https://openalex.org/W2100634462,"Negative carbon isotope anomalies in carbonate rocks bracketing Neoproterozoic glacial deposits in Namibia, combined with estimates of thermal subsidence history, suggest that biological productivity in the surface ocean collapsed for millions of years. This collapse can be explained by a global glaciation (that is, a snowball Earth), which ended abruptly when subaerial volcanic outgassing raised atmospheric carbon dioxide to about 350 times the modern level. The rapid termination would have resulted in a warming of the snowball Earth to extreme greenhouse conditions. The transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean would result in the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate in warm surface waters, producing the cap carbonate rocks observed globally."
https://openalex.org/W2061506085,"Glutamatergic abnormalities have been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and addiction. Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors were targeted to normalize glutamatergic disruptions associated with an animal model of schizophrenia, the phencyclidine model. An agonist of this group of receptors, at a dose that was without effects on spontaneous activity and corticolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, attenuated the disruptive effects of phencyclidine on working memory, stereotypy, locomotion, and cortical glutamate efflux. This behavioral reversal occurred in spite of sustained dopamine hyperactivity. Thus, targeting this group of receptors may present a nondopaminergic therapeutic strategy for treatment of psychiatric disorders."

The signaling pathways that mediate the effects of SDF-1α are not well characterized. We studied events following SDF-1α binding to CXCR-4 in a model murine pre-B cell line transfected with human CXCR-4. There was enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and association of components of focal adhesion complexes such as the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, paxillin, and Crk. We also observed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, partially inhibited the SDF-1α-induced migration and tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. SDF-1α treatment selectively activated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk 1 and Erk 2) and its upstream kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase or mitogen activated protein kinase kinase. We also observed that SDF-1α treatment increased NF-κB activity in nuclear extracts from the CXCR-4 transfectants. Taken together, these studies revealed that SDF-1α activates distinct signaling pathways that may mediate cell growth, migration, and transcriptional activation.

Four classes of chemokines have been defined based on the arrangement of the conserved cysteine (C) residues of the mature proteins; the CXC or α-chemokines; CC or β-chemokines; C or γ-chemokines; and CXXXC or δ-chemokines (1Rollins B.J.

Knock-out mice lacking SDF-1α protein show abnormalities in B cell lymphopoiesis, bone marrow myelopoiesis, and also have nonfatal ventricular septal defects (11Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K.

Despite the increasingly prominent role of SDF-1α and its receptor CXCR-4 in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and HIV infection, relatively little is known about the signaling pathways that may mediate these effects (19Haribabu B.

In this study, we show that SDF-1α stimulation in CXCR-4 transfectants results in the increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion components, including the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK/Pyk2), Crk, and paxillin. SDF-1α treatment activated the p44/42 MAP kinases (Erk 1 and 2), PI-3 kinase, and NF-κB. These studies indicate that activation of CXCR-4 results in modulation of signaling molecules and transcription factors that mediate changes in the cytoskeletal apparatus and also regulate cell growth. RAFTK antibodies were generated using C domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as described previously (29Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serum R-4250 was chosen for further studies based on its titer in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This antiserum does not cross-react with FAK and recognizes both human and murine forms of RAFTK. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was a generous gift from Dr. Brian Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Purified antibodies to JNK, p38 MAP kinase, p44/42 MAPK, and recombinant GST-c-Jun amino-terminal proteins (1–79 amino acids) were obtained from Santa Cruz Laboratories (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to paxillin and Crk were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies to CXCR-4 and the isotype control were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. The protease inhibitors leupeptin and α1-antitrypsin as well as all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin was obtained from Calbiochem, and the nitrocellulose membrane was from Bio-Rad. Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Indo-1 AM) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). We used a murine pre-B lymphoma cell line, L1.2, for the transfection studies. CXCR-4 cDNA, tagged at the amino terminus with a Flag epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys), was subcloned into the pcDNAIII expression vector. The DNA was stably transfected into the L1.2 cells as described (30Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

Newman W. Gerard C. Sodorski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), and G418-selective medium was used to select for transfectants. Cell-surface expression of CXCR-4 on the transfectants was confirmed by FACS analysis. The L1.2 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. The CXCR-4 transfectants were grown in this RPMI 1640 media containing 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The CXCR-4 L1.2 transfectants (1 × 106) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 5% FCS and 5 μg/ml PE-labeled CXCR-4 antibody or isotype control (PharMingen), and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 5% FCS, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, 5% FCS buffer, and then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the levels of surface expression of these receptors. The CXCR-4 transfectants were washed with RPMI 1640 and resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in the RPMI medium. The cells were loaded with Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes) by adding 5 μl of working Indo-1 solution to the 10 × 106 cells that were suspended in 1 ml of RPMI solution and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were diluted to 1 × 106/ml, treated with SDF-1α, and analyzed for calcium mobilization by flow cytometry (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) as described (33Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium flux assays and all other subsequent signaling assays were repeated at least three times. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended at 10 × 106cells/ml in the same medium. Cells were starved for 4 h at 37 °C and then stimulated with different concentrations of SDF-1α at 37 °C for various periods. After stimulation, cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Total cell lysates (TCL) were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, kinase assays, and autophosphorylation assays were carried out as described below. For the immunoprecipitation studies, identical amounts of protein from each sample were clarified by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or Gammabind plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were removed by brief centrifugation, and the solution was incubated with different primary antibodies for each experiment for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-antigen complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose or Gammabind Sepharose (10% suspension) for 4 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with modified RIPA buffer and one time with PBS to remove the nonspecifically bound proteins. Bound proteins were solubilized in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and further analyzed by immunoblotting. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked and probed with primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature (RT) or 4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monoclonal antibody (4G10, IgG2a) was used for Western blot analysis of the phosphotyrosine protein. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described earlier (34Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cell lysates immunoprecipitated with RAFTK antiserum were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 mmNa3VO4). For the in vitro kinase assays, the immune complex was incubated in kinase buffer containing 25 μg of poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1), 20–50 kDa (Sigma), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at RT for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control. The autophosphorylation assay was carried out by incubating the immune complex in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at RT for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and by boiling the sample for 5 min. Proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The JNK assay was performed as described earlier (35Liu Z.Y. Ganju R.K. Wang J.F. Schweitzer K. Weksler B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ATP). The complex was then incubated in kinase buffer containing recombinant GST-c-Jun 0.2 μg/μl (1–79 amino acids) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at RT. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. For the p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase assays, cell lysates from unstimulated or stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with Erk 1 and Erk 2 (p44/42) or p38 MAP kinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2and 20 μm ATP). The complex was then incubated in kinase buffer containing 7 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. For MKK-1 or MKK-4 kinase assays, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with MKK-1 or MKK-4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were washed with RIPA buffer and kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP). The immune complexes were incubated in kinase buffer containing 1.0 μg of recombinant p42 MAP kinase fusion protein (Santa Cruz) for the MKK-1 assay or 1.0 μg of JNK fusion protein-(1–384) (Santa Cruz) for the MKK-4 assay, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. PI-3 kinase assays were performed as described (36Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein from each sample were immunoprecipitated with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) or class-matched mouse IgG. Nonspecific binding was removed by washing the samples three times each with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, followed by 0.5 mm Tris containing 0.5 mm lithium chloride and then by TE buffer. Samples were resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer, 20 μl of phosphoinositol (10 μg, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and 10 μl of ATP mix (1 mm HEPES, 10 μm ATP, 1 μmMgCl2, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at RT for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 60 μl of 2 mm HCl and 160 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1 v/v). Lipids were separated on oxalate-impregnated silica TLC plates using a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (20%) (35:35:3.5:7), followed by autoradiography at −80 °C. The chemotaxis assay was performed in 24-well plates containing 5-μm porosity inserts (Costar Corp., Kennebunk, ME). Cells grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS were washed twice and suspended as 10 × 106 cells per ml in RPMI 1640 and H199 medium (1:1) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Chemokines were then added to the bottom wells, and 100 μl (1 × 106) of cells were loaded onto the inserts. Cells migrating to the bottom well were collected after 2–4 h and counted on a flow cytometer. To assess the effect of wortmannin on migration, the cells were resuspended in medium containing different concentrations of wortmannin, and the chemotaxis assays were done as described above. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding site for NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) using polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to established procedures. 10 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with labeled DNA (0.4 ng, 4,400 cpm) for 10 min at RT in the presence of DNA-binding buffer and 250 ng of poly(dI-dC) oligomer (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (37Yang Y.M. Rutberg S.E. Luo F.C. Spratt T.E. Halaban R. Ferrone S. Ronai Z. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 595-602PubMed Google Scholar). The complexes were then separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. The results shown are representative of findings from three independent experiments. Human CXCR-4 cDNA was stably transfected into the murine pre-B lymphoma cell line, L1.2. Untransfected and transfected cell lines were analyzed for CXCR-4 expression. As shown in Fig. 1, CXCR-4 transfectants expressed high levels of the receptor in these transfected cells. Signal transduction by the binding of ligands to their cognate chemokine receptors involves characteristic calcium fluxes. To confirm that the CXCR-4 L1.2 cells expressing functional human CXCR-4 receptors retained this fundamental signaling property, the cells were treated with SDF-1α, and calcium fluxes were monitored by FACS analysis. SDF-1α treatment induced characteristic calcium fluxes in the CXCR-4 L1.2 cells (data not shown). RAFTK, a recently identified member of the focal adhesion kinase family, has been shown to be activated by various growth factors and chemokines (34Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B.

We observed rapid phosphorylation of endogenous murine RAFTK in the transfected L1.2 cells upon SDF-1α stimulation (Fig. 2 A). We also observed an increase in the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RAFTK following SDF-1α treatment, as determined by an autophosphorylation assay and in vitro kinase assay in which poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) was used as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 2, B and C). Paxillin and Crk, which are components of focal adhesions, have been shown to play an important role in cell migration and adhesion (41Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 42Salgia R. Uemura N. Okuda K. Li J.L. Pisick E. Sattler M. de Jong R. Druker B. Heisterkamp N. Chen L.B. Groffen J. Griffin D.

Thus, we sought to investigate whether SDF-1α treatment of CXCR-4 L1.2 cells would result in changes in the phosphorylation state of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, SDF-1α stimulation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and Crk. Equivalent amounts of these proteins were present in each lane (bottom panels). It has been shown that upon activation by cytokines the adaptor molecule Crk associates with other components of focal adhesions to enhance signaling (41Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin.

As shown in Fig. 4,A and B, Crk associates with paxillin and RAFTK, and this association was enhanced upon SDF-1α treatment. We investigated the effect of SDF-1α on PI-3 kinase activity. PI-3 kinase is an important mediator of chemotaxis in certain cell types (36Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5 A, SDF-1α treatment increased the PI-3 kinase activity of CXCR-4 L1.2 transfectants. The role of PI-3 kinase in mediating SDF-1α-induced migration was further examined using the selective PI-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. As shown in Fig. 5 B, SDF-1α induced the migration of CXCR-4 L1.2 transfectants, and pretreatment with wortmannin inhibited the SDF-1α-induced migration of cells (Fig. 5 C). Further examination revealed that wortmannin treatment also partially inhibited the SDF-1α-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (Fig. 5 D). Equal amounts of paxillin were present in each lane (Fig. 5 D, bottom panel). It has previously been shown that RAFTK acts upstream of MAP kinase and the JNK pathway (39Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R.

Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further showed that RAFTK mediates activation of JNK in these cells. Fig. 6 Ashows that SDF-1α treatment of CXCR-4 L1.2 cells resulted in the rapid activation of p44/42 MAP kinase. However, no significant effect on JNK or p38 MAP kinase was observed (Fig. 6, B and C).

Two subunits of this complex, IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IκB kinase β (IKKβ), are required for NF-κB activation. Purified recombinant IKKα and IKKβ expressed in insect cells were used to demonstrate that each protein can directly phosphorylate IκB proteins. IKKα and IKKβ were found to form both homodimers and heterodimers. Both IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylated IκB bound to NF-κB more efficiently than they phosphorylated free IκB. This result explains how free IκB can accumulate in cells in which IKK is still active and thus can contribute to the termination of NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2046879677,"Individual polymers at thermal equilibrium were exposed to an elongational flow producing a high strain rate, and their dynamics were recorded with video fluorescence microscopy. The flow was turned on suddenly so that the entire evolution of molecular conformation could be observed without initial perturbations. The rate of stretching of individual molecules is highly variable and depends on the molecular conformation that develops during stretching. This variability is due to a dependence of the dynamics on the initial, random equilibrium conformation of the polymer coil. The increasing appearance at high strain rates of slowly unraveling hairpin folds is an example of nonergodic dynamics, which can occur when a statistical mechanical system is subjected to nonadiabatic, or ""sudden,"" external forces."

Many biological processes are controlled at the level transcriptional regulation. Minimally, two functions are required for transcriptional control: the ability to bind a specific DNA sequence and the ability to transactivate by recruiting and modulating the basal transcriptional machinery. SMAD proteins have been identified as the components mediating both these functions in transcriptional regulation by the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 family of cytokines (1Heldin C.-H.

SMADs located in the cytoplasm are directly phosphorylated by membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors that bind TGF-β or the related factors activin and BMPs. The phosphorylated SMADs then move into the nucleus as complexes that bind specific DNA sequences in target promoters, activating transcription.

Harland R. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition, the MH2 domain is involved in homotrimeric interactions that are disrupted by inactivating mutations in tumor-derived forms of Smad2 and Smad4 (30Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain also mediates specific interactions with activated TGF-β receptors (31Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G.

Discreet structural elements in the MH2 domain specify each one of these interactions (31Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although the MH1 domains of SMADs have DNA binding ability, studies on the SMAD regulated gene Mix.2 indicate that the SMAD complex requires FAST1 as a partner for efficient binding to a specific promoter sequence known as the “activin response element” (ARE) (3Chen X.

FAST1, a member of the “winged helix” family of DNA-binding proteins (also known as the forkhead or HNF-3 family), associates with incoming Smad2-Smad4 or Smad3-Smad4 complexes in the nucleus (4Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). FAST1 may provide specific binding interactions, whereas the SMADs provide additional DNA contacts and the transactivating function (6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Coactivators are a class of proteins essential for the transactivating function of a variety of transcription factors. Some of the best characterized coactivators are p300 and the CBP (33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar, 34Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr.

They have been shown to enhance transcriptional activation by a variety of transcription factors such as p53, CREB, AP-1, STATs, MyoD, NF-κB, and steroid/nuclear receptors (33Eckner R. Biol.

To investigate how SMADs activate transcription, we decided to test whether SMADs interact with p300/CBP and require these proteins for transcriptional activation. Linker plus MH2 domains of Smad1 (residues 146–465), Smad2 (residues 187–467), and Smad4 (residues 144–552) were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins and affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amount of protein immobilized on beads was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by comparison against a titration of bovine albumin (Sigma) after Coomassie Blue staining. HaCaT cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% of Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% of glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell extracts were incubated at 4 °C overnight with each of the GST fusion proteins (25 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unbound fractions were recovered. Beads were washed six times in the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins eluted in lysis buffer complemented with 1% of Triton and 1% of N-lauroyl sarkosine. Unbound and eluted (bound) fractions were analyzed by Western blot using 2 μg/ml anti-human p300 antibodies (CT Power Clonal, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or 1 μg/ml the purified A-22 anti-CBP polyclonal serum (Santa Cruz) and detected using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293T or HaCaT cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with the p300-HA expression vector (5 μg) either alone or in combination with Flag-Smad plasmids (5 μg) as indicated using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 40-h post-transfection cells were treated with 1 nm BMP or 200 pm TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) for 2 h. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 25 mmNaCl, 5% of glycerol, 0.5% of Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell extracts were incubated with anti-Flag antibodies and an equal mix of protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose for 5 h at 4 °C and the immunoprecipitates washed four times in the same buffer. The presence of p300 protein in the immune complex was assessed by immunoblot using 2 μg/ml anti-human p300 antibodies (CT Power Clonal, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and detected using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HaCaT and Mv1Lu cells were transfected by DEAE-dextran and SW480.7 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100-mm dishes. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) 24 h post-transfection, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed 20 h later. Luciferase reporter assays were done by transfecting six-well dishes of R1B/L17 cells, a derivative of the Mv1Lu cells, by DEAE-dextran. Two different E1A mutants were used, one containing a deletion of residues 2–29 (NTdl646) (38Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and the other of residues 64–68 (39Wong H.K. Ziff E.B. J.

The A3Lux construct was obtained by subcloning a fragment containing the three copies of the ARE and the basal promoter region of the A3CAT reporter construct (41Huang H.-C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D.

To investigate the role of p300 and CBP in SMAD-mediated transactivation, we first tested whether these proteins directly interact in vitro using GST fusion proteins. Because the transcriptional activity of SMADs resides in the MH2 domain (6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we generated GST fusions with the linker region (for added stability; Ref. 29Hata A. Lo R. Wotton D. Lagna M. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and MH2 domain of Smad1, Smad2, or Smad4 and bound these proteins to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Whole cell extracts prepared from HaCaT human keratinocytes were incubated with the immobilized GST fusion proteins, and the unbound and bound fractions were recovered and analyzed by Western immunoblotting using either anti-p300 or anti-CBP antibody. We were able to detect an interaction between both the Smad1 and Smad2 fusions and endogenous p300 (Fig. 1 A) and similarly with CBP (Fig. 1 B). Little or no interaction with p300 or CBP could be seen with the GST-Smad4 fusion. To test whether complexes containing these two classes of proteins could be obtained from cells, we transfected 293T or HaCaT cells with constructs expressing p300, either alone or along with Flag-tagged SMADs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the Flag antibody were performed followed by Western immunoblotting with anti-p300 antibody. In these experiments, interactions were observed between p300 and SMADs 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1 C). p300 was detectable in the Flag immunoprecipitates when cells were cotransfected with the SMADs but not in control cells transfected with p300 alone (Fig. 1 C). We also saw an interaction of p300 with Smad4, albeit to a lesser extent than with Smad3 (Fig. 1 D). The Smad3-p300 interaction was enhanced by TGF-β (data not shown). This is in contrast to the lack of interaction between p300 and the GST-Smad4 fusion protein. The adenoviral 12 S oncoprotein E1A enhances progression through the cell cycle by binding the protein products of at least two different gene families: retinoblastoma (pRb) and p300/CBP (43Eckner R.

Interestingly, E1A has also been shown to abrogate many TGF-β-mediated gene responses and TGF-β-induced growth inhibition (46Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yacuik P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M.

A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas the ability of E1A to counteract growth inhibitory functions of TGF-β in certain cell lines is due in part to its ability to bind pRb (46Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yacuik P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), its inhibitory effect on other TGF-β responses requires regions of the E1A protein that bind p300 (48Abraham S.E. Carter M.C. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 655-665Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49Datto M.B. Hu P.P. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

We therefore investigated the effect of E1A on transcriptional responses to TGF-β that are known to be mediated by the SMADs. For this we used the A3CAT construct which contains SMAD-responsive ARE sites from Xenopus Mix.2 driving expression of aCAT reporter (41Huang H.-C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both in Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (Fig. 2 A) and in HaCaT human keratinocytes (Fig. 2 B), transfection of increasing amounts of wild-type E1A markedly inhibited transcriptional activation of the ARE. However, similar levels of two different deletion mutants of E1A lacking either residues 64–68 (Fig. 2 A) or residues 2–29 (Fig. 2 B) had little or no effect on activation by TGF-β. These two deletions selectively eliminate the two p300-interacting regions of E1A without preventing interactions with Rb and related proteins (38Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 39Wong H.K. Ziff E.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4910-4920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Egan C. Jelsma T.N. Howe J.A. Bayley S.T. Fergusson B. Branton P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3955-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These results suggest a requirement of p300 function for transactivation by a SMAD-containing complex. To confirm a requirement for p300 in SMAD-directed transactivation more directly, we tested the effect of wild-type and mutant E1A proteins on activation of a GAL4 reporter by a Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein. Gal4-Smad2 activates this reporter when cells are incubated with TGF-β (6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of wild-type E1A, but not an E1A mutant defective in p300 binding, inhibited transactivation by Gal4-Smad2 in HaCaT cells (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained in SW480.7 colon carcinoma cells that are defective in Smad4 and thus depend on exogenous Smad4 for Gal4-Smad2 activity (6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). We also tested the effect of E1A on transactivation by Gal4-Smad4(MH2). This fusion contains the MH2 domain and part of the linker region of Smad4 and is transcriptionally active independent of TGF-β stimulation (6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Wild-type E1A inhibited transactivation by Gal4-Smad4(MH2), whereas the mutant E1A did not (Fig. 3 A). Thus, under various well characterized conditions, the transactivating function of SMADs was inhibited by wild-type E1A, and this inhibition specifically required the p300 binding function of E1A. Finally, using transient transfection assays, we directly evaluated the effect of p300 on the transcriptionally competent complex formed in response to TGF-β/activin. Mink lung epithelial cells were transfected with FAST1, the ARE reporter construct A3Lux, and p300 vectors. p300 overexpression further increased TGF-β-dependent transactivation of this reporter (Fig. 4). The stimulatory effect of p300 was observed only when FAST1 was present, suggesting that an excess of p300 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the ARF complex. However, the effect of p300 was small under all conditions tested, suggesting that the endogenous levels of p300 and functionally related proteins are not rate-limiting for TGF-β-induced transactivation. SMADs are central components of transcriptional complexes that bind to specific sites in TGF-β target promoters and activate transcription. Whereas the DNA binding ability of SMAD complexes has begun to become clear (3Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 4Chen X.

Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), the mechanisms that control transactivation by this complex have remained unknown. Here we provide evidence that SMADs can interact with p300 and CBP, and these interactions are functionally important in transactivation. Using GST-Smad fusion proteins, we show that both the BMP mediator, Smad1, and the TGF-β/activin mediator, Smad2, can interact with p300 and CBP from cell extracts. The SMAD MH2 domain and linker regions are sufficient for this interaction. Focusing on p300, we provide further evidence for an interaction between this protein and Smads 1, 2, and 3 by coprecipitation from cell extracts. In these coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we also observed an interaction between p300 and Smad4. However, a GST-Smad4 fusion product does not bind p300 or CBP from cell extracts under our assay conditions. Smad4 may have a weaker affinity for p300 than Smad1 or Smad2. Alternatively, the interaction between Smad4 and p300 may be mediated by association with endogenous Smads 1 or 2. Evidence for a requirement of p300 in TGF-β transcriptional responses and SMAD-dependent transactivation is provided by results using adenovirus E1A protein that binds and inactivates p300/CBP. As a model system to investigate SMAD-mediated transcriptional responses, we used an ARE-dependent reporter gene. The ARE is a physiological response element, and its activation by a SMAD complex in response to TGF-β signaling is the best characterized to date (3Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 4Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar,6Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Using this reporter construct, we show that wild-type E1A inhibits TGF-β-induced transactivation from the ARE in different cell lines. Most importantly, this effect appears to be dependent on the ability of E1A to bind p300, because two different E1A mutants containing small deletions that selectively eliminate p300 binding do not inhibit ARE transactivation. Furthermore, overexpression of p300 enhanced significantly the ability of TGF-β to activate a transcriptional response. The limited extent of this enhancement by p300 suggests that the endogenous levels of p300 or functionally related proteins are not limiting for these responses. The present results provide a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed ability of E1A to inhibit TGF-β responses. E1A has been reported to inhibit both proliferative responses to TGF-β in fibroblasts (50de Groot R.P. Kranenburg O. de Wit L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij J. Mummery C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar) and antiproliferative responses to TGF-β in keratinocytes (46Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yacuik P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M.

Yokoyama K. Chiu R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 444-534Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50de Groot R.P. Kranenburg O. de Wit L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij J. Mummery C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A.

The ability of E1A to inhibit TGF-β growth inhibitory responses is attributable in part to its ability to bind hypophosphorylated pRb (46Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yacuik P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow R.M. Münger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 52Missero C. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, studies using mutant E1A constructs have shown that E1A can inhibit TGF-β responses independent of its pRb binding function (48Abraham S.E. Carter M.C. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 655-665Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 52Missero C. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of E1A to inhibit both TGF-β-induced expression of p15 Ink4b and p21 Cip1 and TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition have been mapped to the region of E1A that binds p300 (48Abraham S.E. Carter M.C. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 655-665Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49Datto M.B. Hu P.P. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

These observations raised the possibility that p300 might be involved in TGF-β transcriptional responses. Our present results with the ARE reporter show that the p300 sequestering ability of E1A inhibits transcriptional responses that are directly mediated by SMADs. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that E1A inhibits transactivation of a Gal4 reporter by a Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein. Furthermore, the ability of E1A to specifically inhibit transactivation by Gal4-Smad4(MH2) suggests that p300 is required for the intrinsic transcriptional activity of a SMAD MH2 domain. In sum, our results suggest a role for p300/CBP in SMAD-mediated transcriptional activation and provide an explanation for the observed ability of E1A to interfere with TGF-β action. We thank D. M.

In this study, we have investigated further the structural properties of HS required to mediate the activity of bFGF in a mitogenic assay. We have prepared a library of heparinase III-generated HS oligosaccharides fractionated by both their size (dp6-dp12) and sulfate content. The ability of these oligosaccharides to activate bFGF in a mitogenic assay was then correlated with their length and disaccharide composition. All octa- and hexasaccharide fractions tested were unable to activate bFGF. Dodeca- and decasaccharide fractions were found to contain both activating and non-activating oligosaccharides, and showed a clear correlation between total sulfate content and the level of activatory activity. Disaccharide analysis of a range of dodeca- and decasaccharide fractions showed that both activating and non-activating oligosaccharides were composed mainly of N-sulfated and IdoA(2S)-containing disaccharides. The only significant difference between activating and non-activating oligosaccharides was the content of 6-O-sulfated disaccharides, in particular the disaccharide IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(6S). These results show that there is a requirement for 6-O-sulfation of N-sulfated glucosamine residues, in addition to the 2-O-sulfation of IdoA, for the promotion of bFGF mitogenic activity by naturally occurring HS oligosaccharides.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)1 is a member of a large family of polypeptides. It is found in a wide variety of mammalian tissues, and has been shown to influence a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T.

These oligosaccharides were found to be rich in IdoA(2S)-containing disaccharides, with the affinity for bFGF increasing with oligosaccharide length and IdoA(2S) content. The main disaccharide repeat units of these oligosaccharides are IdoA(2S) α1,4GlcNSO3 and IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(6S) in HS and heparin, respectively. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of bFGF complexed with heparin saccharides have shown the fundamental role played by IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(±6S) repeat sequences in the interaction with bFGF (24Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). In particular, the ion pair interactions of the amino acid side chains of bFGF and the sulfate groups of IdoA(2S) and GlcNSO3 were shown to be particularly important. Interestingly, no role was seen for the 6-O- sulfate groups of GlcNSO3 in the interaction with bFGF.Studies relating to the ability of heparin/HS oligosaccharides to activate bFGF in biological assays have been contradictory, both in terms of the minimum oligosaccharide length required for activation, and the role that specific sulfate groups play in mediating the response. The minimum length of the biologically active oligosaccharides have been variously reported as di- and trisaccharides (25Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C-M. Waksman G.

The presence of 2-O-sulfated IdoA has been shown to be an absolute requirement for the ability of HS oligosaccharides to bind bFGF, as well as for the promotion of the growth factor's mitogenic activity. The role of 6-O-sulfate groups, however, remains unclear. Chemically produced, selectively 6-O-desulfated heparins which still bound bFGF strongly were unable to activate bFGF in biological assays (8Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which suggests a role for 6-O-sulfation in mediating biological activity. Others studies, however, have suggested that 6-O-sulfation has no direct role, with the main contributors to biological activity being 2-O-/N-sulfates and the carboxyl group of IdoA (23Walker A. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 931-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ishihara M. Shaklee P.N. Yang Z. Liang W. Wei Z. Stack R.J. Holme K. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).To date, bFGF activation studies using heparin/HS-derived oligosaccharides have relied on size separation and affinity chromatography to generate material for assessment of biological activity. In this study, we have generated a library of HS oligosaccharides separated on the basis of molecular size and content/pattern of sulfation but not bFGF affinity. We have then correlated their ability to activate bFGF in a biological assay with their disaccharide composition.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have produced a library of heparinase III-generated HS oligosaccharides differing in their length and sulfate content. When co-introduced with bFGF into a heparin/HS-dependent mitogenic assay, these oligosaccharides showed an activity cut-off below a certain length, this being below decasaccharides. Interestingly, a number of deca- and dodecasaccharide fractions (dp10A, dp12A, B, C, and D) were found to be unable to stimulate bFGF activity and indeed suppressed the basal activity of bFGF on the BAF-32 cells (Fig. 4). Preliminary studies also indicate that these oligosaccharides (dp10A, dp12A, B, C, and D) have inhibitory activity against heparin-mediated activation of bFGF (results not shown). A clear correlation was also observed between total sulfate content and bFGF stimulatory activity, in particular with decasaccharides (Figs. 3 and 4), with levels of activity for some of the oligosaccharide fractions approaching that achieved by the intact parent HS chains (dp10D, dp12F, and dp12G).Heparinase III is generally believed to cleave linkages of the type GlcNR(±6S)α1,4GlcA, with resistant oligosaccharides having the general formula ΔHexAα/β1,4[GlcNSO3(±6S)α1,4IdoA(±2S)]Nα1,4GlcNR, with R being Ac or SO3 (31Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, some reports have recently suggested that the enzyme acts more widely on the linkage GlcNR(±6S)α1,4GlcA/IdoA (32Desai U.R. Wang H-M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thereby producing fragments enriched in contiguous sequences of IdoA(2S)-containing disaccharides. Indeed the presence of heparinase III-resistant oligosaccharides of the type ΔHexAα1,4GlcNSO3α1,4[IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3]Nα1,4Ido Aα1,4GlcNAc has been confirmed by heparinase I and nitrous acid degradation of heparinase III-resistant domains (19Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disaccharide analyses of our oligosaccharide fractions (Tables I and II) suggests therefore, that they contain an internal repeat of IdoA(2S)-containing disaccharides (IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3 and/or IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(6S)). A positive correlation between bFGF stimulatory activity and sulfate content was indicated previously from the SAX elution profile. However, the disaccharide analyses of the decasaccharides clearly show that biological activity increases with 6-O-sulfate content (Fig. 6 A), in particular an increase in the specific disaccharide IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(6S) (Table I), with no appreciable changes in either 2-O- or N-sulfate content. Dodecasaccharide fractions (dp12) also showed a similar positive correlation between activity and increased 6-O-sulfate content (Fig. 6 B), again the major consistent contributor to this was the trisulfated disaccharide (Table II).Our results suggest that the previously identified, high affinity bFGF-binding tetradecasaccharide sequence (oligo-H) from fibroblast HS, devoid of 6-O-sulfates and comprising of an internal repeat of five IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3 disaccharides (19Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), will be unable to promote bFGF activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor. These results are supported by others who have shown that intact de-6-O-sulfated heparins were unable to restore bFGF-induced mitogenesis of chlorate-treated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (8Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and were ineffective in promoting binding of bFGF to a soluble form of FGFR-1 (10Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Caccia P. Dell'Era P. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Valsaina B. Presta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These conclusions have, however, been contested, since partial loss of 2-O-sulfate groups of IdoA residues occurs along with extensive de-6-O-sulfation. This concern was in part supported by Ishihara and co-workers (27Ishihara M. Shaklee P.N. Yang Z. Liang W. Wei Z. Stack R.J. Holme K. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), who showed that oligosaccharides rich in IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3disaccharides, derived from de-6-O-sulfated heparin, were biologically active. However, it should be noted that these deca- and dodecasaccharides still contained the trisulfated disaccharide IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(6S) at average levels of 12 and 14%, respectively (27Ishihara M. Shaklee P.N. Yang Z. Liang W. Wei Z. Stack R.J. Holme K. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Yet, in a more recent study utilizing partially desulfated intact heparins, this group went on to demonstrate that 6-O-sulfation is necessary for heparin to promote bFGF-induced cell growth, and that about 60% of the 6-O-sulfate groups could be removed without appreciable loss of activity (34Ishihara M. Takano R. Kanda T. Hayashi K. Hara S. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Likewise, chemically N-sulfated acharan sulfate, composed of IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3 repeat units, failed to activate bFGF (35Wang H. Toida T. Kim Y.S. Capila I. Hileman R.E. Bernfield M. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Walker and co-workers (23Walker A. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 931-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that biological activity was correlated most closely to an oligosaccharide's content of N- and 2-O-sulfate groups, with no role being clearly established for 6-O-sulfate groups. However, their most active dp16 oligosaccharide preparation did contain noticeable amounts of IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3(6S) (approximately 7% of disaccharides).We believe that our present results show a clear requirement for 6-O-sulfation in the promotion of bFGF mitogenic activity by IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3 containing HS oligosaccharides. The role that 6-O-sulfation may play in the assembly of the ternary complex of bFGF/HS/FGFR is unclear. It has been suggested that HS acts as a bridge linking bFGF to its high affinity FGFR (8Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Caccia P. Dell'Era P. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Valsaina B. Presta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with 6-O-sulfate groups possibly interacting with a HS-binding site on the FGFR (9Kan M.K. Wang F. Xu J.M. Crabb J.W. Hou J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24941-24948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, a role for 6-O-sulfate groups in the oligomerization and presentation of bFGF to its tyrosine kinase receptors has also been recently suggested (14Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Böhlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous studies which have indicated an absolute need for 6-O-sulfation in promoting bFGF activity have to date failed to show the existence of specificity, both in terms of number and position of 6-O-sulfate groups within HS oligosaccharides. The results of this study show that in the deca- and dodecasaccharides fractions tested, the bFGF promoting activity increases with the number of 6-O-sulfate groups present. Indeed the results with the decasaccharides suggest that an average of two of the three IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3 disaccharides present should be 6-O-sulfated in order to stimulate bFGF activation to the level obtained with intact HS. Also it should be noted that intermediate plateau levels of activity are seen in the decasaccharide fractions dp10B and dp10C (Fig. 4 A). Since each oligosaccharide fraction is still a mixture of several species, it is likely that the differing overall levels of activity are attributable to the relative amounts of activating and inhibitory oligosaccharides present. If therefore the inhibitory action of an oligosaccharide is due to a lack of 6-O-sulfation in specific position(s), then the increased activity of the more 6-O-sulfated oligosaccharide fractions could be a reflection of the increasing occurrence of 6-O-sulfate groups in specifically required positions. This view is strengthened by data obtained from the dodecasaccharide fractions, in which once again a trend between content of IdoA(2S) α1,4GlcNSO3(6S) and bFGF promoting activity was seen. However, inspection of their compositions shows that in the activating fractions an average of 1.11 of the probable four IdoA(2S)α1,4GlcNSO3 disaccharides present are 6-O-sulfated. In the non-activating dodecasaccharides this figure is reduced to an average of 0.45; the difference between the activating dp12E fraction and non-activating dp12D is even smaller at 0.79 and 0.51 trisulfated disaccharides per fraction, respectively. These relatively small changes in 6-O-sulfate content thus result in a dramatic switch between non-activating and activating behavior (Fig. 4 B, Table II). We believe that the most likely explanation for this is an exact requirement for the positioning of one or more 6-O-sulfate groups within the dodecasaccharides.In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first study that has shown a direct correlation between the 6-O-sulfate content of naturally occurring HS oligosaccharides and their ability to promote bFGF activity. Both activating and non-activating oligosaccharides were shown to be comprised of a similar 2-O- and N-sulfated disaccharide backbone with only activating oligosaccharides containing significant quantities of 6-O-sulfate. Furthermore, evidence is presented to suggest that in the activating oligosaccharides the positioning of 6-O-sulfate groups is critical, with perhaps just one specifically positioned 6-O-sulfate being required for promoting bFGF-induced mitogenic activity. These oligosaccharide domains enriched in IdoA(2S)-containing disaccharides have been shown to be a common structural element in HS, and are thought to be the result of a carefully regulated mechanism of HS biosynthesis. The enzymes which control the addition of 6-O-sulfate groups within these domains could be an important control point, which would allow cells to modify their response to bFGF by a controlled variation in the 6-O-sulfation pattern of cell surface HS. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)1 is a member of a large family of polypeptides. It is found in a wide variety of mammalian tissues, and has been shown to influence a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T.

Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The FGFs act primarily through high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (4Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although, in addition, their activity is modulated by and largely dependent on lower affinity HS proteoglycan receptors (5Yayon A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HS promotes bFGF action is not clearly understood, with several hypotheses having been proposed. These include the proposition that HS binding confers a conformational change on bFGF, which in turn promotes binding to its high affinity receptor (5Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). Another model suggests that HS acts as a bridge by simultaneously binding both the growth factor and its tyrosine kinase receptor (8Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2140951631,"Control of the activation of apoptosis is important both in development and in protection against cancer. In the classic genetic model Caenorhabditis elegans, the pro-apoptotic protein CED-4 activates the CED-3 caspase and is inhibited by the Bcl-2-like protein CED-9. Both processes are mediated by protein-protein interaction. Facilitating the proximity of CED-3 zymogen molecules was found to induce caspase activation and cell death. CED-4 protein oligomerized in cells and in vitro. This oligomerization induced CED-3 proximity and competed with CED-4:CED-9 interaction. Mutations that abolished CED-4 oligomerization inactivated its ability to activate CED-3. Thus, the mechanism of control is that CED-3 in CED-3:CED-4 complexes is activated by CED-4 oligomerization, which is inhibited by binding of CED-9 to CED-4."

In this study, selectively logged tropical rainforest in Indonesian Borneo is shown to contain high tree species richness, despite severe structural damage. Plots logged 8 years before sampling contained fewer species of trees greater than 20 centimeters in diameter than did similar-sized unlogged plots. However, in samples of the same numbers of trees (requiring a 50 percent larger area), logged forest contained as many tree species as unlogged forest. These findings warrant reassessment of the conservation potential of large tracts of commercially logged tropical rainforest."
https://openalex.org/W1965490529,"How an individual effector T cell acquires a particular cytokine expression pattern from many possible patterns remains unclear. CD4+ T cells from F1 mice, which allowed assignment of the parental origin of interleukin-4 (IL-4) transcripts, were divided into clones that expressed IL-4 biallelically or monoallelically from either allele. The allelic pattern was transmitted as a stable epigenetic trait. Regulation of cytokine expression by a mechanism that treats each allele independently suggests a probabilistic process by which a diverse repertoire of combinatorially assorted cytokine gene expression patterns could be generated among the clonally related daughters of a single precursor cell."
https://openalex.org/W2013716694,"F1-ATPase assembly has been studied in human ρ° cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Since, in these cells, oxidative phosphorylation cannot provide ATP, their growth relies on glycolysis. Despite the absence of the mtDNA-coded F0 subunits 6 and 8, ρ° cells possessed normal levels of F1-ATPase α and β subunits. This F1-ATPase was functional and azide- or aurovertin-sensitive but oligomycin-insensitive. In addition, aurovertin decreased cell growth in ρ° cells and also reduced their mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured by rhodamine 123 fluorescence. Therefore, a functional F1-ATPase was important to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential and the growth of these ρ° cells. Bongkrekic acid, a specific adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) inhibitor, also reduced ρ° cell growth and mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, ρ° cells need both a functional F1-ATPase and a functional ANT to maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential, which is necessary for their growth. ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by F1 must provide ADP3− at a sufficient rate to maintain a rapid exchange with the glycolytic ATP4− by ANT, this electrogenic exchange inducing a mitochondrial membrane potential efficient enough to sustain cell growth. However, since the effects of bongkrekic acid and of aurovertin were additive, other electrogenic pumps should cooperate with this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2013986083,"Recycling of ascorbic acid from its oxidized forms is required to maintain intracellular stores of the vitamin in most cells. Since the ubiquitous selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase can recycle dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate, we investigated the possibility that the enzyme can also reduce the one-electron-oxidized ascorbyl free radical to ascorbate. Purified rat liver thioredoxin reductase catalyzed the disappearance of NADPH in the presence of low micromolar concentrations of the ascorbyl free radical that were generated from ascorbate by ascorbate oxidase, and this effect was markedly stimulated by selenocystine. Dehydroascorbic acid is generated by dismutation of the ascorbyl free radical, and thioredoxin reductase can reduce dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate. However, control studies showed that the amounts of dehydroascorbic acid generated under the assay conditions used were too low to account for the observed loss of NADPH. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy directly confirmed that the reductase decreased steady-state ascorbyl free radical concentrations, as expected if thioredoxin reductase reduces the ascorbyl free radical. Dialyzed cytosol from rat liver homogenates also catalyzed NADPH-dependent reduction of the ascorbyl free radical. Specificity for thioredoxin reductase was indicated by loss of activity in dialyzed cytosol prepared from livers of selenium-deficient rats, by inhibition with aurothioglucose at concentrations selective for thioredoxin reductase, and by stimulation with selenocystine. Microsomal fractions prepared from rat liver showed substantial NADH-dependent ascorbyl free radical reduction that was not sensitive to selenium depletion. These results suggest that thioredoxin reductase can function as a cytosolic ascorbyl free radical reductase that may complement cellular ascorbate recycling by membrane-bound NADH-dependent reductases.

Most mammalian cells maintain intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, that are much higher than those in the surrounding interstitial space or in plasma. In nucleated cells, this concentration gradient is generated by uptake of ascorbate on a high affinity energy-dependent transporter (1Rose R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 335-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Another mechanism that contributes to this gradient is uptake of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA),1the two-electron oxidized form of ascorbate, by facilitated diffusion on the glucose transporter (2Bianchi J. Rose R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1986; 181: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), followed by reduction of DHA to ascorbate within cells (4Okamura M. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1979; 25: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Wagner E.S. White W. Jennings M. Bennett K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the ascorbate anion is a poor substrate for the glucose transporter (3Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), it leaves the cell only slowly by diffusion (5Wagner E.S. White W. Jennings M. Bennett K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inside the cell, however, ascorbate is subject to oxidation by free radicals generated in mitochondrial metabolism (6Glinn M.A. Lee C.P. Ernster L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or by iron-containing proteins such as hemoglobin (7Van Dyke B.R. Saltman P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These one-electron oxidations initially produce the ascorbyl free radical (AFR) (8Njus D. Kelley P.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and DHA results from dismutation or further oxidation of the AFR. Unless recycled to ascorbate, DHA will be lost from the cell on the glucose transporter or will undergo irreversible degradation to 2,3-diketo-1-gulonic acid. DHA can be reduced to ascorbate directly by GSH (9Winkler B.S. Orselli S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) or by any of several GSH-dependent enzymes (10Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Sun G.P. Wells W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DHA can also be reduced to ascorbate by NADPH-dependent enzymes, including 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (14Del Bello B. Maellaro E. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and thioredoxin reductase (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the affinities of both GSH- and NADPH-dependent enzymes for DHA are such that they would compete poorly with loss of DHA on the glucose transporter, which is abundant in most cells. Thus, recycling of ascorbate from the relatively long lived and the relatively poorly reactive AFR (16Bielski B.H.J. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemistry, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1982: 81-100Google Scholar) may be favored over recycling from DHA, especially since the negative charge of the AFR (8Njus D. Kelley P.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Bielski B.H. Richter H.W. Chan P.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1975; 258: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) will also tend to keep it within the cell. NADH-dependent AFR reductase activities have been demonstrated in mammalian cells. These activities are typically associated with microsomal or mitochondrial fractions, and with cytochrome b 5 reductase activity (18Hara T. Minakami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Ito A. Hayashi S. Yoshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1970; 351: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, sequestration of these enzymes in membrane-enclosed systems may limit their ability to reduce AFR that is generated in cytoplasm. Recycling of the AFR to ascorbate has not been demonstrated for cytosolic GSH- or NADPH-dependent enzymes. Therefore, in this work, we investigated the possibility that thioredoxin reductase mediates the high affinity reduction of AFR to ascorbate and whether this reaction might have physiologic relevance. DHA and tridecylamine were from Aldrich. Ascorbate oxidase, NADPH, and Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx) were purchased from Sigma. Wako Chemicals supplied the 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH). Thioredoxin reductase (TR) was purified from rat liver according to the method of Luthman and Holmgren (23Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and was stored at −80 °C until use. The purity of this preparation has previously been described (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a selenium-deficient Torula yeast diet or this same diet supplemented with 0.25 ppm selenium as Na2SeO4 to provide an adequate amount of dietary selenium (24Burk R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Animals were fed one of the two diets for 14 weeks. At the end of this period, rat weights were similar in each group, as reported previously (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The experiment was terminated after an overnight fast, when rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and exsanguinated by removal of blood from the aorta. Livers were immediately removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until assay. For preparation of dialyzed liver cytosolic fractions, liver was quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. Frozen liver (100 mg) was homogenized in 1.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, that contained 1 mmEDTA. The homogenate was microcentrifuged at 6000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was placed in dialysis tubing (3400 molecular weight cut-off) and dialyzed overnight against three changes of 250 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. As noted in previous studies (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), neither ascorbate nor GSH were detectable by HPLC in dialyzed cytosol. The lower limits for HPLC detection in the incubated cytosol were 0.1 μm for ascorbate and 2 μm for GSH. Microsomal fractions were prepared from frozen livers as described previously (25Burk R.F. Masters B.S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 170: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver from control and selenium-deficient rats (100 mg/3.0 ml of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose) was homogenized with 10 strokes of a hand-held Teflon-glass homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 3700 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,800 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The pellet was suspended in 3 ml of 0.15 mKCl and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet containing microsomal membranes was suspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.26 msucrose for assay of AFR reductase activity. NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity was assayed either as conversion of DHA to ascorbate, with detection of the latter by HPLC, or as NADPH disappearance (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). AFR reductase activity was measured directly by EPR spectroscopy, as described below, or as the rate of TR-dependent NADPH oxidation. In the latter assay, the AFR was generated by incubating 1 mm ascorbate with 0.05–0.4 unit/ml ascorbate oxidase. Incubations also contained 0.2 mm NAD(P)H, 1 mmEDTA, enzyme source (purified rat liver TR, overnight-dialyzed rat liver cytosol, or rat liver microsomes), and other additions as noted in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The disappearance of NAD(P)H was followed at 340 nm in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer at 23 °C. Correction was made in each sample for the very low rate of nucleotide oxidation in the absence of the enzyme source. Rates of NAD(P)H disappearance were linear over the first several minutes of the incubation (results not shown), and these were used to calculate rates of AFR reduction, based on an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm−1·cm−1 for NAD(P)H and the fact that 1 mol of NAD(P)H can reduce 2 mol of the AFR. For purified rat liver TR, results are expressed as the turnover number by dividing the reaction rate by the moles of enzyme present. Results in experiments with liver microsomes or dialyzed cytosol are normalized to protein content. In some experiments, the steady-state concentration of the AFR was determined during the first several minutes of incubation under the conditions used for the AFR reductase assay described above, except for the absence of NADPH. The AFR concentration was calculated from its absorbance at 360 nm, based on an extinction coefficient of 3.3 mm−1·cm−1 (26Schuler R.H. Radiat. Res. 1977; 69: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ascorbate oxidase activity was measured for each series of experiments as a decrease in the ascorbate concentration over time. For experiments in which purified TR was used, ascorbate was measured spectrophotometrically at room temperature as the decrease in absorbance at 265 nm in an incubation that contained the appropriate concentration of ascorbate oxidase and 1 mm ascorbate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. For experiments in which dialyzed cytosol was used, ascorbate oxidase activity was measured as the fall in ascorbate concentration over time in incubations that contained the oxidase, 1 mm ascorbate, the amount of cytosol used in the AFR assay, and 0.2 mm NADPH. In this assay, ascorbate was measured directly by HPLC after dilution of an aliquot of the incubation mixture in methanol. Time-dependent changes in the AFR concentration were measured by EPR and used to assess AFR reductase activity. EPR data were collected on a Bruker EMX 8/27 spectrometer equipped with a BVT300 variable temperature controller. Sample temperature was maintained at 20–23 °C during data acquisition by blowing precooled nitrogen into the cavity through the front optical port. X-band EPR spectra were collected using a ER041XG-DHA microwave bridge and ER4103TM/9614 cavity. EPR data were recorded on samples contained in 50-μl disposable glass capillary pipettes (VWR Scientific). EPR spectra of the AFR were recorded by computerized data collection using the following instrument settings: 100-kHz field modulation, 1.0-G modulation amplitude, 10-milliwatt microwave observer power, and a 5-G sweep width centered between the two resonance lines of the AFR. The sample components described in the legend to Fig. 5 were mixed rapidly (with the ascorbate added last), loaded into the sample capillary, and placed in the pretuned microwave cavity. Approximately 7–8 s elapsed between the ascorbate addition and the start of data collection. The time constant and conversion time of the spectrometer were chosen to result in a magnetic field sweep time of 42 s. A new AFR spectrum was collected every 2 min following mixing, and the peak to peak amplitude of the low field AFR resonance line was measured (WinEPR data analysis software, Bruker Instruments) and plotted in Fig. 5. Assay of reduction of insulin disulfides by TR was determined by the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay described by Holmgren and Björnstedt (27Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (28Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). TR activity in dialyzed liver cytosol was measured as recently described by Hill et al. (28Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Protein was measured using the Bradford reagent (29Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Data are shown as mean ± S.E., except where noted. Curve fitting was carried out for the model noted using the graphics program FigP (Biosoft, Inc., Cambridge, UK). Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance with appropriate post hoc tests using the statistical software package Sigmastat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). To determine whether TR can reduce the AFR to ascorbate, the AFR was generated by one-electron oxidation of ascorbate with ascorbate oxidase, and AFR reduction by TR was followed spectrophotometrically as loss of NADPH. As shown in Fig. 1, TR alone resulted in an increase in NADPH oxidation in this system. Neither TR nor ascorbate oxidase individually increased NADPH oxidation in the presence of ascorbate (results not shown), indicating lack of NADPH oxidase activity. The addition of 5 μm Trx fromE. coli caused a small but consistent increase in the rate of NADPH disappearance. The increase in rate of NADPH loss that was due to TR plus Trx was almost completely prevented by 10 μmaurothioglucose, which is a selective inhibitor of TR at the concentration used (28Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activity of ascorbate oxidase, measured as the decrease in ascorbate at 265 nm in the absence of NADPH, was unaffected by this concentration of aurothioglucose (results not shown). Inhibition of AFR reduction by the gold compound confirms the specificity of the reaction for TR. A 5-fold increase in the ascorbate oxidase concentration also enhanced TR-dependent NADPH oxidation in the presence of Trx. Together, these results are compatible with NADPH-dependent reduction of the AFR by TR. However, dismutation of two molecules of AFR generated in the ascorbate oxidase reaction will produce one molecule each of ascorbate and DHA (30Yamazaki I. Piette L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 50: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and TR can reduce DHA to ascorbate using NADPH as the electron donor (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To assess the extent to which reduction of DHA by TR contributed to the NADPH oxidation observed, an incubation was carried out in each experiment with freshly prepared DHA (1 mm), 5 μm E. coliTrx, and 0.1 μm TR but no ascorbate or ascorbate oxidase. As expected, the loss of NADPH was increased in the presence of DHA, and it is shown for comparative purposes in Fig. 1 as AFR equivalents, rather than as moles of DHA reduced. Incubation of 1 mmascorbate with the same lot of ascorbate oxidase used for the studies shown in Fig. 1, but in the absence of NADPH, resulted in a decrease in the ascorbate concentration, which was measured as a fall in UV absorbance at 265 nm. The amount of ascorbate lost per minute, which corresponds to the maximal amount of DHA that could have been generated, was 49 ± 8 μm (mean ± S.D.,n = 5). Based on the measured rate of ascorbate loss, the average concentration of DHA available to TR would increase by about 25 μm over each minute. Given aK m of 0.8 mm for DHA under these conditions (see Fig. 3, inset), the rate of DHA reduction should still be almost linear up to 1 mm DHA. Therefore, the contribution of DHA reduction to NADPH oxidation by TR plus Trx in the experiments of Fig. 1 would be less than 5% of the initial rate observed at 0.05 unit/ml ascorbate oxidase and less than 8% of that at 0.25 unit/ml ascorbate oxidase. The addition of 40 μm selenocystine instead of Trx, as indicated by the last bar in Fig. 1, increased the rate of NADPH reduction by 8-fold compared with TR plus Trx. In control incubations not shown, selenocystine in the absence of ascorbate had no effect on the rate of NADPH disappearance in the presence of TR and Trx, indicating a lack of significant redox cycling of selenocystine under these conditions. The marked stimulation of TR activity by selenocystine was also observed for TR-dependent reduction of both DHA and of insulin disulfides, as shown in Fig. 2. Incubation of TR with 100 μm DHA and increasing concentrations of selenocystine enhanced the ability of the enzyme to reduce DHA in a saturable manner, with an apparentK m of 3 ± 0.4 μm selenocystine and a maximal rate of reduction or turnover number of 204 min−1. Selenocystine also enhanced the ability of TR to reduce insulin disulfides over a similar range of selenocystine concentrations (Fig. 2). However, the response in this assay was biphasic, with a decrease in the rate of reaction above 50 μm selenocystine. The cause of this decrease is unknown, but additional experiments using higher insulin concentrations showed that it was not due to exhaustion of insulin in the assay (data not shown). Selenocystine-stimulated reduction of both DHA and insulin was completely inhibited by 10 μm aurothioglucose (results not shown). Thus, low concentrations of selenocystine enhanced both the catalytic capacity and the affinity of rat liver TR for DHA into the range observed for insulin disulfides. At a maximal selenocystine concentration of 300 μm, ascorbate generation from increasing concentrations of DHA was saturable, with an apparent K m of 0.3 mmDHA and a turnover number of 735 min −1 (Fig. 3). These parameters differ from published values in both affinity and maximal activity of DHA reduction by TR alone and by TR plus Trx (Fig. 3, inset). Selenocystine enhanced the rate of AFR reduction relative to TR plus Trx to a similar extent as that observed for its stimulation of DHA reduction (compare Fig. 1 with Fig. 3, inset). The rate of NADPH disappearance, measured as described for the studies shown in Fig. 1, was used to evaluate the apparent affinity of TR for the AFR over a range of AFR concentrations. Increasing amounts of AFR were generated from 1 mm ascorbate by increases in the ascorbate oxidase concentration (Fig. 4). The steady-state concentration of the AFR was determined under the same conditions (except for the absence of NADPH) by measuring the UV absorbance of the AFR at 360 nm and is plotted along the xaxis. Reduction of the AFR by TR plus Trx increased in a saturable manner, with an apparent K m of 2.8 μmand a turnover number of 135 min−1. As also shown in Fig. 4, the addition of selenocystine instead of Trx increased the maximal effect to 304 min−1 and resulted in an apparentK m of 0.95 μm. We attribute the lower maximal rate of reduction shown in these studies in comparison with the experiments shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 to the use of an enzyme preparation with lower specific activity. Nonetheless, these results show that TR has a high affinity for the AFR and that selenocystine increases the apparent turnover number of the enzyme for the AFR. To confirm that TR reduces the AFR, EPR spectroscopy was used to follow the AFR concentration during reduction. Because of the sensitivity of this method, it was sufficient to generate the AFR by incubating ascorbate in oxygenated buffer or by stimulation with a low flux of water-soluble free radicals that were derived from decomposition of AAPH at 23 °C. The typical two-line EPR spectrum of ascorbate is shown in the inset to Fig. 5 A. An arrowindicates the low field resonance line whose amplitude was followed with time. Aurothioglucose alone had no effect on the AFR signal generated by 10 mm ascorbate (data not shown), so it was used as a control to establish specific effects of TR and Trx on the AFR signal in all of the EPR data shown. As predicted if the TR system recycles the AFR to ascorbate, a sample containing TR and Trx had a small but consistent decrease in the steady-state AFR signal over the time course studied compared with a sample that also contained 10 μm aurothioglucose (Fig. 5 A). Selenocystine decreased the steady-state AFR signal by almost 40% compared with TR and Trx, and the addition of aurothioglucose substantially reversed this decrease in comparison with the signal observed with TR, Trx, and aurothioglucose. As shown in Fig. 5 B, when the AFR was generated by AAPH, the amplitude of the AFR was almost doubled compared with results observed with oxygenated buffer in Fig. 5 A. The effects of aurothioglucose and selenocystine during AAPH treatment were comparable with those observed with buffer alone in that the steady-state AFR signal was decreased by TR plus Trx compared with a sample containing TR, Trx, and aurothioglucose. Further, selenocystine again decreased, and aurothioglucose completely reversed, the steady-state AFR signal. The relative changes induced by TR plus Trx compared with TR plus selenocystine are similar to those observed in the indirect NADPH assay and are compatible with the notion that the TR system can reduce the AFR. In experiments not shown, TR plus Trx in the absence of ascorbate failed to increase NADPH loss either in buffer alone or in buffer containing 50 mm AAPH. This suggests that the TR system did not consume the initiating oxidants in these EPR studies (i.e. molecular oxygen or radical species derived from AAPH). We also used EPR to address the question of whether the AFR is an intermediate in the reduction of DHA to ascorbate by TR. Freshly prepared 1 mm DHA had no AFR signal, and incubation of 1 mm DHA with 0.1 μm TR, 5 μmTrx, and 0.2 mm NADPH under the conditions of the experiments in Fig. 5 failed to generate an AFR signal (results not shown). The absence of an AFR under conditions in which TR recycles DHA to ascorbate (see Fig. 1) strongly suggests that the AFR is not an intermediate in this two-electron reduction. We next evaluated whether overnight-dialyzed cytosol from rat liver showed NADPH-dependent reduction of the AFR, when the latter was generated by the ascorbate-ascorbate oxidase system. To establish specificity for TR, results were compared between dialysates of liver cytosolic fractions from control and selenium-deficient rats, with the results shown in Table I. Selenium deficiency was produced by dietary restriction of the element, and control animals received the deficient diet with added selenium. TR activity, measured in the insulin reduction assay, was <7% of control in dialysates prepared from livers of selenium-deficient rats (Table I). This confirms the presence of severe selenium deficiency. The addition of Trx doubled the ability of the control dialysates to reduce insulin disulfides. This stimulation is less than observed with purified TR (15May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), suggesting that some endogenous rat liver Trx was retained in these dialysates.Table IAFR reduction by liver cytosol and microsomes from control and selenium-deficient ratsActivityControlSelenium-deficientnmol · (mg protein) −1 · min−1Overnight-dialyzed liver cytosol Disulfide reductase activity4.3 ± 1.60.3 ± 0.41-ap < 0.05 versusselenium-supplemented control.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1), which inhibited the growth of human myofibroblastic HSC, increased the formation of two NF-κB DNA binding complexes; this effect was also observed with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The complexes were identified as the p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-κB dimers. Activation of NF-κB was associated with the degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB-α; no IκB-β was detected. Activation of NF-κB and degradation of IκB-α were prevented by the NF-κB inhibitors sodium salicylate and MG-132. In addition to cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), COX-2 is also constitutively expressed in human HSC, and the use of dexamethasone and of SC-58125, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, revealed that COX-2 accounts for basal COX activity. Moreover, COX-2 mRNA and protein were up-regulated by ET-1 and TNF-α, whereas COX-1 was unaffected. Induction of COX-2 and stimulation of COX activity by ET-1 and TNF-α were prevented by sodium salicylate and MG-132, suggesting that activation of NF-κB by either factor is needed for stimulation of COX-2. Finally, SC-58125 and dexamethasone reduced the growth inhibitory effect of ET-1 and TNF-α, indicating that activation of COX-2 is required for inhibition of HSC proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that NF-κB, by inducing COX-2 expression, may play an important role in the negative regulation of human myofibroblastic HSC proliferation.

Hepatic stellate cells (1Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J.

Following acute or chronic liver injury, HSC transdifferentiate from a quiescent cell containing large retinoid droplets to an activated myofibroblast-like cell (2Schmitt-Gräff A. Krüger S. Bochard F. Gabbiani G. Denk H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1233-1242PubMed Google Scholar). In response to growth factors and cytokines expressed by neighboring cells, activated HSC display enhanced mitogenicity and secrete multiple inflammatory cytokines and components of fibrosis (1Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Experimental models of liver injury have shown an increased proliferation of activated HSC (3Mancini R. Jezequel A.M.

Hepatology. 1993; 13: 1193-1202Google Scholar), and several studies have focused on factors that may limit growth of these cells. In particular, we have shown that binding of endothelin-1 (ET-1) to its G-protein-coupled ETB receptor leads to inhibition of human activated myofibroblastic HSC proliferation, following prostaglandin production (5Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin.

NF-κB is an essential regulator of the expression of viral genes, as well as of a number of genes involved in immune, inflammatory, and growth responses (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 8Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J.

This family of transcription factors comprise at least five members, p65 (RelA), p50, p52, RelB, and the product of the c-Rel protooncogene, which form homo- or heterodimers and bind to a DNA sequence called the κB motif. In most cell types, NF-κB is present in the cytosol in an inactive form, as a heterodimer of a 50-kDa (p50) and 65-kDa (p65) subunit, bound to one of the IκB inhibitory proteins. Of the different IκBs, IκB-α and the more recently identified IκB-β have been well characterized. All known activators of NF-κB (cytokines, phorbol esters, growth factors, and viral trans-activators) rapidly phosphorylate IκB-α, resulting in its ubiquitination and degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Degradation of IκB-β occurs more slowly and is induced by agonists that cause persistent activation of NF-κB (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The free NF-κB dimer subsequently translocates into the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Resynthesis of IκB-α is induced by NF-κB and allows resequestration of NF-κB in the cytoplasm, shutting down the NF-κB response (11Israel A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenases (COX) are the rate-limiting enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2, the committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Two isozymes are found in mammalian tissues, COX-1 and COX-2. The COX-1 isoform is constitutively expressed in most cells, and the COX-2 gene, generally absent in resting cells, is rapidly induced by hormones, cytokines, and tumor promoters (12Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the human cyclooxygenase-2 promoter region has revealed the presence of two NF-κB consensus sites, which are important in the induction of the COX-2 mRNA by TNF-α (13Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Since some evidence supports a role of NF-κB in the activation of genes that regulate cell growth arrest (14Bash J. Zong W.X. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6526-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

We show that two factors that inhibit the growth of human HSC, ET-1 (5Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S.

We also report that activation of NF-κB by both factors leads to the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediates inhibition of human HSC growth. All these results suggest that NF-κB, by inducing COX-2 expression, may play an important role in the negative regulation of human myofibroblastic HSC proliferation. ET-1 and sarafotoxin S6C were from Novabiochem (France), and TNF-α was from Preprotech (Tebu, France). Sodium salicylate, dexamethasone, and ibuprofen were obtained from Sigma (France). [methyl-3H]Thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. (France). Fetal calf serum was from J Bio Laboratories (France). Pooled human AB positive serum was supplied by the National Transfusion Center. Antibodies against p65 and IκB-α were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, France), and antibodies against p50 and IκB-β were kindly provided by Robert Weil (URA CNRS 1149, Paris, France). SC-58125 was a gift from Dr. P. C. Isakson (Searle). MG-132 was from Biomol (Tebu, France). cDNA probe for human COX-2 was a gift from Dr. S. Prescott (University of Utah), and the human G3PDH cDNA probe was from CLONTECH(Ozyme, France). Human HSC in their activated myofibroblastic phenotype were obtained by outgrowth of normal liver explants obtained from surgery of benign or malignant liver tumors. This procedure was performed in accordance with ethical regulations imposed by the French legislation. Explants were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum (5% fetal calf serum, 5% pooled human serum), and exhaustive characterization of these cells has already been published (17Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cell isolates were routinely characterized by a positive staining for smooth muscle α-actin, a marker of HSC in their myofibroblastic phenotype. Experiments were performed between passages 3 and 7, without any noticeable difference in results observed with cells obtained from various passages or from various livers. All experiments were performed on confluent cells made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days. DNA synthesis was measured in triplicate wells by incorporation of [3H]thymidine, as described previously (6Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Following pretreatment for 60 min with 25 μm SC-58125 or 18 h with dexamethasone or vehicle, confluent quiescent cells were stimulated for 30 h with TNF-α or ET-1, in the presence of 5% human serum. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added during the last 6 h of incubation. Confluent cells in 12-well plates were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days. HSC were then incubated for various times with either ET-1 (0.1 μm), sarafotoxin S6C (0.1 μm), TNF-α (50 ng/ml), or vehicle. When indicated, cells were pretreated either for 30 min with the NF-κB inhibitors sodium salicylate (20 mm), or MG-132 (50 μm), or 18 h with dexamethasone (0.1 μm). After a wash in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in whole cell extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm DTT). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (whole cell extract) were stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described by Dignamet al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Confluent cells in 10-cm dishes were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days and were further incubated for various times with the indicated effectors. Cells were then washed two times in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mmMgCl2,10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The tubes were shaken gently and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used as cytoplasmic extracts. The pellet nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mmMgCl2, 450 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation, nuclear debris were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants (nuclear extract) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Sense and antisense oligomers containing NF-κB-binding sites were annealed, and the double-stranded oligomer was radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed by filtration though a G50 Fine column. Sequences of the oligomers containing the positive regulatory element (PRE) κB sequence of the HIV-LTR were 5′-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3′, and oligomers containing the κB-responsive element of the COX-2 promoter were 5′-GGAGAGGGGATTCCCTGCGC-3′. In some experiments, we also used with similar results an oligomer (Promega) corresponding to the consensus sequence of NF-κB from the κ light chain enhancer. The sequence of the oligomer containing the HNF3 sequence of the HNF1 promoter was 5′-TCGAGCTCCAATGTAAACAGAGCAGGT-3′. Nuclear extracts (5–10 μg of protein) were incubated in the binding reaction medium (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by a 15-min incubation with 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer. Gels were run at 150 V for 90 min, dried, and autoradiographed. In competition assays, 100 ng of either unlabeled NF-κB, HNF3, or COX-2 oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction for 15 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. In the supershift experiments, the binding reaction containing the antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before adding the radioactive probe. Confluent cells were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days and were then stimulated with 0.1 μm ET-1 or 50 ng/ml TNF-α, as indicated. Total RNA was extracted in guanidinium thiocyanate, as described previously (5Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were denatured, fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Prehybridization was performed at 42 °C in 5× SSC (1×SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) containing 50% formamide, 1× Denhardt's, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 10% dextran, 170 μg/ml heparin, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. cDNA probes for COX-2 and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using a random priming Ready to Go kit (Pharmacia). Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with the32P-labeled probes, washed at 22 °C for 1 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and once in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm, Amersham) at −70 °C. Hybridization signals were quantified by Fuji Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Results are relative to G3PDH expression, which was used as an internal standard to correct for variations in loading and transfer. Results are expressed as fold over basal COX-2/G3PDH ratio. After electrophoresis on a denaturing SDS gel, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% skim milk. Detection of IκB-α, IκB-β (19Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), COX-1 (20Creminon C.

After 1 h incubation with 2000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody and extensive washings, immunodetected proteins were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent cells were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days and were then pretreated for 60 min with either 25 μm SC-58125, 25 μm ibuprofen, 20 mm sodium salicylate, 50 μm MG-132 or 18 h with 0.1 μm dexamethasone. Cells were further stimulated for the time indicated with 0.1 μm ET-1 or 50 ng/ml TNF-α. When indicated, 10 μm arachidonic acid, freshly diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, was added for 30 min at the end of incubation. Release of PGE2 in the medium was assayed as described previously (6Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Statistical analysis was determined by Student's unpaired t test with p < 0.05 considered significant. Nuclear proteins isolated from ET-1 or TNF-α-treated human myofibroblastic HSC were analyzed in electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA), using a radiolabeled DNA probe containing the κB sequence of the HIV-LTR promoter. As shown in Fig. 1 A(lane 2), ET-1 increased the formation of two NF-κB-DNA binding complexes. This activation was also observed with the ETB receptor agonist sarafotoxin S6C (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). TNF-α, which activates NF-κB in numerous cell types (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 8Barnes P.J. Karin M. N.

The specificity and composition of the complexes stimulated by ET-1 and TNF-α were next examined. Competition experiments, performed with an excess of unlabeled nucleotide corresponding either to the HIV-LTR κB or to one of the κB-responsive elements of the human COX-2 (13Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), eliminated the binding activity of the labeled probe (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and 8). In contrast, addition of the same excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the unrelated HNF3 consensus sequence had no effect (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). These data indicate that the DNA binding activity increased with ET-1, and TNF-α is specific for the κB motif. Supershift experiments using antibodies to each of the NF-κB/Rel proteins were performed to identify the proteins present in the NF-κB binding complexes. Incubation of nuclear extracts from ET-1-treated cells with p50 antibodies caused a supershift of the two complexes, indicating that p50 is present in both DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 1 B, lane 10). The anti-p65 antibody had no effect on the faster DNA-protein complex, whereas it supershifted the slower migrating complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 11). Antibodies to p52, c-Rel, and RelB had no effect (data not shown). Similar supershifts were obtained upon incubation of nuclear extracts from TNF-α-treated cells with the p50 and p65 antibodies (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13 and 14), indicating that ET-1 and TNF-α induce the formation of the same binding complexes. The effect of ET-1 was time-dependent (Fig. 2 A), being maximal after 15 min and persisting for 3 h. Activation of NF-κB by TNF-α occurred more rapidly and was observed as soon as 2–5 min after addition of the cytokine (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these results indicate that ET-1 and TNF-α increase the formation of two NF-κB binding complexes in human myofibroblastic HSC, one containing the p50/p50 homodimer and the other the p50/p65 heterodimer. We studied IκB regulation by ET-1 and TNF-α in the cytoplasm of human HSC treated with ET-1 or TNF-α for various times. The levels of IκB-α were analyzed by Western blot analysis using a specific IκB-α antibody. A protein with an expected size of 37 kDa was detected in cytoplasmic extracts of unstimulated cells (Fig. 3, Aand B). Treatment of human HSC with ET-1 resulted in degradation of IκB-α after 15 min, in keeping with the time course of NF-κB activation; total resynthesis was observed upon 3 h of treatment (Fig. 3 A). TNF-α-induced degradation of IκB-α was observed within 2 min and was total after 5 min (Fig. 3 B), in agreement with the rapid activation of NF-κB by TNF-α (Fig. 2 B). Since resynthesis of IκB-α occurred when activation of NF-κB was maintained, we investigated whether degradation of IκB-β could account for this prolonged activation of NF-κB. However, no signal corresponding to the 47-kDa protein IκB-β was found in untreated human HSC, whereas IκB-β was detected in untreated Jurkat cells taken as control (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrate that both ET-1 and TNF-α induce the degradation of IκB-α, an event that is associated with the increased formation of NF-κB complexes. The activation of NF-κB does not involve IκB-β. We have previously shown that the growth inhibitory effects of ET-1 are mediated by prostaglandins in human myofibroblastic HSC (6Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next explored whether ET-1 and TNF-α regulate COX-2 in these cells, through the NF-κB site in the promoter of this gene (13Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Endothelin-1 caused a rapid and sustained up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA, which was maximally increased by 4-fold after 45 min and remained elevated for at least 18 h (Fig. 4 A). The induction of COX-2 mRNA was associated with an increase in COX-2 protein, observed after 3 h stimulation with ET-1 and lasting for at least 18 h (Fig. 4 B). Activation of COX-2 protein expression was reproduced by the ETB agonist sarafotoxin S6C (see Fig. 5 B) and was totally blocked by the non-selective ETA/ETB antagonist PD-142893 (not shown). In contrast, the selective ETA antagonist B-Q123 did not affect COX-2 stimulation by ET-1 (not shown). Finally, pertussis toxin treatment did not modify ET-1-induced COX-2 expression (not shown). Tumor necrosis factor-α also up-regulated COX-2 mRNA and protein expression with a time course similar to that of ET-1 (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas COX-1 expression was not affected (Fig. 5 C). It should be noted that, in contrast to many other cell types (12Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Both NF-κB inhibitors effectively reduced activation of NF-κB and IκB-α degradation by TNF-α (Fig. 5 A) and ET-1 (not shown). Sodium salicylate and MG-132 blunted activation of COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 5 A), COX-2 protein (Fig. 5 B) by ET-1, S6C, and TNF-α. The NF-κB inhibitors also prevented activation of COX activity, measured as PGE2released in the presence of exogenously added arachidonic acid (Fig. 6 A). The expression of COX-1 protein was unaffected by these treatments (Fig. 5 C). Finally, ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits cyclooxygenase (26Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P.

https://openalex.org/W2054484850,"The activation of growth factor receptors and receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) can increase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity in many cells. Previously, we demonstrated that the activation of G-protein-coupled P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptors by extracellular ATP and UTP stimulated MAP (p42 ERK2) kinase by a mechanism that was dependent on the elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and the activation of related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) (also called PYK2, CAKβ, and CADTK) and protein kinase C (PKC). Here, we examine further the signaling cascade between the P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptor and MAP kinase. MAP kinase was transiently activated by exposure of PC12 cells to UTP. UTP, ionomycin, and phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) increased MAP kinase activity and also promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, SHC, and p120<sup>cbl</sup>. Down-regulation of PKC and inhibition of the elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, conditions that block the activation of MAP kinase, also blocked the increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK and the EGF receptor. AG1478, a tyrphostin selective for the EGF receptor, reduced the activation of MAP kinase, the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, the association of Grb2 with SHC, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and p120<sup>cbl</sup> but did not block the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. The similar effects of UTP, ionomycin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on these signaling proteins demonstrate that the two signaling molecules from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, and diacylglycerol) can individually initiate the activation of MAP kinase in an EGF receptor-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptor-mediated transactivation of the EGF receptor occurs at a point downstream of RAFTK and indicate that the EGF receptor is required for P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation. Although P<sub>2Y2</sub> and EGF receptors may both activate a similar multiprotein signaling cascade immediately upstream of MAP kinase, the P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptor appears to uniquely utilize [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, PKC, and, subsequently, RAFTK."
https://openalex.org/W2101813653,"The involvement of oxidative stress in freeze-thaw injury to yeast cells was analyzed using mutants defective in a range of antioxidant functions, including Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (encoded by SOD1), Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase A, catalase T, glutathione reductase, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and Yap1 transcription factor. Only those affecting superoxide dismutases showed decreased freeze-thaw tolerance, with the sod1 mutant and the sod1 sod2 double mutant being most affected. This indicated that superoxide anions were formed during freezing and thawing. This was confirmed since the sod1 mutant could be made more resistant by treatment with the superoxide anion scavenger MnCl2, or by freezing in the absence of oxygen, or by the generation of a rho0 petite. Increased expression of SOD2 conferred freeze-thaw tolerance on thesod1 mutant indicating the ability of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase to compensate for the lack of the cytoplasmic enzyme.

Cryopreservation provides an excellent way of preserving living cells and storing them and has found wide application in medicine, agriculture, and food technology. However, the processes of freezing and thawing cause severe stress to cells and can lead to loss of viability. There is, therefore, a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie freeze-thaw damage and how cells survive it or respond to prevent it. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the damage caused by freezing and thawing; these are based on an analysis of the physical and chemical changes that occur. For example, cells are known to be damaged by physical changes associated with ice nucleation and dehydration (1Mazur P. Science. 1970; 168: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). They can also be affected by accompanying changes in intracellular osmolarity and pH which lead to aggregation of macromolecules (2Levitt J. Meryman H.T. Cryobiology. Academic Press, New York1966: 495-563Google Scholar) and denaturation of proteins (3Franks F. Mathias S. Galfre P. Brown D. Cryobiology. 1983; 20: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Clegg J.S. Seitz P. Hazelwood C.F. Cryobiology. 1982; 19: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage has also been considered to be a factor since an oxidative burst has been predicted to occur during thawing (5Hermes-Lima M. Storey K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R646-R652PubMed Google Scholar), and this would lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 and oxidative damage to cellular components. This is supported by the observation that antioxidant defense systems of reptiles are activated by freezing stress (5Hermes-Lima M. Storey K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R646-R652PubMed Google Scholar) and that overexpression of superoxide dismutase enhances the freezing tolerance of transgenic Alfalfa (6McKersie B.D. Chen Y. de Beus M. Bowley S.R. Bowler C. Inze D. D'Halluin K. Botterman J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Moreover we have shown that yeast cells can become more resistant to freeze-thaw damage following treatment with a dose of hydrogen peroxide that causes cells to adapt to further peroxide stress (7Park J.-I. Grant C.M. Attfield P.V. Dawes I.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3818-3824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we examine the extent to which oxidative damage occurs during freezing and thawing of cells and directly demonstrate the generation of ROS. ROS are generated as an unavoidable side reaction in living systems that rely on oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor during energy generation. One primary product of electron leakage from the respiratory chain is the superoxide anion (O⨪2) generated by the one-electron reduction of O2 (8Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar, 9Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). This can also be formed from other enzymatic systems including xanthine oxidase or NADPH oxidase (8Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). The superoxide anion disturbs the redox balance of cells by reducing and releasing metal ions from metal ion-clustered proteins or is converted to other ROS including the peroxy radical (HO⨪2) or H2O2 (10Gutteridge J.M.C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 91: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Gille G. Sigler K. Folia Microbiol. 1995; 40: 131-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Reduced metal ions and H2O2 undergo the Fenton reaction generating one of the most reactive ROS, the hydroxyl radical (⋅OH). These ROS damage cells by reacting with many cellular molecules including proteins, lipids, and DNA (12Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar, 13Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The generation of ROS is accelerated as an oxidative burst following ischemia and reoxygenation since this stimulates the conversion of dehydrogenases to oxidases and the introduction of excess O2 in the cell cytoplasm (14Roy R.S. McCord J.C. Greenwald R. Cohen G. Oxyradicals and Their Scavenging Systems. 2. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1983: 145-153Google Scholar). Freezing and thawing may form an analogous situation since cells are isolated from O2 following freezing and are re-oxygenated during thawing. This may be augmented by the attendant dehydration and rehydration processes that result from the balancing of vapor pressure between intra- and extracellular ice systems during freezing and thawing (1Mazur P. Science. 1970; 168: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Cells contain various enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems for detoxifying ROS (15Rock C.L. Jacob R.A. Bowen P.E. J. Am. Diet.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 19Gralla E.B. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar) which is then disproportionated to water by catalases or peroxidases (20Ruis H. Koller F. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 309-343Google Scholar). Yeast has two types of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The Cu,Zn-SOD encoded by theSOD1 gene is located in the cytoplasm; its level is constitutively high (about 1% of soluble protein in the cell) during fermentation and respiration (19Gralla E.B. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar). The Mn-SOD encoded bySOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and from a low level in fermentative cells it is induced during respiration (19Gralla E.B. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar) or starvation (21Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other systems found in yeast include the cytoplasmic catalase encoded by CTT1, the peroxisomal catalase encoded by CTA1 (20Ruis H. Koller F. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 309-343Google Scholar), and the glutathione-based systems including glutathione itself and various peroxidases (22Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we have exploited the availability of mutations affecting oxidative stress response systems in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to characterize the nature and extent of oxidative stress encountered by cells during freezing and thawing. The mutations used included those in CTA1, CTT1, SOD1, SOD2, and YAP1 which encodes a transcriptional activator required for stress-induced expression of several oxidative defense genes (13Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 23Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD were found to be involved in the recovery of cells from freeze-thaw injury, and this enabled an indication of the nature of the major species causing oxidative stress damage and where this damage occurred in the cells. The role of SODs in the process was further analyzed using mutations affecting mitochondrial activity, and the free radicals generated during freeze-thaw injury in wild-type and sod mutants have been detected and characterized using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. 190 Yeast strains used are described in Table I.

For high aeration of cultures, cells were grown at 30 °C, with shaking at 180 rpm, in 40 ml of medium in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask; and for low aeration of cultures, cells were incubated at 30 °C, without shaking, in 8 ml of medium in a 16 × 100-mm culture tube. These experiments were repeated with shaking of all cultures using 250-ml flasks and volumes of medium corresponding to those used in the above conditions, to minimize any problems arising from the differences in shaking; both experiments gave similar results. YEPD medium contained 2% glucose, 2% bactopeptone, and 1% yeast extract; and SD medium contained 2% glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.5% ammonium sulfate (Oxoid), and auxotrophic requirements at 40 mg/liter where necessary. SD medium for anaerobic culture was supplemented with 0.1% Tween 80 and ergosterol at 30 mg/liter. Media were solidified by adding 2% agar. To avoid mutation of the sod strains they were stored on slopes in an anaerobic jar (Oxoid) which contained a gas-generating kit (Anaerobic system BR38: Oxoid). Molecular techniques were carried out as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The SOD1gene was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of total yeast DNA with specific oligonucleotides (TCTCTCGCTGAACTTGTCCTTACC and GTGTTCCCTTTCTTGGTGTCTGTC), and from this aSacI/StuI cut fragment containing 722 bp of upstream untranslated region and 872 bp of coding and downstream untranslated region was cloned into the SacI/SmaI cut pRS425 vector (30Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The plasmid pYEUMn (21Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) containing the intactSOD2 gene in YEp13 was used for overexpression. The intactCTT1 gene donated by H. Ruis was recloned into theBamHI/ClaI site of the pRS426 vector (30Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). TheSOD2::lacZ fusion construct containing 558 bp of upstream untranslated region of SOD2 and 235 bp of coding sequence has been described (21Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed using the lithium acetate method (31Geitz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Integrative plasmids were linearized by cleavage at the StuI site within theURA3 gene prior to transformation. Correct single copy integration was checked by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Transformants of sod1 mutant strain were maintained anaerobically as described above. Assays for β-galactosidase were carried out usingο-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose (ONPG) as substrate as described previously (32Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Specific activity is expressed as nanomoles of ONPG hydrolyzed per min−1mg−1 protein. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad assay method as indicated by the manufacturer. All determinations were the average of three independent experiments. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and suspended to an A 600 of 3 in the same buffer. Aliquots (0.3 ml) of cells were transferred into thin-walled 1.5-ml polycarbonate tubes (Greiner Labortechnik) and frozen at −20 °C for times indicated and then thawed at 4 °C for 40 min as described previously (7Park J.-I. Grant C.M. Attfield P.V. Dawes I.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3818-3824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Survival was determined by diluting cells into YEPD medium at room temperature and plating on YEPD plates. Data were determined in triplicate and the two-sample t test was done where appropriate. Cells were grown at 30 °C for 2 days before colony counting. Anaerobic freezing was performed as above except that the buffer used for freezing was deoxygenated by sparging with argon for 4 h before use. Cells cultured for 1 day were harvested and diluted to an A 600 of 0.1 in fresh YEPD medium. 5 μl of each diluted culture was spotted onto YEPD plates containing either 0.1 or 0.2 mm paraquat and subsequently incubated at 30 °C for the required length of time to visualize phenotypic difference. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 1 in YEPD medium at 30 °C under the low aeration culture condition. MnCl2 was added to the culture to a final concentration of either 2 or 4 mm, and cells were cultured for 30 min before being subjected to the freeze-thaw process. MnCl2 was removed by washing cells twice before freezing. Cells at exponential growth phase (A 600 = 1) were harvested and washed in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cell density was determined by measuring optical density and by colony counting. Cells were then suspended to approximately 2×109 cells/ml in 500 μl of the same buffer containing spin trap agents, either 50 mm α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) or 100 mm 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). Samples were frozen at −20 °C for 2 h and thawed as described above. Thawed samples were then either transferred to an EPR flat cell or extracted into toluene. Toluene extracts were bubbled with argon in cylindrical cells for 10 min prior to EPR measurement. The increase in amplitude with time of the EPR signal of the radicals was measured and expressed in arbitrary units per about 109cells. All EPR spectra were obtained with a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer using field modulation 100.00 kHz and either a standard rectangular (ER 4102 ST) or cylindrical (ER 4103 TM) cavity. Typical EPR spectrometer settings were as follows: gain 2 × 106 (DMPO) or 5 × 106 (PBN), modulation amplitude 0.2 mT (DMPO) or 0.1 mT (PBN), conversion time 81 ms, time constant 81 ms (DMPO) or 163 ms (PBN), sweep time 83 s, center field 347.5 mT, field scan 8 mT, power 31 milliwatts (DMPO) or 50 milliwatts (PBN), frequency 9.722 GHz, temperature 294 K, with 8 scans averaged. We have previously shown that H2O2 pretreatment could induce freeze-thaw tolerance of yeast cells (7Park J.-I. Grant C.M. Attfield P.V. Dawes I.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3818-3824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since such treatment induces cells to adapt to oxidative stress, this indicated that ROS generated during freezing and thawing may cause lethal damage to the cell. To test this hypothesis, and determine which oxidative stress response systems are involved in protecting cells from freeze-thaw damage, the tolerance of a range of mutants affected in various aspects of the oxidative stress response was examined. The mutants examined included those with null mutations in YAP1, GSH1, GLR1, CTA1, CTT1, SOD1, and SOD2,as well as the sod1 sod2 double mutant. YAP1encodes a transcriptional activator of several genes involved in oxidative stress and detoxification of toxic compounds (13Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).GSH1 and GLR1 are responsible for producing and regenerating, respectively, the important antioxidant glutathione (22Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).CTA1 encodes the peroxisomal catalase A and CTT1the yeast cytosolic catalase which scavenge H2O2 (20Ruis H. Koller F. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 309-343Google Scholar), whereas the SOD1 and SOD2 gene products are the superoxide dismutases that scavenge O⨪2 (18Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 19Gralla E.B. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar). The freeze-thaw tolerance of each mutant was compared with its isogenic wild type after growth to the post-diauxic shift phase (48 h in YEPD) since wild-type cells have been shown to be more resistant in this phase (7Park J.-I. Grant C.M. Attfield P.V. Dawes I.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3818-3824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants affected in the SOD genes showed a much greater sensitivity to freeze-thaw stress than their isogenic wild-type strain 1783, whereas the freeze-thaw sensitivity of the other oxidative stress mutants was much less affected relative to their wild-type strain CY4 (Fig. 1). This sensitivity was very apparent in the sod1 and sod1 sod2 double-mutant strains although the sod2, gsh1, and glr1mutants were slightly more sensitive than their isogenic wild-type strains. Since the SOD1 gene product is located in the cytoplasm, this indicates that freeze-thaw damage to cells involves superoxide radicals rather than H2O2 or compounds for which glutathione-based defense systems are important and that prevention of the damage to cells is more dependent on the cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD than the mitochondrial Mn-SOD. As an initial step to try and confirm that the superoxide radicals were involved, we tested the effect on the freeze-thaw-sensitivesod1 mutant of pretreatment with MnCl2, which is known to act as a O⨪2 scavenger (33Chang E.C. Crawford B.F. Hong Z. Bilinski J. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 266: 4417-4424Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 34Archibald F.S. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 452-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). From Fig. 2 it can be seen that pretreatment with 4 mm MnCl2 for 30 min led to a 3-fold increase in the survival of the sod1 strain. The same treatment also increased the freezing tolerance of the wild-type strain as might be expected if free radicals were generated during freezing and thawing. MgCl2 used at the same concentration as a divalent metal ion control did not induce any freezing tolerance (data not shown). We next examined the effects of overexpressing SOD1 and SOD2 in the sod1 mutant. Although the effect of SOD1 gene in multiple copies was not significantly different (Fig. 3 A; compare pRS425SOD1 with pRS425), interestingly overexpression of SOD2 (YEp13SOD2 with YEp13) led to a significant increase in survival approaching that of the wild-type strain. This indicates that higher levels of SOD in the mitochondrial compartment can compensate for the lack of the cytoplasmic enzyme; this is discussed later. The failure of the multi-copy SOD1 vector to improve the tolerance of the sod1 mutant may have been due to H2O2 produced due to the augmented activity of the cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase since in Escherichia coli and Drosophila melanogasteroverproduction of superoxide dismutase increased sensitivity to oxidative stress caused by paraquat (35Scott M.D. Meshnick S.R. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3640-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stavelery B.E. Phillips J.P. Hilliker A.J. Genome. 1990; 33: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We attempted to resolve this point by using sod1 strains transformed with multiple copy vectors carrying SOD1 and CTT1, but the interpretation of these results was hampered by the differences in growth rates of the various single and double transformants and the inability to obtain strains carrying both vectors alone as a control. On transforming the sod1 mutant containing theSOD1 multi-copy vector with another vector carryingCTT1, to remove excess H2O2, a 2-fold increase in survival was seen compared with that of thesod1 mutant transformed with the SOD1 multi-copy vector and the control plasmid pRS426. The overexpression of CTT1 alone in the sod1 mutant did not affect its freeze-thaw tolerance (data not shown). To confirm that theSOD1 and SOD2 genes were overexpressed sufficiently in the various constructs to affect cellular superoxide levels, they were tested for their sensitivity to paraquat on YEPD plates. From Fig. 3 B it can be seen that the SOD1and SOD2 constructs were resistant to paraquat and that overexpression of both SOD1 and CTT1 conferred the greatest resistance. Overexpression of both of the SOD enzymes was also demonstrated by separating them from cell extracts using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and activity staining using nitro blue tetrazolium (data not shown).Figure 3Overexpression of SOD1, SOD2, or CTT1 in the sod1mutant. A, transformants were grown on SD medium for 2 days, and freeze-thaw tolerance was determined by measuring viability after exposure to −20 °C. Percentage survival is expressed relative to the culture viability immediately prior to freezing (%). Data shown are means of triplicate experiments.Error bars represent the standard error of the means (p value obtained for the double transformants was 0.022). Experiments were repeated at least twice. B, the resistance to paraquat of a 1-day culture of each transformant was determined by spotting 5 μl of each diluted fraction (A 600 = 0.1) onto YEPD plates containing 0.2 mm paraquat. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. A YEPD control plate showed similar growth of all strains in the absence of paraquat.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results with the sod1 mutant indicated that the cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD is more important for freeze-thaw resistance than other oxidative defense systems, and this raised the question of whether the freeze-thaw sensitivity of the sod mutants was due to accumulated oxidative damage during prior culture, or to O⨪2 generation during freezing or thawing. To investigate whether freeze-thaw stress sensitivity of the sod mutants was due to the accumulated oxidative damage affecting cellular integrity, or to generation of O⨪2 during the freeze-thaw process, the sod mutants and the wild-type strain were grown under high or low aeration culture conditions, and changes in freeze-thaw tolerance of the cells were followed. If the freeze-thaw sensitivity of the sod mutants was due to the accumulated damage, then high aeration culture would decrease freezing tolerance by increased generation of ROS, and low aeration would do the opposite.

Mutation of the Sox10 gene leads to neural crest defects in the Dominant megacolon mouse mutant and to combined Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndrome in humans. Here, we have studied the four Sox10 mutations found to date in Waardenburg-Hirschsprung patients both in the context of the rat and the human cDNA. Unlike the rat Sox10 protein, which failed to show transcriptional activity on its own, human Sox10 displayed a weak, but reproducible, activity as a transcriptional activator. All mutant Sox10 proteins, including the one that only lacked the 106 last amino acids were deficient in this capacity, indicating that the carboxyl terminus of human Sox10 carries a transactivation domain. Whereas all four mutants failed to transactivate, only two failed to synergistically enhance the activity of other transcription factors. Synergy required both the ability to bind to DNA and a region in the amino-terminal part of Sox10. Those mutants that failed to synergize were unable to bind to DNA. Analysis of the naturally occurring Sox10 mutations not only helps to dissect Sox10 structure, but also allows limited predictions on the severity of the disease.

The family of Sox proteins is an evolutionary conserved group of transcription factors with diverse functions during development (1Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). All members of this family contain as their DNA-binding domain a variant form of the HMG1 box (2Laudet V. Stehelin D. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that was first described in the sex-determining factor SRY (3Gubbay J. Collignon J. Koopman P. Capel B. Economou A. Münsterberg A. Vivian N. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Nature. 1990; 346: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). This HMG box contains three α-helical regions and is arranged in a twisted L shape. It presents its concave surface to the minor groove of DNA, thus allowing sequence-specific recognition. Binding of the HMG box induces a large conformational change in the DNA (4Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to influence the structure of bound DNA, proteins with HMG boxes are believed to exert at least part of their function as architectural proteins (5Werner M.H. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 88: 733-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).We have recently identified Sox10, a novel member of the Sox gene family (6Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During late development and in the adult, Sox10 expression was primarily detected in glial cells of the peripheral and the central nervous system. During early development, before the establishment of this “late” expression pattern, Sox10is already expressed in the emerging neural crest. The neural crest gives rise to a number of different cell types and tissues, which include cells of the peripheral and the enteric nervous system as well as melanocytes. Accordingly, mutation of one Sox10 allele in the naturally occurring Dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse led to aganglionosis of the colon combined with pigmentation defects (7Herbarth B. Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Puliti A. Lemort N. Goossens M. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5161-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar,8Southard-Smith E.M. Kos L. Pavan W.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Mutation of both alleles is embryonic lethal and is characterized by severe defects in various parts of the peripheral and the enteric nervous system.Heterozygous Sox10 mutations have also been detected in three sporadic and one familial case of the human Shah-Waardenburg syndrome (9Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Prehu M.-O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Smith J.C. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). This disease combines the classical features of Waardenburg syndrome (deafness and pigmentation defects) with the aganglionic megacolon of Hirschsprung disease and thus bears resemblance to the phenotype of the Dom mouse (10Read A.P. Newton V.E. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Here, we have performed an in vitro study of these four mutations and have analyzed their impact on Sox10 structure and function.RESULTSThe four mutations that we previously characterized in one Sox10 allele of Shah-Waardenburg patients are schematically summarized in Fig. 1 A. Mutant WS029 is characterized by a nonsense mutation, which converts tyrosine 83 to a stop codon. In the MIC nonsense mutant, glutamate at position 189 is targeted so that the truncated protein consists only of the 188 amino-terminal residues. Mutant 059 lacks the last 106 amino acids of Sox10 due to a deletion of two nucleotides at position 1076 and a resulting frameshift. Mutant 095, on the other hand, carries an insertion of 6 nucleotides between positions 482 and 483. The resulting addition of a leucine and an arginine residue into the DNA-binding HMG box leaves the open reading frame intact.The mutations were introduced into both rat and human cDNAs, and the resulting mutant proteins were expressed in transiently transfected COS cells. To verify expression, we performed Western blot analysis on whole cell extracts of transfected cells using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against Sox10. As evident from Fig. 1 B, proteins of the expected size were readily detected for mutants 095, 059, and MIC in both human and rat cDNA contexts. Mutant WS029 was not detected due to the inability of our antiserum to detect the first 82 amino acids of Sox10 (data not shown). However, we were able to detect WS029 in a Western blot with a monoclonal T7 tag antibody after amino-terminal addition of the corresponding epitope (see Fig. 7). Tagged and untagged version of WS029 behaved identical in all functional assays.Figure 7Cellular localization of the Sox10 mutant WS029. Nuclear (NE) and cytosolic (cyt) extracts from COS cells ectopically expressing epitope-tagged WS029 or Sox10 HMG box were analyzed by Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the T7 epitope (filled box).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously failed to detect inherent transcriptional activity when testing the rat Sox10 protein for its ability to stimulate a promoter consisting of a TATA box and multiple Sox consensus recognition sites (6Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To extend this analysis, we now carried out similar transient transfection experiments with the human Sox10 protein. As a negative control we included rat Sox10. As a positive control, we used Sox11 from rat, which had previously been shown to be a strong activator of this promoter (14Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the experiments summarized in Fig. 2 A, Sox11 stimulated promoter activity approximately 25-fold. Human Sox10 exhibited an intermediate behavior, yielding on average, a 7.5-fold reporter gene induction (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the human and rat Sox10 proteins differ from each other with respect to their transactivation capacity. Whereas the presence of rat Sox10 barely influenced reporter gene expression, human Sox10 led to a reproducible reporter gene induction.Figure 2Transcriptional activities of human Sox10 and its mutants. The Sox-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid 3×SX luc was transfected into U138 glioblastoma cells in combination with expression plasmids for rat Sox11, rat Sox10, or human Sox10 (A) and with expression plasmids for various Sox10 mutants introduced into the background of the human sequence (B). Luciferase activities were determined in three independent experiments, each performed in duplicates. Values from transfections with luciferase reporter and empty expression plasmid were arbitrarily set to 1. Data from all other transfections are presented as -fold induction above this level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This allowed us to test the effect of each mutation on the ability of the human Sox10 protein to activate transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 B, all mutations nullified transactivation ability of human Sox10. This result impressively supports our assumption that all of the previously detected human Sox10 mutations lead to functional inactivation of the protein. This result is especially intriguing with respect to mutant 059, which only lacks the last 106 amino acids. Similar experiments with mutations being introduced into the rat cDNA were not informative because of the inability of the wild-type rat Sox10 protein to transactivate in this assay (data not shown).From the behavior of the 059 mutant, it can be concluded that the carboxyl-terminal region of human Sox10 is required for transcriptional activation. To analyze whether this region would also be sufficient for transcriptional activation, we fused amino acids 354–466 of human Sox10 to the POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (Fig. 3 A), thus allowing us to compare the activity of this chimera with the activities of full-length Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP and the isolated POU domain in transient transfections. All constructs were expressed at comparable levels and bound to a recognition site for POU proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). Full-length Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP activated a POU-responsive promoter approximately 5.5-fold in this set of experiments (Fig. 3 D). The isolated POU domain was inactive as shown previously (13Sock E. Enderich J. Rosenfeld M.G. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17512-17518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using the Sox10/POU domain chimera, we on average obtained a more than 10-fold stimulation of the luciferase reporter, indicating that the last 113 amino acids of human Sox10 indeed contain a transactivation domain.Figure 3Transactivation domain of human Sox10. A, summary of POU domain constructs. Tst-1, full-length Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP; POU, POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP; POU10C, chimera consisting of Tst-1POU domain and amino acids 354–466 of human Sox10.B, expression of POU domain constructs in transfected cells was analyzed by Western blots of whole cell extracts with a polyclonal antiserum against the POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. C, DNA binding of the POU domain constructs to a radiolabeled HSV oct site was tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. D, the POU-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid HSVoct luc was transfected into U138 glioblastoma cells in combination with expression plasmids for full-length Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (Tst-1), the isolated POU domain (POU), and the Sox10/POU domain fusion (POU10C). Luciferase activities were determined in three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Values from transfections with luciferase reporter and empty expression plasmid were arbitrarily set to 1. Data from all other transfections are presented as -fold induction above this level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous analyses had shown that rat Sox10, though not a transcriptional activator by itself, exhibited the ability to synergistically enhance the activity of other transcription factors on suitable promoter constructs (6Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested how the Sox10 mutations would affect this modulatory activity, when introduced into the context of the rat sequence. As shown previously, wild-type rat Sox10 enhanced the transcriptional activity of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP significantly, both at low and at saturating protein levels (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). Mutants WS029 and 095 both failed to synergistically stimulate the activity of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. This was not so with the other two Sox10 mutations. MIC and 059 were approximately as efficient as wild-type rat Sox10 in their ability to enhance Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP function.Figure 4Synergistic activities of Sox10 mutants.The luciferase reporter plasmid 3×FXO luc, which carries binding sites for both Sox and POU proteins, was transfected into U138 glioblastoma cells in combination with empty CMV expression plasmid (−), expression plasmids for Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, wild-type Sox10, Sox10 mutants WS029, 095, MIC, and 059, or various combinations thereof, as indicated. Luciferase activities were determined in three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Values from transfections with luciferase reporter and empty expression plasmid were arbitrarily set to 1. Data for all other transfections are presented as -fold induction above this level. A, mutations introduced into the rat Sox10 sequence;B, mutations introduced into the human Sox10 sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar experiments were also carried out with human Sox10 and the four mutants introduced into the human cDNA. Again, WS029 and 095 failed to exhibit any synergistic activity. In the context of the human sequence, mutants 059 and MIC also showed a marked reduction of their ability to enhance Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP function. Whereas the presence of wild-type human Sox10 increased Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP-dependent reporter gene induction from a mere 3-fold to more than 30-fold, 059 and MIC only led to a 10–12-fold promoter stimulation. These induction rates were still significantly higher than the sum of induction rates obtained for the reporter with either transcription factor alone. Thus, part of the ability to synergistically enhance Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP function is retained in those two mutants. On the basis of these analyses, it can be concluded that the carboxyl terminus, which is missing in MIC and 059, is not absolutely required for synergistic function.We had previously described a mutant version of rat Sox10 in which most amino acids in front of the HMG domain had been deleted (6Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to the 059 and MIC mutations described here, this ΔN mutant had failed to functionally interact with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, indicating that the “synergy domain” might be present in the region amino-terminal of the HMG domain. To study this domain in more detail, we generated two additional mutant versions of rat Sox10 in which we deleted parts of the amino-terminal region. Mutant Sox10Δ1–60 was devoid of the first 60 amino acids, which among Sox proteins are unique to Sox10 (Fig. 5 A). Mutant Sox10Δ61–102 on the other hand carried a deletion encompassing amino acids 61–102, which are conserved between Sox10 and the related Sox9 and SoxP1 proteins. Both mutant proteins were effectively expressed in transiently transfected cells and correctly localized to the nucleus as evident from Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts (Fig. 5 B). However, when tested for their ability to functionally interact with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, only Sox10Δ61–102 proved active, whereas Sox10Δ1–60 was unable to substitute for the wild-type rat Sox10 protein. Thus, we conclude that amino acids 1–60 are involved in mediating synergy with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP.Figure 5Sox10 domains involved in synergism with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. A, summary of Sox10 mutants. Sox10Δ1–60, mutant rat Sox10 lacking amino acids 1–60; Sox10Δ61–102, mutant rat Sox10 lacking amino acids 61–102.B, comparison of expression levels between Sox10 and its mutants Sox10Δ1–60 and Sox10Δ61–102 in nuclear extracts of transfected cells by Western blot using rabbit antiserum against Sox10.Numbers on left indicate size of molecular mass markers in kilodaltons. C, the luciferase reporter plasmid 3×FXO luc was transfected into U138 glioblastoma cells in combination with empty CMV expression plasmid (−) or expression plasmids for Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (Tst-1), wild-type Sox10, or the Sox10 mutants Δ1–60 and Δ61–102 as indicated. Luciferase activities were determined in three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Values from transfections with luciferase reporter and empty expression plasmid were arbitrarily set to 1. Data for all other transfections are presented as -fold induction above this level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the impact of the naturally occurring Sox10 mutations, we next tested the ability of each of the mutant proteins to bind to a consensus DNA recognition element for Sox proteins in gel retardation assays (15Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Wild-type Sox10 and the 059 and MIC mutants each yielded protein-DNA complexes of characteristic mobility when analyzed in the context of the rat proteins (Fig. 6 A). Levels of each Sox10 protein were adjusted to each other by Western blot analysis so that approximately equal amounts of each protein were used in gel retardation assays (Fig. 6 B). Nevertheless, the MIC mutant was reproducibly more effective in complex formation, indicating that the truncated protein might have a higher affinity for the Sox consensus recognition site than wild-type Sox10. In contrast to MIC and 059, WS029 and 095 failed to form protein-DNA complexes. For WS029, this was expected as the protein completely lacks the DNA-binding domain. 095, however, contains an HMG box, which is only altered by insertion of two amino acids compared with wild-type Sox10. Identical results were obtained with the mutant human Sox10 proteins (data not shown). From our gel-shift analyses, it can therefore be concluded that the insertion abolished DNA binding completely.Figure 6DNA binding of Sox10 mutant proteins. A, the radiolabeled consensus recognition site for Sox proteins SX was incubated with whole cell extracts from COS cells that were either mock-transfected (mock) or transfected with expression plasmids for rat Sox10 (wt) or various Sox10 mutants (WS029, 095, MIC, and 059). The specific complex formed by each Sox10 protein is marked. Comparable amounts of each Sox protein were used. B, Western blot analysis of the same extracts using anti-Sox10 polyclonal antiserum. Ten times greater amounts were analyzed in B compared with A. Note that the anti-Sox10 polyclonal antiserum did not recognize the WS029 mutant, which for that reason was omitted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The HMG box of Sox proteins has also been shown to contain two independent nuclear localization signals (16Poulat F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These signals are present in the 095, 059, and MIC mutants. In agreement, these mutants preferentially localize to the cell nucleus and are found in nuclear extracts of transfected cells. The nuclear localization signals are, however, missing from mutant WS029. Therefore, we determined its localization within the cell (Fig. 7). As already mentioned, WS029 was not detected by our Sox10-specific antiserum and therefore had to be tagged by a T7 epitope. This epitope does not influence the cellular localization of proteins by itself (18Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The same epitope was also added onto the HMG box of Sox10. When the cellular localization of both proteins was analyzed by subfractionation studies, it became evident that WS029 preferentially localized to the cytosol, whereas the epitope-tagged HMG box localized to the nucleus (Fig. 7). Thus, we conclude, that WS029 does not reach the nuclear compartment and that the Sox10 HMG box indeed contains the signals necessary for nuclear localization.DISCUSSIONMembers of the Sox family of transcriptional regulators are expressed at various stages and in various tissues of the developing embryo (1Pevny L.H.

Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the Sox10 gene was also found to lead to a combination of neural crest defects in the spontaneous mouse mutant Dominant megacolon (7Herbarth B. Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Puliti A. Lemort N. Goossens M. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5161-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Southard-Smith E.M. Kos L. Pavan W.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the Sox10 gene were shown to underlie some cases of combined Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease in humans (9Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Prehu M.-O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Smith J.C. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In this disease, the aganglionic colon characteristic of Hirschsprung disease is combined with sensorineural deafness and pigmentation abnormalities as usually seen in Waardenburg syndrome.Four independent Sox10 mutations were identified so far in human patients, three with a sporadic and one with a familial occurrence (9Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Prehu M.-O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Smith J.C. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized the impact of each of these mutations on Sox10 function in vitro. Our results indicate that all mutations interfere with normal Sox10 function. Mutant WS029, which corresponded to the first 82 amino acids of Sox10, exhibited an aberrant cytosolic localization and failed to bind to DNA. Previous analyses on Sox9 and Sry, the prototypic member of the Sox gene family, had led to the detection of two independent nuclear localization signals within the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal end of the HMG domain (16Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Goze C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Südbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These signals are conserved in most Sox proteins, including Sox10. The occurrence of nuclear localization signals within the HMG domain of Sox10 is also corroborated by the nuclear localization observed in this study for the isolated HMG domain. Thus it seems that both the aberrant cellular localization and the failure to bind to DNA can be attributed to the loss of the HMG box in WS029. Given the severity of the mutation, it is not surprising that WS029 failed to show intrinsic transcriptional activation as well as synergistic activity with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP.Mutant 095 showed the typical nuclear localization but failed to bind to DNA. This failure was due to the insertion of 2 amino acids into the DNA-binding HMG box. The insertion affects a region that is folded into helix 3, one of the three α-helices, which together form the twisted L-shaped structure of the HMG box (4Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Additionally, helix 3 is normally involved in direct contacts with DNA. The 095 insertion in helix 3 therefore either interferes with DNA binding directly or alters the overall conformation of the HMG box such that DNA binding is disturbed. Similar to WS029, 095 exhibited no transcriptional activity, either alone or in combination with other transcription factors such as Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP.The other two mutants, MIC and 059, differed from WS029 and 095 in that they showed no obvious defects in cellular localization or DNA-binding. In agreement with this, both mutants contained an intact HMG box. When tested in the context of the rat sequence for their ability to snyergistically enhance the activity of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, these mutants behaved very similar to wild-type Sox10 protein from rat. This implied that the region required for synergistic enhancement was present in both MIC and 059. As MIC only consists of the first 188 amino acids of Sox10, the synergy domain should be pre"

The signaling pathways from G protein-coupled receptors to extracellular signal-regulated kinase have been partially elucidated, whereas the mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptors stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK activities remain largely unknown. We have recently demonstrated that the signal from Gq/11-coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor to p38 MAPK is mediated by both Gαq/11 and Gβγ in HEK-293 cells (Yamauchi, J., Nagao, M., Kaziro, Y., and Itoh, H.

In the present study, we report that a constitutively activated mutant of Gα11(Gα11 Q209L) activated not only p38 MAPK, but also JNK, and the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK by Gα11 Q209L was partially inhibited by prolonged treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calphostin C. In addition, the Gα11Q209L-stimulated activation of both kinases was blocked by a specific inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases (PP2) and Csk (C-terminal Src kinase). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Gα11 Q209L stimulated Src family kinase activity and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in HEK-293 cells. These results suggest that Gαq/11 stimulates JNK and p38 MAPK activities through protein kinase C- and Src family kinase-dependent signaling pathways.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 are important mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. Regulation by MAPKs has been implicated in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic death. In mammals, MAPKs are divided into at least three subfamilies: ERK, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAPK (1Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). ERK is activated in response to a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and mitogens. The ERK signaling pathways stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinases are well understood (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). JNK/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 MAPK are stimulated by cellular stresses such as heat shock, osmotic shock, and UV irradiation and by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 (3Kyriakis J.M.

The α-subunit of Gq/11(Gαq/11) activates phospholipase Cβ, which catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to form inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released into the cytoplasm mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC) (10Berridge M.J.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 environment. HEK-293 cells on 60-mm dishes were transfected with each plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 30 μg/60-mm dish with empty vector (pCMV5). The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and the cells were starved in the serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 24 h and were harvested. To measure JNK and p38 MAPK activities, the cells were transfected with pSRα-HA-JNK1 (5 μg) or pCMV5-FLAG-p38 MAPK (3 μg) together with pCMV5-Gα11 (10 μg) and the indicated expression plasmid. The transfected cells were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) 48 h after transfection. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5; 0.2 μg) or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2; 0.2 μg) and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preabsorbed with rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody (1 μg). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with reaction buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate). The washed precipitates were incubated in 30 μl of reaction buffer A containing 1.5 μg of affinity-purified GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) for JNK assay or 1 μg of affinity-purified GST-ATF2 (amino acids 1–96) for p38 MAPK assay, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min (for JNK assay) or 15 min (for p38 MAPK assay). The reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 30 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The boiled samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity incorporated into GST-c-Jun or GST-ATF2 was measured by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS2000) and detected by autoradiography. Src family kinase assay was performed as described previously (29Osherov N. Levitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were transfected with pCMV5-Gα11 (10 μg). The transfected cells were harvested and lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A after 48 h. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants containing 250 μg of protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.2 μg of anti-Src family kinase antibody (SRC2), which recognizes the C-terminal sequence conserved among Src, Yes, and Fyn, and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with reaction buffer B (40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate). Kinase reactions were carried out in 30 μl of reaction buffer B containing 4 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 22 °C for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. The boiled samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity incorporated into the enolase was measured by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS2000) and detected by autoradiography. The transfected cells were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants containing 350 μg of protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) (10 μg) and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B preabsorbed with rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody (20 μg). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with reaction buffer A. The precipitated proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The boiled samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for PY20 or using blocking solution (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% NaN3, and 5% nonfat dried milk) for other specific antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). We previously reported that a constitutively activated mutant of Gα11(Gα11 Q209L) stimulates p38 MAPK activity in HEK-293 cells (18Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether Gα11 Q209L can also stimulate JNK activity in the same cells. The cells were transfected with wild-type Gα11 or Gα11Q209L together with HA epitope-tagged JNK1. HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the transfected cell lysate with anti-HA antibody, and the JNK1 activity was assessed by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79). Wild-type Gα11 did not significantly enhance the JNK1 activity, whereas Gα11Q209L increased the JNK1 activity by 7–8-fold in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1 A). Using FLAG epitope-tagged p38 MAPK and GST-ATF2, an ∼4-fold stimulation of p38 MAPK by Gα11 Q209L was also observed (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblot analysis indicated that HA-JNK1 and FLAG-p38 MAPK were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells. We next examined the signaling pathways from Gαq/11 to JNK and p38 MAPK activation in HEK-293 cells. It is known that Gαq/11 activates phospholipase Cβ to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and thereby generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released into the cytoplasm mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores, whereas diacylglycerol activates some PKC isoforms (10Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PKC participates in the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation by Gα11Q209L. In HEK-293 cells, PMA caused an ∼2-fold increase in JNK1 and p38 MAPK activities (Fig. 2 A). The PMA-stimulated JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation was prevented by a 24-h pretreatment with PMA. In contrast, the prolonged PMA treatment did not diminish the anisomycin-induced activation of both kinases (data not shown). The cells transfected with Gα11 Q209L were treated with PMA for 24 h, and the effect of PKC inactivation on JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation was examined. The Gα11Q209L-stimulated activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK was partially inhibited by the prolonged PMA treatment (Fig. 2 B). In addition, a PKC inhibitor (calphostin C) also blocked the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that PKC may be involved in part in the activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK by Gα11 Q209L. The expression of Gα11, HA-JNK1, or FLAG-p38 MAPK was not affected by treatment with PMA or calphostin C. Carbachol increased JNK1 and p38 MAPK activities by 3-fold in HEK-293 cells expressing Gq/11-coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and calphostin C also reduced the activation by 50%. To explore the role of Ca2+ in JNK and p38 MAPK activation in HEK-293 cells, the cells were stimulated with A23187 or thapsigargin, which increases the intracellular Ca2+concentration. Activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK by A23187 or thapsigargin was observed to a small extent (2-fold) (data not shown). Recently, it has been shown that Src family kinase and Ras contribute to ERK1/2 activation by Gq/11-coupled α1B-adrenergic receptor in HEK-293 cells (30Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To determine whether protein tyrosine kinase and Ras are implicated in the Gαq/11-mediated signaling pathways leading to JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation, we examined the effects of a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PP2) (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), Csk, and dominant-negative Ras(S17N) on the Gα11 Q209L-stimulated JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation. The activation of both kinases by Gα11 Q209L was markedly attenuated by PP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar inhibitory effects of another tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PP1) (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) and PP2 were observed in the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation by m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (Fig. 3, C and D). Western blots analysis indicated that the PP1 and PP2 treatment did not affect the expression of Gα11, HA-JNK1, and FLAG-p38 MAPK. Csk is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that inactivates Src family kinases (28Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Csk significantly blocked the Gα11 Q209L-stimulated JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 3 E). Furthermore, the expression of v-Src effectively stimulated the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activities in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3 F). In contrast, Ras(S17N) failed to inhibit the Gα11 Q209L-induced JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation in the cells (Fig. 4). These data suggest that Src family kinases, but not Ras, are involved in the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation by Gαq/11. Therefore, we tested whether Gα11 stimulates Src family kinase activity in HEK-293 cells. The cells were transfected with wild-type Gα11 or Gα11 Q209L, and endogenous Src family kinases were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src family kinase antibody (SRC2), which recognizes the C-terminal sequence conserved among Src, Yes, and Fyn. Src family kinase activity was assessed by phosphorylation of acid-denatured enolase. As shown in Fig. 5, Gα11 Q209L stimulated an ∼2-fold increase in Src family kinase activity over the basal level. Next, we investigated whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular proteins was induced by the expression of the activated mutant of Gα11 in HEK-293 cells. Lysates of the cells transfected with wild-type Gα11 or Gα11Q209L were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with PY20. The expression of Gα11 Q209L promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of several prominent bands with apparent molecular masses of 100, 105, and 120–130 kDa (Fig. 6 A). A similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when Gq/11-coupled m1 muscarinic receptor-expressed cells were stimulated by carbachol (data not shown). Some of the protein tyrosine phosphorylation enhanced by Gα11 Q209L were reduced by treatment with PP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of a 100-kDa protein was completely abolished by 10 μm PP2, and that of 120–130-kDa proteins was strongly inhibited by 50 μmPP2. In contrast, PP2 had a very weak effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 105-kDa protein. We previously reported that both Gα11 Q209L and Gβ1γ2 stimulate p38 MAPK activity and that the p38 MAPK activation by m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is mediated by both Gαq/11 and Gβγ in HEK-293 cells (18Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that Gβγ effectively stimulates JNK1 activity in the cells (31Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7602-7607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further found that Gα11 Q209L as well as Gβγ can activate not only p38 MAPK, but also JNK1 in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1). Although two reports (13Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) are consistent with our observation that Gα11Q209L stimulates the JNK1 activity, other groups (32Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have reported that a constitutively activated mutant of Gαq fails to stimulate the JNK1 activity in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells. The discrepancy may be due to the difference of the expression level of constitutively activated Gαq or the experimental conditions. It has been recently reported that Btk (Bruton'styrosine kinase) is necessary for p38 MAPK activation by m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in DT40 cells (19Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathways linking Gαq/11with JNK and p38 MAPK activation remain largely unknown. As shown in Fig. 2, Gα11 Q209L-stimulated JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation was partially inhibited by prolonged PMA treatment and calphostin C. These results suggest that a phorbol ester-sensitive PKC may be involved in part in the Gαq/11-induced JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation. It has been shown that PKC can activate MEKK1in vivo (34Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7586-7594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MEKK1 was originally identified as a MAPK kinase kinase that has the ability to activate ERK1/2 (35Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), but recent findings indicated that MEKK1 functions as an activator of the JNK pathway (36Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 37Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C.A. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Although MEKK1 is not directly phosphorylated by PKC, MEKK1 activity is stimulated by PMA treatment in COS cells (34Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7586-7594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, Gαq/11 may regulate the MEKK1-JNK pathway through a PKC-dependent mechanism. In addition to MEKK1, other MAPK kinase kinases such as MEKK2–4 (38Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 39Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), TAK1 (40Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), and ASK1 (41Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) have been shown to be involved in JNK or p38 MAPK activation. Gαq/11 may also stimulate these MAPK kinase kinases activity through PKC-dependent and -independent signaling pathways and thereby induce JNK and p38 MAPK activation. It has been reported that PP1 and PP2 are selective inhibitors for Src family kinases (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). We found that the activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK by Gα11 Q209L was inhibited by PP2 (Fig. 3, Aand B). In HEK-293 cells, overexpression of TAK1 markedly stimulated JNK1 and p38 MAPK activities, and the activation by TAK1 was not inhibited by 50 μm PP2 (data not shown). This demonstrates that PP2 does not inhibit JNK1 and p38 MAPK themselves or their MAPK kinases. In addition, the overexpression of Csk attenuated the Gα11 Q209L-stimulated JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 3 E). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Gα11 Q209L can stimulate Src family kinase activity (Fig. 5). These results suggest that Src family kinases are implicated in Gαq/11-induced JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Since it has been reported that phorbol esters activate Src family kinases in Swiss 3T3 cells (42Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), Gαq/11 may partly stimulate Src family kinase activity through a phorbol ester-sensitive PKC. In the Gi- or Gq/11-coupled receptor-mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway, c-Src has been shown to act upstream of Ras and to stimulate ERK1/2 activity (30Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y.

Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is likely that Gαq/11 stimulates JNK1 and p38 MAPK activities in a Src family kinase-dependent and Ras-independent manner since Ras(S17N) did not inhibit Gα11 Q209L-induced JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 4). Recently, several reports showed that a calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2/cell adhesion kinase β/related adhesion, focal tyrosine kinase/calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (PYK2/CAKβ/RAFTK/CADTK) (45Lev S.

The possibility that Gαq/11 may stimulate JNK and p38 MAPK activities through PYK2/CAKβ/RAFTK/CADTK remains to be proved. We found the Gα11 Q209L-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-, 105-, and 120–130-kDa proteins in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 6 A). In addition, these proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the stimulation of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-expressed cells (data not shown). Since Gα11 stimulated Src family kinase activity and the Src family kinase inhibitor attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation, it is likely that these proteins are Src family kinase substrates. Many Src family kinase substrates have been reported, and they are involved not only in mitogenic signaling pathways, but also in cytoskeletal organization, cell-matrix interaction, cell-cell interaction, and cell-cell communication (50Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expect that Gαq/11 may regulate the focal adhesion proteins and the cytoskeletal proteins as well as JNK and p38 MAPK through Src family kinases. In summary, we have demonstrated that Gαq/11 can stimulate both JNK and p38 MAPK activities and that PKC and Src family kinase contribute to the activation by Gαq/11 in HEK-293 cells. We previously reported that Gβγ, as well as Gαq/11, stimulates JNK and p38 MAPK activities (18Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol.

The signaling pathways from Gβγ to JNK and p38 MAPK and the regulatory mechanism of Src family kinase activation by Gαq/11 remain to be clarified. We thank Dr. A.

The structure of the central EH domain of Eps15 has been solved by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fold consists of a pair of EF hand motifs, the second of which binds tightly to calcium. The NPF peptide is bound in a hydrophobic pocket between two α helices, and binding is mediated by a critical aromatic interaction as revealed by structure-based mutagenesis. The fold is predicted to be highly conserved among 30 identified EH domains and provides a structural basis for defining EH-mediated events in protein trafficking and growth factor signaling."

These measurements can be related to the identity and to the detailed shapes of the dissociating pathways, thus demonstrating that it is possible to probe repulsive states by spectroscopic means."
https://openalex.org/W2067232669,"Protein kinase Cμ (PKCμ), also named protein kinase D, is an unusual member of the PKC family that has a putative transmembrane domain and pleckstrin homology domain. This enzyme has a substrate specificity distinct from other PKC isoforms (Nishikawa, K., Toker, A., Johannes, F. J., Songyang, Z., and Cantley, L. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 952–960), and its mechanism of regulation is not yet clear. Here we show that PKCμ forms a complex in vivo with a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase. A region of PKCμ between the amino-terminal transmembrane domain and the pleckstrin homology domain is shown to be involved in the association with the lipid kinases. Interestingly, a kinase-dead point mutant of PKCμ failed to associate with either lipid kinase activity, indicating that autophosphorylation may be required to expose the lipid kinase interaction domain. Furthermore, the subcellular distribution of the PKCμ-associated lipid kinases to the particulate fraction depends on the presence of the amino-terminal region of PKCμ including the predicted transmembrane region. These results suggest a novel model in which the non-catalytic region of PKCμ acts as a scaffold for assembly of enzymes involved in phosphoinositide synthesis at specific membrane locations.

Protein kinase C (PKC)1family members play crucial roles in the signal transduction of a variety of extracellular stimuli, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors (1Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has demonstrated the presence of at least three groups, conventional PKC (cPKC) comprising α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms (activated by calcium, acidic phospholipid, and diacylglycerol (DAG)), novel PKCs (nPKC) comprising δ, ε, η, and θ (activated by DAG and acidic phospholipid but insensitive to calcium), atypical PKCs ι/λ and ζ (mechanism of regulation not clear) (1Hug H.

PKCμ differs in some structural features from other PKC isozymes in that PKCμ contains a putative transmembrane domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in its amino-terminal regulatory region providing a mechanism for constitutive association with the membrane (7Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Recent investigations using various approaches such as overexpression and down-regulation of specific isozymes indicate that each PKC isozyme plays a unique role in signal transduction processes (1Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 5Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). It is highly likely that the distinct functions of these isozymes are a consequence of isozyme-specific substrates and/or interacting proteins. However, information about the substrate specificities of each PKC family member has been quite limited. Recently, we determined optimal substrate motifs for all classes of PKC isozymes using an oriented peptide library technique and found that each PKC isozyme has a unique optimal substrate sequence (12Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKCμ has very different substrate specificities from other isozymes in that PKCμ showed extreme selectivity for peptides with Leu at position −5 amino-terminal of the phosphorylated Ser. This finding suggested that PKCμ is involved in a unique signaling pathway distinct from those mediated by other PKC family members. PKCμ/PKD was recently shown to be activated by mitogenic regulatory peptides and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by a pathway that requires cPKC or nPKC activation upstream (13Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, PKCμ is shown to regulate signaling via Syk and phospholipase Cγ1 (14Sidorenko S.P. Law C.L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, substrate proteins or interacting proteins of PKCμ in intact cells are poorly understood. Of interest, recent data indicate that PKCμ is located in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in basal transport processes (15Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Lipid kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-K), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PtdIns 4-K), and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns-4P 5-K), have also been implicated in membrane trafficking (16Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). One of the PtdIns 4-K isozymes, PtdIns 4-Kβ, is concentrated in the Golgi apparatus (17Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The yeast VPS34 gene product, Vps34p, which is a PtdIns-specific 3-kinase, is required for the efficient sorting and delivery of proteins from the Golgi to the vacuole (18Stack J.H. DeWald D.B. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Vps34p exists as a complex with Vps15p, a 160-kDa Ser/Thr protein kinase, which recruits Vps34p to the membrane of the Golgi complex and enhances Vps34p PtdIns 3-kinase activity (19Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A human homologue of Vps34p has recently been characterized as part of a complex with a human homologue of Vps15p, an adaptor protein called p150 (20Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this complex also has a protein kinase activity, and the association of Vps34p with p150 increases the PtdIns 3-kinase activity (21Panaretou C. Domin J. Cockcroft S. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate the possibility of the specific interaction of PKCμ and lipid kinases. In this study we found that PKCμ associates with at least two lipid kinases, a type II PtdIns 4-K and type I PtdIns-4-P 5-K, in an isozyme-specific manner. Analysis using various deletion mutants of PKCμ suggest that these two lipid kinases effectively bind to PKCμ through its amino-terminal region and that the protein kinase activity of PKCμ is essential to this association. These results suggest that PKCμ plays a role in assembly of specific phosphatidylinositol-phosphorylating enzymes at the membrane. Isozyme-selective antipeptide antibodies for PKCα, -ε, and -μ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Two anti-PKCμ antibodies were used as follows: one raised against amino acids 6–25 mapping at the amino terminus of PKCμ (α-μ-N) and one against amino acids 893–912 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of PKCμ (α-μ-C). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. LipofectAMINE reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. P81 phosphocellulose paper was purchased from Whatman. [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Liquiscint was purchased from National Diagnostics. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Synthetic peptides based on the predicted optimal substrates of PKCα (RRRRRKGSFRRKK), PKC-βI (FKLKRKGSFKKFA), and PKC-μ (AALVRQMSVAFFFK) were prepared as described previously (12Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Purified PtdIns 3-K was prepared from rat liver as described previously (22Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKCε construct was prepared as described previously (6Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG M2-tagged PKCζ construct was provided by Dr. Matthew Coghlan and Dr. Margaret Chou. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the cysteine-rich region (amino acids 34–290) of PKCμ named GST-CYS and a GST fusion of the pleckstrin homology domain (amino acids 380–545) named GST-PH were expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (7Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delta1–79 PKCμ mutant was constructed by digesting pBpl4 (7Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with ApaI and NsiI. Overhanging 5′- and 3′-ends were filled with the Klenow enzyme and ligated in the BamHI/blunt site of pSV40, a pCDNA3-derived vector. The delta 1–340 mutant was constructed by cutting the delta 1–79/pSV construct with HindIII, isolation of the 800-base pair HindIII fragment followed by religating of the vector/PKCμ portion. Expression of that construct results in the translation initiation at Met-341. The expression of both deletion mutants was verified by Western blot analysis using antipeptide antibodies for PKCμ (epitope corresponding to amino acids 893–912 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of PKCμ). A kinase-deficient mutant of PKCμ, K612W, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the in vitro mutagenesis kit and was subcloned into pcDNA3. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum using 100-mm plastic dishes. Exponentially growing COS-7 cells were transfected with the various plasmids using LipofectAMINE reagents, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For PDGF stimulation experiments, subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% fetal calf serum for 24 h, and stimulated with the indicated concentration of PDGF for 5 min. Cultured cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). PKCs were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h with isozyme-specific antibodies. The immune complexes were recovered using protein A or G (for anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody) coupled to Sepharose. For subcellular fractionation studies, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer lacking detergent. The cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated by 105,000 × g centrifugation as described previously (23Nishikawa K. Yamamoto S. Otsuka C. Kato R. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 757-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PKCμ was then immunoprecipitated from each fraction as above. COS-7 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer. Crude cell extract was clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min). GST or GST-fused proteins (3 μg of each) were incubated with the cell lysate at 4 °C for 2 h with constant rocking. The beads were washed twice with 1-ml volume of ice-cold PBS, twice with 1-ml volume of ice-cold washing buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m LiCl), and twice with 1-ml volume of TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Lipid kinase assays were then performed on the beads as described below. Western blot analysis was done as reported previously (24Nishikawa K. Yamamoto S. Nagumo H. Ishihara M. Murayama N. Kato R. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 20 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min. This solution was subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Isozyme-specific anti-PKC antibodies were used as the primary antibody. Anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody. The membranes were finally visualized by chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (NEN Life Science Products). PKC activity was assayed in vitroessentially as described previously using the standard PKC vesicle assay (25Ogita K. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 100 μm ATP with [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 μg/ml PS, 10 μmDAG, 200 μm CaCl2 (for PKCα), 0.5 mm EGTA (for PKCε, ζ and μ), and the indicated amount of synthetic substrate peptide. Reactions were started by addition of immunoprecipitated PKC and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Reaction mixtures were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and washed 4 times in 500 ml of 1% phosphoric acid. Incorporation of32P was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For each experimental condition, values for control reactions lacking substrate peptide were subtracted as blanks. Autophosphorylation of PKCμ was carried out essentially as described above, but no substrate was added. Proteins of the reaction mixture were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Lipid kinase assays were performed as described previously with a slight modification (26Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 μmATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated lipids, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence (for PtdIns 4-K and PtdIns-4-P 5-K assay) or absence (for PtdIns 3-K assay) of 0.3% Triton X-100. Assays were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and then stopped with 25 μl of 5 n hydrochloric acid. The lipid was extracted with 160 μl of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol. The organic layer was collected, subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica gel 60 plate, and developed with 1-propanol/2 macetic acid (65:35 by volume). Phosphoinositides were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a molecular imager (Bio-Rad). The lipid products on the TLC plate were collected, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC as described in detail elsewhere (27Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 155-162Google Scholar). Standards were made from tritiated PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 (NEN Life Science Products), which were deacylated and included with the32P-labeled product in the HPLC run. PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-5-P standards were made as described previously (28Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). To examine whether PKCμ associates with lipid kinases, phosphoinositide kinase activities were measured in immunoprecipitates of PKCμ. A PKCμ expression vector or control vector were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKCμ-specific antibody raised against the amino terminus of PKCμ. The resultant immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blot analysis and in vitro protein kinase assay to verify the expression of PKCμ. The immunocomplex obtained from PKCμ-transfected COS-7 cells contained a 110-kDa protein that immunoblotted with anti-PKCμ antibody (Fig. 1 A). This is the expected migration position for PKCμ (7Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 110-kDa protein was not detected in immunoprecipitates from non-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A). Three synthetic peptides, α, βI, and μ peptide, were used as substrates for protein kinase assays. These peptides are based on the optimal substrate motifs of PKCα, -βI, and -μ, respectively (12Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The immunocomplex obtained from PKCμ-transfected COS-7 cells phosphorylated βI and μ peptides equally but not the α peptide (Fig. 1 B). The immunocomplex obtained from control vector-transfected cells showed no significant protein kinase activity (Fig. 1 B). These results are consistent with our previous finding that PKCμ preferentially phosphorylates the βI and μ peptides compared with the α peptide (12Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These results confirm the overexpression of functional PKCμ in COS-7 cells. These immunocomplexes were subjected to a lipid kinase assay using crude brain phosphoinositides (CBP) as lipid substrates in the presence or absence of 0.3% of Triton X-100. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the PKCμ immunoprecipitate contained activity that phosphorylated lipids to produce products that migrate on thin layer chromatography in the region of PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 standards. This activity was enhanced in the presence of Triton X-100. Since Triton X-100 is known to inhibit PtdIns 3-kinase activity (29Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), these results argue against PtdIns 3-kinase being responsible for the phosphorylation detected. To characterize further the lipid kinase(s) associated with PKCμ, the lipid products obtained from the experiment in Fig. 1 C were recovered from TLC, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the major products were identified as PtdIns 4-P and PtdIns-4,5- P2 based on comigration with 3H-labeled glycero-phosphorylinositol-4-P (gPI-4-P) and 3H-labeled glycero-phosphorylinositol-4,5-P2 (gPI-4,5-P2). This result suggests that at least two lipid kinases, PtdIns 4-kinase (PtdIns 4-K) and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase (PtdIns-4-P 5-K), may associate with PKCμ. To confirm this possibility, the same experiments were performed using PtdIns or PtdIns-4-P as substrates. Phosphatidylserine (PS) was added as a lipid carrier, and in some experiments, phosphatidic acid (PA) was added to the PtdIns-4-P (see below). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, when PtdIns was added, PtdIns-4-P was produced; and when PtdIns-4-P was added, PtdIns-4,5-P2 was produced. These products could be separated from other phosphoinositides such as PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-5-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,5-P2. Since commercial PtdIns-4-P is contaminated with PtdIns-5-P, we investigated synthetic PtdIns-4-P and synthetic PtdIns-5-P as substrate and found that PtdIns-4-P was the preferred substrate (not shown). We checked the possibility that PtdIns 4-K and PtdIns-4-P 5-K association is a common property of PKC family members. For this purpose, cPKCα, nPKCε, and atypical PKCζ were used, each of which is classified into a different subfamily of PKCs from PKCμ. The expression vectors of PKCε, -ζ, or -μ were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and the enzymes were immunoprecipitated with isozyme-specific antibody. Endogenous PKCα was investigated since this enzyme is highly expressed in COS-7 cells. The expression of each isozyme was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A) and protein kinase assays of immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Each immunocomplex was also subjected to PtdIns 4-K (Fig. 3 B) and PtdIns-4-P 5-K (Fig. 3 C) assays. Both lipid kinase activities were normalized to the βI peptide phosphorylating activity, because βI peptide is a relatively good substrate for all the PKC isozymes as described previously (12Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Significant PtdIns 4-K activity was detected in the PKCμ immunoprecipitate, whereas less activity was detected in the PKCα immunoprecipitate, and no PtdIns 4-K activity was detected in PKCε and PKCζ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, PtdIns-4-P 5-K activity was only detected in the PKCμ immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that PtdIns 4-K and PtdIns-4-P 5-K association is not a general property of PKC family members. Two PKCμ deletion mutants, the delta 1–79 and delta 1–340, were used to determine the region of PKCμ involved in the association of the lipid kinases. These mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCμ antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of PKCμ. The expression of these mutants was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B), by protein kinase activity (Fig. 4 C), and by autophosphorylation (Fig. 4 D) in immunoprecipitates. The delta 1–79 mutant was detected as two bands on Western blot. The upper band of the doublet may result from hyperphosphorylation of the delta 1–79; consistent with this idea, under autophosphorylation conditions more radioactivity is detected in the upper band (Fig. 4 D). Consistent with the absence of region 1–79, neither band was blotted with the antibody against the amino terminus of PKCμ (not shown). The autophosphorylation level of the delta 1–340 mutant was reduced by 75% compared with that of wild type PKCμ and the delta 1–79 mutant. Since the delta 1–340 mutant has similar peptide kinase activity to wild type PKCμ (Fig. 4 C), these results suggest that the major autophosphorylation site might be present in the region between residues 79 and 340. The immunocomplexes were subjected to PtdIns 4-K (Fig. 4 D) and PtdIns-4-P 5-K (Fig. 4 E) assays. Both lipid kinase activities associating with the delta 1–340 mutant were reduced by 80% compared with activities associated with wild type PKCμ and the delta 1–79 mutant. These results indicate that the region between residues 79 and 340 of PKCμ, which contains cysteine rich domain I and II, is involved in the association with both lipid kinases. In order to confirm the above observations and further characterize these lipid kinases, the GST-fused amino-terminal region of PKCμ coding for amino acids 34–290 (GST-CYS domain), GST-fused pleckstrin homology domain coding for amino acids 380–545 (GST-PH domain), or GST only were incubated with COS-7 lysate and assayed for PtdIns 4-K and PtdIns-4-P 5-K activities. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the GST-CYS domain associated with a PtdIns kinase activity while very little activity associated with GST alone or the GST-PH domain. This PtdIns kinase activity was inhibited by adenosine in a dose-dependent manner (85% by 500 μm adenosine) (Fig. 5 C) but was not inhibited by 100 nm wortmannin which caused 100% inhibition of PtdIns 3-K activity (Fig. 5 D). This result indicates that this PtdIns kinase has properties similar to type II PtdIns 4-K which is markedly stimulated by detergent and inhibited by adenosine (30Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similar characteristics were obtained using wild type PKCμ-associated PtdIns kinase (data not shown). The GST-CYS domain also bound PtdIns-4-P 5-K activity, whereas the GST-PH domain and GST alone had very little associated activity (Fig. 5 E). In agreement with results in Fig. 1 C, the GST-CYS domain-associated PtdIns-4-P 5-K activity was activated by phosphatidic acid, consistent with this being a type I PtdIns-4-P 5-K (31Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these results suggest that PKCμ associates with a type II PtdIns 4-K and a type I PtdIns-4-P 5-K through its amino-terminal region (amino acids 80–290). To determine whether the protein kinase activity of PKCμ is required for the association with the lipid kinases, a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCμ, K612W mutant, was transfected into COS-7 cells. The immunoprecipitated K612W mutant showed neither the βI peptide kinase activity nor autophosphorylation activity compared with those of wild type PKCμ (Fig. 6, B and C). The immunoprecipitates of wild type PKCμ and the K612W mutant were subjected to lipid kinase assays using crude brain phosphoinositides as lipid substrates. As shown in Fig. 6 D, no lipid kinase activity was observed in the immunoprecipitate of the K612W mutant, whereas marked productions of both PtdIns-P and PtdIns-P2were observed in the immunoprecipitate of wild type PKCμ, suggesting that protein kinase activity of PKCμ is required for the association of PKCμ with the lipid kinases. PKD, a mouse homologue of PKCμ, has been shown to be activated by various mitogenic regulatory peptides and PDGF through another PKC isozyme-dependent signal transduction pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells (13Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The effect of PDGF on PKCμ protein kinase activity and on the lipid kinase activities was investigated using Swiss 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, A and C, immunoprecipitates of endogenous PKCμ from Swiss 3T3 cells contained both PtdIns 4-K and PtdIns-4-P 5-K activities. PDGF caused marked activation of PKCμ protein kinase activity (3- and 8-fold for 3 and 16 ng/ml of PDGF, respectively) (Fig. 7 B). However, PDGF did not affect the lipid kinase activities associated with PKCμ (Fig. 7 C). Since PDGF causes the enhanced phosphorylation of PKCμ not by activation of autophosphorylation but by"

We investigated preconditioning in isolated neonatal rat cardiocytes by expressing constitutively active isotypes of PKC. Observations at differing durations of simulated ischemia suggested β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity reflected viability within transfected myocytes. Preconditioning with 90 min of ischemia significantly increased β-gal activity and myocyte survival after 6 h of ischemia; an effect abolished by PKC inhibitors. After co-transfection with plasmids encoding β-gal and either constitutively active mutants of PKC-δ, PKC-α, wild type PKC-δ, or empty vector, cardiocytes were subjected to 6 h of ischemia. Only PKC-δ, rendered constitutively active by a limited deletion within the pseudosubstrate domain, consistently increased resistance to simulated ischemia (β-gal activity was 85.6 ± 11.9% versus 53.7 ± 6.5% (p ≤ 0.01) and dead myocytes 46.8 ± 3.4%versus 68.7 ± 2.8% (p ≤ 0.01)). Since transfection was apparent in only 5–12% of cells, the results suggested a protective bystander effect that was confirmed by co-culture of transfected myocytes with untransfected myocytes. In neonatal cardiocytes expression of active PKC-δ increases resistance to simulated ischemia.

Ischemic preconditioning describes the resistance to myocardial infarction that follows short, sublethal episodes of ischemia (1Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7073) Google Scholar). The protection associated with ischemic preconditioning is profound but, unfortunately, short lived (2Van Winkle D.M. Thornton J. Downey J.M. Coron. Artery Dis. 1991; 2: 613-619Google Scholar) and prone to tachyphylaxis (3Cohen M.V. Yang X.M. Downey J.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These features have cast doubts on the eventual clinical utility of this powerful protective phenomenon (4Przyklenk K. Kloner R.A. Br. Heart J. 1995; 74: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For this and other reasons intense research activities and interests have focused upon the trigger(s), mediator(s), and final effector(s) of this phenomenon. The eventual aim is specific manipulation of the signaling pathway to achieve durable protection without an ischemic trigger (5Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 6Abstract Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The most popular hypothesis first proposed by Cohen and Downey (5Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 6Abstract Scopus (80) Google Scholar) views the pathway leading to preconditioning as follows. The brief ischemic trigger causes the release of endogenous mediators such as adenosine that bind in a retaliatory fashion to cognate heptahelical transmembrane receptors (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Wall T.M. Sheehy R. Hartman J.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 681-689PubMed Google Scholar). When bound to agonist, these receptors activate phospholipase C(β) through a GqαGTP protein-mediated mechanism (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C, in turn, mediates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate producing the dual second messengers of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (5Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 6Abstract Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol binds to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C causing activation (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Protection then occurs by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues within a specific amino acid consensus sequence on a target protein (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that this target protein may be the ATP-sensitive potassium channel KATP (8Liu Y. Gao W.D. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Light P.E. Sabir A.A. Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. French R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although very attractive, the Downey hypothesis has come under attack. There is general agreement that adenosine, or a similar heptahelical transmembrane receptor agonist, is the trigger for preconditioning. However, the role of PKC1 as the mediator of preconditioning is far more controversial (4Przyklenk K. Kloner R.A. Br. Heart J. 1995; 74: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Light P.E. Sabir A.A. Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. French R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Vahlhaus C. Schulz R. Post H. Onallah R. Heusch G. Circ.

This is in part related to the complexities of PKC biology and pharmacology. Protein kinase C describes an ever expanding family of enzymes of related structure and function (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These proteins have a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain linked through a hinged region to an amino-terminal regulatory domain. Within the regulatory domain lies a pseudosubstrate subdomain that binds to the catalytic site preventing substrate phosphorylation by steric interference (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 12Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). On activation a conformational change occurs within the enzyme to expose the catalytic site and allow substrate binding. Despite increasing knowledge of how the functional domains interact to cause and regulate PKC activity, the measurement and pharmacological manipulation of this family of enzymes remain complex with multiple pitfalls (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 13Brooks G. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 627-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activators may have a bimodal effect first activating and then down-regulating PKC and its activity, whereas inhibitors may interfere with other kinase pathways. Unfortunately, the most specific inhibitors, peptide fragments of pseudosubstrate domains, are difficult to use in vivo and require sarcolemmal permeabilization to use in vitro (14Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The studies of PKC in preconditioning thus far have used pharmacological manipulation of PKC activity to mimic or block preconditioning and measurement of activity or translocation to infer involvement, but seldom both in a single study (13Brooks G. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 627-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusions of these studies are difficult to reconcile because some investigators (13Brooks G. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 627-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ.

Res. 1995; 76: 73-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report PKC activation is both a sufficient and necessary component of the ischemic preconditioning pathway, and others (10Vahlhaus C. Schulz R. Post H. Onallah R. Heusch G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Li Y. Kloner R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H426-H431PubMed Google Scholar,13Brooks G. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 627-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest there is no involvement. The reason for this dichotomy is thought to lie in the complexities and uncertainties of pharmacological manipulation of the PKC pathway (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 12Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 13Brooks G. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 627-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This issue is of critical importance if preconditioning is to be mimicked and exploited by specific manipulation of its signaling pathway. Recently PKC isotypes have become available that have been rendered constitutively active by limited amino-terminal deletions within the pseudosubstrate domain (17Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Decock J.B.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These alterations are thought to prevent, or decrease the probability of, interactions with the catalytic site and thus reduce the potential for steric interference of substrate phosphorylation (6Sugden P.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cells have been transfected with expression plasmids encoding these mutationally active PKC isotypes to specifically interrogate the PKC pathway and determine the cross-talk between this and other possible parallel signal transduction pathways (17Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, downstream events are preserved because there is transcriptional activation of an atrial naturetic factor promoter/reporter construct in cardiac myocytes expressing constitutively active PKC isotypes (18Decock J.B.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an observation that suggests they, like more physiological stimuli, are capable of triggering a hypertrophic response (18Decock J.B.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our aim was to use these mutant constitutively active PKC isotypes to investigate ischemic preconditioning. We have developed a system of simulated ischemia in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes that shares many features of ischemic preconditioning in vivo and is similar to a previously characterized model (19Webster K.A. Discher D.J. Bishopric H.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By using this system we demonstrate that β-gal can be used as a marker of viability in transfected myocytes exposed to simulated ischemia. By co-transfecting expression vectors for β-gal and mutant constitutively active PKC isotypes, we have examined resistance to simulated ischemia. We believe that this is the first report of the use of genetic manipulation to investigate preconditioning. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, medium 199 (M199), bovine serum albumin, horse serum, fetal calf serum (FCS), pancreatin, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). Collagenase was from Worthington. Trypan blue, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine were from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Corp (Little Chalfont, UK). HEPES and the neutral phospholipid dioleoyl l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Cationic amphiphile 3β[N-(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol) was synthesized as described previously (20Alton E.W.F.W. Middleton P.G. Caplen N.J. Smith S.N. Steel D.M. Munkonge F.M. Jeffery P.K. Geddes D.M. Hart S.L. Williamson R. Fasold K.I. Miller A.D. Dickinson P. Stevenson B.J. McLachlan G. Dorin J.R. Porteous D.J. Nat.

(Exeter, UK). Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Dako (High Wycombe, UK). Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were prepared from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (21Cumming D.V.E. Heads R.J.H. Watson A. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2343-2349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from neonatal rat ventricles were dispersed in a series of incubations at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered salt solution containing 0.6 mg/ml pancreatin and 0.5 mg/ml collagenase. The dispersed cells were preplated for at least 30 min to minimize fibroblast contamination, and the unattached cells were re-plated on 6-well gelatin-coated plates at a density of 1–1.5 million cells/well. Fibroblast contamination was less than 5%. The cardiac myocytes were cultured at 37 °C, in room air with 5% CO2 in 4:1, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:M199, supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FCS, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin for the first 24 h. Thereafter cells were maintained in an identical medium with a reduced serum concentration of 1% FCS. Under these conditions, in excess of 80% of cells beat spontaneously for the duration of the experiment. Experiments were performed after 1–3 days in culture. The high efficiency eukaryotic expression plasmid, pCAGGS, was used for all transfections (22Niwa H. Yamamura K.I. Miyazaki J.I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter with first intron upstream of a multiple cloning site. It has been shown previously that this heterologous promoter is transcriptionally active in cardiac myocytes (23Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCAGGS-β-gal was constructed from pBCH110 (Promega, St Albans, UK) by excising the β-gal gene between HindIII and BamHI sites and inserting into the vector pCAGGS at theBamHI site. The β-gal gene lacked sequences conferring nuclear localization. PKC constructs were subcloned into pCAGGS from plasmids provided by Dr. Peter Parker, Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London, UK. Three PKC isotypes were studied: 1) wild type PKC-δ; 2) PKC-δ with a limited deletion of the inhibitory pseudosubstrate subdomain (residues 151–160); and 3) PKC-α with a limited deletion of the inhibitory pseudosubstrate subdomain (residues 22–28). These mutant PKC isotypes have previously been shown to code for constitutively active functional proteins (17Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Decock J.B.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified by alkaline lysis of the bacterial host (DH5alpha) followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation. Cardiocytes at 60–70% confluency were transfected by incubation with complexes of DNA with DC-Chol/DOPE cationic liposomes. These liposomes were prepared in the following way. DC-Chol (12 μmol) and a chloroform solution of DOPE (8 μmol in 0.6 ml) were combined in dichloromethane (10 ml) under nitrogen and then diluted with sterile 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8. The two-phase system under nitrogen was sonicated for 3 min at ambient temperature. Organic solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting liposomes were sonicated for a further 3 min prior to use. The liposome-DNA complexes were prepared by mixing DNA (0.1% w/v) with liposome (0.1% w/v) in H2O at a ratio of 1:3 (w/w). The liposome-DNA complexes were allowed to stand at room temperature for 15–30 min before use. One ml of serum-free maintenance medium with 20–40 μl of DNA/liposome mixture was added per well of a 6-well plate. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in room air supplemented with 5% CO2 for 1 h. Thereafter maintenance medium containing 1% FCS was gently overlaid, and the cells were returned to the incubator. Cell extracts for gene activity were assayed 48–72 h after transfection. By using pCAGGS-β-gal as a reporter, transfection efficiency was consistently between 5 and 12%, staining with the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were washed three times with PBS before addition of 1 ml of ischemia buffer (118 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 2.5 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium·EDTA·2H2O, 20 mm sodium lactate, and 16 mm KCl, pH 6.2) and pre-gassed with 5% CO2, 95% argon. On addition of ischemia buffer spontaneous contraction within the monolayer ceased. The cells were then transferred to a purpose-built ischemia chamber and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% argon for up to 12 h. The O2 content of the atmosphere inside the chamber was <1% for the duration of the experiment as measured by an on-line oxygen meter (Griffin and George, Fife, UK). Neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared and cultured as described above either on standard 6-well plates or within a cell culture insert (Falcon, Oxford, UK). The inserts, designed to fit within the wells of a 6-well plate, were perforated with 1.0-μm pores allowing free communication of media between insert and well. The cells within the insert and the well were transfected and cultured apart and only combined immediately before simulated ischemia. To ensure that both cell monolayers were bathed in buffer, volumes had to be increased to 2 ml during simulated ischemia. After the cells had been subjected to simulated ischemia, remaining ischemia buffer was gently aspirated and saved for LDH determination, and cells were detached by washing in PBS with trypsin. Following centrifugation a small aliquot of cells was incubated in PBS with 0.4% trypan blue for a few seconds before placing in a hemocytometer for counting under phase contrast. Dead cells, permeable to trypan blue, were counted as a percentage of the total number of cells in at least 25 grids of the hemocytometer so that at least 200 cells were counted in total. Examination of the initial ischemia buffer revealed few detached cells. On opening the ischemia chamber (re-oxygenation) 200-μl samples of the ischemia buffer were gently collected for the determination of LDH. The following day a spectrophotometric LDH enzyme assay was performed with a Sigma assay kit (TOX-7). 48–72 h after transfection the cells were washed three times with PBS and harvested in 1 ml of hot electrophoresis sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol) and then boiled for an additional 5 min. The cell extracts were then centrifuged for 5 min to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration of the diluted supernatant was determined by the Pierce method (Pierce) before adding 0.003% bromphenol blue. The samples were then loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and after one-dimensional separation were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham, UK). Uniform protein loading was confirmed by Coomassie staining of identically loaded gels. The blots were probed sequentially with murine monoclonal antibodies specific for PKC-δ or PKC-α and a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody prior to detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Little Chalfont, UK). β-Galactosidase activity was determined in the cell lysates (lysis buffer, 100 mm KH2PO4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8) using a Galacto-LightTM assay kit (BL 330G, Insight Biotechnology Ltd, London, UK). A β-gal standard was used to show that light output within the experimental range was directly proportional to β-gal concentration. β-Gal activity, expressed per mg of protein, was measured in cells harvested post-simulated ischemia (see evaluation of cell viability) and expressed as a percentage of activity in wells, transfected with the same expression plasmid but lacking insert (empty vector), harvested in the same manner, and subjected to simultaneous simulated ischemia. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in homogenization buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and incubated with 0.5 ml of DEAE-cellulose (DE52) for 60 min at 4 °C with occasional gentle agitation. DE52 had been pre-equilibrated with 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and washed in buffer A at 4 °C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation, the lysate/DE52 slurry was loaded on a column. The column was then washed with 5 ml of buffer A and PKC eluted with 0.3m NaCl. The first 4 ml of eluate was collected for PKC determination (24Brooks G. Wilson R.E. Dooley T.P. Goss M.W. Hart I.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar). After concentrating the fractions using Centricon™ concentrators (Gelman Sciences, Northampton, UK), PKC activity was measured immediately or preserved in 50% glycerol and stored at −70 °C overnight for measurement the following day. PKC activity was determined using an Amersham kit (RPN-77). Measurement of enzyme activity was based on PKC-mediated transfer of the [γ-32P]ATP to a synthetic peptide homologous to the PKC-ε pseudosubstrate domain in the presence of cofactors (i.e. calcium acetate,l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). The method has been optimized to exhibit maximum PKC activity. All values are expressed as mean ±S.E. The cardiocytes within each well were used for three determinations, the mean of which was used as the value for that particular well. After each period of simulated ischemia, data were collected from no more than two wells for each experimental group. The “n” numbers under “Results” relate to the number of wells from which data were obtained. For each intervention mean values were pooled to allow statistical comparisons. Statistical comparisons between groups at a single time point were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and comparisons between the 2- and 12-h time points by two-way ANOVA. All post-hoc comparisons were by the Fischer protected least significant difference method (FPLSD). All analyses were performed using the Statview version 4.0 statistical package (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). A probability value ≤0.05 was considered significant. To mimic the changes in extracellular ions occurring during ischemia in vivo, we used a bicarbonate-based buffer at pH 6.2 with 20 mmlactate, 16 mm K+, and no metabolic substrate (O2 <1%), at a volume of 1 ml, just sufficient to wet the cellular monolayer. By using this technique we exposed neonatal cardiocytes to simulated ischemia of increasing duration. The rate and extent of ischemic injury were determined by an assessment of trypan blue permeability and LDH release. Fig. 1, panel A, shows that the percentage of dead cells (as assessed by trypan blue) increased in a time-dependent and reproducible manner. Similar results were obtained for LDH release (see Fig. 1, panel B). Our aim was to use this model to transfect a subpopulation of cells within the monolayer with genes encoding isotypes of PKC to determine sensitivity to simulated ischemia. However this would require a method of assessing viability in the subpopulation of cells taking up plasmid, expressing recombinant protein, and remaining attached post-ischemia. β-Gal is a cytoplasmic enzyme with a molecular mass of 43 kDa, less than that of other endogenous enzymes such as creatine kinase (81 kDa) and LDH (70 kDa) which are commonly used markers of cell viability. We therefore wished to examine if β-gal derived from a transfected plasmid could be used as an index of viability in the subpopulation of transfected cells. Fig. 1, panel C, shows that when β-gal activity, after different durations of simulated ischemia, is expressed as a percentage of activity prior to ischemia, there is a time-dependent attrition which is inversely related to trypan blue exclusion and supernatant LDH activity. Thus, after 8 h of simulated ischemia β-gal activity was reduced to 38.3 ± 4.6% of the control activity (p < 0.01versus control). Preconditioning with ischemia in vivo or simulated ischemia in vitro has been shown to delay necrosis/cell death in response to subsequent ischemia. We wished to investigate if similar protection occurred in our model. Cardiocytes were subjected to varying durations of simulated ischemia before returning cultures to maintenance medium in a standard incubator (room air supplemented with 5% CO2) for 30 min. After this recovery phase cultures were exposed once again to ischemia buffer in an atmosphere of 95% argon, 5% CO2 for periods of 6 h. These preliminary experiments demonstrated that 90 min of simulated ischemia was not a sufficiently severe stress to cause cell death but would consistently reduce injury after 6 h of simulated ischemia. To determine whether this pretreatment represented a delay in cell death, we repeated the time course, as described above, with and without preconditioning (see Fig. 2). 90 min of simulated ischemia consistently and significantly delayed cell death as measured by trypan blue exclusion. Moreover, when measured after 6 h of simulated ischemia in cells transfected with pCAGGS-β-gal, the residual β-gal activity in preconditioned cells was significantly greater than, and LDH leakage was significantly less than, that in paired non-preconditioned cells (see Table IA).Table IThe effect of preconditioning with and without PKC inhibitors on the viability of neonatal cardiocytes 6 h after simulated ischemiaCell deathLDH releaseβ-Galactosidase activity%%%A Control70.3 ± 2.1100100(n = 20)(n = 20)(n = 20) Preconditioning45.1 ± 2.584.6 ± 2.8111.5 ± 5.6(n = 20)(n = 20)(n = 20)B Control65.6 ± 5.4100100(n = 4)(n = 8)(n = 8) Preconditioning30.0 ± 3.893.2 ± 2.5118.1 ± 5.2(n = 8)(n = 8)(n = 8) Preconditioning + 10 μm chelerythrine64.3 ± 7.7118.6 ± 8.787.6 ± 5.1(n = 4)(n = 4)(n = 4) Preconditioning + 1 μm staurosporine64.3 ± 0.6109.7 ± 9.173.9 ± 12.9(n = 4)(n = 4)(n = 4)LDH release and β-galactosidase activity in the preconditioned cells were expressed as a percentage of the value in paired (non-preconditioned) controls.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), HGF is considered to be a mesenchymal-derived mediator in epithelial-mesenchymal (or -stromal) interactions during organogenesis and organ regeneration. Biologically active HGF is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of a 69-kDa α-chain and a 34-kDa β-chain (19Nakamura T. Nawa K. Ichihara A. Kaise N. Nishino T.

The α-chain contains the N-terminal hairpin domain and subsequently four homologous kringle domains, while the β-chain contains a serine protease-like domain (22Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M.

To address the specific function of each subunit in the HGF molecule, variously mutated variant HGFs were tested for biological activities and receptor binding. A small molecule consisting of the N-terminal hairpin domain, the first kringle domain (K1), and the second kringle domain (K2), designated HGF/NK2 exists as a naturally biosynthesized variant form, and HGF/NK2 can bind the c-Met/HGF receptor (23Chan A.M.-L.

On the other hand, the β-chain alone cannot bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor and has none of the biological activities of HGF (25Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M.

Nevertheless, deletion of the β-chain in HGF results in loss of biological activities of HGF, even though the α-chain alone can bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor (25Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9555-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previous studies clarified the specific function of the N-terminal half of the α-chain (HGF/NK2), as a receptor-binding motif, as well as a partial agonist in terms of motogenic activity. Thus, biological function of the β-chain remained to be specified. We recently obtained the antagonist for HGF, termed “HGF/NK4” (32Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). HGF/NK4 contains the N-terminal hairpin structure and four kringle domains. We have now obtained evidence which supports the proposal that the β-chain can bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor which is specifically occupied with HGF/NK4, and that this cooperative binding induces receptor tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met, leading to mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses. The α-chain of HGF can bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor, but the optimum activation of c-Met/HGF receptor for the transduction of multiple biological activities of HGF depends on the β-chain. Human recombinant HGF was purified from the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human HGF cDNA (22Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A.

Shimonishi M. Nishizawa T. Asami O. Hagiya M. Nakamura T. Shimizu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The purity of HGF exceed 98%, as determined by SDS-PAGE and protein staining. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY-20) was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA) and anti-c-Met polyclonal antibody (C-12) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase was obtained from TAKARA Co. Ltd. (Otsu, Japan). Monoclonal antibody against the α-chain of HGF was prepared as described elsewhere (34Yamada A. Matsumoto K. Iwanari H. Sekiguchi K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Nakamura T. Biomed. Res. 1995; 16: 105-114Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Human recombinant HGF was digested with pancreatic elastase (Sigma), and the digested material was applied onto μBondapak C4 reverse-phase HPLC column and adsorbed materials were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (32Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). HGF/β was further purified using a Hi-Trap heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala). The preparation of HGF/β was rechromatographed on C4 reverse-phase HPLC, as described above. The final preparation of HGF/β used in this study contained 0.003% (in molar ratio) of intact HGF, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (32Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis indicated that HGF/NK4 is composed of the N-terminal hairpin and subsequent four kringle domains, which corresponds to the α-chain deleted with C-terminal 16 amino acids, while HGF/β is composed of the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the α-chain and the entire β-chain, linked by a disulfide bridge between Cys487 and Cys604 (Fig. 1 A). HGF/NK2 was produced by transient expression in COS-7 cells, using the expression vector pCDM containing cDNA, which corresponds to the sequence of human HGF/NK2, as described elsewhere (23Chan A.M.-L. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Hirschfield D.W. Chedid M. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HGF/NK2 was purified from the serum-free conditioned medium using a Hi-Trap heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant HGF/NK2 showed an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa in SDS-PAGE and following Western immunoblotting, under reducing condition (not shown). SDS-PAGE was done using a 4–20% or 2–15% gradient gel, and proteins were visualized by silver staining (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka). MDCK (clone 3B) renal epithelial cells, a kind gift from Dr. R. Montesano (University of Geneva) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. HuCC-T1 human cholangiocarcinoma and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. For migration assay, MDCK cells were seeded on a 48-well plate at a density of 2.5 × 103 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, with or without test samples. The cells were cultured for 20 h, then photographed. For three-dimensional culture in collagen gels, MDCK cells were harvested using trypsin-EDTA solution, suspended in ice-cold 0.2% collagen solution (Nitta Gelatin, Tokyo) at a density of 104 cells/ml, and 500-μl aliquots were added to wells of a 16-mm width (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After the collagen solution gelled, 500 μl of culture medium containing HGF, HGF/NK4, and/or HGF/β were added. Culture medium was changed every 3 days. Mitogenic activity of HGF, HGF/NK4, HGF/β, or their combinations was measured using adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture, as described elsewhere (30Matsumoto K. Takehara T. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HGF, HGF/NK4, HGF/β, HGF/NK2, or their combinations were added to cultures of hepatocytes, the culture was run for 20 h, and then pulse-labeled with 0.3 μCi/ml125I-deoxyuridine for 6 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with trichloroacetic acid, then solubilized with 1 m NaOH. Radioactivity of125I-deoxyuridine incorporated into nuclei was measured using a γ-counter. HGF, HGF/NK4, and HGF/β were respectively radioiodinated by the chloramine-T method, as described elsewhere (32Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The competitive binding assay was performed by incubating 60 pm125I-HGF and various concentrations of unlabeled HGF, HGF/NK4, or HGF/β, simultaneously with 50 μg of plasma membranes from rat livers at 12 °C for 1 h, in 0.1 ml of binding buffer (Hanks' solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0). Membranes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended with 10 μl of binding buffer and transferred to fresh tubes.125I-HGF specifically bound to membranes was measured using a γ-counter. Concentration-dependent binding of radiolabeled ligand and Scatchard analysis were performed using HuCC-T1 cells, as described elsewhere (32Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured on a 24-well plate, and the cultures were washed once with the binding buffer and equilibrated in the same buffer for 30 min at 10 °C. Ice-cold binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of125I-HGF or 125I-HGF/β, with or without 100 times excess molar unlabeled HGF or HGF/β, was added, and the preparation was incubated at 12 °C for 1 h. Cultures were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer, and radiolabeled ligand bound to cells was measured. All binding experiments were done in quadruplicate. Subconfluent A549 cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 20 h. The cells were treated with HGF, HGF/NK4, and/or HGF/β, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, as described previously (32Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The resultant supernatant was preadsorbed with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was treated with anti-human c-Met antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated materials were washed with lysis buffer and solubilized with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody or anti-c-Met antibody. Proteins reacting with these antibodies were detected using ECL enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). HuCC-T1 cells cultured in a 90 mm dish were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer consisting of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated in the binding buffer for 30 min at 10 °C. The binding buffer was changed to fresh binding buffer, and the radiolabeled ligand was added. After 1 h of incubation at 10 °C, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) was added at the final concentration of 0.5 μm,and the cells were incubated 1 h at 4 °C. After cells had been washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lyzed and scraped into buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100. The cell suspension in a siliconized tube was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was preadsorbed with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was treated with rabbit anti-c-Met antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, then 7.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added. The preparation was centrifuged, and the precipitated material was washed four times with lysis buffer and solubilized in the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The solubilized proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, using 2–15% gradient gel, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. To determine whether HGF/NK4 and HGF/β can bind to the cell surface receptor, competitive binding analysis was carried out using 125I-HGF (Fig. 1 B). Liver plasma membranes were incubated in the presence of 125I-HGF alone, or 125I-HGF plus various concentrations of unlabeled HGF, HGF/NK4, or HGF/β. Addition of unlabeled HGF inhibited the specific binding of 125I-HGF to the plasma membranes, and 50% inhibition by unlabeled HGF was seen with 60 pm HGF; the dose being approximately equimolar to that of 125I-HGF. Addition of HGF/NK4 also inhibited the binding of 125I-HGF, and the inhibition by 50% was seen with 600 pm HGF/NK4; the concentration was 10-fold higher than that of HGF. In contrast, the addition of HGF/β did not inhibit the binding of125I-HGF, at least up to 30 nm, the maximal concentration tested here. Therefore, HGF/NK4 seems to bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor with a 10-fold lower affinity than that of the native HGF; however, HGF/β does not bind to the receptor. We next examined the mitogenic activity of HGF/NK4 and HGF/β, using adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture (Fig. 2 A). Addition of 100 pm HGF potently stimulated DNA synthesis to over 10-fold higher levels. In contrast, addition of HGF/β alone up to 30 nm had no apparent effect on DNA synthesis. This result is consistent with the finding that HGF/β alone cannot bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor. On the other hand, 1.5 nm HGF/NK4 alone had no evident effect on DNA synthesis, even though HGF/NK4 at this concentration seems to occupy most of the c-Met/HGF receptor. However, it is noteworthy that the addition of HGF/β in the presence of 1.5 nm HGF/NK4 dose-dependently induced mitogenic responses in hepatocytes, and the maximal stimulatory effect was seen at 30 nm HGF/β and was 50–60% of that of HGF. Previous studies showed that the two-kringle variant form, HGF/NK2 can bind to the c-Met/HGF receptor and has motogenic (enhancement of cell motility) but not mitogenic activity (23Chan A.M.-L.

We then asked whether the combination of HGF/NK2 and HGF/β would elicit mitogenic activity, as seen in the combination of HGF/NK4 and HGF/β (Fig. 2 B). Although HGF/NK4 plus HGF/β, as well as native HGF, stimulated DNA synthesis in hepatocytes, HGF/NK2 alone or 30 nm HGF/β plus HGF/NK2 did not stimulate DNA synthesis. When HGF was added to the monolayer culture of MDCK cells, HGF enhanced their motility and induced scattering of the cells (Fig. 3). Neither HGF/NK4 (1.5 nm) alone nor HGF/β (30 nm) alone induced scattering of the MDCK cells. However, when HGF/β was added to the culture in the presence of HGF/NK4, HGF/β dose-dependently induced scattering of the cells. The cell scattering seen with 1.5 nm HGF/NK4 plus 30 nmHGF/β was comparable to that seen with 100 pm HGF. Consistent with previous reports (23Chan A.M.-L. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Hirschfield D.W.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 83: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the addition of HGF/NK2 alone (3.3 nm) induced scattering of MDCK cells (not shown). On the other hand, Hartmann et al. (25Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) previously showed that the α-chain of HGF has weak motogenic activity. A discrepancy regarding the biological activity between HGF/NK4 and the α-chain may be attributable to the structural difference between HGF/NK4 and the α-chain; HGF/NK4 lacks C-terminal 16 amino acids of the α-chain (Fig. 1 A). Importantly, the C-terminal 16-amino acid fragment contains a cysteine residue involved in a disulfide bond between the α- and β-chain of HGF. When the entire α-chain alone was expressed in mammalian cells, the α-chain formed, at least, a homodimer, presumably through a disulfide bond between C-terminal-free cysteines. Moreover, the recombinant α-chain preparation showed weak motogenic activity. 2K. Matsumoto, H. Kataoka, K. Date, and T. Nakamura, unpublished observation. Covalently dimerized α-chain may induce receptor dimerization and thus allow low level signaling, leading to cell scattering. We also asked whether HGF/NK4 and HGF/β have morphogenic activity (Fig. 4). When MDCK cells were grown in a collagen gel matrix, they form spherical cysts, but when grown in the presence of HGF, branching tubulogenesis occurred. Neither HGF/NK4 alone, nor HGF/β induced branching tubular structures in the MDCK cells; however, the addition of HGF/β in the presence of 1.5 nm HGF/NK4 did induce branching tubulogenesis, as seen with the native HGF. These results indicate that the combination of HGF/NK4 and HGF/β elicits mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activities, all typical for multiple biological activities of HGF, although neither HGF/NK4 alone nor HGF/β alone has biological activities. Multiple biological activities of HGF depend on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met/HGF receptor upon HGF binding. We next analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met"

The present view of cell membranes as dynamic structures has put forward the role of membrane fusion in many cellular processes from membrane biogenesis to viral infections. Despite important recent advances, the molecular mechanism of membrane merging leading to fusion of bilayers is not fully understood yet. The so-called “stalk hypothesis” of membrane fusion, first proposed by Kozlov and Markin (1Kozlov M.M. Markin V.S. Biofizika. 1983; 28: 255-261Google Scholar) and then reformulated in slightly different ways by Chernomordik (2Chernomordik L.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 81: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Siegel (3Siegel D.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2124-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), constitutes the most widely accepted explanation of this phenomenon at the molecular level. According to this view, fusion would occur through an interbilayer and highly curved semitoroidal intermediate, the stalk, initially formed by the external (cis) monolayers of the membranes to be fused. Furthertrans-monolayer contacts would eventually break down, leading to the formation of the fusion pore. Central to the idea of the “stalk” intermediate is the role of nonlamellar lipid phases (inverted cubic, inverted hexagonal) in the mechanism of membrane fusion (4Luzzati V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Chernomordik L.V. Chanturiya A. Green J. Zimmerberg J. Biophys.

J. 1997; 73: 3089-3111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).Other lines of research indicate that membrane lipids may have roles other than the structural one. Specifically, some of them are known to be involved in cell signaling. Metabolic derivatives of glycerophospholipids, i.e. diacylglycerols, were identified years ago as second messengers (8Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). More recently, a series of sphingolipid derivatives, including ceramides, have been shown to be involved in pathways of cell signaling (9Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that in situ production of diacylglycerol by phospholipase C leads to fusion of vesicles that are composed of phospholipid and cholesterol (10Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. Basáñez G. Fidelio G.D. Alonso A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By contrast, sphingomyelinase yields ceramide, which results in aggregation and leakage of vesicles containing sphingolipid and cholesterol (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, sphingomyelinase can induce leaky fusion of sphingomyelin-containing liposomes (13Basáñez G. Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Alonso A. Goñi F.M. Karlsson G. Edwards K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2630-2637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whether physiological fusion events are or are not accompanied by a certain degree of leakage is subject to debate (14Shangguan T. Alford D. Bentz J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have attempted to combine the specific effects of both enzymes, phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase, to promote destabilization and fusion of a model membrane system, large unilamellar vesicles, containing both glycerophospholipids and sphingophospholipids.It is known from our studies on phospholipase C-induced liposomal fusion that diacylglycerol plays two different roles. First, a significant amount (between 5 and 20 mol %) of more or less symmetrically distributed diacylglycerol is required to allow the formation of nonlamellar structures, which are essential for fusion to occur (15Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Nieva J.L. Alonso A. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Gulik A. Vargas R. Luzzati V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Basáñez G. Nieva J.L. Rivas E. Alonso A. Goñi F.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This “bulk” diacylglycerol may be included from the start in the liposomal composition, causing a decrease in the lag time between enzyme addition and fusion, although phospholipase C activity is always essential for membrane destabilization (15Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of phospholipase C consists of generating the pool of diacylglycerol responsible for the second of its two roles: namely the rapid, localized, and asymmetric synthesis of diacylglycerol that is the “trigger” for fusion to occur (15Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Nieva J.L. Alonso A. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Gulik A. Vargas R. Luzzati V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, but using vesicles containing sphingomyelin, sphingomyelinase produces aggregation, but not fusion, of liposomes (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As described in the latter study, ceramide is similar to diacylglycerol though less potent in the induction of nonlamellar phases, and it may substitute for diacylglycerol in reducing the lag time of phospholipase C-induced fusion.This work shows that, under conditions where neither sphingomyelinase nor phospholipase C produce any major structural change in lipidic vesicles, the concerted action of both enzymes readily induces vesicle fusion, the relatively slow acting sphingomyelinase producing the bulk amount of ceramide and phospholipase C supplying the fast diacylglycerol production that makes the trigger. To our knowledge, this is the first report on bilayer fusion induced by the concerted specific actions of two enzymes. In addition, this effect on model membranes may have an in vivo parallelism in what would be a novel aspect of cross-talk between two independent pathways of cell signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSPhospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3) from Bacillus cereus was supplied by Boehringer Mannheim. Cholesterol and sphingomyelinase (EC3.1.4.12) from B. cereus were from Sigma. Sphingomyelinase contained an impurity of phospholipase C, in a proportion that varied from batch to batch. When the specific activity of phospholipase C was ≤ 2% of that of sphingomyelinase, the enzyme was used as such. Batches with contamination higher than 10% were discarded. In intermediate situations, sphingomyelinase was used in experiments when no phospholipase C was involved, in the presence of 2 mm o-phenanthroline. Preliminary studies showed that the presence of the phospholipase C inhibitor o-phenanthroline did not affect sphingomyelinase activity, in agreement with published data (18Ikezawa H. Mori M. Ohyabu T. Taguchi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 528: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Egg PC1, egg PE, and diacylglycerol, obtained by phospholipase C hydrolysis of egg PC, were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, United Kingdom). Egg sphingomyelin and egg ceramide were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS),p-xylenebis (pyridinium bromide) (DPX), and octadecylrhodamine B (R18) were supplied by Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). o-Phenanthroline was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by extrusion (19Mayer L.D. Hope M.H. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) using Nuclepore filters of 0.1 μm pore diameter, at room temperature, as detailed previously (10Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Vesicle size was estimated by quasi-elastic light scattering using a Zeta-Sizer instrument (Malvern Instruments, Inc.). PC:SM:PE:Ch (1:1:1:1, mole ratio) vesicles had an average diameter of ≈ 110 nm. Chemical analysis of the extruded vesicles showed that the extrusion procedure did not modify their composition.For experiments involving sphingomyelinase, or both sphingomyelinase and phospholipase C, LUVs were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0 (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For experiments involving phospholipase C alone, LUVs were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, pH 7.0 (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) although control experiments showed that the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 had no significant effect on phospholipase C activity. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Total lipid concentration was 0.3 mm, and enzymes were used at 1.6 units/ml when added alone or at 0.4 units/ml each when used in combination, unless otherwise stated.Phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities were assayed by determining phosphorous contents (20Böttcher C.S.F. van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 1061: 297-303Google Scholar) in the aqueous phase of an extraction mixture (chloroform:methanol, 2:1) after addition of aliquots from the reaction mixture at different times. When both enzymes were used together, their activities were assayed by measuring diacylglycerol and ceramide in the organic phase of the extraction mixture. For this purpose, aliquots of the organic phase were evaporated, and the lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel G using petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (60:40:1) as solvent. The spots corresponding to diacylglycerol and ceramide were quantitated after charring the plates with a sulfuric acid reagent. Spot intensity was measured with a CS-930 dual wavelength TLC scanner from Shimadzu Corp. Samples containing known amounts of the lipids were run on the same plates, to be used as standards for quantitation. The amounts of product, diacylglycerol or ceramide, are given as mole percentages of total lipid in the system.Liposome aggregation was estimated as an increase in light scattering, measured in an LS50 Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer with both monochromators set at 520 nm. Lipid mixing was assayed by the octadecylrhodamine method (21Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Fusion was detected as mixing of vesicle aqueous contents using the ANTS/DPX fluorescent probe system described by Ellens et al. (22Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4141-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Vesicle leakage was also measured with the ANTS/DPX system. Details on the use of these fluorescent probes, including calibration of the various assays, have been given elsewhere (10Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C inhibition byo-phenanthroline was achieved by premixing the required amount of inhibitor with the liposomes 10 min before the assay.RESULTSAddition of phospholipase C to a suspension of large unilamellar vesicles of PC:PE:Ch (2:1:1, mole ratio) leads to rapid liposomal aggregation and fusion (Nieva et al., 1989). However, when PC is substituted by an equimolar mixture of PC and SM, so that the new liposomal composition is PC:SM:PE:Ch (1:1:1:1), addition of phospholipase C, under otherwise similar conditions, produces neither fusion (contents mixing) nor lipid mixing (Fig. 1 A) even in a time scale that is 1 order of magnitude longer than the one used in the previous study. Light scattering does not change either in the experiment shown in Fig. 1 A, which precludes vesicle aggregation under those conditions (Fig. 2). However, lipid hydrolysis occurs, and the amount of diacylglycerol produced in the experiment shown in Fig. 1 A should be enough to produce vesicle fusion. At least in the PC:PE:Ch mixture, enzymically produced diacylglycerol in amounts equivalent to 5–20% of the total lipid was found to induce fusion (15Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Figure 2Changes in light scattering of liposomal suspensions upon addition of phospholipase C and/or sphingomyelinase.

Enzyme amounts are as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similarly, vesicles containing SM:PE:Ch (2:1:1) undergo rapid aggregation and leakage, but no lipid or contents mixing, when treated with sphingomyelinase (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The same enzyme treatment on large unilamellar vesicles consisting of PC:SM:PE:Ch (1:1:1:1) produces lipid hydrolysis, but no aggregation or fusion (Figs. 1 B and 2). Remarkably, however, the joint addition of both phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase to PC:SM:PE:Ch (1:1:1:1) vesicles leads to rapid vesicle aggregation, lipid mixing, and contents mixing (Figs. 1 C and 2). When both enzymes are added together, their activities appear to be mutually potentiated, and phospholipase C becomes particularly activated (Fig. 1 D). None of the effects shown in Fig. 1, C and D, were seen when the enzymes had been previously inactivated by heat, or when phospholipase C had been preincubated with its specific inhibitor,o-phenanthroline. In the experiments in Fig. 1, Cand D, 0.4 units/ml each phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase were added. Qualitatively similar results were found when the amounts of each enzyme varied in the 0.4–1.6 units/ml range, both enzymes being present at equal concentrations, only the rates increased with increasing amounts of enzyme.Fusion induced by phospholipase C occurred in the absence of vesicle leakage (10Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas sphingomyelinase action on SM:PE:Ch vesicles included extensive release of aqueous contents (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). With PC:SM:PE:Ch (1:1:1:1) liposomes, neither enzyme produces vesicle leakage (Fig. 3) although, when both enzymes are added in combination, a leakage effect is observed that starts once fusion (mixing of aqueous contents) has reached an apparent equilibrium (Fig. 3). Under these conditions leakage proceeds slowly for a long time afterward.Figure 3Release of vesicle aqueous contents upon addition of phospholipase C and/or sphingomyelin. Liposomes were loaded with ANTS + DPX (see “Materials and Methods”). Other experimental details are as in Figs. 1 and 2.

Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Nieva J.L. Alonso A. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Gulik A. Vargas R. Luzzati V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A local high concentration of diacylglycerol in one of the monolayers can only be built up in competition with the phenomena of lateral and transbilayer (flip-flop) diffusion. (b) Sphingomyelinase acts in much the same way as in the ternary mixture SM:PE:Ch (1:1:1) (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and consequently no fusion occurs. However, a significant proportion of ceramide is generated in the bilayers, thus facilitating an eventual lamellar transition. (c) When both enzymes are acting together, the rate of generation of ceramide and particularly of diacylglycerol is high enough to overcome diffusion, and vesicle fusion occurs (Fig. 1,C and D). These points are discussed and experimentally tested below.The initial rates of phospholipase C and of sphingomyelinase acting on 3- and 4-component liposomes are shown in Table I. In these cases, initial rates are also maximum rates since no “lag periods” are detected. The amounts of end product (diacylglycerol or ceramide) that accumulated after 1 min of enzyme activity are also shown in Table I. It can be seen that the amount of diacylglycerol released by phospholipase C in the 4-component mixture after 1 min would be more than enough to produce vesicle fusion (fusion occurs already with ≈ 5% diacylglycerol in PC:PE:Ch liposomes (15Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), but the phospholipase C rate in the 4-component mixture is much lower than in the 3-component liposomes. This supports our hypothesis that, in the PC:SM:PE:Ch vesicles, diacylglycerol production is not fast enough to overcome lateral and transbilayer diffusion so that the high, local and asymmetric diacylglycerol concentration that is required as the fusion trigger is never achieved. Transbilayer (flip-flop) and lateral diffusion of diacylglycerol are probably very fast in fluid lipid bilayers, with half-times in the subsecond time scale (23Hamilton J.A. Bhamidipati S.P. Kodali D.R. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of a fast production of diacylglycerol is also supported by data showing the need for a given enzyme/vesicle ratio, below which fusion is much reduced or totally abolished (10Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Nieva J.L. Alonso A. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Gulik A. Vargas R. Luzzati V.

Open table in a new tab According to the data in Table I, sphingomyelinase activity is also lower in the 4-component than in the 3-component systems. It should be noted that, with PC:SM:PE:Ch vesicles, sphingomyelinase does not elicit vesicle aggregation (Fig. 2), as was the case with SM:PE:Ch vesicles (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, independent studies have shown that vesicle aggregation induced by sphingomyelinase is extremely sensitive to lipid composition. 2M. B. Ruiz-Argüello, unpublished results.When both enzymes are added together to the 4-component system, the amount of substrate processed after 1 min is approximately three times the sum of the amounts of substrate hydrolyzed by each single enzyme (Table I). This is in agreement with the mutual potentiation of both enzymes when acting on this system, which was as seen in Fig. 1 D. The data in Table I and Fig. 1 D are compatible with the hypothesis that it is the faster rate of diacylglycerol production that leads to fusion under the conditions of Fig. 1 C, as compared with those of Fig. 1 A, because, under those conditions, fast diacylglycerol synthesis may give rise to a steady state in which local accumulation of this product occurs. It is doubtful that the concomitant activation of sphingomyelinase is instrumental in the onset of fusion because, in the previous study (12Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basáñez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it was shown that fast ceramide production leads to vesicle leakage, but not fusion. However, full experimental confirmation of this point will require specific measurements of diacylglycerol and ceramide diffusion in bilayers.The hypothesis that, in the fusion process shown in Fig. 1 C, each enzyme plays a specific role so that sphingomyelinase produces ceramide that mainly facilitates the formation of nonlamellar intermediates, while phospholipase C provides the trigger, leads to the prediction that the order of addition of the enzymes should not be irrelevant. Sphingomyelinase would need some time to build up an adequate concentration of ceramide, whereas the action of phospholipase C should be much shorter in time. Consequently, when both enzymes are added simultaneously, or when phospholipase C is added prior to sphingomyelinase, a lag time should be seen, corresponding to the synthesis of ceramide by the latter enzyme. Conversely, addition of sphingomyelinase first, followed after some time by phospholipase C, should lead to immediate fusion. These predictions are confirmed by the experiments in Fig. 4. Changes in light scattering parallel the observations on lipid and contents mixing, with a lag time when phospholipase C is added prior to sphingomyelinase, but not vice versa (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of the order of enzyme addition on vesicle fusion induced by phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase.Lipid mixing and fusion (contents mixing) are represented in each case. Experimental details as in Figs. 1 and 2. Enzymes are added at the times indicated by the corresponding arrows. A, phospholipase C first; B, sphingomyelinase first;C and D, correspond to amplified parts of panels A and B, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A related prediction of our hypothesis is that, if the liposomal composition contains a sufficient amount of ceramide from the start, sphingomyelinase would become “redundant,” and phospholipase C alone would be able to induce fusion. This was tested by preparing large unilamellar vesicles with the usual 4-component mixture, in which 15% sphingomyelin was substituted by ceramide so that the final bilayer composition was PC:SM:PE:Ch:ceramide (25:10:25:25:15 mole ratio). These vesicles were stable for several days at 4 °C. Addition of phospholipase C immediately produced vesicle fusion (Fig. 5), thus reinforcing our hypothesis. Under these conditions, fusion is slower than when both enzymes are added (compare Figs. 5 and 1 C). This may be because of the transbilayer distribution of enzymically produced ceramide being partially asymmetric, which should favor the fusion process (3Siegel D.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2124-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), whereas ceramide mixed with the other lipids in the process of vesicle preparation will be symmetrically distributed in the bilayers. Note that, for the first 5 min, the presence of ceramide in the bilayer does not modify significantly the production of diacylglycerol by phospholipase C (Fig. 5 B), and yet fusion occurs because, once ceramide is present in sufficient amounts to facilitate nonlamellar phase formation, a small, but localized, formation of diacylglycerol by the enzyme is enough to trigger fusion. Conversely, vesicles prepared with a PC:SM:PE:Ch:diacylglycerol (17.5:25:17.5:25:15) mixture did not fuse when treated with sphingomyelinase (Fig. 5 A), in agreement with the proposed role of phospholipase C activity in the induction of fusion.Figure 5Influence of including ceramide or diacylglycerol in the bilayer composition on the enzyme effects on vesicles.

This in turn potentiates the action of these growth factors in activating mitogen-activated protein kinases, PI 3-kinase, and the downstream protein kinases PDK1 and Akt/PKB (29Cybulsky A.V. McTavish A.J. Cyr M.-D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30King W.G. Mattalano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The mitogenic effects of insulin have also been shown to be enhanced by interactions of extracellular vitronectin with cell surface αvβ3 integrins, which associate with insulin receptor and IRS-1 in response to insulin (31Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 32Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of such synergism in the actions of insulin and integrins is still unclear. Conversely, it also has been shown that growth factor receptors, such as KIT (33Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and PDGF (34Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, stimulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion onto fibronectin through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. Thus, in the present studies, we addressed the questions whether insulin may directly activate integrin-mediated cell adhesion and if integrin activation modulates insulin signaling. Here, we show that insulin markedly promotes CHO-T cell adhesion onto a fibronectin matrix by a mechanism that is mediated by α5β1 integrin. Activation of this integrin in turn enhances insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as recruitment of PI 3-kinase activity to IRS-1 in response to insulin. This cross-talk between insulin and integrin receptor pathways is likely to play an important role in biological processes regulated by insulin and which depend on integrin engagement. Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(p)) mouse monoclonal 4G10, anti-p85 polyclonal, and laminin were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 immunoglobulin used for immunoprecipitation was prepared as described previously (35Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Anti-insulin receptor monoclonal (CT-1) and polyclonal antibodies were from mouse ascites and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Plasma human fibronectin was from Boehringer. GRGDSP and GRADSP peptides for the adhesion competition assay were from Life Technologies, Inc. Specific anti α5β1integrin receptor monoclonal antibody, used in CHO-T cell adhesion blocking assay, was a gift from Dr. Rudolph Juliano. [γ-32P]ATP and 35S-labeled protein labeling mix were from NEN Life Science Products. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. CHO-T cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin/penicillin and grown to confluence before use. To assay cell adhesion on different matrices, cell culture dishes (12-well plate) were coated with fibronectin (0.5 μg/ml), laminin (10 μg/ml), and poly-lysine (0.5 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, prior to plating the cells. Confluent CHO-T cells were serum starved for 12 h in F-12 serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA and labeled with35S-labeled protein labeling mix (1 μCi/150 cm2 plate) at 37 °C and washed twice with PBS. Cells labeled with 35S were detached by adding EDTA-trypsin (0.05 mm, 0.025%). Cells were held in suspension for 5 min, and additions were made for the times indicated in the figure legends. Cells were plated in dishes coated with different substrata, as indicated. Nonadhered cells were removed, and attached cells were washed twice with PBS containing 25 mm MgCl2. Adhered cells were quantified by adding 0.5 ml SDS (0.1%), and samples were counted by a β-counter. Cells held in suspension or attached on a substrata were lysed by adding detergent lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 20 min. Detergent lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min in the cold, and protein concentration was determined by the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay protocol from Pierce. Appropriate antibodies were then added to the cleared cell lysate standardized for total cell protein, and the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C by end-over-end mixing. Protein A-Sepharose was added and the samples incubated for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed four times in PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with appropriate antibody. Bound primary monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were visualized by the Renaissance Chemiluminescence Detection System (NEN Life Science Products) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated detection antibody at 1:15,000 dilution. The tyrosine phosphorylation levels of immunoprecipitated insulin receptor and IRS-1 were quantified, where indicated, by scanning densitometry. IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity assays were performed in vitro by immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 from total cell lysates as described above. The IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were washed three times in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, twice in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and once in PI 3-kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2). The IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 0.2 ml of PI 3-kinase assay buffer containing 50 μg of PI and [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi at final concentration of 0.05 mm), and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and quenched with HCl 1 N. Phospholipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:1), washed twice with methanol:HCl 1 N (1:1), and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and the radioactive products were quantified as described previously (35Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether insulin signaling can activate integrin-mediated cell adhesion, CHO-T cells were detached from culture dishes, treated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C, and plated onto dishes coated with bovine serum albumin, poly-lysine, or fibronectin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, adhesion of CHO-T cells onto a fibronectin matrix was stimulated 2–3-fold by prior treatment with insulin. A similar result was observed when a laminin matrix was used (Fig. 2,right). Nonspecific adhesion processes were not found to be affected by insulin since insulin treatment did not have any effect on CHO-T cell adhesion to dishes coated with bovine serum albumin or poly-lysine. Thus, insulin can modulate CHO-T cell adhesion, similar to the effects described for other growth factor receptors, such as those that bind PDGF, and KIT (33Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G.

After 1 h of incubation, cells were stimulated (+) or not (−) with 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C and replated on fibronectin (0.5 μg/ml) or laminin-coated (5 μg/ml) dishes, as indicated, and allowed to adhere for 10 or 20 min, respectively. Data presented are the average values of three independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether the action of insulin to increase cell adhesion to fibronectin was mediated by integrins. Thus, the effect of a specific GRGDSP sequence peptide, which binds to integrins (36Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on insulin-stimulated CHO-T cell adhesion to fibronectin was examined. As seen in Fig. 1 B, the addition of 0.5 mm GRGDSP peptide to assay media abolished basal and insulin-stimulated cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated dishes, whereas an inactive GRADSP peptide at the same concentration did not. Thus, these data suggest that insulin action modulates integrin-mediated CHO-T cell adhesion. It has previously been established that CHO cells adhere to fibronectin by α5β1 integrin receptors (37Brown P.J. Juliano R.L. Science. 1985; 228: 1448-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We thus examined the effect of a monoclonal anti-α5β1 blocking antibody, PB-1 (37Brown P.J. Juliano R.L. Science. 1985; 228: 1448-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 108: 1925-1933Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39Brown P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), on CHO-T cell adhesion to fibronectin in the presence and absence of insulin. As seen in Fig. 2 (right), addition of PB-1 to assay media markedly inhibited the adhesion of CHO-T cells to a fibronectin matrix under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. In contrast, no inhibition of CHO-T cell adhesion onto laminin could be detected by adding PB-1 to the assay media (Fig. 2, left). These data are consistent with a previous report showing PB-1 inhibition of CHO cell adhesion onto fibronectin, but not onto laminin (37Brown P.J. Juliano R.L. Science. 1985; 228: 1448-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate a marked effect of insulin to enhance CHO-T cell adhesion onto fibronectin through α5β1 integrin. To determine whether insulin-stimulated and integrin-mediated cell adhesion is dependent on activated PI-3-kinase, CHO-T cells were detached from the culture dishes, treated with or without 50 nm of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin for 15 min prior to incubation with or without insulin for 10 min, and then replated onto fibronectin or laminin-coated plates. As depicted in Fig. 3, wortmannin treatment of the cells markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated, fibronectin-dependent CHO-T cell adhesion. Similar results were observed when cells were plated onto laminin-coated dishes (Fig. 3). These results suggest that insulin-stimulated cell adhesion in this system is dependent, at least in part, on PI 3-kinase activity. The mechanism of this insulin action on cell adhesion may thus share common elements with the actions of growth factors such as PDGF on adhesion, which are also blocked by wortmannin (33Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 34Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A.

Attachment of cells to fibronectin results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (M r= 125,000) and paxillin (M r = 68,000–75,000) proteins that are associated with focal adhesion complexes (23Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 24Guan J.-L. Int. J. Biochem.

Also, it has been shown that integrin-mediated cell anchorage promotes increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor and PDGF receptors (28Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 29Cybulsky A.V. McTavish A.J. Cyr M.-D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine whether the α5β1 integrin engagement modulates insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin, we performed experiments in which serum-starved CHO-T cells were detached from the culture dish, held in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C, treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 10 min, and then either kept in suspension or plated onto fibronectin-coated plates for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 4 Aand B, CHO-T cell attachment to fibronectin markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein that corresponds to FAK as well as 68-kDa proteins. Surprisingly, cell attachment to fibronectin also markedly increased insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation under basal conditions and in response to insulin by 2–3-fold (Fig. 4, A and B). Fig. 4also shows that insulin treatment of these cells caused dephosphorylation of FAK, consistent with previous reports that insulin induces FAK tyrosine dephosphorylation (17Pillay T.S. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

To examine whether α5β1 integrin engagement potentiates signaling by insulin at submaximal doses, the effect of different concentrations of insulin on insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed in cells held in suspension or allowed to attach onto fibronectin (Fig. 5). CHO-T cell attachment onto a fibronectin matrix markedly potentiated the ability of insulin to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor at all concentrations employed. Similar to this effect observed on insulin receptor phosphorylation, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to all doses of insulin tested was enhanced by CHO-T cell attachment onto fibronectin (Fig. 6 A).Figure 6Effect of cell adhesion on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with PI 3-kinase.Serum-starved CHO-T cells were detached, held in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated or not (−) with different insulin concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 nm) for 10 min, replated on fibronectin-coated dishes, or held in suspension for 20 min.

Thus, we tested the effect of α5β1integrin engagement on the association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1. As seen in Fig. 6 A, CHO-T cell adhesion onto fibronectin promotes the increased association of p85 with IRS-1 at both submaximal and maximal concentrations of insulin. Experiments were also conducted to determine the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 after treatment of adherent and nonadherent CHO-T cells with or without various concentrations of insulin. Fibronectin engagement of α5β1 integrin receptor was associated with a significant, severalfold increase in basal CHO-T cell PI 3-kinase activity detected in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6,B and C). Elevated PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 was also observed when submaximal or maximal doses of insulin were incubated with adherent cells compared with nonadherent cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of α5β1 integrin through cell adhesion onto fibronectin causes enhanced recruitment of p85/p110-type PI 3-kinases to IRS-1, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity of these enzymes. The findings presented here demonstrating the potentiation of insulin receptor modulation of IRS-1 by α5β1integrin engagement suggests the concommittant enhancement of signaling events downstream of IRS-1. One function proposed to be regulated by IRS-1/PI 3-kinase signaling complexes is cell proliferation (41Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and recent evidence indeed indicates that αVβ3 integrin-mediated cell adhesion enhances this insulin action (31Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). As PI 3-kinase activation appears to also be required for the metabolic actions of insulin (8Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Siddle K. Biochem.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it will be important in future studies to determine whether integrin ligation may influence such insulin effects. The present work shows for the first time that insulin stimulates cell adhesion, and this effect is dependent upon PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 3). Cell adhesion is also enhanced upon ligation and clustering of integrins on the cell surface. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potentiation of the insulin signaling pathway through IRS-1/PI 3-kinase by integrins reflects an indirect mechanism to further enhance adhesion over that caused directly by the integrins. Testing this hypothesis will require determining whether IRS-1/PI 3-kinase complexes formed in response to integrin activation actually mediate increased cell adhesion. Such studies will also be important in ultimately probing the full physiological implications of insulin regulation of cell adhesion.

MTs1 bind metals of the copper and zinc triads, typically in metal thiolate clusters (reviewed in Ref. 1Kägi J.H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Indeed, the presence of such clusters is often cited as a defining characteristic of MTs. In mammalian MTI and MTII, seven Zn2+ (or Cd2+) ions are tetrahedrally coordinated to thiolate ligands in two distinct Zn3S9 and Zn4S11clusters. In comparison, little is known about metal coordination by bacterial MTs. Electronic absorption spectra suggested the presence of (some) metal thiolate coordination in MT purified fromSynechococcus sp. (2Olafson R.W. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Biochem.

The possibility that these His residues may be involved in metal coordination has never been investigated. An atypical (for an MT) coordination chemistry could be significant in view of the unusually high affinity of SmtA for Zn2+ (5Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Robinson N.J.

Lindsay W.P. Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This implies that SmtA has a higher affinity than other MTs for Zn2+, whereas metal displacement curves for Cd2+ and copper ions have indicated that SmtA has a lower affinity than equine renal MT for these ions (5Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, expression from thesmtA operator-promoter is maximally induced by Zn2+, in comparison with other metals at maximum permissive concentrations (4Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutants deficient in SmtA are hypersensitive to Zn2+ (and to some extent Cd2+) but have normal tolerance to copper ions (6Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, yeast mutants deficient in the MT gene CUP1 are hypersensitive to copper ions but not Zn2+ (9Thiele D.J. Wright C.F. Walling M.J. Hamer D.H. Kägi J.H.R. Kojima Y. Metallothionein II. 1987: 423-429Google Scholar), whereas transgenic animals in which MTI and MTII genes are disrupted are hypersensitive to hepatic poisoning by Cd2+ (10Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Here we describe analyses of metal coordination by recombinant SmtA and mutants thereof to determine the number of metal ions bound and the number of Cys residues involved. Most importantly, the results of experiments that implicate His-imidazole groups in metal binding by SmtA are reported. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were supplied by New England Biolabs Inc., Taq DNA polymerase was supplied by Life Technologies, Inc., and other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. All generated plasmid constructs were checked by sequence analysis as described previously (4Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and reaction products analyzed using an Applied Biosystems 370A DNA sequence analyzer. Plasmid pJHNR49 (4Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was used as template DNA in PCR reactions using standard conditions with primers P1 (5′-CGCGGATCCTCATGACCTCAACA-3′) and P2 (5′-GGAGTCAAGCTTGGAAACAGTTGATTA-3′) designed to anneal to the 5′ and 3′ ends of smtA, respectively. The PCR amplification product, containing smtA, was ligated to pGEM-T (Promega Corp.) prior to subcloning into the BamHI/SmaI site of the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create pMDNR1.1. A mutant of smtA was generated in which all three His codons were converted to Arg codons. A three-stage PCR reaction was performed (to minimize mispriming) using plasmid pJHNR49 as template DNA with primers P1 and P3 (5′-CCGGAATTCTGATTAGCCGCGGCAGTTACAGCCGGTGCGGCCGCAGCCTTTGCTACCACCGGTGCGGCCATCGGC-3′, designed to convert codons 40, 49, and 55 from CAC to CGC): Stage 1, three cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 1 min) and annealing (50 °C, 1 min) were performed with a 50-μl reaction containing pJHNR49 (100 ng) and P3 (2 mm) in PCR buffer; stage 2, the reaction volume was increased to 90 μl with the addition of Taq DNA polymerase (5 units) and dNTPs (0.22 mm) in PCR buffer, and three cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1.5 min), annealing (45 °C, 1.5 min), and extension (73 °C, 2 min) were performed; stage 3, the reaction volume was increased to 100 μl with the addition of P1 (1 mm) in PCR buffer and 12 further cycles of PCR performed (as for stage 2). The PCR amplification product containing mutatedsmtA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-3X to create pMDNR1.2. Codons 40, 49, and 55 of smtA, which encode His, were also converted individually (from CAC to CGC) to encode Arg, thereby creating three separate mutants. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed via Quik-change (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocols, with pMDNR1.1 as template. The primers used were: 5′-ACCACCGGTGCGGCCATCGGC-3′ with 5′-GCCGATGGCCGCACCGGTGGT-3′ to convert codon 40, creating pMDNR1.3; 5′-ACAGCCGGTGCGGCCGCAGCC-3′ with 5′-GGCTGCGGCCGCACCGGCTGT-3′ to convert codon 49, creating pMDNR1.4; and 5′-CCACACCGGCTGTAACTGCCGCGGCTAATCAACTGTTTCCA-3′ with 5′-TGGAAACAGTTGATTAGCCGCGGCAGTTACAGCCGGTGTGG-3′ to convert codon 55, creating pMDNR1.5. Recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (JM101) grown in the presence of 0.5 mmZn2+ and purified as described previously (11Tommey A.M. Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Urwin P.E. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins and three residues of GST (Gly, Ile, and Leu), were released from glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST by incubation with factor Xa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. An aliquot of SmtA was hydrolyzed and analyzed for amino acid composition (Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham) to allow calibration of colorimetric estimations of SmtA. Purified SmtA was concentrated (to 0.9 mm) for NMR spectroscopy using Centriprep-3 concentrators (Amicon) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Purified recombinant proteins (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 353.52 kBq 65Zn before fractionation on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated to pH 7.0 (in 0.05 mKH2PO4, 0.029 m NaOH). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were analyzed for protein content and radioactivity. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and aliquots (625 μl) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 1.875 ml of 0.05 m KH phthalate/HCl (pH 2–5) or 0.05 m KH2PO4/NaOH (pH 5–7), followed by fractionation on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with the same buffers. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were again analyzed for protein content and radioactivity. The amount of Zn2+ bound to 1 nmol of recombinant protein (in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was determined by addition of 0.67 mm PAR and incubation for 5 min with increasing amounts (1 nmol increments) of PMPS. The metallochromic indicator PAR is known to generate colored chelate compounds with Zn2+ (12Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metal ion release was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 492 nm, and the values were calibrated by reacting known amounts of Zn2+ with PAR. Samples were prepared by adding 4 mol eq of 111Cd (as a 50 mm solution, prepared by dissolving 111CdO in a minimum amount of HCl and diluted with D2O) dropwise to 0.9 mm SmtA (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4) and equilibrated for >12 h. Excess111Cd was removed by ultracentrifugation (Amicon) and washed four times with 50 mm Tris-d11 (pH 8.4) for ∼2 h. 111Cd and 1H{111Cd} NMR spectra were obtained at 298 K on a Bruker DMX 500 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 106.04 and 500.13 MHz for 111Cd and1H, respectively. Typically parameters for111Cd were: spectral width, 240 ppm, centered at 620 ppm (relative to Cd(ClO4)2), with 16, 384 data points; pulse width, 8 μs (60 ° pulse); pulse delay, 0.6 s. Gated CPD 1H decoupling (during acquisition time) was used to avoid negative NOEs. The total acquisition time for each spectrum was 6–8 h. An exponential function (equivalent to a line broadening of ∼10–20 Hz) was used prior to Fourier transformation. Shifts are referenced to external 0.1 mCd(ClO4)2 (0 ppm). 111Cd-edited1H NMR spectra (4,096 data points) were obtained by using the first increment of a two-dimensional [1H,111Cd] heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiment (13Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 55: 301-315Google Scholar), and the coherence transfer was selected by pulsed field gradients (14Stonehouse J. Shaw G.L. Keeler J. Laue E.D. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1994; 107: 178-184Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Data were acquired with different mixing times (1/2J[111Cd, 1H]) because of markedly different vicinal coupling constants (3J[111Cd, 1H]) (15Zerbe O. Poutney D.L. von Philipsborn W. Vasák M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 377-378Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).111Cd GARP decoupling (centered at 620 ppm) (16Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) was carried out during the acquisition time to remove 111Cd coupling. The 1H spectral width was 8 ppm with the H2O resonance in the center of the spectrum. Unshifted Gaussian functions were used for processing. Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were acquired using a spin-lock time (MLEV-17) of 60 ms with 2,048 data points in the second frequency domain and 256 increments in the first frequency domain. Data were zero-filled to 2,048 × 1,024 data points. Typically 32 transients were acquired for each increment. Extracts from E. coli cells containing plasmids pMDNR1.1 and pMDNR1.2 were fractionated on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and proteins of ∼35 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of GST-SmtA, were detected in fractions eluted with buffer containing 5 mm glutathione (data not shown). It was noted that GST-SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) migrated slightly faster than GST-SmtA, which does not correlate with a difference in molecular mass. Following overnight incubation of recombinant proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B with factor Xa, smaller proteins of ∼6.5 kDa (corresponding to the predicted size of SmtA) were released in factor Xa cleavage buffer (devoid of glutathione). In vitro incubation of either SmtA or SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) for 1 h with 65Zn gave rise to radioactivity and protein that co-chromatographed on Sephadex G-25 (Fig. 1, A and B). At pH 4.28 65Zn remained associated with SmtA but dissociated from SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) (Fig. 1, C and D). Fig. 1 E shows the proportion of65Zn associated with either protein as a function of pH. The mean estimated pH values (and standard deviations) of half-dissociation of Zn2+ from SmtA and SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) from three independent experiments were 4.05 ± 0.09 and 5.37 ± 0.04, respectively. The former value is in good agreement with that reported previously (5Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the latter implies that substitution of His residues with Arg reduces the affinity for Zn2+. Upon Cys modification of 1 nmol of SmtA in the presence of PAR, an increase in A 492(ΔA 492) was observed up to the addition of 8 nmol of PMPS (Fig. 2 A). In each of three experiments using independent preparations of recombinant SmtA, no further increase in A 492 was detected upon addition of more than 8 nmol of PMPS (Fig. 2 A). This implies that only eight of the nine Cys residues are involved in Zn2+ coordination and that the remaining Cys residue is the least accessible to PMPS. Use of calibration curves for Zn2+ reacting with PAR gave estimates of 3.06 ± 0.37 nmol of Zn2+ released nmol−1 of SmtA following the addition of saturating amounts of PMPS. This implies that each molecule of SmtA coordinates three Zn2+ ions. When SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) was incubated with PAR, an immediate color change (prior to the addition of PMPS) was observed. Thus, unlike Zn2+ associated with SmtA, a proportion of the Zn2+ associated with SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) is immediately accessible to PAR with no requirement for Cys modification. It is known that PAR, a metal chelator, can remove Zn2+ from some proteins (17Yu W. Santhanagopalan V. Sewell A.K. Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21010-21015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of Zn2+ removed from the mutant protein by PAR was estimated to be 1.22 ± 0.21 nmol Zn2+ nmol−1 protein, a value close to one (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the coordination of (at least) one Zn2+ ion is sufficiently weakened by the substitution of all three His residues by Arg such that PAR can now directly compete for this metal ion. The amount of metal subsequently displaced by PMPS was variable, possibly reflecting some variable loss of metal during purification, but the total stoichiometry is less than three and does not significantly deviate from 2 nmol Zn2+nmol−1 protein. The pH lability (Fig. 1) and accessibility to PAR (Fig. 2) of Zn2+ associated with SmtA(H40R/H49R/H55R) implicates His residues in metal coordination. Mutants were therefore generated in which each His residue was individually substituted by Arg to define which of the three residues contribute(s) toward metal binding. Following overnight incubation with factor Xa, proteins of ∼6.5 kDa (corresponding to the predicted size of SmtA) were released from glutathione-Sepharose 4B-immobilized extracts from E. colicontaining plasmid pMDNR1.3, pMDNR1.4, or pMDNR1.5. Purified SmtA(H40R), SmtA(H49R), or SmtA(H55R) was incubated with65Zn, fractionated on Sephadex G-25, and then incubated and re-chromatographed in buffers of differing pH. Fig. 3 shows the pH displacement curves for each protein. The mean estimated pH values of half-dissociation of Zn2+ from SmtA(H40R), SmtA(H49R), and SmtA(H55R) from three independent experiments were 4.62 ± 0.22, 4.48 ± 0.2, and 3.81 ± 0.2, respectively. Replacement of His40 and His49 by Arg reduces the apparent affinity of SmtA for Zn2+, whereas replacement of His55 confers a slight increase in stability of metal binding at reduced pH. The amount of metal displaced by PMPS did not significantly deviate from 3 nmol of Zn2+ nmol−1 protein for either SmtA(H40R) or SmtA(H55R), whereas the stoichiometry was close to 2 nmol of Zn2+ nmol−1 SmtA(H49R) (Fig. 2 B). An increase in A 492 was observed with the addition of up to 6 nmol of PMPS nmol−1 of SmtA(H49R). In each of three experiments using independent preparations of recombinant SmtA(H49R), no further increase in A 492 was detected upon the addition of more than 6 nmol of PMPS. This implies that only six Cys residues coordinate Zn2+ in SmtA(H49R) and that the other three Cys are less accessible to PMPS. The pH stability and accessibility to PAR of Zn2+ associated with His mutants of SmtA suggest that His-imidazole is involved in metal binding in addition to Cys-thiolate. To investigate the types of residues (especially His) involved in binding, 111Cd was used to displace Zn2+ from the protein, and both 111Cd (Fig. 4) and 111Cd-edited1H (Fig. 5) NMR were used to probe the binding sites. Fig. 4 shows the 1H{111Cd } NMR spectrum of a solution of SmtA (0.9 mm in 50 mm Tris-d11, 90% v/v H2O) with resonances in the range expected for111Cd bound, in full or in part, by thiolate ligands (18Li H. Otvos J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13929-13936Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,19Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Three major resonances were observed at pH 8.4, two with chemical shifts of 654 and 661 ppm and a third displaced at 572 ppm. At pH 7.6 a fourth resonance appeared at 567 ppm. No 111Cd resonances were observed from 0 to 500 ppm. Fig. 5 shows1H{111Cd} NMR spectra recorded with different mixing times (0.5/3J[111Cd,1H]). At very short mixing times, several resonances were observed around 2.7–3.0 ppm. This region is typical of the β proton resonances of Cys residues. Four apparent singlets at 6.65, 7.31, 7.78, and 7.98 ppm appeared in the aromatic region of the1H{111Cd} one-dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence NMR spectrum. These peaks decreased in intensity with decreasing mixing times. A two-dimensional TOCSY1H NMR spectrum (with 111Cd decoupling; mixing time, 65 ms) showed cross-peaks between the peaks at 6.65 and 7.78 ppm, 7.31 and 7.98 ppm, and 7.28 and 8.17 ppm (Fig. 5 A), assignable to His CδH/CεH connectivities. It is evident from Fig. 5 B that only the two His residues giving rise to the former two sets of cross-peaks and not the latter are coordinated to Cd2+. The 1H NMR spectra of Cd2+-SmtA and Zn2+-SmtA (data not shown) show very similar well dispersed resonances in the aromatic and NH region (6 to 11 ppm) and low frequency-shifted methyl resonances in the aliphatic region (∼0.5 ppm), features that are typical of folded proteins. This suggests that Cd2+-SmtA and Zn2+-SmtA proteins have similar structures.Figure 51 H NMR spectra of SmtA. A, two-dimensional TOCSY 1H NMR spectrum of SmtA showing connectives (CδH/CεH) assignable to three His residues (a, b, and c). Residues aand b exhibit 111Cd coupling. B,111Cd-edited 1H NMR analysis of SmtA (50 mm Tris-d11 pH 8.4, 298 K) at various values of τ(=0.5/J). Peak intensities vary because of the large range of111Cd-1H coupling constants. The spectra show that two of the three His residues (a and b, showing cross-peaks in A) and several Cys residues (β-CH2 resonances near 3 ppm overlapping together) are bound to 111Cd.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results show that SmtA coordinates to three Zn2+ions via eight Cys residues. Analyses of metal binding to mutants of SmtA in which His residues were substituted by Arg, suggest that at least two His residues (specifically His40 and His49) are also involved in the coordination of metal ions.111Cd and 111Cd-edited 1H NMR spectra confirmed that SmtA has at least three distinct metal binding sites. Two metal sites contain exclusively Cys-thiolate ligands, whereas the third contains both Cys-thiolate and His-imidazole ligands. This novel (for an MT) coordination chemistry is of significance in view of (i) the unusually high apparent affinity of SmtA for Zn2+ and (ii) observations that SmtA is exquisitely adapted to roles in the intracellular handling of Zn2+ rather than other metal ions. 111Cd NMR has been used previously to probe metal coordination by eukaryotic MTs (19Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The 111Cd (or113Cd) NMR shifts of the CdS4 clusters of eukaryotic MTs usually lie within the range of 600–700 ppm (18Li H. Otvos J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13929-13936Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Gan T. Munoz A. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas the shifts of isolated CdS4 centers are usually at the high frequency end of this range (680–750 ppm) (21Bobsein B.R. Myers R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2454-2455Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Pan T. Freedman L.P. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9218-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The111Cd NMR spectrum of 111Cd-SmtA contains two high frequency peaks at 654 and 661 ppm, which are both in the chemical shift region normally associated with the CdS4 clusters of eukaryotic MT. These two 111Cd NMR peaks for Cd2+-SmtA are relatively sharp. Unlike the spectra of eukaryotic MT, there is no evidence for Cd2+-Cd2+ coupling (∼29–48 Hz for MT) (19Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that could suggest that clusters are not present in Cd2+-SmtA. Alternatively the couplings may be small or the bridging ligands may be involved in fluxional processes, for example involving a dynamic equilibrium between structures (ii) and (iii) in Fig. 6 A. The third peak in the 111Cd NMR spectrum lies at 572 ppm, outside the normal range for CdS4 centers. Shifts of 630–660 ppm have been documented for CdNS3 centers composed of Cys and a single His residue, and even lower shifts in the region of 400 ppm observed for centers that include two nitrogen atoms (19Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23South T.L. Kim B Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 395-396Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Giedroc D.P. Johnson B.A. Armitage I.M. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2410-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The third peak for Cd2+-SmtA is therefore suggestive of either CdNS3 or CdN2S2 coordination. Two-dimensional TOCSY 1H NMR and 111Cd-edited1H NMR data reveal that two His residues are bound to111Cd, and therefore CdN2S2coordination is inferred for the third site. In the only previous report of 113Cd NMR of a prokaryotic MT-like protein isolated from P. putida, Higham et al. (3Higham D.P. Sadler P.J. Scawen M.D. Science. 1984; 225: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported 113Cd NMR shifts of 615, 604, 483, and 476 ppm. These represent two groups of peaks separated by ∼100 ppm, somewhat analogous to the present work. The total number of Cys (nine) and His (three) residues in SmtA is sufficient for tetrahedral coordination of Zn2+ in three independent sites. However, the requirement for only eight equivalents of PMPS to displace all Zn2+ (Fig. 2) indicates that one Cys was not involved in metal binding. Furthermore, both the pH stability of Zn2+-SmtA(H55R) (Fig. 3) and the111Cd-edited 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 5) imply that His55 does not stabilize metal binding. Thus, only configurations for metal coordination that involve eight Cys and two His residues are shown (Fig. 6 A). The reduced stoichiometry of SmtA(H49R) (Fig. 2 B) suggests that the His coordinated ion is lost from this protein and hence that His49 is obligatory for the CdN2S2site, whereas His40 (or His55) is optional. Only six equivalents of PMPS are required to displace the Zn2+, which remains associated with SmtA(H49R) supporting models (ii) and (iii) (Fig. 6 A). Although only one metal ion is coordinated to His residues at pH 8.4 (Fig. 4), all metal ions are more readily displaced at low pH upon substitution of all three His with Arg (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the two Zn2+ that remain associated with SmtA(H49R) are also more readily displaced at low pH (Fig. 3), showing interaction between binding at the CdN2S2 and CdS4sites and/or showing that residual metal coordination is abnormal in the mutant proteins because of abnormal folding. NMR analyses of the mutant proteins would be required to resolve this. Future investigations of metal coordination by SmtA should not only consider the basis of its unusual specificity in the detoxification of Zn2+ but also any specificity in the release of Zn2+ to apo-proteins. The nature of Zn2+coordination by mammalian MT not only creates high affinity binding sites but also ones that are highly labile allowing rapid metal exchange (1Kägi J.H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). There is evidence to support a role for mammalian MT in the donation of Zn2+ to Zn2+-binding proteins (25Zeng J. Heuchel R. Schaffner W. Kägi J.H.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 26Zeng J. Vallee B.L. Kägi J.H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that SmtA may donate Zn2+ to DNA primase (DnaG), which in Synechococcus PCC 7942 contains two Zn2+ binding sites and is encoded by a gene that is located next to thesmtA gene (31Bird A.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Lakey J.H. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarities between metal binding domains provided a clue to the existence of interaction between a copper chaperone and its receptor (32Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Alignments between SmtA and the metal binding domains of DnaG do show similarities in the spacing of some His and Cys residues (Fig. 6, B and C). Both alignments include His55. It is formally possible that His55 and the ninth Cys contribute to transient metal coordination states that are favored during metal transfer. The 111Cd-SmtA NMR peak at 572 ppm (Fig. 4) is the most broad resonance, which is possibly a reflection of the kinetic lability of the CdN2S2 site. The pH dependence of the111Cd NMR spectrum of Cd 2+-SmtA was investigated only over a limited range in view of the potential instability of the protein and limited availability. However, at pH 7.6 an additional peak appeared at 567 ppm. Because no additional111Cd was added to the protein when the pH was lowered, this implies a redistribution of Cd2+ between available sites. This is consistent with flexible coordination modes involving a variable complement of the nine available Cys and three His ligands. Selective protonation of certain residues may encourage the redistribution of metal ions to other centers. We are intrigued by the possibility that such a process could “drive” metal releasein vivo.

Octamer formation has been postulated to occur via interaction of the charged amino acids in the N-terminal peptide of the mature enzyme. We altered codons for charged amino acids in the N-terminal region of mature sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK) to those encoding neutral amino acids. Transfection of normal sMtCK cDNA or those with the mutations R42G, E43G/H45G, and K46G into rat neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in enzymatically active sMtCK expression in all. After hypoosmotic treatment of isolated mitochondria, mitochondrial inner membrane-associated and soluble sMtCK from the intermembranous space were measured. The R42G and E43G/H45G double mutation caused destabilization of the octameric structure of sMtCK and a profound reduction in binding of sMtCK to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The other mutant sMtCK proteins had modest reductions in binding. Creatine-stimulated respiration was markedly reduced in mitochondria isolated from cells transfected with the R42G mutant cDNA as compared with those transfected with normal sMtCK cDNA. We conclude that neutralization of charges in N-terminal peptide resulted in destabilization of octamer structure of sMtCK. Thus, charged amino acids at the N-terminal moiety of mature sMtCK are essential for octamer formation, binding of sMtCK with inner mitochondrial membrane, and coupling of sMtCK to oxidative phosphorylation.

Sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK)1 is a member of a gene family of four homologous CK genes (1Qin, W., Khuchua, Z., Cheng, J., Boero, J., Payne, R. M., and Strauss, A. W. (1998) Mol.

The M-CK and B-CK genes encode soluble, cytoplasmic homodimeric enzymes necessary for ATP production from creatine phosphate at sites of high energy utilization, such as the contractile apparatus. These cytosolic CKs share about 85% similarity to each other in a particular species, and each has 77–91% homology among vertebrate species. Two additional genes encode different mitochondrial CKs, which are localized on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (2Haas R.C. Korenfeld C. Zhang Z.F. Perryman B. Roman D.

Mammalian MtCKs are only 60–65% similar to cytosolic CKs and about 80% homologous to each other, but sMtCKs share 95% identity across species. This suggests that, in addition to enzymatic functions, ubiquitous MtCK and sMtCK may have slightly different structural roles requiring sequence conservation across species.

The rat sMtCK cDNA coding region consists of 1260 nucleotides, and the first 117 bp encode the transit peptide, responsible for transport of de novo synthesized precursor sMtCK from cytosol into mitochondria. During this translocation of pre-sMtCK to the intermembranous space, the transit peptide is proteolytically removed, allowing formation of the active, mature subunit (2Haas R.C. Korenfeld C.

Wallimann T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). sMtCK is functionally coupled with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system via the ADP-ATP translocase (adenine nucleotide translocase; ANT) and directly converts ATP to phosphocreatine, which is exported as an easily diffusible energy carrier to the cytosolic sites of energy utilization, such as the contractile apparatus or ion channels and pumps. Published results suggest that only membrane-associated sMtCK is effectively coupled with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (6Saks V.A. Khuchua Z.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Veksler V.I.

Functionally active mitochondrial creatine kinase in vivoexists as a homooctamer, which can be reversibly dissociated into dimers in the presence of ADP, creatine, and NO3− (9Schlegel J. Wyss M. Eppenberger H. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9221-9227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of dissociation in vivo remains unclear. Experimentsin vitro showed that the N-terminal peptide of mature sMtCK is crucial for stable octamer formation in vitro, and an important role for the glutamic acid at residue 43 was suggested (15Kaldis P. Furter R. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, no experiments in intact cells or in vivo to examine the hypothesis that glutamic acid 43 and other N-terminal residues are essential in sMtCK function have been done. The octamerization of sMtCK has also been proposed as necessary for formation of a multienzyme complex with porin, an anionic channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and mitochondrial ANT (10Saks V.

Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) of sMtCK revealed surprising features consistent with this structural role. sMtCK forms a highly symmetrical, cube-like octameric structure with a channel extending along the four-fold axis. Previous work suggested that sMtCK specifically interacts with cardiolipin molecules in the inner mitochondrial membrane (8Muller M. Moser R. Cheneval D. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

The structural analysis suggested the possibility that charged N-terminal residues might be required for or facilitate binding to ANT, cardiolipin, or porin to form the contact sites, allowing metabolic channeling.

To test the hypothesis that octamer formation is essential for coupling of sMtCK with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system directlyin vivo in intact cells, we created mutations in the mouse sMtCK cDNA. Following transfection and overexpression of normal and mutant sMtCK mRNAs in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we characterized octamer formation and binding to the IMM of the expressed sMtCKs and quantified creatine-stimulated respiration to assess functional and physiologic coupling to oxidative phosphorylation. An sMtCK cDNA was isolated from an adult mouse cardiac cDNA library in Lambda ZAP II vector (Stratagene) by standard plaque screening techniques (18Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Acta. 1991; 1089: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The purified clone containing mouse sMtCK was isolated and subcloned using ApaI and XbaI sites in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) designed for eukaryotic expression. DNA sequence analysis (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) revealed that the insert contained 1394 bp and encompassed the entire sMtCK coding region, the 3′-untranslated region, and the poly(A) tail. Mutations were created with the primer-directed mutagenesis technique (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed.

Flanking, “outside,” normal sense and antisense primers were 125–190 bp upstream or 690–640 bp downstream, respectively, of the mutation sites. Two sets of primary polymerase chain reactions were performed to amplify the two overlapping fragments carrying the desired mutations using the PvuI-linearized sMtCK cDNA in pcDNA3 vector (100 ng) as template DNA. Each cycle of amplification consisted of denaturation at 96 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 60 s (30 cycles). After amplification, approximately 10 ng of these overlapping primary products were mixed, denaturated, and allowed to reanneal. Subsequent reamplification with the outside primers gave 860-bp, full-length secondary products, containing the desired mutations. These products were digested by XbaI and DraIII, restriction sites that flank the mutated region, and the purified 319-bp fragment containing mutations was inserted into the sMtCK cDNA in pcDNA3. All mutations were confirmed by sequence determinations of the entire fragment, which also ruled out the presence of other, undesired polymerase chain reaction-generated abnormalities.Table IPrimers used for PCR-mediated introduction of mutations in the N terminus of sMtCK cDNAMutationNucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)cDNA positionbpInside primers R42GGAT GCC GGG GAA CAG CA118–134 senseTG CTG TTC CCC GGC ATC118–134 antisense E43G/H45GCGGCAA CAG AAG CTC TTT124–144 senseAAA GAG CTT CTG TTG CCG124–144 antisense K46GAA CAG CAC GGG CTC TTT CCC128–147 senseGGG AAA GAG CCC GTG CTG TT128–147 antisenseOutside primers LeftTAA TAC GACTCA CTA TAG GGVector T7 primer RightTCC ATT GAA ATC ACC CTG GT805–824 antisensePrimers used for subcloning of sMtCK cDNA in pET21a bacterial expression vector 5′-End withNde I site and translation start codon (underlined)G AAG GTA CAT ATG GAT GCC CGG GAA CAG CACSense 3′-End with XhoI site and translation stop codon (underlined)GGC AGG CTC GAG TCA CTT CCT GCC AAAAntisensePositions are given in bp from the ATG start codon in sMtCK cDNA.

Primary cultures of cardiomyocytes were prepared from 1–2-day-old newborn rat hearts using repeated collagenase digestion (130 units/ml) (21Chien K.R. Sen A. Reynolds R. Chang A. Kim Y. Gunn M. Buja L.M. Willerson J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 25: 1770-1780Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were separated from nonmuscle cells by centrifugation through two steps of a Percoll density gradient (1.059 and 1.082 g/ml) for 30 min at 2000 × g. Muscle cells from the middle band were collected by centrifugation and suspended in the PC-1 media (Hycor catalog no. 77232). Approximately 3 × 106 cells were transferred to collagen-coated culture dishes. After 24 h, PC-1 medium was changed to PC-1/F-12 minimal essential medium (1:2 v/v) mixture. LipofectAMINE® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed for transfection of normal and mutant sMtCK cDNA into primary cultures of cardiomyocytes. Approximately 24 μg of plasmid DNA and 60 μl of the LipofectAMINE®reagent were used for each 60-mm plate. Cells were exposed to the transfection mixture for 4 h. After this, cells were grown in PC-1/F-12 minimal essential medium (1:2 v/v) mixture for an additional 48 h. We employed E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLyS and pET21a vector (Novagen) for expression of normal and mutant sMtCK in bacteria. The coding sequence of mature mouse sMtCK was generated by primer-directed polymerase chain reaction with sMtCK containing pcDNA3 plasmid as template to create an NdeI site and new initiator methionine codon (Table I) at the 5′-end and an XhoI site immediately after the translation stop codon (Table I). The NdeI–XhoI fragment, containing the complete sequence of mature sMtCK, was inserted into the expression vector, pET21a. Mutations in the N terminus were created using the strategy outlined above. Freshly transformed single colonies of the expression host, BL21(DE3)pLyS, were inoculated in 150 ml of CIRCLEGROW®(Bio 101) medium, and bacteria were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of about 0.4 and induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g; resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA; and sonicated for 5 min (10-s pulse, 15-s pause) at 0 °C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Clear supernatants were used for further CK assay and gel permeation chromatography. The proportion of sMtCK as octamers or dimers was estimated by measuring the CK activities after gel filtration of E. coli lysates on a Sephacryl S200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (0.4 × 50 cm). 120 μl of clear bacterial lysate, containing approximately 6 IU of CK activity was applied onto the column and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. 200-μl fractions were collected, and CK activities were measured in each. Cardiac mitochondria were isolated using Percoll/metrizamide discontinuous density gradient centrifugation as described previously (22Storrie B. Madden A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). To estimate the ratio of membrane-associated and soluble sMtCK, mitochondria from cultured cardiac cells were isolated, and the outer mitochondrial membrane was disrupted by treatment of the mitochondria with hypoosmotic buffer, containing 14 mm KCl and 5 mm K-Hepes (pH 8.1). Samples with 20 μg of mitochondria were incubated in ice-cold hypoosmotic buffer for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min, and the resultant pellets were washed with 50 μl of the indicated medium and recentrifuged. Supernatants, containing the soluble or free mitochondrial CK originally in the intermembranous space, were pooled from both steps. The remaining, membrane-associated CK activity was extracted from the mitochondrial pellet with 100 μl of buffer containing 100 mmK2HPO4 (pH 8.9), 15 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The entire volume was taken for determination of CK activity. Cardiomyocyte respiration rates were determined at 22 °C using an oxygraph (Yellow Spring Instruments) and Clark electrode in a special attachment, as described by Seraydarian and Yamada (23Seraydarian M.W. Yamada T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 194: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption by cultured cardiomyocytes was measured in air-saturated medium containing 120 mm K-MES, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mmimidazole (pH 7.2), 20 mm taurine, 8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm K2HPO4, 4 mm glutamate, 2 mm malate, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. For permeabilization of the sarcolemma, cells were incubated with saponin (20 μg/ml) for 5 min. Basal respiration (V o) was recorded during this time. Respiration was stimulated by 60 μm ADP to submaximal level (V ADP). Respiration rate was enhanced further by the addition of 25 mm creatine (V Cr). Near-maximal respiration rates were observed at 1 mm ADP (V max), which was inhibited by atractyloside, an inhibitor of the ATP-ADP translocator. For determination of total CK activity, CK isoenzymes, and protein concentration, cells were scraped on ice in 2 ml of F-12 medium, collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in the 0.2 ml of extraction buffer, containing 100 mm K2HPO4 (pH 8.5), 15 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cells were broken by sonication (model 550 Sonic Dismembrator from Fisher) for 45 s. After incubation for 1 h in ice, samples were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used for the following measurements. CK activities in the samples were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using CK single assay vials (Sigma) (24Rosalki S.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 69: 696-705PubMed Google Scholar). CK isoenzymes were analyzed electrophoretically in agarose gels (Ciba Corning CK Isoenzyme System) (25Roe C.R. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1977; 7: 201-209PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie method with bovine serum albumin as the standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The results are presented as means ± sample S.D. of 3–6 different experiments. To test the hypothesis that conserved N-terminal charged residues were essential for binding of mature sMtCK to the IMM and for the formation of octameric structures necessary for metabolic channeling and coupling to oxidative phosphorylation, we wanted to compare sequences in this region of our previously characterized human and rat sMtCK (1Qin, W., Khuchua, Z., Cheng, J., Boero, J., Payne, R. M., and Strauss, A. W. (1998) Mol. Cell Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar, 2Haas R.C. Korenfeld C. Zhang Z.F. Perryman B. Roman D. Strauss A.W. J. Biol.

Strauss A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to another mammalian species. Therefore, we isolated and characterized by complete nucleotide sequence analysis a full-length mouse heart sMtCK cDNA. Overall, within the coding region, the mouse sMtCK had 93.8% nucleotide and 96% amino acid identity to rat and 92% amino acid identity to human sMtCK. This high degree of conservation across species is typical of mitochondrial proteins. The 3′-untranslated regions were also highly homologous, with 96% identity over the entire 153-bp region in the rat and 85% identity to 160 bp of the human 3′-untranslated region. This unusual degree of cross-species nucleotide identity in a nontranslated region suggests a potential role of this domain in the regulation of sMtCK expression (3Haas R.C. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Payne M.R. Haas R.C. Strauss A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the mature mouse N terminus with rat and human sMtCK N-terminal heptapeptides (residues 40–47 of the sMtCK precursor protein) demonstrates 100% identity to rat and 86% similarity with human (Fig. 1). However, this region differs significantly from the N-terminal domain of ubiquitous MtCKs from these three species, particularly in residues 40–42. In the sMtCKs, a balance of positive and negative charges are present in this region. Previous reports showed that removal of N-terminal pentapeptide of mature chicken sMtCK by limited proteolysis drastically destabilized octamer formation in vitro (15Kaldis P. Furter R. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and suggested an important role for the highly conserved glutamic acid 43. Based upon these previous in vitro results, we postulated that charged amino acids would play an important role in retention of sMtCK as an octamer and be crucial for coupling of sMtCK with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. To test this hypothesis, we created mutations in the sMtCK mRNA, substituting arginine 42, both glutamic acid 43 and histidine 45, or lysine 46 with glycine codons by primer-directed mutagenesis. The Glu43/His45 double mutant was created because of the previous in vitro study (15Kaldis P. Furter R. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) implicating E43 in octamer formation. The impact of each mutation on sMtCK enzymatic function, inner mitochondrial membrane binding, and octamer formation was examined after expression in cardiomyocytes and E. coli. We chose the neonatal rat cardiomyocyte primary culture system to test sMtCK octamer formation and binding with inner mitochondrial membrane because of the low level of the endogenous sMtCK expression, the high number of mitochondria, and sufficient organ size to isolate enough cardiomyocytes for transfection and biochemical analyses. We first characterized this system by analyzing expression of endogenous CK isoenzymes. Total CK activity in nontransfected, cultured cells was 0.96 ± 0.15 IU/mg of protein. In mitochondria isolated from these cells, endogenous sMtCK activity was 0.18 ± 0.07 IU/mg of mitochondrial protein. For comparison, sMtCK activity from freshly isolated adult rat heart mitochondria is 10-fold greater (2.0–2.9 IU/mg of mitochondrial protein) (Table II). To confirm that these measured activities represent the different CK isoenzymes, we performed nondenaturing gel electrophoresis with subsequent in situactivity measurements (Fig. 2) (25Roe C.R. Ann.

Total CK activity (Fig. 2) from adult heart (lane 1) and neonatal cardiomyocytes (lane 2) could easily be separated into the cytosolic isoenzymes, MM, MB, and BB CK, and the octamer and dimer of the mitochondrial isoenzyme, sMtCK. These results demonstrate that the cardiomyocyte preparation and CK assay procedures work well in separating endogenous sMtCK from cytosolic CKs and provide a basis for comparison of sMtCK expression in transfected cardiomyocytes.Table IICK activity in cardiomyocytes and mitochondria before and after transfection with normal and mutant sMtCK cDNASourceTotal CK activityCK activity in mitochondriaIU/mg cellular proteinIU/mg mitochondrial proteinAdult rat heart2.25 ± 0.24Nontransfected cells0.96 ± 0.130.18 ± 0.07Normal sMtCK2-aPlasmid transfected in neonatal cardiomyocytes.1.14 ± 0.101.12 ± 0.09R42G2-aPlasmid transfected in neonatal cardiomyocytes.1.14 ± 0.121.13 ± 0.10E43G/H45G2-aPlasmid transfected in neonatal cardiomyocytes.1.12 ± 0.211.06 ± 0.14K46G2-aPlasmid transfected in neonatal cardiomyocytes.1.10 ± 0.141.13 ± 0.162-a Plasmid transfected in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Open table in a new tab We used the cardiomyocyte culture system to analyze expression of transfected sMtCK cDNAs. Forty-eight hours following transfection with expression plasmids containing normal and mutant sMtCK cDNA, cardiomyocytes expressed about 20% more total CK activity than nontransfected controls (Table II). Gel electrophoretic separation of total CK activity (Fig. 2) showed that cytosolic CK isoenzyme expression was unchanged and that sMtCK activity was dramatically increased, both in cells transfected with normal sMtCK cDNA (lane 3) and any of three mutant plasmids (lanes 4–6), as compared with nontransfected cells (lane 2). After isolation of the mitochondria, we determined that the overexpressed sMtCK was present in mitochondria and active (Table II). Again, cells transfected with the normal or any of the three mutated cDNAs expressed similar levels of active sMtCK localized to mitochondria. By comparison, nontransfected neonatal cells have substantially lower sMtCK activity in this assay. We conclude that all of the increase in total CK activity in transfected cells is attributable to increased sMtCK enzyme (Table II and Fig. 2). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of CK isoenzymes allowed us to distinguish the sMtCK fast moving octamer from slow moving dimer (Fig. 2). In adult rat heart and cardiomyocytes transfected with normal sMtCK, octamer is the predominant form of the enzyme (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 3). However, substitution of Arg42 and both Glu43 and His45with glycine resulted in partial dissociation of sMtCK octamer into dimers (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). The K46G substitution has a minimal effect on stability of sMtCK octamer (Fig. 2, lane 6). These data strongly suggest that the first 6 amino acid residues at the N terminus are crucial for sMtCK octamer stability. Previous studies document that sMtCK in heart is located in the intermembranous space of mitochondria bound to the IMM (27Scholte H.R. Weijers P.I. Wit-Peeters E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 291: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We developed an assay to localize sMtCK and test for binding to the IMM, both as normally expressed in heart, and after transfection of isolated cardiomyocytes (Table III). Incubation of purified adult rat heart mitochondria in hypoosmotic solution released only 15% of sMtCK, leaving 85% firmly bound with the IMM, confirmin"

https://openalex.org/W2017772094,"Oxidant stress is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of many gastric disorders. We have recently reported that histidine decarboxylase (HDC) promoter activity is stimulated by gastrin through a protein kinase C- and extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway in gastric cancer (AGS-B) cells, and this transcriptional response is mediated by a downstream cis-acting element, the gastrin response element (GAS-RE). To study the mechanism through which oxidant stress affects gastric cells, we examined the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on HDC promoter activity and intracellular signaling in AGS-B cells. H2O2(10 mm) specifically activated the HDC promoter 10–12-fold, and this activation was blocked by both mannitol and N-acetylcysteine. Hydrogen peroxide treatment of AGS-B cells increased the phosphorylation and kinase activity of ERK-1 and ERK-2, but did not affect Jun kinase tyrosine phosphorylation or kinase activity. In addition, treatment of AGS-B cells with H2O2 resulted in increasedc-fos/c-jun mRNA expression and AP-1 activity, and also led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Shc. H2O2-dependent stimulation of HDC promoter activity was completely inhibited by kinase-deficient ERKs, dominant-negative (N17 and N15) Ras, and dominant-negative Raf, and partially blocked by a dominant-negative EGFR mutant. In contrast, protein kinase C blockade did not inhibit H2O2-dependent induction of the HDC promoter. Finally, deletion analysis demonstrated that the H2O2 response element could be mapped to the GAS-RE (nucleotides 2 to 24) of the basal HDC promoter. Overall, these studies suggest that oxidant stress activates the HDC promoter through the GAS-RE, and through an Ras-, Raf-, and ERK-dependent pathway at least partially involving the EGFR.

Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs),1 such as superoxide anion O⨪2, hydroxyl radical OH, and H2O2, are generated in cells as physiological by-products of electron transfer reactions and arachidonic acid metabolism (1Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3846) Google Scholar, 2Kehrer J.P. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). An elevated level of ROMs reflecting oxidative stress is observed during a number of acute physiologic and pathological states, including sepsis, exposure to ionizing radiation, ischemia and reperfusion, and diverse inflammatory conditions (2Kehrer J.P. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidative stress is thought to play a role in many chronic disease processes, included atherosclerosis, aging, and cancer (3Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 4Zor U. Ferber E. Gergely P. Szücs K. Dombradi V. Goldman R. Biochem.

The gastric mucosa is continuously exposed to luminal oxidants generated from ingested food, bacteria, and shed mucosal cells (6Hiraishi H. Terano A. Ota S. Mutoh H. Sugimoto T. Harada T. Razandi M. Ivey K.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gastric epithelium, in conjunction with the surface mucous layer, represents the first line of defense against luminal oxidative stress (7Hiraishi H. Terano A. Sugimoto T. Harada T. Razandi M. Ivey K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); despite constant exposure to luminal oxidants, the gastric epithelium remains unaffected. However, enhanced production of ROMs due to acute and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the mucosal injury. Inflammatory and ulcerative diseases of the gastric mucosa, such as those associated with ethanol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cold stress, burn stress, ischemia-reperfusion, and Helicobacter pylori, are associated with increased oxidative stress (8Smith G.S. Mercer D.W. Cross J.M. Barreto J.C. Miller T.A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1996; 41: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Yajima N. Hiraishi H. Harada T. Dig. Dis.

Gut. 1993; 34: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa, for example, is characterized by an accumulation of active neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) (11Davies G.R. Simmonds N.J. Stevens T.R.J. Grandison A.

Ko H.G. Park C.K. Kasai H. Rhee K.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1279-1282PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, reactive oxygen metabolites may be involved in the pathogenesis of both peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer (14Drake I.M. Davies M.J. Mapstone N.P. Dixon M.E. Schorah C.J. White K.L.M. Chalmers D.M. Axon A.T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although oxidative stress has cytotoxic effects, studies have also indicated that ROMs mediate a number of adaptive biologic responses (15Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress secondary to H2O2exposure may function as a local trigger for programmed cell death (16Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), but it can also modulate the expression of a variety of genes that are involved in the immune and inflammatory response, such as the nuclear transcription factor kB (NF-κB) (17Sen C. Packer L. FASEB J. 1990; 10: 709-720Crossref Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). In addition, ROMs at low levels have been shown to induce the expression of growth factor-regulated genes, such as AP-1 (c-fos and c-jun), c-myc, and egr-1 (17Sen C. Packer L. FASEB J. 1990; 10: 709-720Crossref Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 18Nose K. Ohba M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Amstad P. Crawford D. Muehlematter D,. Zbinden I. Larsson R. Cerutti P. Bull. Cancer. 1990; 77: 501-502PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative stress appears to affect numerous signaling pathways through protein phosphorylation and induce selectively a number of genes, and thus chronic exposure to low levels of ROM may conceivably influence cell growth and differentiation. Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the major enzyme involved in the production of histamine from the amino acid l-histidine, a key step in the stimulation of gastric acid secretion (20Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tagerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both histamine and HDC enzyme are activated in the rat stomach in response to cold-induced stress (21Höcker M. Koh T.J Zhang Z. Wang T.C. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1996; 69: 21-33PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bouclier M. Jung M.J. Gerhart F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 90: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Several previous observations have suggested that the HDC gene may be activated in the stomach under conditions of oxidative stress. For example, HDC activity has been shown to be increased during ischemia-reperfusion injury to the gastrointestinal tract (23Fujimoto K. Imamura I. Granger D.N. Wada H. Sakata T. Tso P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Fujimoto K. Sakata Y. Tsunada S. Koyama T. Morita H. Ogata S.I. Matsunaga C. Gotoh Y. Iwakiri R. Dig. Dis.

Med. 1995; 209: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Experiments from our laboratory have shown that the HDC promoter is transcriptionally regulated by gastrin and the phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PMA) through a protein kinase C (PKC)- and MAP kinase- dependent pathway, acting on a 23-nucleotide cis-acting element, the gastrin response element (GAS-RE) (20Höcker M.

More recently, we have shown that activation of AP-1 is essential for gastrin-stimulated HDC transcription, although the mechanism is most likely indirect (28Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G822-G830PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that HDC may be an important downstream target of AP-1. Thus, we decided to study the effects of oxidative stress on gastric epithelial cells, AP-1 activity, and HDC promoter activity. These studies suggest that H2O2 can selectively stimulate HDC promoter activity, most likely through an EGFR-dependent signaling pathway that leads to activation of the MAP kinase/ERK pathway. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and EDTA-trypsin were obtained from Bio Whittaker, Walkerville, MA. Sulfated gastrin-17 was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, San Diego, CA. The protein kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (H-7) and the phorbol ester PMA were obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA. H2O2, N-acetylcysteine, mannitol, and dibutyryl cAMP were obtained from Sigma. The human 1.8-kb HDC-luciferase construct and the GAS-RE/thymidine kinase-Luc construct have been described elsewhere (26Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The GAS-RE/thymidine kinase-Luc construct is derived from thymidine kinase-Luc but also contains the human HDC GAS-RE sequences ligated upstream of the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase promoter. The 4XTRE-CAT construct has been previously reported (28Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G822-G830PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Fos-luciferase construct was a kind gift of Richard Treisman (29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). The EGFR dominant-negative expression (HER653) construct was a gift of Murray Korc and contains the kinase-deleted mutant of the human EGFR cDNA (dominant-negative (DN)-EGFR) under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Transfection of this DN-EGFR construct has been shown to block EGFR signaling (30Wagner M. Cao T. Lopez M.E. Hope C. van Nostrand K. Kobrin M.S. Fan H.U. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ornithine decarboxylase-luciferase construct was a gift of Juanita L. Merchant, and contained 450 base pairs of human ornithine dcarboxylase 5′-flanking DNA. The GAL4-c-Jun wild type construct contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain linked to amino acids 1–246 of human c-Jun, while the GAL4-c-Jun mutant (AA) has Ser-63 and Ser-73 of c-Jun mutated to alanines. These constructs and the 5XGAL-Luc system have been described previously (27Höcker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.O. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

Wild type ERK constructs contained full-length human cDNAs, whereas the mutants K71R-ERK-1 and K52R-ERK-2 encode kinase-deficient, interfering proteins with kinase activities <5% of the corresponding wild type kinases (31Robbins D.J.

The constructs Ha-ras-ASN17 (RasN17) and Ha-ras-Ala15 (RasN15) represent dominant-negative Ras expression constructs in which mutated Ras genes are under control of the murine mammary tumor virus promoter (32Feig L.A.

AGS-B, the cell line used in these studies, was prepared by stable transfection of the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AGS (ATCC CRL 1739) with the CCK-B/gastrin receptor and has been reported (20Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tagerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AGS-B/1.8-kb hHDC-Luc cells, derived from the AGS-B cells through transfection of the 1.8-kb hHDC-Luc construct, have also been described (26Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). AGS-B and AGS-B/1.8-kb hHDC-Luc cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% bovine calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). Transient transfections of cultured cells were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (DNA transfection kit, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) as described previously (20Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tagerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 stimulation was performed for 10 min, and cells were harvested 6 h thereafter. In time course studies, cells were harvested 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after a 10-min H2O2 pulse. Gastrin and PMA were added at stimulatory concentrations (12–24 h after transient transfection), cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed at 48 h. Luciferase assays were carried out using luciferin, ATP, coenzyme A (Promega system) with a Monolight Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). CAT assays were performed as described previously (28Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G822-G830PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and results were calculated as mean ± S.D. Values for HDC luciferase were expressed as a fold increase in luciferase compared with untreated controls. Activities in all transfection experiments represented the mean ± S.D. of at least 4–6 independent transfections. Activities varied <15% among transfection experiments. Statistical differences were calculated using the Student's t test (Microsoft Excel). Total RNA from AGS-B cells was prepared using TRIzol R reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of total RNA were separated on 2.2 m formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gels. Ethidium bromide staining confirmed that equal amounts of RNA were loaded per lane (data not shown). Probes for c-jun and c-fos probes were excised from expression constructs which have previously been reported (28Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G822-G830PubMed Google Scholar) and were labeled with the Ready-to-go kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were prehybridized for 30 min and hybridized for 60 min using Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 65 °C. Following hybridization the membranes were washed twice for 20 min each in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 25 °C, then once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 16 h at −80 °C. AGS-B cells were grown to subconfluence and then starved for 36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. Cells were then stimulated with H2O2 (10 mm final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). The lysates were precleared for 1 h by incubating them with normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Antibodies to ERK-1, JNK-1, EGF-R, and Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biochemicals), and Shc (Transduction Laboratories) were used to immunoprecipitate these proteins from cells lysates. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. SDS-sample buffer was added, and the beads were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membrane was then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) (1 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). Membranes that were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were reprobed after stripping the membrane. Stripping was performed by washing extensively with TTBS (20 mm Tris pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl plus 0.05% Tween 20) for 4 h, then incubating the membrane in a solution of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 55 °C followed by washing in TTBS for 2 h changing the buffer every 30 min. To determine ERK activity in response to H2O2, cell-free extracts were prepared after treatment of subconfluent AGS-B cells with H2O2 (10 mm). Extracts were boiled with Laemmli sample buffer, and aliquots (10 μg protein) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ERK substrate myelin basic protein (35Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Gels were subsequently submitted to denaturation-renaturation and kinase activity was measured by incubating the gels in kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP and 100 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 90 min at room temperature. Kinase reaction was terminated by washing the gels in 5% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray films, and signal intensity was determined by scanning densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer with Imagequant version 3.22 software. To determine whether oxidative stress stimulates HDC promoter activity, AGS-B cells stably transfected with the 1.8-kb hHDC-Luc construct were exposed to varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity 6 h later (Fig. 1 A). Hydrogen peroxide stimulated HDC promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion, with a 10–12-fold increase seen when using 10 mmH2O2. Stimulation by 10 mmH2O2 resulted in a measurable increase in HDC promoter activity as early as 3 h post-stimulation, with a maximal increase seen at 5–7 h after treatment (Fig. 1 B). The effect of H2O2 appeared to be selective, since no activation of the ornithine decarboxylase promoter nor of the basal thymidine kinase promoter was observed under similar conditions (data not shown). To confirm that induction of HDC promoter activity was due to increased oxidant stress and free radical generation, we examined the effect of pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine and mannitol on stimulation by H2O2.N-Acetylcysteine is a glutathione precursor known to enhance cellular antioxidant potential, while mannitol is a free radical scavenger with relative specificity for the hydroxyl radical (3Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). BothN-acetylcysteine and mannitol completely abolished HDC promoter activation by H2O2, consistent with a mechanism involving oxidant stress and a hydroxyl radical-like species (Fig. 2). Previous studies from our laboratory showed that HDC promoter activity was stimulated by gastrin and PMA through an AP-1-dependent mechanism (28Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G822-G830PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of H2O2 on the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA in AGS-B gastric cells using Northern blot analysis. Treatment of AGS-B cells with 10 mm H2O2 led to a marked increase in mRNA expression of both c-fos and c-jun, with initial increases seen at 30 min and the largest increases observed at 120 min (Fig. 3 A). We also examined the effect of H2O2 on c-Jun-dependent transactivation, using the GAL4-c-Jun (wild type and mutant) expression vectors and the 5XGAL-Luc reporter gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both H2O2and PMA stimulated transactivation by GAL4-c-Jun wild type but had no effect on the mutant construct, GAL4-c-Jun mutant (AA) (Fig. 3B). Hydrogen peroxide also stimulated AP-1-dependent transactivation, as measured using AGS-B cells transiently transfected with the 4XTRE-CAT construct (Fig. 3 C). The effect of H2O2 on c-fos gene expression was most likely due to transcriptional induction, as evidenced by a 10-fold stimulation effect of H2O2 on c-fospromoter activity in transiently transfected AGS-B cells (Fig. 3 D). Finally, H2O2 also stimulated c-Myc-dependent transactivation, as shown in studies using wild type and mutant GAL4-c-Myc expression vectors and the 5XGAL-Luc reporter gene (Fig. 3 E). These studies indicate that H2O2 transactivates c-Myc, and that the AP-1 pathway is activated both transcriptionally and post-translationally by oxidative stress in gastric cells. Since both HDC and c-fos (and to a lesser extent, c-jun) promoter activity are known downstream targets of ERK activation, we investigated the effect of H2O2 on the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the ERKs. As shown in Fig. 4 A, H2O2 stimulated both the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the ERKs. H2O2 stimulated ERK kinase activity to a greater degree (>15-fold) than either gastrin or PMA (5–10 fold) or dibutyryl cAMP (3–5-fold) in AGS-B cells (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the JNKs were not activated by H2O2, although they were stimulated (and phosphorylated) by UV light exposure (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these findings suggest selective activation of ERKs by H2O2 in the AGS-B system. Previous studies have suggested that in some cell systems H2O2 activates the ERKs through a Ras pathway that involves tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, followed by phosphorylation of Shc and the induction of Shc-Grb2-SOS complexes (3Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar,36Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the pathways utilized by gastric cells in response to oxidant stress, we analyzed protein extracts from H2O2-treated AGS-B cells for phosphotyrosine proteins by Western blotting. H2O2 induced a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (Fig. 5 A, lane 4) with molecular masses that ranged from 60 to 200 kDa. In order to examine the effect of H2O2 on the phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the adaptor protein Grb2, Grb2 and Shc proteins were first immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, and phosphorylation levels were assessed using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lanes 5–12), treatment of AGS-B cells with H2O2 resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both the 52- and 46-kDa isoforms of Shc. The increase was greater than that seen with PMA or gastrin stimulation. In addition, multiple bands representing tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, not seen with PMA or gastrin stimulation, were co-immunoprecipitated when using antibodies to Grb2 or Shc (Fig. 5 A). Several of the proteins that were phosphorylated in response to H2O2 ranged in size from 100 to 200 kDa. Since the EGFR protein is 170 kDa, we examined whether EGFR associates with Shc and undergoes phosphorylation in response to H2O2. As shown in Fig. 5 B, treatment of AGS-B cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and association with Shc, while PMA treatment did not. Gastrin stimulation also did not lead to EGFR phosphorylation (data not shown). To define the functional role of PKCs for H2O2-dependent hHDC transactivation, we down-regulated PKCs using pretreatment with 10−8m phorbol ester PMA as described previously (20Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tagerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that blockade of PKCs using PMA pretreatment had no effect on the transactivating effect of H2O2, whereas PMA-stimulated activity of the 1.8-kb hHDC-Luc construct was completely abolished (Fig. 6). These data strongly suggest that the effect of H2O2 on the hHDC promoter is preferentially mediated through activation of pathways independent of PKCs. To evaluate the importance of ERK-dependent signaling pathways for H2O2 -dependent regulation of the hHDC promoter, AGS-B cells were co-transfected with 1.8-kb hHDC-Luc, and expression constructs encoding dominant-negative ERK mutants and subsequently stimulated with a maximal concentration of H2O2. Expression of dominant-negative ERK proteins abolished the effect of H2O2 on hHDC promoter activity (Fig. 7), demonstrating that H2O2-dependent transactivation of the hHDC promoter is mediated through activation of MAP kinase/ERKs. To define the initial steps in activation of intracellular signaling cascades transmitting the effect of H2O2 on the hHDC promoter, we analyzed the role of Ras and Raf for H2O2-stimulated hHDC promoter activity. Expression of the interfering Ras mutants Ha-ras-ASN17 (RasN17) or Ha-ras-Ala15 (RasN15) abolished the effect of H2O2 on the hHDC construct (Fig. 8). In contrast, no effect on PMA-stimulated hHDC promoter transactivation could be observed (27Höcker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewic"

However, its simple presence within the erythroid lineage is not sufficient to activate the β-globin promoter. One explanation that may account for this is that post-translational modification of EKLF differs within erythroid cell populations and regulates its activity. We have therefore addressed whether phosphorylation plays a role in modulating EKLF action. First, in vivo analyses implicate serine/threonine kinases as important players in the terminal differentiation of MEL cells, and demonstrate that EKLF is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues within its transactivation region. Second, directed disruption of a protein kinase casein kinase (CK) II site, located within the EKLF interaction domain, abolishes EKLF transactivation and in vivo competition activity. Third, in vitro assays demonstrate that CKIIα interacts with EKLF, and that the EKLF interaction domain is phosphorylated by CKII only at Thr-41; however, the CKII-site mutant is not phosphorylated. Finally, the transactivation capability of EKLF is augmented by co-transfection of CKIIα. We conclude that EKLF is a phosphoprotein whose ability to transcriptionally activate an adjacent promoter is critically dependent on the phosphorylation status of a specific site located within the EKLF interaction domain, and that serine/threonine kinases play an important role in this process.

Molecular models that describe the regulation of the β-like globin cluster require that developmental controls, in addition to those that impart erythroid cell specificity, be accommodated. This is because the β-like globin cluster combines tissue specificity with developmentally regulated switching in expression of its members (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Majerus P.W. Varmus H. Hemoglobin Switching. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1994: 107-155Google Scholar). At a primary level, the identification of tissue-specific DNA-binding proteins that direct globin transcription have begun to illuminate the molecular mechanisms that establish and maintain this process (2Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although a number of these factors have been isolated and help to explain the tissue specificity of globin expression, the details of how and when they interact to establish the correct temporal expression of individual members remain elusive (3Orkin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, these events occur within the context of chromatin, where structural constraints, and their attendant modulators, add yet another layer of potential cellular control points for regulation (4Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 5Felsenfeld G.

Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Current models of transcriptional regulation invoke protein-protein interactions as being of primary importance for establishing stereospecific arrays both at the promoter (7Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) and within more complex, long-range structures, such as that thought to form at the β-like globin locus (8Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 9Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Wijgerde M. Grosveld F.

A. 1997; 94: 4566-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is an open, erythroid cell-specific chromatin domain that encompasses the distal locus control region (LCR)1 and the set of β-like globin genes. Correct developmental regulation of each gene in the cluster is thought to occur by a dynamic competition of individual globin promoters for interaction with the LCR. As a result, these models not only postulate interactions between erythroid-enriched transcription factors and coactivators, but also with the surrounding histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. Post-transcriptional alterations that modulate the formation and stability of these complexes (e.g. phosphorylation (14Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar)) can therefore provide another powerful layer of control upon the activity of tissue-specific regulators at specific times in development, leading to changes in transcript levels of selected globin target genes. One of these tissue-specific regulators is erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF). EKLF is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that interacts with the CACCC element in the adult β-globin promoter and, through its proline-rich transactivation domain, directs high-level expression of β-globin expression (15Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 16Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its interaction with the adult β-globin CACCC element is quite specific (17Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as EKLF does not interact well with the closely related bh1/γ CACCC element and is thereby implicated as a potential globin switching factor (18Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, genetic ablation of EKLF leads to profound β-thalassemia and embryonic lethality yet leaves expression of yolk sac β-like globins unaffected (19Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 20Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 21Lim S.K. Bieker J.J. Lin C.S. Costantini F. Blood. 1997; 90: 1291-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, EKLF expression is critical for consolidating the switch from fetal to adult globin and for generating an open chromatin structure around the adult β-globin transcription unit (22Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Devel. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M.L. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12267-12271Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, a paradox that has emerged from these studies is that EKLF is expressed within erythropotential tissues (24Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and cell lines (25Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Hu M. Krause D.

Todokoro K. Wojchowski D.M. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that do not produce adult β-globin. For example, murine EKLF is first expressed during development within the blood islands of the day 7.5 embryo, which produce primitive erythroid cells that only express the embryonic globins (24Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). EKLF is then expressed later in the fetal liver, where it helps generate optimal adult globin expression within the definitive erythroid cell compartment. Translational regulation cannot account for this difference in effect, as EKLF protein is present in both primitive and definitive erythroid populations (24Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Relevant to these observations is the fact that the EKLF transactivation region contains subdomains that are important for both inter- and intra-molecular interactions (16Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have postulated that phosphorylation might play a role in either/both of these processes (28Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as there are a number of consensus phosphorylation sites in both the minimal activation and the inhibitory subdomains (29Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether post-translational modification plays a role in differential EKLF activity, we investigated whether changes in EKLF phosphorylation alter its transactivational properties in vivo. Our studies point to the status of a protein kinase CKII site within the interaction domain as being particularly important for EKLF transcriptional activity. As CKII is known to modulate a number of transcription factors (30Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), we more directly examined its role in EKLF function. pSG5/EKLF, pGAL/EKLF (which contains the EKLF transactivation domain (amino acids 20–291) fused to GAL1–147), and pGAL/EKLF(20–124) have been described (15Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 16Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen X.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pGAL/EKLF/mut A23G24 and pGAL/EKLF/mut A43G44 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pGAL/EKLF as described previously (28Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pGAL/EKLF(20–124)/mut T41A and pGAL/EKLF(20–124)/mut T41D were generated with the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer (Stratagene). pCKIIα has been described (32Heller-Harrison R.A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14435-14439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All fragments were routinely purified (GeneClean) by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to ligation. pHis-EKLF was constructed by polymerase chain reaction cloning of an EKLF fragment that contained amino acids 20–376 into theNde/BamHI sites of pET-15b (Novagen). pGST-EKLF(20–60) and pGST-EKLF(20–60)/A43G44 were constructed by cloning of the 120-base pair BamHI/blunted ApaI (T4 DNA polymerase) fragment isolated from pGAL1–147/EKLF(20–124) and pSG5/EKLF(Δ60–195)/M(E43D44/A43G44), respectively, into theBamHI/SmaI sites of pGEX3X (Pharmacia). pFLAG/EKLFΔZn was constructed in two steps, first by insertion of theBamHI/filled-in fragment from pGAL/EKLF (which contains the transactivation region) in-frame into the SmaI site of a FLAG sequence-containing vector (pBFT4 from J. Licht). This places the FLAG sequence at the amino terminus of the EKLF transactivation region. The XbaI/HindII (filled-in) fragment containing the fusion protein was then cloned into the BamHI/filled-in site of pSVneoHMT-IIA (33Shoji W. Yamamoto T. Obinata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections of 32DEpo1 cells and CAT assays were as described (28Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Results are the average of multiple experiments after normalization of CAT activity to growth hormone levels (15Miller I.J.

Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of MEL cells to terminal differentiation was performed with 5 mm HMBA. Inhibitor experiments included 15 μmH7 (Seikagaku). Extract preparation and Western blot analysis was as described (24Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology. Stable MEL lines were derived from cells that had been electroporated as described (16Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with pFL/EKLFΔZn. Selection was performed in media containing 350 μg (active)/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks on poly-l-lysine-coated Petri dishes (33Shoji W. Yamamoto T. Obinata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies were picked and expanded (e.g. line 4D); additionally, lines from single clones were generated by limiting dilution (e.g.line M4D3). All lines were tested by overnight induction of the plasmid metallothionein promoter with 160 μm ZnCl2, followed by cell extract preparation (24Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak). In-gel protein kinase assays were performed as described (35Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro protein kinase assays were performed at 30 °C with recombinant CKII enzyme (New England Biolabs), 50–100 ng of substrate, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Reaction products were resolved by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Actively growing MEL cells (cell line M4D3) that had been stably transfected with the expression vector for the FLAG-EKLF fusion protein under the control of metallothionein promoter (pFL/EKLFΔZn) were resuspended at 6 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum that contained 160 μm ZnCl2. After 16 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% phosphate-free fetal calf serum (dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and then incubated for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml). The cells then were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 15 min, 1/5 volume of ice-cold 2.5 m NaCl, 50% glycerol was added, mixed, and further incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 75,000 rpm in a TL-100 microcentrifuge and the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M5 (Eastman Kodak) for 4 h followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) for another hour. The beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and once with lysis buffer. Proteins on the beads were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer to Immobilon-P by established procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the labeled band was as described (37Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coliBL21(pLysS) cells transformed with a His-tagged EKLF expression vector (pHIS/EKLF) were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacterial cell pellets were collected and lysed in buffer A (6m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0). The supernatant was applied to a charged nickel-agarose resin column (Novagen) and washed sequentially with 10 volumes of buffer A, 5 volumes of buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris) at pH 8.0, 5 volumes of buffer B at pH 6.3, and then eluted sequentially with 3 volumes of buffer B at pH 5.9, 5 volumes of buffer B at pH 4.5, and 5 volumes of buffer C (6 m guanidine, 0.2 macetic acid). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against renaturation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 20 μm oxidized glutathione) sequentially with 8m urea, 4 m urea, and 2 m urea. GST fusion protein preparations were as described (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). To begin our analyses, we addressed which amino acid might be the primary EKLF target(s) for the putative MEL kinase. Extracts were prepared from uninduced MEL cells and from cells at 24, 48, and 72 h post-HMBA induction and either probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or immunoprecipitated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The lack of an EKLF-reactive band in either case (data not shown) suggested that tyrosine may not be the amino acid that is the primary target for the MEL kinase. The alternate target would be serine and/or threonine. If modification of these residues is prevented, and if they are involved in EKLF function, one prediction would be that globin expression would be directly affected, since EKLF is a necessary component for inducing high levels of β-globin (19Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 20Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To test this idea, MEL cells were treated at a non-toxic concentration with H7, which is a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (39Hidaka H. Watanabe M. Kobayashi R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These cells were then induced with HMBA, and hemoglobin synthesis was monitored at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-induction. The results (Fig. 1) show that hemoglobin synthesis is extensively delayed in the cells treated with H7, such that at 48 h, these cells still present no evidence of hemoglobin synthesis, whereas the non-H7-treated controls are 36% hemoglobin positive after HMBA induction. This data implicates serine/threonine kinases as important players in the onset of globin synthesis during terminal differentiation of MEL cells, consistent with the prediction above. However, these experiments do not directly implicate EKLF in this type of control. To obtain more direct evidence for involvement of serine/threonine kinase(s) in EKLF function, we examined the status of the EKLF protein in MEL cells. Although our anti-EKLF antibodies have been used for Western blot analysis (24Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), they have not proven to be useful reagents for immunoprecipitation. To circumvent this problem, we established a number of stable MEL cell lines that contain an inducible flag-tagged EKLF protein, named FLAG/EKLFΔZn. This protein contains the flag epitope linked at the amino terminus to the transactivation region of EKLF in the pSVneoHMT-IIA vector (33Shoji W. Yamamoto T. Obinata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector contains a metallothionein promoter element, which makes it inducible with zinc. As shown in Fig. 2 A, these cells synthesize an inducible protein product of the expected size that is recognized by anti-EKLF antibodies. Importantly, this protein can be immunoprecipitated by the M5 anti-flag antibody (data not shown). Using this cell line we established that EKLF is a phosphoprotein in MEL cells by immunoprecipitating the induced FLAG/EKLFΔZn protein after in vivo labeling with radioactive orthophosphate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the precipitated protein (Fig. 2 B) demonstrates that serine and threonine are phosphorylated, whereas there is no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the EKLF transactivation domain is phosphorylated in MEL cells in a pattern consistent with our previous analyses. To localize potential target sites in EKLF of Ser/Thr kinase activities, we compared the murine and human EKLF amino acid sequences (25Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), particularly within the minimal transactivation domain, in search of conserved kinase target sequences. This uncovered a threonine within one consensus casein kinase II (CKII) site (TQ(E/D)D) located 23 residues from the amino terminus (Fig. 3 A). The importance of this sequence was tested in two ways. Both tests relied on construction of a mutated derivative at this site within the mouse gene, converting Thr-Gln-Glu-Asp44 to Thr-Gln-Ala-Gly44 by site-directed mutagenesis (numbering of the mouse gene is based on the initiator methionine as amino acid 19). One test, already published (28Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), utilized an in vivo competition assay which demonstrated that increasing amounts of wild-type EKLF could compete with a positive-acting factor for transcription of a reporter in the 32DEpo1 erythropotential cell line. This competitive effect was localized to the amino-terminal 40 amino acids of EKLF, a region containing the putative CKII site. Importantly, the competitive ability of this fragment was lost when the site-directed mutant described above (Thr-Gln-Ala-Gly44) was used for these experiments. However, other site-directed mutants (e.g.Ser-Ala-Glu-Thr24 to Ser-Ala-Ala-Gly24) still retained their competitive ability. The second functional test was performed by co-transfection of the GAL/EKLF chimeric activator with the pG5BCAT reporter into 32DEpo1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, this reporter is extensively activated by GAL/EKLF, and only slightly affected by a derivative that contains the Ser-Ala-Ala-Gly24 mutation. However, the Thr-Gln-Ala-Gly44 mutation almost abolishes its transcriptional activity. We conclude from these two tests that the putative CKII site located 23 residues from the amino terminus is critically important both for protein-protein interactions and for efficient transcriptional activation. These data also more directly implicate an important role for serine/threonine kinase(s) in EKLF function, particularly within its minimal transcriptional activation domain. We next utilized a number of approaches to determine if CKII (or a related activity) might be responsible for modulating EKLF activity. Our substrate for thein vitro experiments was HIS-tagged EKLF that was affinity purified to homogeneity. The ability of MEL extracts to phosphorylate this substrate was tested in two ways. First, in solution we found that uninduced or induced MEL extracts contain kinase activities that are able to phosphorylate HIS/EKLF (Fig. 4 A). Second, we used an in-gel kinase assay as a means to direct our attention to potential kinases that might be involved. In the in-gel kinase assay (40Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the polyacrylamide gel is made in the presence of EKLF. MEL extracts were then electrophoresed through this gel, and kinase activities in situ were determined by incubation with labeled ATP after renaturation. During this process, kinases in the MEL extract are resolved in the gel, renatured, and act upon EKLF substrate, which remains interspersed throughout the gel matrix (41Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 B demonstrate that there are a number of discrete activities of various molecular weights that are able to phosphorylate EKLF. These activities do not appear in the absence of EKLF substrate, excluding autophosphorylation signals from consideration (data not shown). Of particular interest is the activity at ∼40,000M r, a size that corresponds to the catalytic α subunit of CKII (30Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Appearance of this band is selectively inhibited by heparin, a known specific inhibitor of CKII (42Hathaway G.H. Zoller M.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11442-11446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the band comigrates with purified CKIIα. From this data we felt that MEL extracts contain CKII, and that this is one of the kinases that is able to modify EKLF. Further characterization of this activity was performed in solution using purified HIS/EKLF and CKII (Fig. 5). First, we found that EKLF is a direct substrate for CKII in vitro, and that serine and threonine are phosphorylated in the same amounts as observed in vivo. Second, as expected, this activity is inhibited by heparin. By optimizing the reaction conditions, we found that a 5-min incubation with 25 units was sufficient for efficient in vitrophosphorylation of EKLF by CKII. Using these in vitro conditions, we then directly tested our presumption that the Thr-Gln-Glu-Asp44 to Thr-Gln-Ala-Gly44 mutation described earlier could, in fact, disrupt threonine phosphorylation at Thr41. For this purpose we created a chimera that contained the EKLF interaction domain (amino acids 20–60; see Fig. 3 A) fused to GST, and a derivative that contained the Thr-Gln-Ala-Gly44 mutation. After phosphorylation in vitro of these purified substrates by CKII, proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophorsis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Staining for total protein reveals similar amounts of substrate; but the autoradiograph reveals a significant drop in the ability of the mutant substrate to be phosphorylated (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that threonine was the only amino acid phosphorylated within this substrate, and that this site was no longer a suitable substrate for casein kinase II after mutation of the adjacent amino acids (Fig. 6 B). Although these data are consistent with Thr41 status playing a role in EKLF function, we directly tested this notion by changing it to either alanine (to eliminate it as a substrate for phosphorylation) or aspartic acid (to mimic the negative charge seen in phosphothreonine (43Hoeffler W.K. Levinson A.D. Bauer E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 44Oelgeschlager M. Krieg J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) and testing their transactivational abilityin vivo (Fig. 7). Co-transfection of the GAL/EKLF(20–124) chimeric activator and its derivatives indicates that the T41A alteration leads to a drastic drop in its transactivational activity, demonstrating the importance of threonine at position 41. However, the T41D compensatory acidic replacement works as well as wild-type,"

While the cellular response can be as distinct as growth stimulation or growth inhibition, it appears as though a similar receptor system is utilized for both pathways.

Although a great deal of information has been generated documenting potential receptor interactions required for TGFβ signaling, the endocytic fate of the receptor-ligand complex is essentially unexplored. Typically, once growth factor receptors bind ligand, they are endocytosed through structures referred to as clathrin-coated pits (25Lamaze C. Schmid S. Curr. Opin.

BioEssays. 1992; 14: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The endocytic process usually requires the intrinsic enzymatic (kinase) activity of the receptor and is mediated via defined elements routinely found in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (28Carpentier J.L.

While much of our current understanding surrounding growth factor receptor endocytosis derives from studies performed on the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptor tyrosine kinases, relatively little has been done investigating these processes in the TGFβ receptor superfamily. Since the signaling mechanism, intrinsic receptor kinase activity, and biology of the two receptor systems differ, it is unknown whether the paradigms developed for the receptor tyrosine kinases will be operative in the TGFβ serine/threonine receptor family. TGFβ receptors have been previously reported to undergo down-regulation after ligand binding in some cell types but not in others (6Muramatsu M. Yan J. Eto K. Tomoda T. Yamada R. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6181-6188PubMed Google Scholar). While this might simply represent cell type differences, it is now possible to evaluate these earlier studies in the context that both heteromeric and homomeric TGFβ receptor interactions have been documented on the cell surface (38Chen R.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For instance, ligand binding to homomeric type II receptor oligomers might result in a distinct endocytic response from that observed following activation of signaling competent type I-type II receptor heteromers. In that regard, our recent studies have shown that while type I-type I, type II-type II, or type I-type II TGFβ receptor oligomerization in mesenchymal AKR-2B cells results in the internalization of bound ligand, only signaling-competent type I-type II TGFβ receptor heteromers are down-regulated (40Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although that study demonstrated distinct endocytic responses of heteromeric and homomeric TGFβ receptors, it did not address the potential regulatory role for receptor serine/threonine kinase activity, nor did it determine whether the endocytic and signaling responses were independently regulated. In the present paper, we have employed chimeric receptors consisting of the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) α and β receptor ligand binding domain fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of kinase-inactive type I and type II TGFβ receptors to examine the role of TGFβ receptor kinase activity in receptor trafficking and signaling. Consistent with previous reports in epithelial cells (7Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 8Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar), we find an obligate requirement for both type I and type II TGFβ receptor kinase activity in mediating heteromeric receptor signaling in mesenchymal cells. However, in contrast to that observed for receptor signaling, a differential requirement for receptor kinase activity in modulating the endocytic response of the receptor complex was observed. For instance, while internalization and down-regulation occurred independently of the type I receptor kinase, type II receptor-transphosphorylating activity was needed for optimal endocytosis. Thus, in addition to activating downstream effector molecules, type I receptor phosphorylation (by the type II TGFβ receptor) is similarly required to promote internalization and down-regulation of the TGFβ receptor complex. Recombinant human GM-CSF was a generous gift from DNAX Research Institute (Palo Alto, CA) and recombinant human TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA) or R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

SC 458; anti-human GM-CSF β receptor, Santa Cruz catalog no. 457; or control mouse ascities, Sigma catalog no. M-8273) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. Cells were washed twice with antibody buffer and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Sigma catalog no. F-2012). Following a 45-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed; fixed in 500 μl of PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4; and filtered through a 40-μm nylon filter prior to flow analysis using a Beckton Dickinson FACS Vantage with PCLYSIS version 1.1 software. Cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes at 2 × 105cells/well 24 h before treatment. The serum containing medium was removed, and the cultures were placed in 1.0 ml of serum-free DMEM lacking methionine but supplemented with the indicated growth factors. Following a 2-h treatment at 37 °C, wells were pulsed for 2 h with 50 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and processed by washing once with PBS; three times with 10 mm Tris, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), pH 8.0; twice with 2 mm Tris, pH 8.0; and once with PBS (41Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matrix proteins were eluted from the wells by the addition of 100 μl the 2× Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol, separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and processed for fluorography. Cells were plated in six-well dishes (9.6 cm2) at 1.5 × 105 per well 24 h prior to transfection. Three μg of 3TP-Lux, 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase, and 7 μl of TransIT LT2 (Mirus Corp, Madison WI) were combined with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) to a final volume of 100 μl, and transfection was performed as described previously (4Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cultures were then stimulated in 5% FBS/DMEM for 24 h in the presence or absence of TGFβ or GM-CSF, and luciferase activity was determined following normalization for transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase. Cells were plated in six-well dishes (9.6 cm2/well) at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 5% FBS/DMEM. Following 24 h at 37 °C, internalization assays were initiated by incubation at 4 °C for 2–4 h in binding buffer (0.3 ml DMEM containing 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 100 pm125I-GM-CSF (119 μCi/μg; NEN Life Science Products). Once equilibrium had been reached, the plates were washed two times with binding buffer containing 75% horse serum and then placed at 37 °C in 5% FBS/DMEM for various times to promote receptor endocytosis. To calculate the percentage of internalization (i.e. specific cpm in cell/specific surface cpm), the cultures were returned to 4 °C, and the remaining surface-bound ligand was removed by acid washing (PBS, pH 3.0) and the internalized ligand was determined by cell lysis in 0.2 m NaOH, 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All time points contained parallel plates with 25-fold excess cold GM-CSF to document specificity of binding. Potassium depletion of cells was performed essentially as described by Larkin et al. (42Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and Sorkin et al. (43Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Following an initial 5-min hypotonic shock with DMEM/H2O (1:1) at 37 °C, cultures were incubated for 10 min in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and 30 min in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Cells were then placed at 4 °C (in buffer B) for 15 min and replaced with buffer B containing 100 pm125I-GM-CSF. Control cells were treated similarly but did not undergo initial hypotonic shock, and subsequent incubations in buffers A and B contained 10 mm KCl. Similar conditions as described above for internalization assays were used to determine receptor down-regulation. The primary difference being that the cultures were first incubated at 37 °C with 5% FBS/DMEM containing unlabeled GM-CSF (520 pm or 10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Surface bound ligand was removed by acid washing (PBS, pH 3.0), and the remaining cell surface receptor binding determined by incubation at 4 °C for 2–4 h with 100 pm125I-GM-CSF. The plates were then washed two times with cold 75% horse serum, 25% binding buffer, and specifically bound 125I-GM-CSF was determined. Control studies had shown that acid washing removed 90–95% of receptor-bound ligand without affecting subsequent binding (data not shown). Once the chimeric receptor cDNAs were mutated and their sequences were confirmed, they were stably transfected into mouse fibroblast AKR-2B cells in α and β pairs to generate high affinity ligand-dependent heteromeric complex formation. The designation αIβII, for example, represents clones expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the ligand binding domain of the GM-CSF α receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the type I TGFβ receptor and the ligand binding domain of the GM-CSF β receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the type II TGFβ receptor (4Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 600 series of clones contain a wild type chimeric type I TGFβ receptor co-expressed with a kinase-inactive chimeric type II TGFβ receptor, and the 700 series contain a wild type chimeric type II TGFβ receptor co-expressed with a kinase-inactive chimeric type I TGFβ receptor. Individual clones were isolated by ring subcloning and initially screened for membrane expression of the chimeric receptors by FACS (Fig. 1). Our previous work has shown that the parental AKR-2B cell line does not show specific staining for these receptors (4Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Once clones were shown to express the chimeric receptors, their ability to specifically bind radiolabeled GM-CSF was determined (data not shown). The parental AKR-2B cells showed no significant binding, which increased to >85% specific binding when wild type chimeric αIβII receptors were expressed (4Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For each of the mutated chimeric receptors, similar amounts of specific GM-CSF binding ranging from 70 to 90% of total binding was seen. Once expression and ligand binding of the chimeric receptors was confirmed, we wished to determine whether the chimeric kinase-dead receptors responded in a similar fashion to that reported for kinase-inactive endogenous TGFβ receptors (2Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 44ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This was addressed by examining the ability of the chimeric and endogenous TGFβ receptors to stimulate expression of the extracellular matrix-associated protein plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). As shown in Fig. 2, clone A105 (expresses wild type chimeric receptors) stimulates PAI-1 production when treated with either GM-CSF or TGFβ (activates chimeric or endogenous TGFβ receptors, respectively). However, cells expressing type I or type II kinase-dead chimeric TGFβ receptors do not induce PAI-1 protein when treated with GM-CSF at either 10 or 100 ng/ml. This does not represent a general signaling defect in the TGFβ pathway(s), since the addition of TGFβ to activate the endogenous TGFβ receptors results in PAI-1 expression similar to that observed in the parental cell line (Fig. 2). In that regard, identical ligand-dependent results are seen when the cultures are examined for their ability to form colonies in soft agar (data not shown). Transfection of kinase-dead TGFβ receptors has been previously shown to function as dominant/negative mediators of TGFβ action (45Bottinger E.P. Jakubczak J.L. Roberts I.S.D. Mumy M. Hemmati P.

This inhibitory activity is presumably a reflection of the requirement for TGFβ receptor oligomerization in signal propagation (4Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Luo K. Lodish H.F.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic domains of the type I and type II TGFβ receptors have been shown to form both receptor heteromers and homomers in overexpressing COS cells and yeast two-hybrid screens (38Chen R.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kawabata M. Chytil A. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5625-5630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, however, shows that signaling through endogenous TGFβ receptors occurs independently of the expression of kinase-inactive (signaling-incompetent) chimeric TGFβ receptors. To address this potential paradox, the studies shown in Fig. 3 were performed. Representative chimeric kinase-inactive type I and type II TGFβ-expressing clones (A706 and A608, respectively) were stimulated with TGFβ, GM-CSF, or TGFβ plus GM-CSF, and the effect on PAI-1 protein secretion was determined. As expected, treatment with GM-CSF at either 10 or 100 ng/ml was unable to activate the kinase-dead chimeric receptors, while the addition of TGFβ stimulated PAI-1 protein expression through endogenous TGFβ receptor signaling. In order to determine whether PAI-1 expression was regulated by the oligomerization state of both the chimeric and endogenous receptor system, cultures were simultaneously treated with GM-CSF and TGFβ, and synthesis of PAI-1 protein was determined. The results show independent TGFβ receptor signaling regardless of the heteromerization state of the kinase-dead receptors. Thus, in either the absence or presence of GM-CSF, kinase-dead chimeric receptors are unable to form a functional association (i.e. act as a dominant/negative) with endogenous TGFβ receptors. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that both homomeric and heteromeric TGFβ receptor combinations internalize ligand at similar rates in a clathrin-dependent manner (40Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the receptor elements or activities regulating this response have not been identified or characterized. Since the kinase activity of the chimeric type I and type II TGFβ receptor is required for signaling (Figs. 2and 3) and internalization of tyrosine kinase receptor family members is dependent upon receptor k"
https://openalex.org/W1986763274,"The membrane topography of proteins that convert between soluble and membrane-inserted states has proven a challenging problem. In particular, it has been difficult to define both whether a transmembrane orientation is achieved and what are the boundaries of membrane-inserted segments. In this report the fluorescence of bimane-labeled Cys residues and the binding of anti-BODIPY antibodies to BODIPY-labeled Cys residues are combined to define these features for helices TH8 and TH9 of the T domain of diphtheria toxin. Using a series of labeled residues the topography of these helices was examined in both conformations of membrane-inserted T domain identified previously (Wang, Y., Malenbaum, S. E., Kachel, K., Zhan, H., Collier, R. J., and London, E. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 25091–25098). In the shallowly inserted conformation these helices are found to be aligned close to the cis surface of the bilayer all along their sequences. In contrast, in the more deeply inserted conformation most TH8 and TH9 residues examined located in a non-polar environment, with the boundaries of the membrane-inserted sequences close to residues 324 and 372–374 on the cis (insertion) side of the bilayer. It was also found that residues 348 and 349, which are in the loop connecting TH8 and TH9, reached the opposite trans side of the bilayer, but did not protrude fully into the aqueous environment. These boundaries suggest the membrane-inserted segments of TH8 and TH9 form transmembrane helices about 25 residues in length, and suggest that they are connected by a tight turn. It is concluded that this combination of fluorescent techniques can be combined to obtain transmembrane helix topography.

Diphtheria toxin is secreted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The toxin can be split into two chains, A (M r 21 kDa) and B (M r 37 kDa), joined by a disulfide bond (1Collier R.J. Hayashi O. Ueda K. ADP-ribosylation Reactions: Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, New York1982: 573-592Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows diphtheria toxin consists of three domains (2Choe S. Bennett M.J.

Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The A chain is the catalytic (C) domain. The B chain contains the transmembrane (T) and receptor-binding (R) domains. Subsequent to endocytosis, the toxin reaches endosomes and membrane penetration occurs (6London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The low pH within the endosomal lumen induces a partial unfolding of the toxin, resulting in exposure of the hydrophobic regions and translocation of the A chain of the toxin into the cytoplasm (6London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, the A chain catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribosyl group of NAD+to elongation factor 2, inactivating protein synthesis. The T domain is composed basically of α-helices, several of which are hydrophobic and are likely to play a critical role in membrane insertion and translocation (2Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fuiji G.

Kaplan D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Determining whether such helical hydrophobic segments span the bilayer has been an especially difficult problem for those proteins that, like the T domain, convert between soluble and membrane-inserted forms. For example, despite much study the boundaries of the inserted sequence and the orientation of the hydrophobic tail of cytochrome b 5 in its loosely and tightly bound states has proven complex (8Ladokhin A. Wang L. Steggles A.W. Malak H. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6951-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Taylor K.M.P. Roseman M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1278: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the case of some colicin, channel domains determining the conditions under which the two most hydrophobic helices are transmembraneous (umbrella model) or non-transmembraneous (penknife model) has also been a difficult question (10Lakey J.H. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Lakey J.H. Duche D. Gonzalas-Manas J.-M. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol.

For the T domain of diphtheria toxin recent studies have concentrated on the two most hydrophobic helices, TH8 and TH9, because they are most likely to form a transmembrane structure upon membrane insertion (13Cabiaux V.

Studies on pore formation by T domain mutants are consistent with a model in which in the loop between TH8 and TH9 reaches the trans side of the membrane in the pore-forming state (14Zhan H. Choe S.

However, the details of the orientation and structure of these helices are not yet clear. Studies using electron spin resonance (ESR) have suggested a transmembrane structure for TH9 with a defined pore facing side, but did not define the precise helix boundary on the trans side of the bilayer (see “Discussion”) (19Zhan H. Oh K.J. Shin Y.-K. Hubbell W.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4856-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,20Oh K.J. Zhan H. Cui C. Hideg K. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1996; 273: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, pore formation studies measuring the effects of reaction with aqueous methanethiosulfonate reagents have been interpreted in terms of a flexible non-helical structure for both TH8 and TH9 (21Huynh P.D. Cui C. Zhan H. Oh K.J. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. J. Gen Physiol. 1997; 110: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Complicating matters, our recent fluorescence studies have shown that the T domain can exist in two distinct conformations, one of which penetrates the bilayer to a much greater extent than the other (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional methods to identify the membrane-inserting boundaries and to establish the degree of transmembrane orientation of TH8 and TH9, and analogous sequences in other proteins, are desirable. In this report the locations of a series of T domain residues labeled with bimane and BODIPY fluorophores have been evaluated by fluorescence and fluorescence quenching-detected antibody binding. The results identify the more deeply inserted conformation of the T domain as transmembraneous, and place narrow limits on the boundaries of the membrane-inserted sequence. Dioleoyl PC (DOPC),1 dimyristoleoyl-PC (DMoPC), and dioleoyl-PG (DOPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lipid concentrations were determined by dry weight. Rabbit anti-BODIPY-FL IgG,N-((4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl)iodoacetamide (BODIPY-FL C1 IA, BODIPY-iodoacetamide), and monochlorobimane were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Preparation of T domain from E. coli strains expressing T domain mutants with single Cys substitutions was performed similarly to the methods described previously (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Resequencing of the mutants detected only one unexpected mutation, a T267I substitution in the mutant carrying a Cys on residue 361. A Talon Metal affinity resin was used in place of a nickel-charged His binding for purification (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Generally, a column containing about 1.5 ml of resin was washed with 1 ml of 0.25 × wash buffer (wash buffer was 90 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8), then 1 ml of 0.5 × wash buffer, 1 ml of 0.75 × wash buffer, 1 ml of 1 × wash buffer, and then a series of individual 0.5-ml aliquots of elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8). The T domain tended to elute in the last wash buffer and the first two elution buffer aliquots. The T domain fractions were combined, diluted to 50 ml with 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, and then subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a 1-ml Source-Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), eluting at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. The T domain eluted at about 250 mm NaCl. The purified fractions (detected by SDS-gel electrophoresis) were combined and stored at 4 °C. The hexa-His tag at the N-terminal was not removed (22Wang Y.

Generally, final purity appeared to be over 95% as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis. T domain concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using ε = 18,200 m−1cm−1, and converted to micrograms using an approximate molecular weight of 20,000. Those T domain mutants which labeled efficiently without unfolding were labeled with BODIPY-iodoacetamide and monochlorobimane as described previously (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H.

In all cases, it was assumed that there was full recovery of protein (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For several mutants the level of labeling was very low unless they were unfolded during the labeling reaction. These mutants (328, 331, 333, 349, 361, 366, 368, and 378) were labeled under denaturing conditions and then refolded as described previously (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J.

A small aliquot of solution containing 50 μg of mutant T domain was combined with an equal volume of 8 m urea, yielding a volume of 50–200 μl. To this solution, 3.8 μl of 8 mmmonochlorobimane in ethanol or 6.4 μl of 1.95 mmBODIPY-iodoacetamide in dimethyl sulfoxide was added and then mixed with a micro-stir bar for 1 h. To induce refolding of the T domain, samples were then diluted rapidly while mixing with 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 8, to a final volume where the urea concentration was between 0.2 and 0.4 m(22Wang Y.

Both residual urea and excess fluorescent label were removed by dialysis, as described previously (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Trp emission of the labeled protein (with or without the denaturation step) was generally between 334 and 338 nm, which was close to the value obtained with the native wild type T domain. In all labeling experiments wild type T domain was labeled (using the same protocol as for the mutants) in parallel to the mutants. The degree of labeling of wild type T domain relative to the mutants was found to be between 1 and 10% as judged by fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence was measured at room temperature with a Spex 212 Fluorolog spectrofluorometer operating in the ratio mode. Unless otherwise noted measurements were made in a semi-micro quartz cuvette (excitation path length 10 mm, emission path length 4 mm). The excitation and emission slit widths used were 2.5 and 5 mm, respectively. Trp emission spectra were measured at a rate of 1 nm/s using excitation at 280 nm. Bimane emission spectra were measured at a rate of 1 nm/s with excitation at 375 nm. BODIPY fluorescence intensity was measured for 20–30 s with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and emission wavelength at 516 nm. Background subtraction was not done for bimane-labeled protein because no significant effect of subtraction was detected. However, because of the increase in background upon addition of anti-BODIPY antibodies, it was necessary to subtract background intensities in controls lacking T domain but containing antibody from the BODIPY intensities. Samples of T domain were incorporated into sonicated small unilamellar vesicles. Mixtures containing 1 μmol of total lipid composed of 70% DMoPC, 30% DOPG or 70% DOPC, 30% DOPG (mole/mole) were prepared. These were dried under a stream of N2 at about 30 °C, dissolved in CHCl3, redried with N2, hydrated with 250 μl of 6.7 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 167 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and then sonicated in a bath sonicator (Model G112SP1T, Lab Supplies Co., Hicksville, NY) for 25 min or until optically clear. Typically, a 40-μl aliquot of the sonicated vesicles was mixed with 740 μl of 6.7 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 167 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and then 0.5–2.5 μg (10–60 μl) of fluorescently labeled mutant was added, mixed with a micro-stir bar, and allowed to incubate for about 5 min. The final volume of each sample was 800 μl and the final lipid concentration was 200 μm. For the bimane-labeled samples, bimane emission spectra were then measured as described above. For the BODIPY-labeled samples, anti-BODIPY quenching was performed as described previously (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of T domain concentration on the fluorescence, bimane or BODIPY-labeled T domain mutants were first incorporated into 30% DOPG, 70% DOPC small unilamellar vesicles prepared as described above. Then, aliquots (usually about 10 μl) of purified wild type T domain were then added to obtain a final total T domain concentration of approximately 10 μg/ml, and after a 30-s incubation fluorescence was measured as described above. Two fluorescence assays were used to evaluate the location of labeled Cys residues introduced into the TH8/TH9 helical hairpin region of the T domain. In the first, the emission wavelength of bimane-labeled residues was measured. This parameter is sensitive to exposure to aqueous solution. In the second, the accessibility of BODIPY-labeled Cys residues to binding by anti-BODIPY antibodies was determined from the quenching of BODIPY fluorescence upon antibody addition. Anti-BODIPY binding can only occur when a residue is exposed to theexternal aqueous solution (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 2That BODIPY groups exposed at the membrane surface can bind to antibody is confirmed by the efficient antibody-induced quenching of a BODIPY group attached to the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine (BODIPY FL C3 DHPE, Avanti Polar Lipids) (data not shown). In this lipid the BODIPY group locates in the polar head group region of the bilayer, about 21 Å from the bilayer center (25Weiner M. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 437-447Google Scholar). That antibody binding requires a residue to be exposed on the external surface of the membrane is confirmed by leakage studies showing that the T domain does not form pores large enough to allow the antibodies to pass through the bilayer (J. Sharpe and E. London, unpublished observations). Measurements were made on model membrane-inserted T domain in 30% DOPG, 70% PC vesicles containing 70% DOPC or DMoPC and 30% DOPG (mol/mol). We previously demonstrated that at low protein concentrations the T domain inserts into bilayers with both of these lipid mixtures, but in a less deeply inserted conformation in vesicles formed by DOPC than in the thinner bilayers formed by DMoPC (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The shallower conformation will be denoted as the P (partially inserted) conformation and the deeper conformation the TM (transmembraneous) conformation for reasons that will become clear. As shown in Fig. 1there is a marked dependence of antibody binding to BODIPY-labeled residues upon both residue position and T domain conformation. In the DOPC-containing bilayers (P conformation) there is close to 50% quenching of almost all the examined residues throughout the TH8/TH9 region. This value is close to the maximum amount of quenching that can be obtained with the BODIPY probe attached to protein (22Wang Y. Malenbaum S.E. Kachel K. Zhan H. Collier R.J. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25091-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and suggests that the P conformation is aligned with both TH8 and TH9 close to the cis surface of the bilayer, such that the BODIPY-labeled residues are basically fully accessible to antibody. In contrast to the behavior in DOPC-containing vesicles, antibody binding is significantly reduced in the case of DMoPC-containing vesicles. Quenching reaching 50% is only seen at residues on the N-terminal flank of TH8 and the C-terminal flank of TH9. In most of the remainder of the sequence quenching averages close to 25%, about half that in the P conformation. The ratio of quenching in DMoPC-containing vesicles to that in DOPC-containing vesicles was calculated to determine relative antibody binding (Fig. 2). Relative binding shows that only BODIPY-labeled Cys at positions at 322, 324, 372, and 378 are about as reactive in DMoPC-containing vesicles as they are in DOPC-containing vesicles. Quenching of residues 373 and perhaps 338 (see below) is also almost as strong in DMoPC-containing vesicles as in DOPC-containing vesicles. Except for the helix-flanking residues it was found that the generally weaker quenching of residues in the DMoPC-containing vesicles could not be significantly increased by a longer incubation time with antibody or by using a higher antibody concentration (not shown). Therefore, the partial reactivity of most residues with antibody in the DMoPC-containing samples appears to reflect a mixture of antibody-reactive and antibody-unreactive molecules. In other words, in DMoPC-containing vesicles there appears a roughly 50:50% mixture of fully antibody reactive T domain molecules, probably in the P conformation, and (except at the helix flanking regions) antibody-unreactive molecules, which we will denote as in the TM conformation. This model predicts that upon switching from DOPC-containing vesicles to DMoPC-containing vesicles, not only would those non-helix flanking residues within TH8 and TH9 that are fully exposed in DOPC-containing vesicles lose about half their reactivity, but also even those few residues that are relatively buried in DOPC-containing vesicles would lose half their reactivity. In contrast, a consistent loss of half of the reactivity would not be predicted by a model in which a single conformation is present in the DMoPC-containing samples. Therefore, the observation that the former prediction is borne out by the behavior of residues 361 and 368, which are the relatively unreactive with antibody in the DOPC-containing vesicles, yet like the more reactive residues lose about half their reactivity in DMoPC-containing vesicles, further supports the two-conformation model. Thus, the loss of antibody reactivity in DMoPC-containing vesicles relative to DOPC-containing vesicles identifies residues that become inaccessible to antibody in the TM state. The fact that this loss is seen with all but the residues at the N-terminal end of TH8 and C-terminal end of TH9 implies that the insertion of the TH8/TH9 region is oriented with only the N-terminal flank of TH8 and C-terminal flank of TH9 exposed to the external (cis) solution in the TM state. Even the TL5 loop sequence (residues 347–351), 3In the crystal structure toxin residues 352–357 form a distorted helical region. On the assumption that a more ordered helical structure is likely to form within the bilayer, we have included these residues in TH9. which contain Asp and Glu residues, is inaccessible to antibody in solution in DMoPC-containing vesicles. This pattern is most easily explained by a structure in which TH8 and TH9 form a transmembrane helical hairpin, and in which the boundary of the membrane-inserted segment on the cis side of the bilayer is close to residue 324 on TH8 and 372 on TH9 (Fig. 3, top). To confirm and amplify the conclusions obtained with anti-BODIPY antibodies, the fluorescence emission of bimane-labeled Cys mutants was monitored. As shown in Table I, residues were assigned to three classes, those exposed to a non-polar environment (which exhibited a blue shifted wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission), those exposed to a polar environment (which exhibited a red shifted fluorescence maximum), and those exposed to an intermediate environment (which gave an intermediate wavelength shift).Table IEmission maximum of bimane labeled T domains in the P and TM conformationsConformation (conditions), labeled Cys residueEmission maximum (nm)Mixed deep (DMoPC-containing vesicles)P conformation (DOPC-containing vesicles)TM conformation estimated3224691-aResults shown are the average of duplicate samples.

Open table in a new tab For almost all residues the wavelength of maximum emission was highly red shifted in DOPC-containing vesicles, suggesting that almost every residue examined in TH8 and TH9 was fully exposed to a polar environment. This indicates, in excellent agreement with the anti-BODIPY binding results, that in the P conformation the TH8/TH9 helix pair lies close to the cis surface of the bilayer. It should be noted that the large blue shift of residue 361 in the P conformation (Table I), which is an exception to this pattern, is consistent with the inaccessibility of this residue to antibody binding in DOPC-containing vesicles (Fig. 1). In contrast, in DMoPC-containing vesicles most residues exhibited a significantly more blue-shifted fluorescence, with an emission maximum shifted to below 465 nm. This shows that the conformational change detected by anti-BODIPY binding can also be detected by bimane emission. To analyze the results in the DMoPC-containing vesicles in more detail, it was necessary to determine the emission maximum of the subpopulation of T domain molecules that are in the TM conformation, i.e.to correct for the presence of the T domain molecules that are not deeply buried. We did this roughly by utilizing the estimate from the anti-BODIPY results that 50% the molecules in the DMoPC-containing vesicles are in the P conformation (or in a similar conformation), and estimating that the shift between the emission maximum in the DMoPC-containing vesicles and the DOPC vesicles would be about double if the T domain DMoPC-containing vesicles were 100% in the TM conformation. This rough approximation should be adequate because only small shifts in wavelength are being considered, and the overall intensity difference of bimane-labeled residues in DOPC and DMoPC is not large (not shown). 4It should be noted that the details of the transmembrane conformation obtained by correcting for a non-transmembrane subpopulation would only be altered slightly if the correction was omitted and the raw anti-BODIPY quenching and bimane emission maxima were used to evaluate topography. As shown in Table I, the estimated emission maximum values for the pure TM state show that the residues with the most striking red shifts were mainly in the regions flanking the N terminus of TH8 and C terminus of TH9, namely 322, 324, and 378. This indicates that these residues are fully exposed to aqueous solution in the TM conformation, in go"

In addition to its role in replication fidelity, mismatch repair contributes to genome stability by controlling the level of recombination between closely related sequences (1Fishel R.A. Siegel E.C.

InEscherichia coli, MutS and MutL act to block recombinant yield when phenotypic selection arises in the vicinity of heteroallelic markers (10Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Recent work from Zahrt and Maloy (11Zahrt T.C. Mora G.C. Maloy S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1527-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided more evidence implicating mismatch repair in recombination. Specifically, they showed that the efficiency of chromosomal gene transfer betweenSalmonella typhimurium and the closely relatedSalmonella typhi is low due to mismatch repair. Zahrt and Maloy (11Zahrt T.C. Mora G.C. Maloy S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1527-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) attributed this barrier of genetic exchange to DNA divergence and the ability of MMR to correct this event in favor of the recipient strand. Abdulkarim and Hughes (12Abdulkarim F. Hughes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 506-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) also showed that themutHLSU genes increased the fidelity of exchange 1000-fold between the TufA and TufB translation factors, whose sequences share 99% sequence identity. Mismatch repair in this case ensures that the integrity of the genome is preserved by allowing these genes to evolve in concert. The first biochemical evidence to implicate mismatch repair in homologous recombination was provided by the in vitroRecA-catalyzed three-strand transfer reaction. E. coli MutS was shown to inhibit exchange between M13 and fd DNAs whose sequence heterology is ∼3% at the nucleotide level (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since MutS was without effect on M13-M13 or fd-fd exchange, we attribute the block to the occurrence of mismatched base pairs in newly formed heteroduplex. MutL enhanced the MutS-dependent block of M13-fd exchange. Indeed, these proteins completely abolished full-length heteroduplex between these DNAs and is reminiscent of the proposed role of these activities in MMR (14Lahue R.S. Modrich P. Mutat.

MutL is believed to add to the MutS mismatch complex in an ATP-dependent fashion. Evidence for this stems from work by Grilley et al. (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed the region of DNase I protection by MutS and ATP is extended by MutL. In the experiments described here, the role of ATP hydrolysis by MutS is examined on RecA-strand transfer. Previous work by Wu and Marinus (21Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described dominant negative mutants of MutS from MNNG treatment and showed a large fraction of the isolates were missense mutations within the nucleotide binding domain (21Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is here that we have characterized two of these mutants, MutS501 and MutS506, and show that 1) mismatch binding is retained, 2) ATP hydrolysis is reduced, and 3) mismatch correction with MutS − extracts is not restored. These mutants also blocked RecA-catalyzed strand transfer between M13 and fd DNAs. That MutS501, and to a lesser extent MutS506, inhibited M13-fd and not M13-M13 exchange, suggests that mismatch recognition precludes RecA-dependent branch migration in regions of nonhomology. Moreover, that both mutants failed to completely block strand transfer in the presence of MutL suggests that the barrier to homeologous recombination is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis. E. coli proteins RecA, SSB,1 and MutL were purified as described previously (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were recovered in a sonication buffer (100 ml; 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mmMgCl2, 13.3% glycerol) and stored at −70 °C. Thawed cell paste (14.5 g) was suspended in 80 ml of sonication buffer with protease inhibitors (antipain, chymostatin, and leupeptin at 0.25 μg/ml; aprotinin and pepstatin A at 0.20 μg/ml;o-phenanthroline at 0.1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 17 μg/ml; and benzamidine-HCl at 0.16 μg/ml) and 90 mg of lysozyme, sonicated, and batch-eluted with nickel affinity resin. MutS was dialyzed against 1l of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 13.3% glycerol for 3 h, followed by overnight dialysis using the same buffer containing 200 mm KCl. MutS, at 2.5–3 mg/ml and >95% purity, was stored at −70 °C. All gel shift assays were carried out at 4 °C for 30 min in the following buffer: 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02 μm γ-32P-labeled G/T oligonucleotide (T lower 5′-CCACGTTAGCCGAATGCTAGCAAGCTTTCGAGTCTAGAAATTTAGGCTTTT-3′ and G upper 5′-AAAAGCCTAAATTTCTAGACTCGAGAGCTTGCTAGCATTCGGCGAACGTGG-3′. His6-tagged MutS501 (or MutS506) was added at the following final concentrations: 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 450 nm. Reactions with ATP were performed in a similar fashion with the addition of G/C carrier (5′-CCACGTTAGCCGAATGCTAGCAAGCTCTCGAGTCTAGAAATTTAGGCTTTT-3′; 0.133 μm) and 0.208 μm MutS (15 μl). Incubations were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 110 V using 10% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Analysis was done with ImageQuaNT from the Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 PhosphorImager. MutS ATPase activity was carried out as described by Hughes and Jiricny (28Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (24 μl) were performed in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, containing 0.75 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2, 4, 8, 18, 25, 37.5, 50, or 75 μm ATP. MutS (0.33 μm; MutS501 and MutS506, 2 μm) was added to initiate the reaction at 37 °C, and aliquots (2 μl) were quenched (4 μl; 8.3 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; 2.0 μl formamide) and resolved for 0.5 h at 25-mA constant current as described in the figure legends. Rates for ATP hydrolysis were determined by quantitating the amount of labeled Piliberated as described above. Kinetic determinations were accomplished by two methods from three independent experiments (29Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A standard reaction was carried out in a total volume of 80 ml containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 6 mmphosphocreatine, 140 unit/ml creatine phosphokinase, 14 μm single-stranded circular DNA M13 (fd), 6.6 μm RecA, 10 μm linear double-stranded fd (M13), 0.4 μm SSB, 3 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Preincubation of RecA and single-stranded circular DNA was for 10 min at 37 °C followed by linear duplex for an additional 10 min. Reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of SSB and ATP (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Aliquots (14.5 μl) were removed at 2.5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min; quenched with a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA (pH 8), and 153 μg/ml proteinase K; and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After deproteination, load buffer (2 μl; 20% Ficoll 400, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.0% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added, and samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels (0.8%) for 3 h at 6 V/cm. Reactions were carried out as described previously, except MutS (75 nm) and MutL (75 nm) were added just prior to SSB and ATP (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Control reactions were supplemented with MutS and MutL diluent buffer. For reactions with 32P-end-labeled DNA (∼50 ng; 35,000 cpm) concentration of linear duplex was adjusted with cold homoduplex DNA. Labeled duplex (75 pm; 0.5 μl) was premixed with unlabeled duplex (10.4 μm; 1.2 μl) and then incubated with the RecA-single-stranded DNA reaction as described. Footprinting reactions were carried out as described by Grilley et al. (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a 100-base pair synthetic heteroduplex fragment identical in sequence to 5591–5690 of f1MR1 and f1MR3 (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Duplexes were prepared by annealing the following oligonucleotides in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl: strand 1A (homoduplex) 5′-CCCTTCCTTTCTCGCCACGTTCGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTCTCGAGTCTAGAAATTCGGCTTTCCCCGTCAAGCTCTAAATCGGGGGCTCCCTTTAGGG-3′ or strand 1B (heteroduplex) 5′-CCCTTCCTTTCTCGCCACGTTCGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTTTCGAGTCTAGAAATTCGGCTTTCCCCGTCAAGCTCTAAATCGGGGGCTCCCTTTAGGG-3′ to strand 2 (template) 5′-CCCTAAAGGGAGCCCCCGATTTAGAGCTTGACGGGGAAAGCCGAATTTCTAGACTCGAGAGCTTGCTAGCAATTCGGCGAACGTGGCGAGAAAGGAAGGG-3′ (the underlined nucleotides indicate position of mismatch or G:C base pair). Reactions containing 5′-labeled oligoduplex (with or without a G/T mispair) and MutS, MutL, and ATP or as indicated were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C followed by DNase I at 0.1 ng/reaction (0.02 units). Samples were terminated after 20 s with EDTA (50 mm, pH 8) and precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue, and the digested products were resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (89 mm, pH 8.0 Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). DNA quantitation was performed on the Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT. Both MutS mutants (501 and 506) and wild-type were overexpressed and purified using a N-terminal hexameric histidine tag. Induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside resulted in high levels of expression, since ∼30% of the totalE. coli lysate (Fig. 1.) was MutS. However, a vast majority (∼80%) of the recombinant protein precipitated as inclusion bodies (30Wingfield P.T. Palmer I. Liang S.-M. Curr. Protocols Protein Sci. 1995; 1: 6.5.1-6.5.27Google Scholar). This was corrected by reducing the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.05–0.1 mm and lowering the growth temperature to 25 °C. Recombinant His6-tagged proteins were purified to greater than 95% purity using nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). The yield from 4-liter preparations was 40–50 mg of protein at 2.5–3.0 mg/ml. Purification of wild-type MutS (31Allen D. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was done in parallel to examine the effects of the N-terminal tag on mismatch repair. In complementingMutS − extracts, His6-tagged MutS was as proficient in repair as wild-type biochemical properties (mismatch binding/repair) for wild-type and His6-tagged MutS. This is in good agreement with studies from previous laboratories (32Aronshtam A. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Feng G. Winkler M.E. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar) illustrating no detectable perturbations due to the N-terminal tag (34Buning H. Gartner U. Schack D.-V,. Baeuerle P.A. Zorbas H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Both MutS501 and MutS506 were examined for mismatch recognition by the ability to retard a 51-mer G/T-containing oligonucleotide. Titration of His6-tagged MutS revealed a K D for a G/T mispair at 40 nm (Fig. 2 a) (15Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MutS501 mismatch was marginally affected with a K D of 55 nm. Mismatch recognition by MutS506, however, was down almost 3-fold with aK D of 125 nm. The gel retardation pattern was identical in nature to both tagged and nontagged wild-type MutS (data not shown). Discrimination for G/T heteroduplex over homoduplex DNA was 10-fold for both wild-type and MutS501 (Fig. 2 b). Previous studies have shown E. coli MutS leaves the mismatch in the presence of ATP (31Allen D. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 35Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This nucleotide-driven process was tested for wild-type, His6-tagged wild-type, MutS501, and MutS506 in the presence of 2 mm ATP. Like nontagged wild-type, His6-tagged MutS failed to bind the mismatch site in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, MutS501 and MutS506 retained mismatch binding. Both mutants essentially bound a G/T mismatch with the same affinity as that when ATP was not present. Nonspecific binding (G:C homoduplex) by these proteins was slightly affected by ATP. Further studies with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs ATPγS and AMP-PNP revealed similar results. In a related experiment, we tested binding specificity of these mutants by examining the relative accessibility of a restriction site adjacent to the mismatch (31Allen D. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). As detailed in Fig. 3 a. G/T-containing duplex DNA was protected against digestion by NheI at increasing concentrations of His6-tagged MutS and abolished by 2 mm ATP. G:C homoduplex was sensitive to cleavage byNheI at the highest level of MutS, demonstrating the mismatch-specific nature of protection. MutS501 protected against endonucleolytic attack in a similar fashion as wild-type. MutS506 was less efficient in its ability to protect against cleavage. As illustrated in Fig. 3 b, a 2-fold increase in sensitivity to NheI digestion was seen for MutS506 as compared with MutS501. Even at substoichiometric amounts of protein, both MutS501 and MutS506 remained bound to the mismatch site in the presence of ATP. These results further reinforce the gel retardation data in illustrating the mismatch specificity of these mutants in the presence of ATP. ATPase activity was examined for MutS501 and MutS506 to further characterize the dominant negative phenotype (21Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters, K m and k cat were determined for wild type, MutS501, and MutS506 to verify their role in MMR. As shown in Fig. 4,E. coli MutS hydrolyzes ATP to ADP + Pi and thus corroborates the early findings of Grilley et al. (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From three independent experiments,k cat and K m values were determined, and the data were analyzed by both Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee double reciprocal plots. As a comparison, values for MutS from S. typhimurium are presented (29Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In terms of k cat, E. coli wild-type MutS is approximately 30 times faster. This rate of hydrolysis does not seem to be dependent upon better binding, since the K mvalues are virtually identical (Table I). Moreover, it is unlikely that this difference in k cat is due to an ATPase contaminant in theE. coli preparations, because both MutS501 and MutS506 possessed different rates of ATP hydrolysis.Table IATP hydrolysis: kinetic constants comparison between S.

Values forE. coli MutS were the average of three independent experiments (S.D. of ±3.4) involving initial velocities from single ATP concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants k cat and K m for S. typhimurium MutS were taken from Haber and Walker (35Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M.

Values forE. coli MutS were the average of three independent experiments (S.D. of ±3.4) involving initial velocities from single ATP concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based upon the mutations (29Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) defining MutS506 and MutS501, we observed a dramatic drop in ATPase activity (Fig. 5) as compared with wild type. A turnover number of 7.4 min−1 for wild type was down 60–100-fold for MutS501 and MutS506 with values of 0.11 and 0.08, respectively (Table I). K m values were slightly affected with a 2–3-fold decrease in binding as compared with wild-type. It is important to note that the ATPase activities presented here were measured in the absence of DNA. We observed no difference in ATP hydrolysis in the presence of duplex DNA (data not shown), but effects of a mismatch were not tested. Mismatch repair was examined to compare the repair efficiency of MutS501 and MutS506 with His6-tagged wild-type by complementingmutS-(MutS201::Tn5) extracts. Maximum repair of closed circular G/T heteroduplex by His6-tagged MutS occurred at 0.2 pmol of protein (Table II). This corresponded well with wild-type MutS as optimum repair occurred between 0.2 and 0.8 pmol of MutS. Unlike wild type, His6-tagged MutS started to inhibit repair above 0.3 pmol. 2Repair efficiency varied among MutS preparations and inhibited at higher concentrations when purified in HEPESversus phosphate buffer.Table IIMutS mismatch repair complementation assays with RK1517RepairWith 200 fmol of MutSWith 800 fmol of MutSWild type8.414.2His6-MutS15.75.4His 6-MutS5010.70.5His 6-MutS5060.60.6Hemimethylated G/T heteroduplex DNA was treated with RK1517(mutS) extracts in the presence of varying amounts of MutS protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Repair was scored as described previously, and the amount of background repair observed in the absence of purified MutS protein was ≤0.3 fmol. Open table in a new tab Hemimethylated G/T heteroduplex DNA was treated with RK1517(mutS) extracts in the presence of varying amounts of MutS protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Repair was scored as described previously, and the amount of background repair observed in the absence of purified MutS protein was ≤0.3 fmol. Neither MutS501 nor MutS506 was able to complementMutS − extracts (Table II). Increasing the protein concentration an additional 5-fold resulted only in minimal repair (<7 fmol). These proteins also failed to block repair of wild-type MutS when added in a 1:1 ratio at 0.4 pmol of total protein (data not shown). To better define the mechanism behind the MutS,L block of RecA-mediated strand transfer, we examined the role of MutS ATPase activity in this process. Functional His6-tagged MutS was therefore tested against the ATPase-defective mutants in the ability to block M13-fd exchange (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5., His6-tagged wild type limits full-length heteroduplex formation at increasing MutS concentrations. This concentration-dependent block is in good agreement with previous studies on nontagged MutS and again illustrates no unusual perturbations due to the N-terminal histidines (34Buning H. Gartner U. Schack D.-V,. Baeuerle P.A. Zorbas H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Maximal inhibition was observed at a MutS to mismatch ratio of 1:2.5. MutS501 shows a similar ability to inhibit strand transfer as wild-type MutS. The extent of inhibition by MutS506, however, was down approximately 2–3-fold. A concentration of MutS to mismatch of 1:4 yielded a 2-fold decrease in full-length heteroduplex. Consistent with previous studies (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the rate of strand transfer between M13 and M13 was about 3 times faster than M13-fd (Fig. 6, a and b), thus illustrating that homology search by RecA is sensitive to non-Watson-Crick base pairing. M13 duplex was taken up by the RecA filamented single-stranded circular M13 within the first 10 min of incubation. The population of branched intermediates for M13-M13 exchange appeared more dispersed, indicating no barrier to branch migration. MutS failed to change this distribution in the homologous reaction (Fig. 6 a), an observation consistent with the formation of normal canonical base pairing. Conversely, branched intermediates between M13 duplex and fd single-strands accumulated as a defined species that appeared to stabilize when MutS was present (Fig. 6 b). His6-tagged MutS and MutL revealed a similar kinetics profile as that observed for nontagged wild type (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These combined repair activities completely blocked formation of full-length heteroduplex DNA between M13 and fd (Fig. 7). This barrier to RecA-catalyzed strand transfer was MutS-dependent, since MutL alone had no effect on either M13-M13 or M13-fd exchange. As illustrated in Fig. 6 b, it appears that MutL participates in this block by destabilizing branched intermediates that have accumulated in the presence of MutS (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In examining the role of mismatch repair proteins in homeologous recombination, we tested the effects of MutS501 and MutS506 on both M13-M13 and M13-fd exchange in the presence of MutL. As illustrated in Fig. 8 and 9 a, we observed that MutS501 inhibits M13-fd exchange similar to that observed for wild type. In contrast, the level of inhibition by MutS506 was down 2-fold (Fig. 9 b). This inhibition of M13-fd exchange was dependent upon heteroduplex formation as both mutants contribute little to the block of M13-M13 strand transfer (data not shown).Figure 9Kinetics of M13-fd exchange with MutS501 or MutS506 and MutL. Reaction conditions were as described in Fig. 7.

The extent of product formation was the same whether MutL was present or not (Figs. 8 and 9 a). It appears from these results that the effect of MutL requires MutS and ATP hydrolysis. In addition, it suggests the block by MutL is mismatch-dependent. A similar loss of MutL function was observed with MutS506. The amount of heteroduplex DNA, however, was 2–3 times higher for MutS506 than MutS501 (Figs. 8 and 9 b). We further characterized the DNA binding properties of MutS501 and MutS506 using DNase I footprinting. Grilley et al. (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that MutL will extend the MutS footprint at a G/T mispair in the presence of ATP. MutS501 protein retains its mismatch binding specificity and protects a region of ∼20 base pairs spanning the G/T mismatch (Fig. 10 a). This footprint is identical to that observed for wild type. Consistent with previous studies with gel retardation, MutS501 remained at the mismatch site in the presence of ATP. His6-tagged wild-type MutS, however, does not protect against DNase I digestion in the presence of ATP (Fig. 10 b). This observation is different from Grilley et al. (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with nontagged MutS. We do, however, point out that in the studies of Grilley et al. they did observe a decrease in protection due to ATP. Evidence here and elsewhere suggests MutS leaves the mismatch in the presence of ATP (31Allen D. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MutS506 bound specifically at the G/T mismatch and produced a different protection pattern than MutS501 or wild-type (Fig. 10 a). A region of approximately 8–10 bp 5′ to the mismatch is more sensitive to DNA cleavage with MutS506 than MutS501 or wild-type (Figs. 8 and 10 a). To help clarify MutL function in recombination, we examined this activity with MutS501 and MutS506 in the presence of ATP. Consistent with studies of Grilley et al. (20Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we see that His6-tagged wild-type MutS protection from DNase I increases upon the addition of MutL and ATP (Fig. 10 b, right). Neither MutS501 nor MutS506 extended the region of protection in the presence of MutL and ATP. Both mutants remained in the vicinity of the G/T mispair. Studies with ATP alone revealed a similar pattern of protection (Fig. 10 b, middle). This is in good agreement with the results from the gel retardation assays, where the presence of ATP failed to disrupt mismatch binding. Here, we present data that define the enzymatic properties of MutS mutants MutS501 and MutS506 in MMR and recombination. Gel retardation analysis shows both MutS501 and 506 retain the ability to bind mismatches. Indeed, MutS501 was as efficient as wild-type in binding a G/T mispair. MutS506 binding specificity, however, was reduced almost 3-fold. This difference in mismatch binding is consistent with thein vivo studies of Wu and Marinus (21Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who showed repair of a 2-base deletion was more efficient in mutS501 thanmutS506 mutant strains. That both mutS501 and mutS506 are dominant over wild type suggests mismatch binding is not the only criterion defining this phenotype. We do believe the results presented here offer a plausible explanation for the relative difference in repair efficiencies by these mutants (21Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial goal of these studies was to define the role of MutS,L during RecA-catalyzed strand transfer between closely related DNAs. Previous work has shown that the formation of mismatched base pairs in heteroduplex is modulated by MutS,L (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In E. coli, MutS initiates repair by binding to the mismatch site. In subsequent steps, incision at a hemimethylated d(GATC) site is dependent upon MutS, MutL, MutH, and ATP hydrolysis. It is known that a persistent and strand-specific nick will direct repair and thus bypass the MutH requirement (15Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 38Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 39Smith J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). That MutS,L and ATP hydrolysis are still required for excision reflects an intimate interaction between these proteins in governing a repair event. In this study, we examined how these repair activities interact during strand transfer by examining the role of ATP hydrolysis by MutS in this process. We demonstrate that the extent of exchange between homeologous DNAs is affected by the ability of MutS to bind newly formed mismatches. More precisely, strand exchange between M13 and fd DNAs is hampered by both MutS501 and MutS506. Since both mutants have reduced ATPase activity (60–100-fold) and failed to leave the mismatch in the presence of ATP, we attribute this block of strand exchange to mismatch binding. Based on studies from Cox (40Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 41Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RecA promotes the exchange of homologous DNAs at a rate of 350 bp min−1. Given the size of M13 phage DNA, RecA should drive the reaction to completion in approximately 18 min. Indeed, we observed 100% conversion of linear duplex to nicked circles between M13 DNAs in 20 min. The rate of branch migration for M13-fd exchange was slower at ∼105 bp min−1. Because of this difference in rates, as manifested by regions of nonhomology, we believe MutS has time to test for the presence of non-Watson-Crick base pairing. Indeed, it would be fair to assume that mismatch binding interferes with normal RecA reassociation in regions where the density of mispairs is energetically unfavorable (13Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The effect by MutL on homologous strand transfer could result from MutS-dependent translocation along the DNA via a-shaped loop structures, a process that would help stabilize MutS,L on duplex DNA after mismatch binding. Recent studies from Allen et al.(31Allen D. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) are consistent with this idea. The rate of loop formation catalyzed by MutS and ATP increased 2-fold in the presence of MutL. Moreover, the ATPase-defective mutants MutS501 and MutS506 failed to show the enhanced block of full-length heteroduplex between M13 and fd DNAs in the presence of MutL. It appears the role of MutL is confined to a step following mismatch recognition and is probably coupled to MutS ATPase activity. DNase I footprinting studies presented here are consistent with this line of reasoning. Unlike wild-type MutS, both mutants failed to expand the region of nuclease protection in the presence of ATP and MutL. However, it is not immediately obvious whether binding or hydrolysis is required for MutL recruitment to the complex. MutS could in principle undergo a conformational change once ATP is bound. Mismatch binding would then be lost, and the hydrolytic step would ensure that MutS remains in this state, thus facilitating DNA translocation over mismatch recognition. It is also likely that MutL somehow contributes to this form of MutS by stabilizing the complex on duplex DNA (28Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest MMR exerts a similar strategy in testing for the occurrence of mismatched base pairs during RecA-catalyzed strand transfer. Certainly, further studies are needed to help define other roles of mismatch repair in recombination. Based on studies in yeast S. cerevisiae two MutS homologues, MSH4 and MSH5 are implicated in meiotic recombination (42Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 43Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 44Bawa S.

Chi N.W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), could implicate further roles for mismatch repair in genome stability. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W4233260603,"Comparisons of gyre-scale acoustic and direct thermal measurements of heat content in the Pacific Ocean, satellite altimeter measurements of sea surface height, and results from a general circulation model show that only about half of the seasonal and year-to-year changes in sea level are attributable to thermal expansion. Interpreting climate change signals from fluctuations in sea level is therefore complicated. The annual cycle of heat flux is 150 ± 25 watts per square meter (peak-to-peak, corresponding to a 0.2°C vertically averaged temperature cycle); an interannual change of similar magnitude is also detected.

https://openalex.org/W1973151317,"Activation domains of eukaryotic transcription factors can be classified into at least three distinct types based on their amino acid composition: acidic, proline-rich, and glutamine-rich. Acidic activators, such as yeast GAL4 and GCN4 and herpes simplex virus VP16, have been shown to stimulate transcription in various higher and lower eukaryotic cells. Similarly, proline-rich activators also function in both mammalian and yeast cells. These activators are regarded to possess “universal” activating potentials. By contrast, several studies have suggested that glutamine-rich activators such as human Sp1 are active in higher (mammalian) but not lower (yeast) eukaryotic cells. One interpretation is that lower eukaryotic cells lack a critical co-factor necessary for a glutamine-rich domain. This reasoning is counter-intuitive because many native yeast activator proteins contain glutamine-rich domains. Here, we have investigated the activity of a glutamine-rich GAL4-Sp1 domain A (Sp1A) hybrid protein in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that GAL4-Sp1A activated a GAL1-lacZ reporter by more than 200-fold over basal when the reporter was carried on a 2μ vector. The generality of the Sp1A results is supported by our finding that yeast glutamine-rich domains from HAP2 and MCM1 are also transcriptionally active in S. cerevisiae.

Activation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is dictated by the interaction of upstream activator proteins with factors at the core promoter (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Activators usually contain two modular domains: one for binding to DNA and another for functional contact with the transcriptional machinery (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 2Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). At least three types of activation domains have been identified and characterized (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). These include the acidic (e.g. GCN4, GAL4, and VP16), the proline-rich (e.g. CTF/NF1), and the glutamine-rich domains (e.g. Sp1). Acidic activators have been shown to stimulate transcription in a range of eukaryotic cells from yeast to human (3Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 4Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 58: 1051-1077Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 5Ptashne M. Gann R.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thus, the acidic GAL4 activator of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can activate transcription when introduced intoDrosophila (6Fischer J.A. Giniger E. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 332: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), plants (7Ma J. Przibilla E. Hu J. Bogorad L. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 334: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and mammalian cells (8Kakidani H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 52: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Conversely, the “mammalian” acidic activator, VP16, functions efficiently when assayed in yeast. Similarly, proline-rich domains (e.g. CTF/NF1) also stimulate transcription in higher (mammalian) and lower (yeast) eukaryotic cells (9Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in both settings the potency of proline-rich activators is lower than that of acidic activators. In assessing the ubiquitous ability to activate transcription in higher and lower eukaryotic cells, an apparent exception emerges for glutamine-rich activators, prototypically represented by human transcription factor Sp1. Thus, several investigators have reported that glutamine-rich domains are active in higher eukaryotes but are apparently inert for transcription in yeast (10Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This had led to the reasoning that a necessary co-factor(s) for glutamine-rich domains might be absent in yeast. Such an idea appears to be counter-intuitive because glutamine-rich domains exist in many yeast transcriptional factors such as HAP1 (15Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), HAP2 (16Pinkham J.L. Olesen J.T. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), MCM1 (17Passmore S. Maine G.T. Elble R. Christ C. Tye B.-K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), PHO2 (18Sengstag C. Hinnen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and GAL11 (19Suzuki Y. Nogi Y. Abe A. Fukusawa T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Formally, the prevalence of glutamine-rich domains in yeast activator proteins does not prove a functional significance. Indeed, as yet, the glutamine-rich sequences native to yeast proteins have not been explicitly tested for transcriptional activity. In re-examining the question as to why glutamine-rich domains might be selectively inactive in yeast, we unexpectedly found that a GAL4-human Sp1A fusion protein activated transcription from a GAL1-lacZ reporter in yeast S. cerevisiae by more than 200-fold over basal. This activation by the glutamine-rich domain of Sp1A was found to be dependent on the GAL1-lacZ reporter being on an extrachromosomal 2μ-based vector; GAL4-Sp1A showed little or no activity when GAL1-lacZ was integrated into yeast chromosome. These results suggest that glutamine-rich activators are not transcriptionally inert in yeast (e.g. missing a necessary co-factor), but rather they may be subjected to limitations exerted by position effects (e.g. access to chromosomally embedded promoters) in lower eukaryotic cells. Standard media were prepared (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology: Laboratory Manuals.

Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). pGAL4-VP16 contains the C-terminal 79 amino acids of VP16 (23Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), pGAL4-CTF1 contains amino acids 399–499 of CTF/NF1 (24Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R.

Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). GAL4-SP1A(Qm) contains alanines substituted for the 14 glutamines contained in the stretch of amino acids from 83 to 124. To construct GAL4-HAP2 and GAL4-MCM1, DNA fragments containing the respective ORFs1 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from yeast genomic DNA and fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pHGX1. GAL4-HAP2 contains the entire HAP2 sequence (16Pinkham J.L. Olesen J.T. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and GAL4-HAP2(Qm) is the same as GAL4-HAP2 except for an internal deletion of the glutamine-rich segment that contains 29 glutamines. GAL4-MCM1N contains the N-terminal portion (amino acids 1–121) of MCM1 (17Passmore S. Maine G.T. Elble R. Christ C. Tye B.-K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and GAL4-MCM1Q contains the C-terminal glutamine-rich portion (amino acids 78–286) of MCM1. GAL1-lacZ/2μ plasmid was as described previously (26Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GAL-CYC1-lacZ was constructed by replacing the native CYC1 upstream regulatory sequences with a synthetic 17-mer GAL4-binding site inserted at the XhoI site (position −178) of a CYC1-lacZ reporter (27Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). HSE-CYC1-lacZ is the same as GAL-CYC1-lacZ except that the reporter is under a synthetic 15-base pair HSE (28Xiao H. The Nature of Heat Shock Response Elements. Cornell University Press, 1989Google Scholar). HIS3-lacZ was constructed by placing the Escherichia coli lacZ coding sequence under the yeast his3 promoter region from position −161 to +40 of the yeast his3 gene that contain all the regulatory sites (29Struhl K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 901-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAL-HIS3-lacZ was constructed by replacing the GCN4-binding site with a synthetic 17-mer GAL4-binding site. PHO5-lacZ was constructed by placing the E. coli lacZ coding sequence under the control of the yeast Pho5 promoter (30Nakao J. Miyanohara A. Toh-e A. Matsubara K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2613-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1340-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into yeast as described previously (32Hill J. Ian K.A. Donald G. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) as substrate (9Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared as described (33Scafe C. Chao D. Lopes J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S. Young R.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibody direct to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by chemiluminescence detection (Tropix). Of the three types of activators based on amino acid composition, published literature suggests that acidic and proline-rich activators (e.g. VP16 and CTF1, respectively) are active, whereas glutamine-rich activators (e.g. Sp1) are inactive for transcription in yeast S. cerevisiae (for example, see Ref.10Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have previously studied Sp1-viral activator interactions in mammalian cells (34Jeang K.-T. Chun R. Lin N.H. Gatignol A. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we wished to construct an Sp1-responsive promoter system in yeast, we sought to re-examine the reason(s) as to why glutamine-rich domains are seemingly selectively inactive in lower eukaryotes. To this end, we constructed chimeric proteins that contained each of the three types of activation domains fused to the DNA-binding portion of GAL4 (Fig. 1 A). As controls for the human glutamine-rich Sp1, GAL4 chimera containing two yeast glutamine-rich transcription factors, HAP2 and MCM1, were also constructed. We also deleted or substituted for glutamines in HAP2 and Sp1A to generate additional mutant proteins to specifically define the importance of these residues for activity in yeast. The promoter-reporter constructions that we used to assay for transcription are represented schematically in Fig. 1 B. Activities were assessed by co-introducing activator plasmids with “responsive” promoter-reporter into yeast. Thus, when GAL4-VP16 was co-transformed into yeast with GAL1-lacZ, GAL-CYC1-lacZ, or GAL-HIS3-lacZ, respectively, it activated each of these reporters in the range of 300–8000-fold over basal, as expected (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Similar co-introductions using GAL4-CTF1 in place of GAL4-VP16 also activated the same promoter-reporters by 10–100-fold over basal (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Next, we tested GAL4-Sp1A. Unexpectedly, we found that glutamine-rich GAL4-Sp1A activated GAL1-lacZ by more than 200-fold over basal (Fig. 2 A). To verify this finding, we assessed the function of GAL4-Sp1A on two additional promoters. Results in Fig. 2(B and C) show that GAL4-Sp1A activated both GAL-HIS3-lacZ and GAL-CYC1-lacZ by more than 20-fold over basal (Fig. 1 B). That targeting of the glutamine-rich domain to the promoter is responsible for activity was assessed by assaying GAL4-Sp1A on reporter-plasmids lacking GAL4-binding sites. Failure of CYC1-lacZ and HIS3-lacZ (both plasmids lack GAL4-binding sites) to be activated by GAL4-Sp1A (Fig. 2 D) confirmed this supposition. Activation by GAL4-Sp1A in yeast measures about 2% of that observed for GAL4-VP16. However, this magnitude for GAL4-Sp1A remains approximately 2-fold higher than that observed for the proline-rich activator, GAL4-CTF1 (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Interestingly, the latter (but not the former) is commonly regarded as a “universal” activator in both higher and lower eukaryotic cells (9Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional points suggest that the Sp1A activity in yeast is biologically significant. First, one notes that the relative potencies of GAL4-Sp1A and GAL4-VP16 in yeast mirror that seen in human cells (where Sp1A is about 1% as active as the acidic domain of VP16; Refs. 36Tansey W.P. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 37Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), suggesting comparable mechanisms of action for each protein in higher and lower eukaryotic cells. Second, activities exhibited by GAL4-Sp1A on promoters bearing GAL4-binding site(s) are physiologically typical of those seen for many native yeast activators on their corresponding promoters. As illustrated in Fig. 3, GAL4-Sp1A activates GAL1-lacZ to a level similar to that achieved with PHO5-lacZ activated by endogenous yeast activator(s) (compare GAL1-lacZ with PHO5-lacZ; see Fig. 1 B for the promoter structures of reporters). Comparable levels of expression are also seen for CYC1-lacZ when activated by either GAL4-Sp1A or endogenous heat shock factor (compare GAL-CYC1-lacZ with HSE-CYC1-lacZ) and for HIS3-lacZ whether activated through a 17-mer GAL4-binding site or through natural UAS (compare GAL-HIS3-lacZ with HIS3-lacZ). Taken together, these results support that the Sp1A glutamine-rich domain can provide physiologically relevant activation function in yeast. The observed activity of Sp1A in yeast was highly unexpected based on extant literature. Glutamine-rich domains from Sp1 have been extensively reported to be transcriptionally inert in yeast (10Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Emili A. Greenblatt J.

In comparing the conflicting findings, we noted that a major difference exists in the format of the reporters used to assay for responsiveness to glutamine-rich domains. The responsive GAL1-lacZ reporter used in our study was on a 2μ vector, whereas in previous studies the GAL1-lacZ reporter was integrated into yeast chromosome (for example, see Ref. 10Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To check whether this difference accounts for the variable activities, we reassessed GAL4-Sp1A function in the yeast strain, GGY1:171 (used in previous studies), which harbors GAL1-lacZ integrated at the URA3 chromosomal locus (21Gill G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this setting, integrated GAL1-lacZ was indeed not activated by GAL4-Sp1A but was activated by GAL4-VP16 and GAL4-CTF1 (Fig. 4, compare A withB). Hence, unlike the acidic VP16 and the proline-rich CTF1, activity of the glutamine-rich Sp1A is affected by the physical context of the promoter. This finding represents another example consistent with the concept of position effects on gene expression in yeast (38Struhl K. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The above finding that the Sp1A glutamine-rich domain is active in yeast, although initially unexpected, is consistent with our current understanding of transcriptional activation in yeast. The supposition that Sp1 was not active for transcription in yeast was based on the assumption that yeast lacked an Sp1-specific TBP-associated factor, which bridges Sp1 and the basal transcription machinery (14Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence shows that these TBP-associated factor factors are not generally required for transcriptional activation in yeast (39Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of yeast proteins also suggests that activity from the Sp1 glutamine-rich domain should be expected. A cursory examination of the yeast genome reveals the abundant presence of Sp1-like glutamine-rich motifs in many proteins. Indeed, based on known experimental results, several glutamine-rich yeast proteins (for example, HAP1 (15Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), HAP2 (16Pinkham J.L. Olesen J.T. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), MCM1 (17Passmore S. Maine G.T. Elble R. Christ C. Tye B.-K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), PHO2 (18Sengstag C. Hinnen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and GAL11 (19Suzuki Y. Nogi Y. Abe A. Fukusawa T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) are clearly indicated to be transcriptional activators. However, because, as yet, no yeast glutamine-rich motif has been tested explicitly for transcriptional activity, it remains formally possible that each of these proteins uses other discrete domains for function. To confirm the generality of activity from glutamine-rich domains in yeast, we next constructed fusions of two glutamine-rich yeast factors, HAP2 and MCM1, to GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Fig. 5 A demonstrates that both GAL4-HAP2 and GAL4-MCM1Q are transcriptionally active for a GAL1-lacZ promoter on a 2μ vector. GAL4-HAP2 measured 2-fold more active than GAL4-Sp1A, whereas GAL4-MCM1Q was 10% as active as GAL4-Sp1A. GAL4-MCM1Q, like GAL4-Sp1A, did not activate chromosomally integrated GAL1-lacZ (Fig. 5 B); however, surprisingly, GAL4-HAP2 activated integrated GAL1-lacZ roughly 2-fold better than the counterpart promoter on the 2μ plasmid (Fig. 5, compare A and B). Altogether, extending the results of GAL4-Sp1A, these findings suggest that the barrier for glutamine-rich domains in the activation of chromosomally integrated promoter might be a quantitative (as opposed to qualitative) issue. To rule out that domains other than glutamine-rich sequences accounted for the observed transcriptional activities, we next generated several mutant proteins to better define activities. First, we mutated Sp1A by substituting alanines for glutamines in this activation domain (Sp1A(Qm); Fig. 1 A). Second, we constructed a HAP2 mutant in which the glutamine-rich sequence was selectively deleted (HAP2(Qm); Fig. 1 A). Both mutants lost the respective transcriptional activities observed for wild type Sp1A and HAP2 (Fig. 6, A and B). As a further verification, two GAL4 fusion proteins containing, respectively, the N-terminal half (glutamine-less) and the C-terminal half (glutamine-rich) of MCM1 were compared in parallel for activity. Here, as expected, transcriptional function of MCM1 segregated with its glutamine-rich motif (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these results associate a transcriptionally active domain in yeast with glutamine residues. Different types of transcriptional activators provide discrete functions at the many steps that together lead to productive RNA-polymerase II transcription (41Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6898-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that in mammalian cells activators function both to recruit a TBP-containing complex to the promoter and to facilitate the egress of a correctly assembled RNAPII complex from the promoter. On the other hand, glutamine-rich activators (i.e. Sp1) seem to serve solely a TBP recruitment activity (41Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 45Xiao H. Lis J.T. Jeang K.-T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6898-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The elegant combinatorial co-operativities provided by activities from different classes of activators and the otherwise highly conserved mechanisms for gene expression between yeast and human (3Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 4Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 58: 1051-1077Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 46Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) make findings that point to selective inactivity in yeast of glutamine-rich domains provocative. This is especially puzzling in view of the prevalence of glutamine-rich factors in yeast and because human glutamine-rich activators (e.g. the human homologue of HAP2) have been genetically identified based on functional complementation in yeast (47Becker D.M. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which suggests that these human glutamine-rich activators are active in yeast. Here, we show using three glutamine-rich activators, Sp1A (human), HAP2 (yeast), and MCM1 (yeast), that glutamine-rich domains are indeed transcriptionally competent in yeast S. cerevisiae. For some glutamine-rich domains, access to integrated promoters seems to be a limiting step. However, the activity from HAP2 indicates that this might be a quantitative rather than a qualitative barrier. Overall, our results support a general conservation that includes the important class of glutamine-rich activators of transcriptional mechanisms in lower and higher eukaryotes."

Previously, we reported that most products of ornithine decarboxylase degraded in vitro by the 26 S ATP-dependent proteasome, which contained one or two Pro residues (Tokunaga, F., Goto, T., Koide, T., Murakami, Y., Hayashi, S., Tamura, T., Tanaka, K., and Ichihara, A.

Replacement of the first or second Pro residue within these epitopes by Ala resulted in a marked reduction of this epitope-derived production or their random cleavage by proteasomes, irrespective of the presence of PA28, which greatly accelerates the generation of unmodified ligands. Moreover, replacement of a single amino acid residue other than Pro in both epitopic and flanking regions by Ala or Leu had no or little appreciable effect on the SIIPGLPLSL or its derivative production. Thus, Pro residue(s) within these epitopic sequences presumably contributes to efficient production of MHC class I ligands through prevention of their random cleavage by proteasomes.

The resultant antigenic peptides are transported by a transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they become associated with MHC class I molecules and are then delivered to the cell surface to activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (7Monaco J.J.

Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome, consisting of the 20 S proteasome and PA700 (also known as the 19 S complex), is a eukaryotic ATP-dependent protease that seems to be well organized as a large complex of 2 MDa with approximately 40 different polypeptides to facilitate the rapid breakdown of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, most of which have been ubiquitinylated. Another recently identified activator, PA28 (13Ma C.-P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 11 S regulator (14Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), greatly stimulated multiple peptidase activities of the latent 20 S proteasome without causing destruction of large protein substrates, even though the proteins had already been ubiquitinylated, suggesting that it may cooperate with the 26 S proteasome in a sequential proteolytic pathway (11Tanaka K. Tanahashi N. Tsurumi C. Yokota K. Shimbara N. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that PA28 is composed of two homologous subunits, PA28 α and PA28 β, and that the genes of both were coordinately up-regulated by a major immunomodulatory cytokine, interferon-γ (15Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shimbara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N.

From transfection analysis with PA28α cDNA, Groettrupet al. (17Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) concluded that PA28, together with MHC-encoded, interferon-γ-induced LMP subunits, increases the spectrum of peptides that can be generated in antigen-presenting cells. Subsequently, this group found that specific CTL lysis of influenza-infected target cells was much greater when PA28α was overexpressed (18Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.-M. Nature. 1996; 381: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one function of PA28 is to optimize antigen processing, leading to the induction of specific CTLs in vivo. Moreover, Dick et al. (19Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) reported that PA28 is responsible for the generation of the dominant MHC class I ligand in vitro. These findings suggest that PA28 could play an important role in the generation by the 20 S proteasome of antigenic peptides capable of presentation by MHC class I molecules.Very recently, we reported that the 20 S proteasome excised the precursor decamer pRL1b (SIIPGLPLSL) peptide, but not the final octamer pRL1a (IPGLPLSL) bound to the H-2Ld molecule, from the 29-mer peptide harboring the sequence (20Shimbara N. Nakajima H. Tanahashi N. Ogawa K. Niwa S. Uenaka A. Nakayama E. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These two pRL1 peptides were identified as tumor rejection antigen peptides on BALB/c radiation leukemia RL♂1 cells recognized by CTLs obtained from spleens of (BALB/c × C57BL/6)F1 mice that had rejected RL♂1 (21Uenaka A. Ono T. Akisawa T. Wada H. Yasuda T. Nakayama E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The pRL1 peptide was derived from the untranslated region of the c-akt proto-oncogene that had been translated by insertion of murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat into the first exon of c-akt (22Wada H. Matsuo M. Uenaka A. Shimbara N. Shimizu K. Nakayama E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4780-4783PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that PA28 collaborates with the 20 S proteasome for increased and accurate excision of the immunodominant epitope (20Shimbara N. Nakajima H. Tanahashi N. Ogawa K. Niwa S. Uenaka A. Nakayama E. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it is not known why the epitopic sequence of pRL1b that is composed of many amino acid residues that are susceptible to the proteasome is resistant to proteasomal attack. To clarify this mechanism, using the 29-mer pRL1-containing peptide together with a 25-mer peptide covering the natural CTL epitope YPHFMPTNL derived from the pp89 protein of mouse cytomagalovirus (MCMV) (19Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we examined the role of the Pro residue within the CTL epitopic sequences by Ala scan analysis and found that the Pro residue(s) plays a critical role in MHC class I ligand generation by proteasomes and/or PA28. The significance of results obtained by the present study and the reason we focused on the role of the Pro residue in the production of the correct MHC class I ligand are discussed.DISCUSSIONThe peptides associated with cell surface MHC class I molecules consist of 8–10 amino acid residues derived from intracellular (also called endogenous) antigens synthesized in the cytoplasm of cells (27Rammensee H.-G. Friede T. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). To define the role of the proteasome in the antigen processing pathway, it is necessary to determine whether it is capable of yielding antigenic peptides correctly in vitro. Indeed, much convincing evidence has accumulated that the 20 S proteasome has the ability to yield CTL epitopes from synthetic short polypeptides, including the epitopic sequence in vitro (19Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G.

In addition, the TAP heterodimeric transporter seems to transport efficiently small peptides of the size of MHC class I peptides from the cytosol into the ER, although it can also transport much longer peptides at a considerably slower rate (33Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, it is not known why peptides processed by proteasomes have structural similarity to those that favor transport by TAP and binding to MHC class I molecules.The frequency of amino acids at the C termini of peptides generated by proteasomes is almost completely consistent with that of peptides associated with MHC class I expressed on the cell surface. Actually, the C terminus of epitopic peptides becomes the anchor for their binding to class I molecules. Intriguingly, however, it was found that proteasomes produced precursor peptides, but not final epitopes bound to MHC class I molecules, most of which have several extra amino acid residues at the N terminus of these final epitopes (20Shimbara N. Nakajima H. Tanahashi N. Ogawa K. Niwa S. Uenaka A. Nakayama E. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Ossendrop F. Eggers M. Neisig A. Ruppert T.

An unidentified protease(s) in the ER is proposed to contribute to trimming of longer precursor peptides to optimize their N termini for MHC class I binding (34Snyder H.L. Yewedell J.W. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2389-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Elliott T. Willis A. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently, Craiu et al. (36Craiu A. Akopian T. Golberg A. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) reported that cleavage by the proteasome defines the proper C terminus, whereas distinct peptidase(s) may generate the appropriate N terminus from extended peptides. Consistent with these findings, here we show that proteasomes excised two CTL precursor peptides, pRL1b and MCMV pp89/166–176, both of which had two extra amino acid residues at the N-terminal end of their final CTL epitopes, from synthetic peptides covering these CTL epitopes (Figs. 1 and 4). It is of interest why the proteasome excises the precursor peptides, but not the final MHC-bound forms. One possible explanation was proposed by Ossendrop et al. (32Ossendrop F. Eggers M. Neisig A. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Sijts A. Mengedé E. Kloetzel P.-M. Neefjes J. Koszinowski U. Melief C. Immunity. 1996; 5: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). They found that in vitro, the proteasome produced precursor decamer peptides FN-M8 (FNKSPWFTTL) for the correct octamer CTL epitope, M8 (KSPWFTTL), encoded by the AKV/MCF type of murine leukemia virus and that the precursor FN-M8 peptide, not the M8 peptide, was transported most efficiently by the TAP peptide pump in a permeabilized cell system, suggesting that peptides that bind optimally with MHC class I molecules are poorly transported by TAP but that when they are elongated N-terminally, their transport is improved. Thus, the proteasome seems to generate peptide fragments favoring transportation by TAP, but not binding to class I molecules. In addition, peptides carrying a Pro at position 2 from the N terminus are not well accepted by the TAP system in translocation assays (37Momburg F. Neefjes J.J. Hämmerling G.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two CTL epitopes, IPGLPLSL and YPHFMPTNL, used in the present study seem to apply to this explanation because both contain Pro at position 2, and thus it seems to be reasonable that proteasomes produced their precursor forms SIIPGLPLSL and DMYPHFMPTNL.Accumulating evidence has indicated that various CTL epitopes or their precursor peptides are generated from their synthetic peptides by proteasomes, suggesting that a mechanism must be present to prevent the random cleavage of the epitopic sequence. How do epitopic sequences resist proteasomal digestion? It is fundamentally important for these immunodominant peptides to be resistant to exhaustive degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome may have the ability to recognize peptide sequences that escape its attack. Here, we propose that the Pro residue(s) within the epitopic sequence plays an essential role in producing these epitopes. This proposal was based on our previous analysis of the proteolytic products of ODC produced by the 26 S proteasome (25Tokunaga F. Goto T. Koide T. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Tamura T. Tanaka K.

Actually, the naturally occurring short-lived protein ODC is a unique non-ubiquitinated protein degraded ATP dependently by the 26 S proteasome in the presence of antizyme, an ODC inhibitor (39Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The cleavage specificity for ODC by the 26 S proteasome, tested with ODC purified from ODC-overproducing cells and an excess of antizyme in the presence of ATP, was examined (25Tokunaga F. Goto T. Koide T. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17382-17385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results showed that the 26 S proteasome has an endoproteolytic action on ODC breakdown, occurring in a multicatalytic and ATP-dependent manner, and that the major products produced by the 26 S proteasome had lengths of 5–11 amino acid residues, which included a peptide with the appropriate size and motif to be bound by MHC class I molecules, suggesting that the 26 S proteasome has the capability of generating peptides with appropriate sizes corresponding to the MHC class I-binding peptides. However, these peptides did not cover the entire primary sequence of the ODC molecule, comprising only 15–20% of the total amino acid residues. Presumably, the undetected peptides were degraded into oligopeptides too small for detection on a reverse-phase HPLC column. Of interest is why some peptides were resistant to exhaustive degradation by the 26 S proteasomes. The 26 S proteasome may be able to somehow recognize differences in peptide sequences that allow some peptides to escape from proteasomal attack. Although the mechanism is not known, it is noteworthy that most of the proteolytic products of ODC had one or two Pro residues.In considering these findings, we speculated that the Pro residues within the epitopic sequence may contribute to the correct production of MHC ligands, allowing escape from random attack by proteasomes. In the present study, we examined this possibility. We first indicated that the substitution of the first Pro residue within the pRL1b sequence by Ala resulted in a marked reduction of pRL1b(P22A) production, suggesting the importance of this residue for efficient production of the epitope (Fig. 1 B). We also showed that the second Pro residue within the epitope sequence may contribute to resistance to digestion by the proteasome, because when Pro-25 of pRL1b was replaced by Ala, the proteasome cleaved the target peptide RLAkt12–40(P25A) in an apparently random fashion (Fig. 1 C). In addition, as summarized in Table I, substitutions of other residues within pRL1b by Ala independently had no effect on epitopic production, except for the Leu residue next to the second Pro, which may affect the tertiary conformation of the peptide surrounding the second Pro residue, which may influence proteasomal degradation. Moreover, substitution of the C-terminal end Leu of pRL1b by Ala also did not lead to pRL1b production, but this is predictable because the cleavage “P1” site is thought to be primarily recognized by various proteases. Previously, we reported that lengths of both N- and C-terminal flanking regions outside of pRL1b are required for double-cleavage production of the immunodominant precursor epitope (20Shimbara N. Nakajima H. Tanahashi N. Ogawa K. Niwa S. Uenaka A. Nakayama E. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but their sequences seem not to be important for correct cleavage because the substitution of a single amino acid residue corresponding to both flanking regions by Ala or Leu did not alter the production of pRL1b (Table II). However, it is uncertain whether the presence of Pro residues is necessary or specific to pRL1b production. These speculations required studies using various other immunodominant peptides. Therefore, we examined a different CTL epitope, the pp89/166–176 peptide, from MCMV and had essentially the same results, that is, the role of the Pro residue for efficient production of class I ligand was also consistent for production of the pp89/166–176 peptide from the 25-mer peptide harboring the epitopic sequence, because individual replacement of two Pro residues by Ala caused a dramatic decrease of generation of the epitope-derivative peptide (Fig. 4).To emphasize the role of the Pro residue in generating MHC ligands by proteasomes, we shall tentatively designate our proposal as the “Pro-rule.” To consider the Pro-rule, we calculated the frequency of MHC class I peptides containing Pro residue(s) based on an available data base (40Brusic V. Rudly G. Harrison L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It was found that mouse and human MHC class I molecules have values of 322/657 and 1239/2403, respectively, that represent the number of peptides containing Pro out of the total class I-bound peptides identified so far, calculating the frequency of 49.0 and 51.6%, respectively. However, these values do not seem to be remarkably high because the probability that a given peptide consisting of 10 amino acid residues contains one or two Pro residues can be calculated to be 39.8%. Moreover, the frequency of Pro distribution among total amino acid residues associated with class I molecules of mouse and human in peptides described above is 6.6 and 7.3%, respectively, which seems to be comparable with the value of 5.8%, the frequency of Pro distribution in 100 randomly selected proteins deposited in Swiss-Prot data bases. Thus, peptides containing one or more Pro residue(s) bound to MHC class I molecules seem not to be highly frequent, which seems to apparently conflict with our proposal that proteasomal digestion resists degrading peptides containing Pro residue(s), with the expectation of a high abundance of the Pro residue in the generation of MHC class I ligands by proteasomes. However, this expectation was not the case, as mentioned, possibly for the following two reasons. First, MHC class I molecules can bind selectively to the CTL epitopic peptides containing anchor or auxiliary anchor residues (27Rammensee H.-G. Friede T. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), but the Pro residue usually does not function as an anchor except with certain class I molecules. This selectivity is known to be a definite factor in determining the peptides that can associate with class I molecules. Second, certain peptides containing Pro residue(s) are not often transported from the cytosol into the ER by the TAP system, although this transporting defect is dependent on the position of the Pro residue in the peptide as discussed above. Therefore, a high frequency of Pro distribution is not necessary to support our proposed Pro-rule hypothesis.It is of note that approximately 40–50% of peptides bound to MHC class I molecules contain one or more Pro residues. Put another way, however, over 50% of peptides associated with MHC class I molecules do not contain Pro. Actually, Ehring et al. (31Ehring B. Meyer T.H. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Tampe R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that an Ala replacement in the epitopic sequence that does not contain Pro residues did not cause a significant change in epitope production, suggesting that the mechanism for class I ligand production seems to differ. Perhaps, the proteasome has multiple, as yet unknown, mechanisms for preventing complete degradation of target proteins for production of antigenic peptides. An alternative mechanism for the escape of random cleavage by the proteasome may be the tertiary conformation of the epitope sequence, such as a particular sterile configuration or a pattern of residues with a polarity distribution, that is, a cluster of charges or a hydrophobic region. The mechanisms for the prevention of epitopic hydrolysis are not as yet known. Further study is required to clarify this issue.In the present study, we analyzed the products generated by digestion with the proteasome from two polypeptides covering the CTL epitopic precursor peptides, SIIPGLPLSL and DMYPHFMPTNL. However, in many experiments, the sum of peptides recovered usually was not consistent with the amount of the original peptide or, to our surprise, certain peptide fragments disappeared almost completely, depending on which peptides were substituted by Ala (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The reason the proteasome produced different amounts of products remains to be uncovered, but similar observations have been reported elsewhere (19Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G.

Med. 1997; 185: 209-220Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a few papers have reported details of the products generated by the proteasome-mediated digestion at the present time. One possible explanation is that the proteasome digested into very short oligopeptides that could not be detected by present methods of analysis of some peptides. Indeed, as discussed above (see also Ref. 25Tokunaga F. Goto T. Koide T. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17382-17385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thein vitro degradation products of ODC by the proteasome were only 15–20% of the total amino acid residues, suggesting that other undetected regions were degraded almost completely by the proteasome. This assumption may partially explain the unusual degree of recovery of the proteasomal digestion products.In addition, it is noteworthy that special mechanism(s) for proteasome digestion may operate in vitro and presumably in vivo. As reported by Dick et al. (19Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G.

Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the proteasome excised epitopic or precursor peptides in a dual-cleavage manner. Actually, as shown in Fig. 2 C, the proteasome cleaved before and after the pRL1b peptide of RLAkt12–40(L26A) but did not produce pRL1b(L26A), indicating that dual cleavage is required for correct excision of the epitope derivative peptide pRL1b(L26A). Previously, we proposed the importance of both N- and C-terminal flanking regions adjacent to either end of the CTL epitope for correct production of the epitopic peptide and suggested that the f"

Carboxyl-terminal amidation is an essential modification for the bioactivity of many neuropeptides and peptide hormones. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM)1 is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the sequential α-hydroxylation and subsequentN-dealkylation of peptidylglycine substrates to yield α-amidated product peptides and glyoxylate (Fig. 1 A) (1Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A.

Commun. 1997; 241: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), separate genes encode PHM and PAL. PAM is the only enzyme known to catalyze this important modification, and all evidence indicates that PAM is involved in the synthesis of all amidated peptides. Alternative splicing of the single copy rat PAM gene yields a complex collection of several soluble and integral membrane forms of PAM (10Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The wild type PAM protein that is the subject of this study is PAM-3, a soluble bifunctional protein that has a signal sequence, proregion, PHM domain, short protease-sensitive linker, PAL domain, and carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 1 B) (10Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All of the naturally occurring forms of PAM are completelyN-glycosylated at a single consensus site (Asn-Phe-Ser) conserved from frog to human and located near the carboxyl-terminal of the PAL domain (11Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The addition of N-linked oligosaccharides to Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites in proteins is catalyzed by oligosaccharyl transferase (OST), an enzyme closely associated with the translocon and generally thought to have access only to nascent chains as they emerge from the ribosome (12Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the course of defining the carboxyl-terminal limits of the lyase domain, we observed a post-translational modification that occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on mutagenesis studies, the use of endoglycosidases and the use of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, this post-translational modification was shown to be N-glycosylation. Our data suggest that the OST has access to proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for at least an hour after translation is complete. The expression vector pCIS.KrPAM-3 (13Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used to create the various truncation mutants. Truncations were carried out by introducing stop codons with polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using antisense primers encoding 12 bases upstream of the truncation site and a restriction site (XbaI or BamHI). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was introduced into the PAM-3 gene in pBS.PAM-3 creating PAM/778s and PAM/820s. The mutated genes were sequenced in the pBS vector and cloned into the pCIS.KrPAM vector for expression. TheN-glycosylation site was abolished in PAM-1 by site-directed mutation of Ser767 to Ala in pBS.PAM-1 (14Eipper B.A. Green C.B. Campbell T.A. Stoffers D.A. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Ouafik L. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The PAL domain was created in pBS from rat PAM amino acids 1–42, His-Met, rat PAM 498–820 DNA sequence. The pCIS.PAM/778s/S767A, PAL/778s/S767A, and PAL/820s/S767A were made by swapping the AvrII-AatII fragment from pBS.PAM-1/S767A with the corresponding fragment of the respective pBS plasmids; the mutated genes were sequenced and moved to the pCIS.KrPAM vector. Stable CHO cell lines were generated by transfecting CHO (DG44) (dhfr −) cells (created by Dr. L. W. Chasin; kindly provided by Dr. Iris Lindberg, Louisiana State University) with the pCIS.KrPAM vectors with the inserts for PAM-3, PAM/778s, PAM/778s/S767A, PAM/820s, PAL/778s, PAL/778s/S767A, PAL/820s/S767A and the gene for dihydrofolate reductase, as described (16Lindberg I.

Clones were selected on the basis of PHM activity in the medium (for secreted proteins), PHM activity in the cell extract (for intracellular proteins), Western blot analysis, and by immunocytochemical analysis (6Kolhekar A.S.

The cloned cell lines were maintained in modified essential α-medium (lacking deoxynucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (6Kolhekar A.S.

The stably transfected cells were plated 1 day prior to biosynthetic labeling in 16-mm wells, preincubated in Met−/Cys− serum-free medium for 10 min and incubated for 15 min in medium containing [35S]Met/Cys (1.0 mCi/ml) (ProMix from Amersham) (pulse). The pulse incubation was followed by an incubation in complete serum-free medium for 0.5, 2, 4, or 6 h (chase). The cells were extracted in 20 mm sodium TES (pH 7.4), 10 mmmannitol with 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitors as described (13Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

The fluorographs were densitized to determine protein stability and rates of secretion as described (17Yun H.-Y. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

The PHM and PAL activities of the mutant and wild type PAM-3 proteins were measured using the 125I-labeled acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly and 125I-labeled acetyl-Tyr-Val-hydroxyglycine substrates, respectively (5Eipper B.A. Perkins S.N.

Total cellular protein was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The presence of N-linked oligosaccharides was determined usingN-glycanase (Genzyme) and endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (18Maltese J.Y. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2579-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma) (10 μg/ml) was used to determine whether attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides to the protein could occur after cessation of protein synthesis. Using CHO cell, addition of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide to the medium, inhibited protein synthesis by >85 and >95% in 10 and 15 min, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PHM (Ab 1761) as described (6Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.S.

Cells expressing PAL/778s or PAL/820s/S767A were extracted in 20 mm sodium TES (pH 7.4), 10 mm mannitol. Cell extracts representing equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were treated with chymotrypsin (Sigma) (5–40 ng) for 10 min at room temperature. The digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PAL (Ab 471) (11Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the amino-terminal portion of PAL (Ab 877) as described (6Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.S.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We expressed PAM proteins truncated immediately before the two potential paired basic cleavage sites in CHO cells, a non-neuroendocrine cell type (Fig. 1B) in order to determine the carboxyl terminus of the lyase domain. In neuroendocrine (e.g. AtT-20) but not in non-neuroendocrine (e.g. hEK293, CHO) cells, PAM is subject to endoproteolytic cleavage; the carboxyl-terminal region is removed from the 95-kDa glycoprotein to yield a 75-kDa glycoprotein (21Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Neuroendocrine-specific cleavages often occur at sites with pairs of basic amino acids and two such sites (Arg-Lys780 and Lys-Lys822) exist in PAM; cleavage could affect the catalytic activities, since in vitro cleavage of PAM has been demonstrated to increase the PHM specific activity (22Husten E.J. Tausk F.A. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9709-9717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the carboxyl terminus of the lyase domain has not yet been defined, we wanted to determine whether the choice of cleavage site could affect the activity of the lyase domain. A pulse/chase paradigm with [35S]Met/Cys followed by immunoprecipitation was used to assess the stability of the newly synthesized proteins and the efficiency with which they were secreted (Fig. 2). In each of the transfected cell lines, the newly synthesized PAM protein accounted for ∼0.5% of the total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein. We observed efficient secretion of wild type PAM-3 and PAM/820s (Fig. 2). Approximately 70% of the newly synthesized PAM-3 was secreted in 2 h, with 95% secreted in 6 h; essentially all of the protein could be accounted for after 6 h of chase. Although a single major species of PAM/820s was apparent after the pulse labeling period, a heterogeneous collection of protein appeared during the chase, with different forms observed in cell extracts and medium. Equal amounts of newly synthesized PAM/820s were recovered from cells and medium after 2 h of chase and all of the protein was recovered from the medium after 6 h of chase. Interestingly, both forms of PAM/820s were secreted. A single major species of PAM/778s appeared after the pulse labeling period. However, even after 6 h, no PAM/778s was secreted into the medium. Despite the lack of secretion, the mutant protein was stable, with over 95% of the newly synthesized protein remaining in the cells after 6 h of chase (Fig. 2). PAM/778s, and to a lesser extent PAM/820s, underwent a post-translational modification yielding an approximately 3-kDa increase in apparent molecular mass. For PAM/778s, this maturation process had not begun at the end of the 15-min pulse. After an additional 30-min chase, approximately 50% of the newly synthesized PAM/778s showed an increase in mass. This process was finished by 2 h, with essentially all of the newly synthesized PAM/778s exhibiting an increase in apparent molecular mass. Post-translational modification of PAM/820s was not as extensive, with approximately half of the protein exhibiting this increase in apparent molecular mass after the 6-h chase. PAM/778s was stable, but metabolic labeling failed to detect a secreted product, suggesting that the protein might be malfolded and therefore retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (23Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 24Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). We collected medium from cells expressing these three PAM proteins and looked for secretion of PAM protein with Western blot analyses and assays for both PHM and PAL catalytic activities. To detect these truncated PAM proteins we used an antiserum against the amino-terminal region of PAL (Fig. 1 A) (20Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From the stably transfected cell lines, cell extracts representing equivalent amounts of PHM activity were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A); a corresponding amount of medium was analyzed at the same time. Wild type PAM-3 again yielded a single major component while PAM/820s yielded a heterogenous collection of PAM proteins in cells and medium; the asterisk marks the protein form that appeared only during the chase incubation (from Fig. 2). PAM/778s was still not detectable in spent medium by Western blot, while a single major species of PAM/778s was observed in cell extracts, corresponding to the protein form that appeared only during the chase incubation (Fig. 2, asterisk). Minor amounts of the lower molecular mass form were apparent. Cell extracts and spent media from all three stable cell lines were assayed for PHM and PAL activities (Fig. 3 B). All three cell extracts yielded active PHM while PAL activity was observed only in extracts of PAM-3 and PAM/820s cells; despite the presence of similar amounts of PAM protein, extracts of PAM/778s cells did not yield any PAL activity. Assays of spent medium demonstrated the secretion of PHM and PAL activity by PAM-3 and PAM/820s cells; consistent with the metabolic labeling experiments, no PHM or PAL activity was secreted by PAM/778s cells. Since our earlier studies with PAM to which the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motif had been appended demonstrated that PAM need not progress past the medial Golgi to yield active PHM and active PAL (11Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the failure of PAM/3778s to yield PAL activity indicates that some key feature of the PAL catalytic core is missing. The wild type PAM-3 protein has one consensus N-glycosylation site at Asn765 which is 125 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus and is fully utilized (11Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine theN-glycosylation status of the truncated mutants of PAM that show an unexpected increase in mass post-translationally (Fig. 2). The presence and maturity of N-linked oligosaccharides on [35S]Met/Cys labeled PAM-3, PAM/820s, and PAM/778s proteins were determined using N-glycanase (Fig. 4) and endoglycosidase H (data shown for PAM/778s only). The wild-type PAM-3 protein was fully glycosylated at the end of the 15-min pulse as evidenced by a 3-kDa decrease in size following N-glycanase treatment (Fig. 4). Most of the newly synthesized PAM/820s protein (90%) was not sensitive to N-glycanase treatment (Fig. 4). A small percentage of the newly synthesized protein acquired an N-linked oligosaccharide during the 15-min pulse. However, about 50% of the newly synthesized PAM/820s remaining in the cells or secreted into the medium after the 2-h chase had received an N-linked oligosaccharide. The N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the secreted protein were further modified as evidenced by an increase in apparent molecular mass of 50% of the secreted protein (asterisk). The higher molecular mass secreted form of PAM/820s is sensitive to N-glycanase treatment, but not to endoglycosidase H (data not shown), indicating the presence of a mature oligosaccharide chain. No N-glycosylation of PAM/778s was apparent at the end of the 15-min pulse; newly synthesized PAM/778s was completely insensitive to N-glycanase treatment (Fig. 4). However, as the mutant protein matured during the chase incubation, an increase in apparent molecular mass was observed. After this maturation process the protein was sensitive to N-glycanase treatment, suggesting the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide (Fig. 4). All of the newly synthesized PAM/778s protein present after a 2-h chase remained sensitive to both N-glycanase and endoglycosidase H, indicating that the protein did not gain access to compartments distal to the medial Golgi. In order to determine whether the post-translational increase in mass observed for PAM/820s and PAM/778s were due to the delayed addition of N-linked oligosaccharide, the CHO cells expressing PAM/778s and PAM/820s were treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of dolichol oligosaccharide precursor formation (24Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The presence of tunicamycin had no effect on the newly synthesized mutant proteins generated during the pulse; however, the larger forms of the mutant proteins failed to appear during the 2 h after chase period (Fig. 5 A), also supporting the conclusion that the larger forms were due to the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides. To confirm the occurrence of post-translationalN-glycosylation, we mutated the single consensusN-glycosylation site in PAM, Asn-Phe-Ser767 to Asn-Phe-Ala767. Since the post-translational modification was most apparent in PAM/778s, the mutation was introduced into this truncated, secretion incompetent molecule. Biosynthetic labeling of cells expressing PAM/778s/S767A (Fig. 5 B) showed that the increase in apparent molecular mass did not occur in the chase period upon deletion of the N-glycosylation site. PAM/778s/S767A is still secretion incompetent, indicating that the presence of a consensus site for N-linked oligosaccharide addition is not an essential contributor to the retention of PAM/778s in the cells. We also investigated the ability of PAM/778s to undergo glycosylation when protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide. The protein synthesized prior to the cycloheximide blockage was glycosylated equally well in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (data not shown). Thus post-translational N-glycosylation at the Asn-Phe-Ser767 site occurs with 100% efficiency in PAM/778s and to a lesser extent in PAM/820s. We considered the possibility that the presence of a catalytically functional and properly folded PHM domain was providing stability to PAM/778s and PAM/820s and thus allowing complete or partial post-translational N-glycosylation of Asn765. To test this hypothesis we expressed the corresponding monofunctional PAL proteins in CHO cells (Fig. 6 A). Expression of the complete PAL domain lacking an N-glycosylation site, PAL/820s/S767A, yielded catalytically active protein (data not shown). Most of the newly synthesized PAL/820s/S767A protein was secreted in the first 2 h of the chase period (Fig. 6 B), demonstrating that the PAL domain is secretion competent when extended to residue 820 in the absence of the N-linked oligosaccharide. We then examined cells expressing PAL/778s to determine whether post-translational N-glycosylation continued to occur in the absence of the PHM domain (Fig. 6 C). Like the bifunctional PAM/778s protein, PAL/778s lacked PAL activity and was secretion incompetent (data not shown). Pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that PAL/778s underwent post-translationalN-glycosylation with the same kinetics as PAM/778s. Approximately half of the newly synthesized PAL/778s was modified by 30 min of chase and all of it was modified after 2 h of chase. Thus post-translational N-glycosylation at Asn765occurs with a similar time course and to the same extent, whether an active PHM domain is appended or not. The apparent molecular mass of the protein declines slightly during the chase, suggesting that modification of the oligosaccharide is occurring. The PAL/778s protein, although catalytically inactive, was quite stable, with 47 ± 11% (n = 5) of the protein remaining after 6 h of chase (Fig. 6 C). To determine whether the N-linked oligosaccharide provided stability to PAL/778s we deleted the consensusN-glycosylation site creating PAL/778s/S767A (Fig. 6 A). The in vivo stability and secretion of PAL/778s/S767A were investigated using the same biosynthetic labeling paradigm (Fig. 6 C). As expected based on our analysis of the bifunctional PAM proteins, no post-translational increase in mass was observed for PAL/778s/S767A. Only 25 ± 11% (n = 4) of the PAL/778s/S767A synthesized in the 15-min pulse was present at the end of the 6-h chase period. Thus, the presence of theN-linked sugar stabilized this inactive protein (p < 0.01 for half-life of PAL/778s/S767Aversus PAL/778s). We wanted to determine whether the newly synthesized, not yet glycosylated PAL/778s remained membrane associated, providing accessibility to OST, or dissociated from the ER membrane and was laterN-glycosylated. To address this issue we compared the solubility of non-glycosylated and N-glycosylated PAL/778s (Fig. 7 A). Approximately equal amounts of non-glycosylated and N-glycosylated PAL/778s were obtained by pulse labeling cells with [35S]Met/Cys for 15 min and then chasing with complete serum-free medium for 30 min (Fig. 6 C). Protein solubility was assessed by separating soluble proteins from the crude particulate fraction and then solubilizing the particulate fraction with detergent. PAL/778s was immunoprecipitated from both samples; an association of non-glycosylated PAL/778s with membranes would be indicated by an enrichment of this protein in the detergent-solubilized particulate fraction. No difference was observed between the solubility of non-glycosylated PAL/778s (lower band) and N-glycosylated PAL/778 s (asterisked band) in any of the 3 buffers tested; the ratio of the two species was the same in the soluble and crude particulate fractions. In the same type of experiment, PAL/820s/S767A, a soluble, secreted protein that cannot be glycosylated, showed a similar distribution between the soluble and crude particulate fractions (data not shown). These results suggest that newly synthesized PAL/778s is not membrane associated, presumably leaving the translocon and accessing theN-glycosylation machinery post-translationally. In order to determine why the PAL/778s remained in the lumen of the ER, we compared the structural integrity of secretion incompetent, inactive PAL/778s and secretion competent, catalytically active PAL/820s/S767A. Sensitivity of the two proteins to digestion by increasing amounts of chymotrypsin was used as a test for foldedness. Extracts from PAL/778s and PAL/820s/S767A expressing cell lines were subjected to increasing amounts of chymotrypsin and the effect of protease treatment on the PAL proteins was determined by Western blot (Fig. 7 B). Despite the fact that most of the PAL/778s is eventuallyN-glycosylated, it is more protease sensitive than non-glycosylated PAL/820s/S767A; for example, digestion of 10 μg of cell protein with 10 ng of chymotrypsin had no effect on PAL/820s/S767A but destroyed over half of the PAL/778s. The fact that PAL/778s is substantially more sensitive to protease treatment than PAL/820s/S767A suggests that the PAL domain truncated at residue 778 lacks structural integrity in comparison to PAL extended to residue 820. There are 4 Cys residues in the PAL domain (Fig. 1); although all four Cys residues are contained in PAL/778s, the truncated PAL domain appears to be incompletely folded, rendering the protein catalytically inactive and unable to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. In the process of the biochemical characterization of the lyase domain of PAM we discovered robust post-translationalN-glycosylation of the PAL domain and defined the carboxyl terminus of the PAL domain. We first discuss our finding thatN-glycosylation can occur post-translationally. This important modification is conserved from yeast to humans and well over half of proteins are reported to have N-linked oligosaccharides. N-Linked oligosaccharides serve diverse functions such as facilitating proper folding, transport, cellular targeting, stability in the circulation and secretion competence (24Helenius A. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) is the enzyme responsible for attaching N-linked oligosaccharides to Asn residues at consensus Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites. However, not all consensus sites in every protein are used, and it is unclear what dictates the usage efficiency of a consensus site. OST is a multisubunit enzyme located on the lumenal side of the ER membrane and is an integral part of the translocon (12Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Current dogma states that N-linked oligosaccharide is linked co-translationally as the protein is being synthesized (30Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 31Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the truncated proteins, we clearly observe post-translational N-glycosylation; approximately half of the active and secreted PAM/820s protein is N-glycosylated post-translationally and essentially all of the misfolded PAL domain of PAM/778s and PAL/778s is N-glycosylated post-translationally. The active site of OST has been mapped to 30–40 Å from the lumenal side of the ER membrane (equivalent to 12–14 amino acids in polypeptide length) (32Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This places the active site of OST in the range of 65 (33Whitley P. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Glabe C.G. Hanover J.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) amino acid residues from the ribosomal translational site. Consistent with this, N-glycosylation sites that occur near the carboxyl terminus of a polypeptide chain are frequently not completely modified (35Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar); this observation has been interpreted to mean that access of a nascent chain to the OST ends when the nascent chain leaves the ribosome and the translocon. The N-glycosylation site (Asn765) of PAM-3 is 125 amino acids from its carboxyl terminus and is fully modified. This site is merely 13 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of PAM/778s (Fig. 1 A) and PAL/778s and both proteins are completelyN-glycosylated. The proximity of theN-glycosylation site (Asn765) to the carboxyl terminus of the protein necessitates release of the newly synthesized protein from the ribosome to enable addition of the oligosaccharide. The mutant proteins must be presented to the OST at a later time. Consistent with this conclusion, the N-glycanase sensitivity of PAM/778s appears only during the chase period and the protein does not appear to be membrane bound prior toN-glycosylation. PAM/778s and PAL/778s are secretion-incompetent and remain in the ER, as evidenced by the presence of endo H-sensitive sugars several hours after synthesis, lack of PAL activity, and an unfolded, chymotrypsin-sensitive structure. Various chaperone proteins presumably retain the truncated proteins in the ER due to lack of the correctly folded conformation (24Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and present the protein to the N-glycosylation machinery post-translationally. In PAM/820s the N-glycosylation site is 55 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus; it is also post-translationallyN-glycosylated with about half of the protein beingN-glycosylated. The proximity of theN-glycosylation site to the carboxyl terminus may allow some newly synthesized PAM/820s molecules to leave the ribosomes prior to the addition of the N-linked oligosaccharide. By comparison, wild type PAM-3, which has 125 residues between theN-glycosylation site and chain termination, is fully co-translationally glycosylated. The partial glycosylation of PAM/820s could occur due to a competition between folding and accessibility of the acceptor site for N-glycosylation (36Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Guan J.L. Machamer C.E. Rose J.K.

However, it is clear that PAM/820s is stably folded and transport-competent, both with and without the N-linked oligosaccharide. The delayed N-glycosylation of these truncated proteins demonstrates that N-glycosylation can occur post-translationally in the absence of pharmacological treatment. Post-translational N-glycosylation has been observed in unusual circumstances such as on small acceptor tripeptides (39Geetha-Habib M. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13655-13660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on aglycoinsulin receptor generated by tunicamycin treatment (40Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4704-4707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with heat induced prompt glycosylation of the chaperone protein calreticulin (41Jethmalani S.M. Henle K.J. Kaushal G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23603-23609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have clearly demonstrated post-translationalN-glycosylation at a normally used consensus site without the addition of N-glycosylation inhibitors. Our study indicates that the PAL domain is catalytically viable only when extended at the carboxyl terminus to Val820. Others have also reported a recombinant rat PAM protein truncated at this position that has both PHM and PAL activities, but no shorter proteins were examined (42Miller D.A. Sayad K.U. Kulathila R. Beaudry G.A. Merkler D.J. Bertelsen A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PAM/778s includes all 4 of the Cys residues contained within the PAL domain (Fig. 1) and yet the domain fails to yield active PAL, is retained in the cell, and is protease sensitive. As observed with PAM/778s and PAL/778s, even completeN-glycosylation does not allow proper folding of the PAL domain. The region between amino acids 778 and 820 has the highest level of evolutionary conservation in PAL (89% sequence identity between frog and human) emphasizing the importance of this region. In AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells expressing soluble wild type PAM-3, the carboxyl terminus of the 95-kDa PAM protein is removed to yield a 75-kDa protein that includes active PHM and PAL domains (13Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Eipper B.A. Green C.B. Campbell T.A. Stoffers D.A. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Ouafik L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4008-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this cleavage occurs only after the newly synthesized PAM has exited thetrans-Golgi network and entered immature regulated secretory granules (21Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cleavage is neuroendocrine-specific and does not occur in fibroblasts expressing wild type PAM-3. The identity of the endoproteases that cleave PAM in AtT-20 cells is not yet clear, but neuroendocrine secretory granules contain prohormone convertases that recognize paired basic sites in prohormone substrates (16Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 94-108Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 43Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 3: 197-212Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Seidah N.G.

Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). There are two potential paired basic cleavage sites in PAM-3, Arg-Lys780 and Lys-Lys822 (Fig. 1). The fact that PAM/778s lacks PAL activity and is retained within the ER suggests that the active PAL produced in corticotropes is cleaved at Lys-Lys822. The exon 16 region present in some forms of PAM contains a Lys-Lys sequence and corticotropes efficiently cleave within exon 16 (13Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AtT-20 cells contain large amounts of prohormone convertase 1 (16Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 94-108Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 44Seidah N.G. Day R. Chretien M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and AtT-20 cells have been shown to cleave a Lys-Lys site in transfected proenkephalin (47Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The exact site of this cleavage may be a critical determinant of PAL activity. To summarize, we have identified the choice of endoproteolytic cleavage site in PAM-3 as a key determinant of PAL catalytic activity in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells and demonstrated thatN-glycosylation can occur post-translationally. We were able to observe post-translational N-glycosylation occurring in PAM due to the close proximity of the consensusN-glycosylation site to the carboxyl terminus, the availability of a single site and the occurrence of a size shift that could be monitored by SDS-PAGE. The phenomenon of post-translationalN-glycosylation likely applies to other proteins, especially those that fold slowly, and N-glycosylation should not be eliminated as a potential explanation for an increase in molecular mass that occurs post-translationally. We thank Dr. Lawrence A. Chasin (Columbia University) for allowing the use of the CHO (DG44) cells, Dr. Iris Lindberg (LSU) for providing the cells, and Marie Bell for technical assistance."

Sliding at the bed accounted for 60 to 70 percent of the glacier's surface motion. Strain rates in the ice were low from the surface to a depth of about 120 meters, but then increased rapidly toward the bed. Ice deformation was not affected by temporal changes in the sliding rate. The three-dimensional pattern of motion indicates that plane strain, which is often assumed by models, is a poor approximation of this viscous flow."

The decision to proofread is determined by the different rates for extension of a correct compared with a mismatched primer-terminus. Nucleotide incorporation is normally rapid from a correct base pair but slow from a mismatched primer-terminus. The slower extension rate in the case of a mismatched primer-terminus provides a window of opportunity to initiate the proofreading pathway. In order to study DNA polymerase proofreading in real time,we have used the fluorescence of the base analog 2-aminopurine (2AP)1 as a reporter. 2AP fluorescence is quenched when 2AP resides in DNA, but fluorescence is restored when the 2AP nucleotide 2AP 2′-deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate (d2APMP) is released from DNA by DNA polymerase proofreading activity (5Bloom L.B.

A rate of about 4 s−1 is detected for this step for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase with the fluorescence assay, which is consistent with a rate of about 5 s−1 detected with a rapid quench assay (8Capson T.L.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). 2AP fluorescence is also produced by formation of a specific complex with T4 DNA polymerase in which DNA labeled at the 3′-end with 2AP interacts with amino acid residues in the exonuclease active center (5Bloom L.B.

Fluorescence anisotropy studies indicate that the fluorescence complex is an intermediate in the proofreading pathway (5Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by studies of “mutator” T4 DNA polymerases that are defective in reaction steps of the exonucleolytic proofreading pathway that prepare the primer-terminus for excision. Two mutant DNA polymerases, the G255S-DNA polymerase (Ser substitution for Gly255) and the D131N-DNA polymerase (Asn substitution for Asp131), have reduced ability to form fluorescent complexes (7Baker R.P. Reha-Krantz L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the proofreading pathway, which is about 4 s−1 for the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase, is reduced 10-fold for the mutant DNA polymerases (6Marquez L.A. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28903-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Baker R.P. Reha-Krantz L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Residue Gly255 resides in a novel protein loop structure in the exonuclease domain, and this structure is implicated in facilitating movement of the primer-terminus from the polymerase to the exonuclease active center (6Marquez L.A. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28903-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Residue Asp131 resides near the exonuclease active center (7Baker R.P. Reha-Krantz L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The use of the highly sensitive 2AP fluorescence assay and the availability of mutant DNA polymerases with defects in the exonucleolytic proofreading pathway provide the means to equate changes in fluorescence intensity with specific reaction steps. We report here reactions that begin with preformed fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes that can be trapped in the absence of Mg2+. The addition of Mg2+ to fluorescent complexes formed with the wild type T4 DNA polymerase produced excision product in a rapid, intramolecular reaction; thus, the fluorescent complex is an intermediate or can be converted to an intermediate in the proofreading pathway. Excision product was also produced from complexes formed with the G255S-DNA polymerase but not from complexes formed with the D131N-DNA polymerase. These results are consistent with a proofreading scheme in which residues in the Gly255-protein loop function in transfer of DNA from the polymerase active center to form a preexonuclease complex. Residue Asp131 is also implicated in formation of a preexonuclease complex, but after action of the Gly255-protein loop. Experiments were also done with the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase (Ala substitutions for Asp112and Glu114). Comparisons of fluorescence intensity changes between the wild type and D112A/E114A-DNA-DNA polymerases, along with the G255S- and D131N-DNA polymerases, were used to model the exonucleolytic proofreading pathway. The D131N- and G255S-DNA polymerases were identified in genetic selections for mutant DNA polymerases with reduced exonucleolytic proofreading, the mutator phenotype (9Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol.

Oligonucleotides labeled with 2AP at the 3′-end were synthesized as described previously using a 2AP-derivatized controlled pore glass solid support (14Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Mhaskar D. Sowers L.C. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5869-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or by using a 2AP phosphoramidite (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) and a 3′-phosphate controlled pore glass as support. The synthetic oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 14% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. For oligonucleotides prepared from the 3′-phosphate controlled pore glass support, the 3′-phosphatase activity of bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase was used to remove the 3′-terminal phosphate group. The primer was a 17-mer with the sequence 5′-GCACGTCATTAACGGT(2AP). Two template DNAs were used: 5′-TTTGGTAGCTAGG(T/C)ACCGTTAATGACGTGC. The primer and template DNAs were annealed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl with a 20% excess of template strand to ensure complete hybridization of the 2AP primer strand (5Bloom L.B.

The 2AP-T primer-template was prepared by annealing the 2AP primer to the template DNA with T in the variable position. (The variable nucleotide is underlined in the sequence of the template strand.) The 2AP-C mispair was formed by annealing the 2AP-primer to the DNA template with C in the variable position. DNA primer-templates were as follows.3′­CGTGCAGTAATTGCCA(T¯/C¯)GGATCGATGGTTT5′­GCACGTCATTAACGGT(2AP)SEQUENCE 1 Stopped-flow emission scans and kinetic measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.17 MV spectrofluorimeter. Excitation was set at 310 nm from a xenon arc lamp. A 335-nm cut-off filter was used. The photomultiplier voltage was set at 700 V, and scattered light was subtracted by applying an offset voltage. All measurements were carried out at 20.0 ± 0.5 °C. The instrument dead time was approximately 1.5 ms. Between six and eight determinations were performed for each reaction, and mean values were calculated. The experimental traces were fit to either single or double exponential equations using the SF 17 MV Kinetic Software Package supplied by Applied Photo-Physics. The agreement between the experimental traces and the calculated curves was determined by analysis of the randomness of the distribution in residuals for either single or double exponential equations. Reactions were initiated in the stopped-flow apparatus by mixing equal volumes of a solution of 1.4 μm T4 DNA polymerase, 400 nm 2AP-DNA substrate, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA with a second solution of 16 mmMgCl2, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 50 mm NaCl. The final concentrations of reaction components were 700 nm T4 DNA polymerase, 200 nm 2AP-DNA substrate, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 8 mm MgCl2. In experiments with the heparin trap, heparin (Sigma; catalog no. H5271) was present at 0.2 mg/ml in the syringe with the Mg2+ solution; after mixing, the final concentration of heparin was 0.1 mg/ml. No further trapping efficiency was detected when the final concentration of heparin was raised to 0.2 mg/ml. The background level of fluorescence due to buffer components, enzyme, and unbound 2AP-DNA was about 0.15. The experiments presented here begin with preformed fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes. Several studies indicate that the 3′-2AP-labeled primer-terminus in fluorescent complexes resides in the exonuclease active center. First, mutant T4 DNA polymerases with alanine substitutions for acidic amino acid residues in the exonuclease active center that are required for the hydrolysis reaction are also partially defective in forming fluorescent complexes (5Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Second, higher fluorescence intensity is detected with complexes formed with single-stranded or partially single-stranded 3′-labeled 2AP-DNAs, which are more likely to be bound in the exonuclease active center, than for fully duplex DNAs, which are more likely to bind in the polymerase active center (5Bloom L.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28903-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since DNA binding in the polymerase active center does not appear to produce fluorescence, 2J. M. Beechem, M. R. Otto, L. B. Bloom, R. Eritja, L. J. Reha-Krantz, and M. F. Goodman, submitted for publication. conditions that favor increased partitioning of DNA to the exonuclease active center, which happens with single-stranded DNA, produce more fluorescent complexes. Third, dNTPs and PPi, which stabilize primer-terminus binding in the polymerase active center at the expense of DNA binding in the exonuclease active center, also reduce formation of fluorescent complexes. 2J. M. Beechem, M. R. Otto, L. B. Bloom, R. Eritja, L. J. Reha-Krantz, and M. F. Goodman, submitted for publication., 3L. A. Marquez, D. Vijayalakshmi, and L. J. Reha-Krantz, unpublished data). A fourth observation, which is particularly relevant to our studies, is that the absence of Mg2+ favors formation of fluorescent complexes, while the presence of Mg2+ increases DNA binding in the polymerase active center.2 We propose that the environment that is responsible for creating 2AP fluorescence in the T4 DNA polymerase enzyme-DNA complex is linked to how the enzyme prepares the 3′-terminal nucleotide for the hydrolysis reaction. Thus, adding Mg2+ to preformed fluorescent complexes may provide insights about further processing of the primer-terminus in preparation for the hydrolysis reaction as well as the cleavage reaction itself. Changes in fluorescence intensity provide the means to follow interactions of the enzyme with the 3′-terminal 2AP nucleotide. In one syringe of the stopped-flow apparatus, fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes were preformed in the absence of Mg2+ under optimal conditions for formation of fluorescent complexes, 3.5-fold excess wild type T4 DNA polymerase to 2AP-DNA (see “Methods”). A solution of Mg2+ was contained in the second syringe. When the solutions were mixed, the fluorescence intensity declined rapidly at the apparent rate of about 211 s−1 (Fig. 1, Table I). The initial rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity was followed by a biphasic increase in fluorescence intensity at rates of about 3 and 23 s−1. The interesting observation is the detection of a transient, intervening state with reduced fluorescence intensity. Characterization of this intervening state is addressed in the following experiments.Table IFluorescence decay ratesEnzymeDNANo heparinWith heparins−1Wild typeAP-T211 ± 29249 ± 29D112A/E114AAP-T70 ± 1100 ± 13 (0.7), 12 ± 2 (0.3)Wild typeAP-C304 ± 38309 ± 20D112A/E114AAP-C82 ± 485 ± 13 (0.7), 15 ± 1 (0.3)G255SAP-T291 ± 59D131NAP-T71 ± 6The apparent fluorescence decay rates were determined by fitting the experimental data to curves described by either single or double exponential equations.

Amplitudes for the apparent biphasic reactions are given in parentheses. The addition of Mg2+ produced a rapid decline in fluorescence intensity to about 0.65, well above the background level of 0.15 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2 A). The residual fluorescence could be due to excision and release of the fluorescent product, d2APMP, if excision can take place within the first 20 ms of reaction. In order to test this possibility, the Mg2+-initiated experiments were repeated with an exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase, the D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase (13Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27100-27108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase produces excision product only very slowly, 0.01 s−1 (16Baker, R. (1996) Importance of Aspartate 131 for T4 DNA Polymerase Proofreading Mechanism, M.S. thesis, University of AlbertaGoogle Scholar); thus, d2APMP production cannot be observed in the first few seconds of reaction. A rapid decline in fluorescence intensity was observed for the D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase when Mg2+ was added to the preformed fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes, but the apparent rate was slower than observed with the wild type enzyme, about 70 s−1 (Fig. 2 B; Table I). A greater decrease in intensity of the fluorescent signal was also observed for the exonuclease-deficient enzyme than for the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2, compare A and B). The end point reached in the first 100 ms of reaction for the exonuclease-deficient enzyme was about 0.3. This value, lower than observed for the wild type enzyme, indicates that the higher level of fluorescence intensity observed for the wild type enzyme after the initial rapid decline may be the result of excision and production of fluorescent d2APMP. The 0.3 value reached by the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase, on the other hand, may be due to reformation of fluorescent complexes, but at a lower level in the presence of Mg2+ than in the absence of Mg2+. The 2AP-DNA substrate used for experiments in Fig. 2, A and B, has 2AP in the 3′-terminal position paired opposite template T (2AP-T DNA). The Mg2+-initiated experiments were repeated with the 2AP-C DNA substrate, in which 2AP is paired opposite template C (Fig. 2, C and D). The end points following the rapid initial decline in fluorescence intensity were higher with the 2AP-C DNA substrate than for the 2AP-T substrate, particularly for the D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase (compare the fluorescence decay end point of about 0.3 for the 2AP-T substrate to 0.65 for the 2AP-C substrate (Fig. 2, B and D)). A higher level of fluorescent complex formation is predicted for the mispaired 2AP-C DNA than the 2AP-T DNA, since a mispaired primer-terminus is less likely to be bound in the polymerase active center. For the wild type enzyme, excision and fluorescent complex formation are both likely possibilities to account for the level of fluorescence reached after the initial decline. In stopped-flow experiments in which a solution of 2AP-T DNA was mixed with a solution of exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase and Mg2+ (association experiments), an increase in fluorescence intensity was observed from the background level of 0.15 to about 0.3 at the apparent rate of 80 s−1 (Fig. 3). This rate corresponds to a bimolecular association rate of about 1 × 10−8m−1 s−1 as observed previously (5Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The increase in fluorescence intensity is due to formation of the fluorescent complex, since the mutant enzyme is severely defective in the hydrolysis reaction. The steady-state level of fluorescence intensity of 0.3 corresponds to the end point reached in the fluorescent decay curve in the Mg2+-initiated experiments with 2AP-T DNA (Fig. 2 B). Fluorescent complex formation was also measured for the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase with the 2AP-C DNA substrate. An approximate 2-fold higher steady-state level of fluorescent complex was formed with the 2AP-C DNA (0.65) than with the 2AP-T DNA (Fig. 3), but the apparent association rate, 92 s−1, was similar to the rate observed with the 2AP-T DNA. The higher steady-state level of fluorescent complex formed with the 2AP-C DNA than with the 2AP-T DNA is consistent with previous results in which a larger population of fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes was formed with a single-stranded 2AP-DNA compared with a double-stranded 2AP-DNA (5Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and with duplex DNAs with preformed terminal strand separations. 4L. A. Marquez and L. J. Reha-Krantz, unpublished data. As observed with the 2AP-T DNA substrate, the steady-state level of fluorescence detected for complex formation with the 2AP-C DNA corresponds to the fluorescence decay end point in the Mg2+-initiated experiments (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the rapid decline in fluorescence intensity upon the addition of Mg2+ with the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase appears to be followed by rapid reformation of fluorescent complexes, but the level of fluorescence is below that obtained in the absence of Mg2+. The steady-state level of fluorescence intensity reached with the 2AP-T DNA in the absence of Mg2+ was about 0.9, while the end point reached in the presence of Mg2+was about 0.3 (Fig. 3). This difference is the basis for the decline in fluorescence intensity observed when Mg2+ is added to complexes formed in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2 B). The decreased level of fluorescence intensity is due to increased formation of nonfluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes when Mg2+ is added, such as complexes in which the 3′-2AP-labeled primer-terminus is bound in the polymerase active center.2 The above experiments suggest that the addition of Mg2+ to preformed fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes results in a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity that is coupled to an increase in fluorescence intensity that may be due to either excision and release of the fluorescent d2APMP, in the case of the wild type enzyme, or to reformation of fluorescent complexes at a reduced level as seen for the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase. A heparin trap can be used to determine if the wild type enzyme carries out the excision reaction. Heparin traps T4 DNA polymerase as the enzyme dissociates from the 2AP-DNA substrate and thus prevents reformation of enzyme-DNA complexes (17Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fluorescence intensity will decline from enzyme-DNA complexes as DNA polymerase molecules dissociate from the 2AP-DNA and are trapped by heparin. The fluorescence of d2APMP, however, is not sensitive to the heparin trap. When a solution of fluorescent enzyme-DNA complexes formed with the wild type T4 DNA polymerase was mixed with a solution of Mg2+ and heparin, a decline in fluorescence intensity was detected that was similar to the decline observed without the heparin trap for the first 20 ms of reaction. Compare the Mg2+-initiated reaction with 2AP-T DNA in Fig. 2 A without heparin to the reaction in Fig. 4 A with heparin. Also compare the reactions with the 2AP-C DNA substrate, Fig. 2 C (no heparin) with Fig. 4 C (with heparin). The level of fluorescence produced after the initial decline was insensitive to heparin, which indicates that this fluorescence is due to production of fluorescent d2APMP rather than to the fluorescent complexes. The increase in fluorescence intensity observed with the wild type enzyme at longer reaction times (Fig. 1) was not seen in the presence of the heparin trap. Thus, the changes in fluorescence intensity in Fig. 1 can be explained in two parts. Initially, a rapid decline in fluorescence intensity is produced by Mg2+ binding. About 70% of the initial complexes produce a burst of excision product via an intramolecular pathway while 30% dissociate. In the second part, which is observed in the absence of the heparin trap, enzyme that has dissociated can then reform enzyme-DNA complexes in the presence of Mg2+, which in turn leads to more product formation. The rate for production of excision product intramolecularly via the heparin insensitive pathway cannot be determined directly by inspection of the curves that show the rapid decline in fluorescent intensity (Fig. 4, A and C), because these curves represent the sum of multiple reactions, reactions that reduce and increase the fluorescent signal. A breakdown of the individual reaction steps in the first 50 ms of reaction is described under “Discussion” and in the Appendix. For the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase, the addition of the heparin trap changed both the apparent decay rates and the end points of fluorescence decay in Mg2+-initiated experiments. Compare reactions with the 2AP-T DNA substrate in Fig. 2 B(no heparin) and Fig. 4 B (with heparin) and reactions with 2AP-C DNA in Fig. 2 D (no heparin) to Fig. 4 D(with heparin). The fluorescence decay end points reached with the heparin trap for both DNA substrates were lower than without the trap and reached an intensity of about 0.2, which is approximately the level of background fluorescence. Moreover, fluorescence decay curves in the presence of heparin, unlike the rates detected in the absence of heparin, were biphasic. The best curve fit for the experimental traces for the 2AP-T DNA substrate (Fig. 4 B) was achieved by using a double exponential equation with decay rates of about 100 s−1 and 12 s−1 (Table I). Apparent rates of 85 and 15 s−1 were observed for the 2AP-C DNA substrate (Fig. 4 D). The faster rates were detected in the absence of the heparin trap, but the slower rates of 12–15 s−1probably measure an additional reaction step that could be observed only in the presence of the trap. We propose that the slower rates measure the dissociation of enzyme from the 2AP-DNA substrate. The proposed dissociation rates are similar to the dissociation rates measured for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase by Capson et al. of 6–8 s−1 (8Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W.

Bishop T.R. Rogers O.C. Noyes A.N. Frelin L.P. Hobbs S. Blood. 1992; 80: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R. Crit. Rev.

In a hematopoietic system, IGF-I has been shown to promote growth in a broad spectrum of hematopoietic cells. A number of studies have shown that IGF-I is able to cooperate with erythropoietin (EPO) in promoting the formation of erythroid burst- and colony-forming units in serum-free colony assays (5Akahane K. Tojo A. Urabe A. Takaku F. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar, 6Correa P.N. Axelrad A.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2823-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sanders M. Sorba S. Dainiak N. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 25-30PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that IGF-I enhances granulopoiesis and expansion of pro-B cells from normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (8Landreth K.S. Narayanan R. Dorshkind K. Blood. 1992; 80: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Merchav S. Tatarsky I. Hochberg Z. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, daily infusion of IGF-I into normal mice has been found to result in a dramatic increase in splenic B and thymic T cells (8Landreth K.S. Narayanan R. Dorshkind K. Blood. 1992; 80: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gibson L.F. Piktel D. Landreth K.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 3005-3011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this cell growth cannot be sustained by IGF-I alone but requires synergistic stimulation by a combination with other growth factors such as EPO, platelet-derived growth factor, and IL-7 (5Akahane K. Tojo A. Urabe A. Takaku F. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gibson L.F. Piktel D. Landreth K.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 3005-3011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Baserga R. Cancer. Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). Although the intracellular signaling pathways from IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) have been the subject of intense investigation (for a review see Ref. 1Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which IGF-I cooperates with other growth factors remain unknown. EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that is required for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitor cells (for a review see Ref. 12Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent report, mice that contained null mutations in both EPO and EPO receptor (EPOR) genes were shown to die at around embryonic day 13 because of the failure of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver (13Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). EPOR belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily, which includes receptors for interleukins, colony-stimulating factors, and thrombopoietin. These receptors do not appear to contain any recognized kinase domain or enzymatic motif in the cytoplasmic domain but are capable of inducing a series of biochemical events, including tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Shc (for a review see Ref. 14Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). EPOR, JAK2, and STAT5 are all known to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated upon ligand binding. The activated STAT5 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, binds to specific DNA sequences, and participates in transcriptional regulation (15Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 16Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw Boris A. Leonard W.J. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among six members of the STAT proteins, STAT5 was originally identified as a mammary gland factor (MGF) that was regulated by prolactin (17Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). STAT5 is known to be activated by multiple cytokines such as IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, EPO, and thrombopoietin (18Mui A.L. Wakao H. Harada N. O'Farrell A.M. Miyajima A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R.

Blood. 1996; 87: 439-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional roles of STAT5 in cytokine-dependent proliferation and differentiation have been investigated by a number of investigators, the results of these studies were contradictory: one study demonstrated that a dominant-negative (dn) STAT5 suppressed IL-3-induced proliferation (23Muli A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and the other study showed that a mutant EPOR, which cannot activate STAT5, transmitted EPO-induced mitogenic signals as efficiently as the wild-type receptor (24Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that STAT5 is involved in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cell lines, ELM-I-1 and SKT6, whereas an opposite result was shown in a human IL-3-dependent erythrocytic leukemia cell line TF-1 (25Iwatsuki K.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which IGF-I exerts its effect on EPO-induced proliferation of a human IL-3-dependent erythroleukemia cell line, F-36P. By using dn forms of STAT5 and Ras, we demonstrate here that both STAT5 and Ras are involved in the EPO-induced DNA synthesis of F-36P cells and that IGF-I augments EPO-induced DNA synthesis through the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Highly purified recombinant human (rh) EPO was provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). rhIL-3, rhGM-CSF, and rh stem cell factor (SCF) were provided by Kirin Brewery Company Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). rhIGF-I was a generous gift from the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Anti-phosphotyrosine, a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), was supplied from Dr. B. Druker (Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR). Murine anti-IGF-I mAb for flow cytometric analysis was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit anti-STAT5b and anti-JAK2 polyclonal Abs, murine anti-HA (hemagglutinin) mAb (12CA5), and murine anti-pan-Ras mAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, California, CA), Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), and Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), respectively. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). A dn mutant of human c-H-Ras (H-RasS17N) cDNA was kindly provided from Dr. T. Satoh (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan) (28Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A dn HA-tagged STAT5 (HA-MGF694F) was described in previous papers (26Wakao H. Chida D. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Miyajima A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,29Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were subcloned into the NotI site of pOPRSVI-CAT (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), instead of the chroramphenicol acetyltransferase gene by using NotI linkers. F-36P, a human IL-3-dependent erythroleukemia cell line established by Chiba et al. (30Chiba S. Takaku F. Tange T. Shibuya K. Misawa C. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1991; 78: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tukuba, Japan). F-36P cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Nakarai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Flow, North Ryde, Australia) in the presence of 5 ng/ml rhIL-3 at 37 °C. To quantitate DNA synthesis of the cells, a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was used as previously described (31Sugahara H. Kanakura Y. Furitsu T. Ishihara K. Oritani K. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Ishikawa J. Hashimoto K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, after 24-h serum and rhIL-3 starvation, triplicate aliquots of cells (3.0 × 104 cells resuspended in 100 μl of serum-free Cos 004 medium (Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan)) were cultured in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates for 48 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the growth factor(s). [3H]Thymidine was added prior to the final 4 h of the culture, and incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured with a scintillation counter. To examine the effects of dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras, the cells were treated with 1 mm of IPTG during 24 h of starvation and following 48-h culture periods. Isolation of total cellular RNA and the method for Northern blot were described previously (32Matsumura I. Kanakura Y. Kato T. Ikeda H. Ishikawa J. Horikawa Y. Hashimoto K. Moriyama Y. Tsujimura T. Nishiura T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe for c-CIS mRNA was full-length cDNA, and that for c-mycmRNA corresponded to exon 3. The isolation of cellular lysates, immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed according to the methods described previously (33Matsumura I. Kanakura Y. Kato T. Ikeda H. Horikawa Y. Ishikawa J. Kitayama H. Nishiura T. Tomiyama Y. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 3074-3082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after serum and rhIL-3 starvation for 12 h, F-36P cells were treated with an appropriate growth factor(s). The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, the precleared lysates obtained from 1 × 107 cells were incubated with 1 μg of anti-STAT5b Ab or 2 μg of anti-HA mAb, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates (15 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking the residual binding sites on the filter, immunoblotting was performed with an appropriate Ab. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). In some experiments, the filters were then stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT5b Ab to confirm the amounts of the immunoprecipitated STAT5. To inducibly express dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras in F-36P cells, we used a LacSwitchTM II inducible expression system (Stratagene), in which the target cDNA is inducibly expressed by the addition of IPTG. In short, F-36P cells were initially transfected with an expression vector of Lac repressor (Lac-R), pCMV-LacI, by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarad) (Bio-Lad, Richmond, CA). The transfected cells were screened by the culture with hygromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Several hygromycin-resistant cells were cloned, and expression levels of Lac-R mRNA were examined by Northern blot analysis. Of these clones, one clone (designated Lac-R/cl3) was selected, because it showed the most intensive expression of Lac-R mRNA and also retained characteristics that were nearly the same as the parental F-36P cells. Lac-R/cl3 cells were next transfected with pOPRSVI each containing dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras. The expression vector pOPRSVI contains Rous sarcoma virus promoter linked to the Escherichia colilactose operon, and expression of the target cDNA is suppressed by Lac-R through the lactose operon. When IPTG was added to culture medium, Lac-R was released from lactose operon, and transcription of the target cDNA is initiated. The transfected cells were screened by the culture with G418 (Sigma) at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. G418-resistant cells were cloned, and induction levels of the target protein were examined before and after the treatment with IPTG by Western blot analyses. After the selection, 694F cl1 and N17 cl2 were subjected to further analyses, because dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras proteins were most efficiently induced by treatment with IPTG in these clones. Two types of luciferase plasmids each containing potential STAT5- and AP1-binding sequence were used as reporter genes. The details of 3x AP1-Lu, which can be transactivated by Ras-mediated AP1, have been described previously (34Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To construct a reporter gene for STAT5 (3x β-Cas-Lu), three tandem repeats of GAS sequence from β-casein gene (5′-TCGAAGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATCGTAC-3′; recognition site is underlined) were subcloned into a location just upstream of the murine minimal JunB promoter (−42 to +136) linked to the firefly luciferase gene (17Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The luciferase assay was performed by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, Madison, WI), in which the transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfected pRL-CMV-Rluc, an expression vector of renilla luciferase. The cultured cells were electroporated with 30 μg of reporter gene, together with 30 μg of pRL-CMV-Rluc. The transfected cells were serum- and IL-3-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with rhEPO (10 units/ml) and/or rhIGF-I (10 ng/ml) for 5 h. To examine the effects of dn mutants, the cells were pretreated with 1 mm IPTG for 24 h prior to electroporation and cultured with IPTG during the assay. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplied by manufacturer followed by measurement of the firefly and the renilla luciferase activities on luminometer LB96P (Berthold Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the renilla luciferase activities. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and similar results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Initially, we examined dose-dependent effects of rhIL-3, rhGM-CSF, rhSCF, rhEPO, and rhIGF-I on DNA synthesis of F-36P cells. The cells were cultured with various concentrations of each growth factor for 48 h, followed by measurement of DNA synthesis by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, F-36P cells showed dose-dependent DNA synthesis in response to rhIL-3 (over the range of 0.1–100 ng/ml), rhGM-CSF (0.1–100 ng/ml), rhSCF (1–100 ng/ml), and rhEPO (0.3–10 units/ml), respectively. When the maximal responses to each growth factor were compared, rhIL-3, rhGM-CSF, and rhSCF showed more potent activities in stimulating DNA synthesis of F-36P cells than rhEPO. In contrast, IGF-I showed only a minimal or undetectable effect on DNA synthesis of F-36P cells (Fig. 1 A). We next examined cooperative effects of IGF-I with other cytokines. F-36P cells were cultured in a suboptimal dose of rhGM-CSF (2 ng/ml), rhIL-3 (2 ng/ml), rhSCF (20 ng/ml), or rhEPO (1 units/ml) with or without rhIGF-1 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. Although rhIGF-I alone was not capable of inducing DNA synthesis of F-36P cells, the rhGM-CSF-, rhIL-3-, rhSCF-, and rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis was augmented by the addition of rhIGF-I by 1.4-, 1.8-, 1.3-, and 7.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). To analyze the mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of rhEPO and rhIGF-I on DNA synthesis of F-36P cells, we examined the changes in surface expression of IGF-IR during the 48-h treatment with rhEPO by flow cytometric analysis. The expression level of IGF-IR was found to be considerably high even before the treatment and to be not affected by the EPO treatment, suggesting that the synergistic effect was not mediated by up-regulation of IGF-IR by rhEPO (data not shown). Because STAT5 has been reported to be involved in the EPO- and IL-3-dependent proliferation in previous studies (19Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 21Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we examined changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 after 15 min of stimulation with rhEPO or rhIGF-I or in combination (rhEPO/rhIGF-I). Consistent with the previous reports, the treatment with rhEPO resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 2 A, EPO lane). Although IGF-I alone failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 2 A, IGF-I lane), the treatment with rhEPO/rhIGF-I led to a significantly increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 as compared with that induced by rhEPO alone (Fig. 2 A, EPO/IGF-I lane). In a time course analysis, rhIGF-I was shown to enhance rhEPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 during the entire test period (Fig. 2 B). However, an apparent difference was not observed in the kinetics of the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 between the treatments with rhEPO and rhEPO/rhIGF-I (Fig. 2 B). The stimulation with rhIL-3 or rhGM-CSF was more effective in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 than that with rhEPO (Fig. 2 C, IL3 and GM-CSF lanes), and rhIGF-I was ineffective in augmenting rhIL-3- or rhGM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 2 C, IL3/IGF-I and GM-CSF/IGF-I lanes). In contrast to the effect of IGF-I, SCF, whose receptor is a member of receptor tyrosine kinase family, did not enhance rhEPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 2 C, EPO lane versus EPO/SCF lane). To evaluate the changes in transactivating activity of STAT5 before and after treatment with rhEPO or rhEPO/rhIGF-I, we examined the induction of c-CIS mRNA by Northern blot analysis, which is one of the target molecules of STAT5 (35Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 36Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment with rhEPO for 30 min was found to induce c-CIS mRNA expression in F-36P cells (Fig. 3 A). The treatment with rhIGF-I alone was not capable of inducing c-CIS mRNA expression, whereas the treatment with rhEPO/rhIGF-I led to a higher level of c-CIS mRNA expression than that with rhEPO alone (Fig. 3 A). In addition, a time course analysis revealed that rhEPO/rhIGF-I was more effective in inducing c-CIS mRNA than rhEPO alone from 30 to 90 min (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to c-CIS mRNA induction, the induction levels of c-myc mRNA were essentially the same for rhEPO alone and rhEPO/rhIGF-I (Fig. 3 A). To quantitate the cooperative effects of rhEPO and rhIGF-I, we performed a luciferase assay with two types of reporter genes, 3x β-Cas-Lu and 3x AP1-Lu, that are transactivated by STAT5 and Ras-mediated AP1, respectively. The treatments with rhEPO and rhEPO/rhIGF-I stimulated luciferase activities of 3x β-Cas-Lu by 5.1- and 7.7-fold, respectively, whereas rhIGF-I alone had no affect on the β-Cas-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 4 A). The activity of 3x AP1-Lu was stimulated 4.5-fold by treatments with rhEPO, 4.3-fold by rhIGF-I, and 4.7-fold with rhEPO/rhIGF-I, respectively (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to the results obtained from 3x β-Cas-Lu, rhIGF-I showed no additive effect on EPO-induced luciferase activity in 3x AP1-Lu (4.7-fold versus 4.5-fold).Figure 4Changes in transactivating activities of STAT5 and Ras-mediated AP1 before and after the treatment with rhEPO and/or IGF-I. F-36P cells were electroporated with 30 mg of each reporter gene (3x β-Cas-Lu or 3x AP1-Lu, respectively) together with 30 mg of pRL-CMV-Rluc, an expression vector of renilla luciferase. The transfected cells were serum- and IL-3-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with rhEPO (10 units/ml) and/or rhIGF-I (10 ng/ml) for 5 h. The relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing the transfection efficiency according to the renilla luciferase activities. The results are shown as the means ± S.D. of triplicated experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the mechanism of synergistic effect of rhIGF-I on rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis of F-36P cells, we prepared stable transfectants that can inducibly express HA-tagged dn-STAT5 (designated 694F cl1) and dn-Ras (designated N17 cl2). As shown in a representative blot (Fig. 5 A), the addition of 1 mm IPTG to the culture medium led to the induction of dn-STAT5 as early as 4 h, and its expression peaked at ∼24 h and was retained for up to 48 h in the HA-immunoprecipitated proteins from 694F cl1 cells. In addition, Western blot analysis on the whole cell lysates from N17 cl2 cells showed that treatment with IPTG resulted in the induction of dn-Ras (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of IPTG pretreatment, the treatment with rhIGF-I enhanced rhEPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in 694F cl1 cells in a manner similar to that of parental F-36P cells (data not shown); by contrast, when dn-STAT5 was induced to express by pretreatment with IPTG, both rhEPO- and rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylations of STAT5 were found to be severely reduced as compared with those in the absence of dn-STAT5 (data not shown). In addition, dn-STAT5, HA-MGF694F, was not tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment with rhEPO, rhIGF-I, or rhEPO/rhIGF-I (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that both rhEPO and rhEPO/rhIGF-I catalyze the phosphorylation of only a single tyrosine residue (tyrosine 694) of STAT5 and that the rhIGF-I-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation occurred at the tyrosine 694 residue but not at other tyrosine residues. To evaluate the inhibitory effects of dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras in each signaling pathway, we performed a luciferase assay with reporter plasmids, 3x β-Cas-Lu and 3x AP1-Lu. In 694F cl1 cells, both rhEPO and rhEPO/rhIGF-I induced luciferase activities of 3 × β-Cas-Lu in about the same manner as in parental F-36P cells in the absence of dn-STAT5: a 5.3-fold induction by rhEPO and an 8.0-fold induction by rhEPO/rhIGF-I (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, when dn-STAT5 was inducibly expressed by pretreatment with IPTG, both rhEPO- and rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced luciferase activities were severely reduced: 1.3-fold by rhEPO and 1.8-fold by rhEPO/rhIGF-I (Fig. 6 A). The inhibitory effects of dn-Ras on 3x AP1-Lu were also observed in N17 cl2 cells. In the absence of dn-Ras, the treatment with rhEPO, rhIGF-I, and rhEPO/rhIGF-I stimulated luciferase activities by 4.7-, 4.4-, and 4.8-fold, respectively, when compared with the basal activity (Fig. 6 B). However, in the condition where dn-Ras was expressed, rhEPO-, rhIGF-I-, and rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced luciferase activities were reduced to 1.3-, 1.2-, and 1.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that both dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras are effective in blocking each signaling pathway. We next examined the effects of dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras on rhEPO- and rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced DNA synthesis of F-36P cells. The 694F cl1 and N17 cl2 cells were IL-3-starved for 24 h in the presence or absence of IPTG, and the effects of rhEPO (10 units/ml) and/or rhIGF-I (10 ng/ml) on DNA synthesis were then examined after a 48-h culture period with or without IPTG. In the absence of IPTG pretreatment, the responses in DNA synthesis of Vector cl1 (a stable transformant with an empty vector), 694F cl1, and N17 cl2 cells to each growth factor were similar to those of parental F-36P cells (Fig. 7). The addition of IPTG had no effect on the responses of Vector cl1 cells to each growth factor. In contrast, the inducible expression of dn-STAT5 by IPTG led to a reduction of rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis by 34% and the rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced DNA synthesis by 61% in 694F cl1 cells, when DNA synthesis was compared between the presence and absence of IPTG treatment (Fig. 7). In addition, in N17 cl2 cells, dn-Ras suppressed the rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis by 32% and rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced DNA synthesis by 54% (Fig. 7). Thus, rhEPO/rhIGF-I-induced DNA synthesis was more significantly inhibited by dn-STAT5 or dn-Ras than rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis, suggesting that both STAT5 and Ras are involved in the rhEPO-induced proliferation of F-36P cells and also, at least in part, in the synergistic effect of rhIGF-I on rhEPO-induced proliferation. In an effort to characterize the mechanism by which IGF-I enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, we examined changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 after the treatment with rhEPO or rhEPO/rhIGF-I. As shown in Fig. 8 A, no significant difference in intensity and kinetics of JAK2-tyrosyl phosphorylation was observed between the rhEPO and rhEPO/rhIGF-I treatments, suggesting that JAK2 tyrosine kinase is probably not involved in the IGF-I-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Because the synergistic effect of rhIGF-I and rhEPO on DNA synthesis was inhibited by dn-Ras as efficiently as by dn-STAT5 (Fig. 7), we next examined the effects of dn-Ras on the IGF-I-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 8 B). N17 cl2 cells were stimulated with rhEPO or rhEPO/rhIGF-I in the presence and absence of IPTG pretreatment. Without IPTG pretreatment, rhEPO/rhIGF-I was found to enhance rhEPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in N17 cl2 cells as well as F-36P cells. In contrast, the rhEPO/rhIGF-I-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was abolished by the pretreatment with IPTG. This result raises the possibility that Ras-mediated signaling may be involved in the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 by rhIGF-I. The IGF-IR is a tyrosine kinase receptor with 70% homology to the insulin receptor. On ligand binding, IGF-IR autophosphorylates and dimerizes, activating its kinase activity. The activated IGF-IR induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and Shc, leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway and a Ras/MAPK cascade (for reviews see Refs. 37White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 38Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1993; 74: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The Ras/MAPK cascade, which consists of Raf, MEK (MAPK kinase) and MAPK is known to transmit mitogenic signals from IGF-IR, resulting in gene expression such as c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and cyclin D1 (39Weiland M.

However, a number of previous studies have reported that IGF-I alone shows only a minimum effect on cell proliferation but synergizes with other growth factors to induce cell proliferation (5Akahane K. Tojo A. Urabe A. Takaku F. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gibson L.F. Piktel D. Landreth K.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 3005-3011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Baserga R. Cancer. Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we here showed that rhIGF-I alone was unable to promote DNA synthesis of F-36P cells, but that it augmented the GM-CSF-, IL-3-, SCF-, and EPO-induced DNA synthesis. Because rhIGF-I activated Ras pathways as effectively as EPO in the luciferase assay, it was suggested that the activated Ras signaling from IGF-IR alone may not be sufficient to induce DNA synthesis. In F-36P cells, both dn forms of STAT5 and Ras inhibited rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis. Although the precise role of STAT5 in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells is not fully understood, our results suggest that STAT5, in addition to Ras, may be involved in the EPO-induced proliferation of F-36P cells. This conclusion is supported by the recent finding that although STAT5A targeted mice underwent normal development without apparent hematopoietic abnormalities (43Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), the macrophages obtained from the bone marrow of these mice showed a significantly decreased proliferative response to rhGM-CSF of 33% as compared with those from normal mice (16Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw Boris A. Leonard W.J. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, dn-STAT5 and dn-Ras were found to inhibit the synergistic effect of rhIGF-I on rhEPO-induced DNA synthesis of F-36P cells. These results suggest that both STAT5 and Ras may be involved in the cooperative effect of rhIGF-I. In N17 cl2 cells, dn-Ras showed a considerable but not complete inhibitory effect on the cooperation in DNA synthesis, whereas it completely abrogated IGF-I-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Recently, Zhou et al. (44Zhou L.F. Xu SQ. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that IGF-I is capable of stabilizing STAT5 protein in a murine IL-3-dependent myeloblastic leukemia cell line, 32D, and that this stabilization might contribute to the protection from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal. Although we did not study the expression levels of STAT5 protein during the treatment with rhEPO, rhIGF-I, or rhEPO/rhIGF-I, the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and the stabilization of STAT5 may be involved in the synergistic effect of EPO and IGF-I on F-36P cells. In addition to hematopoietin receptors, several receptor tyrosine kinases such as receptors for erythroid growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin have recently been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of STAT proteins (45Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 46Vignais M.L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin has been shown to phosphorylate on serine residue of STAT3 and STAT5, which is required for the maximal activation of these molecules (47Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 48Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12121-12124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, IGF-I alone was ineffective in inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 but enhanced the EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. The enhancing effect of IGF-I on tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was abrogated by dn-Ras, suggesting that the Ras pathway(s) may be involved in the increased phosphorylation of STAT5 by IGF-I. Because the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 were not apparently augmented by the addition of rhIGF-I to rhEPO, JAK2 may not participate in the process. Because STAT5 is known to associate with EPOR and JAK2 (14Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar,49Fujitani Y. Hibi M. Fukada T. Takahashi Tezuka M. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi T. Sugiyama K. Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is possible that IGF-I might strengthen the affinity of these associations. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs are known to be rapidly dephosphorylated by an as-yet-unidentified tyrosine phosphatase. It was previously reported that the N-terminal (amino acids 1–61) domain of STAT1 was required for the interaction with this tyrosine phosphatase and that the N-terminal deletion mutant of STAT1 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine (50Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that IGF-I might modulate the activity of this tyrosine phosphatase through the Ras pathways. Because this domain is highly conserved between the STAT proteins, it would be interesting to investigate whether or not rhEPO and rhEPO/rhIGF-I shows similar effects on the N-terminal deletion mutant of STAT5. In F-36P cells, rhEPO alone was less effective in inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 than rhIL-3 or rhGM-CSF. As in the case of F-36P cells, it was recently reported that EPO-induced STAT5 activation was absent or severely suppressed in bone marrow cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, whereas IL-3 was able to normally activate STAT5 in these cells (51Hoefsloot L.H. van Amelsvoort M.P. Broeders L.C. van der Plas D.C. van Lom K. Hoogerbrugge H. Touw I.P. Lowenberg B. Blood. 1997; 89: 1690-1700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because myelodysplastic syndrome is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis despite erythroid hyperplasia on which EPO shows little effect in most cases, IGF-I might be a candidate for a new therapeutic agent for myelodysplastic syndrome patients. In summary, we showed here that IGF-I cooperated with EPO, at least in part, through the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and that Ras was involved in this process. These results demonstrate a new type of cross-talk between the receptor tyrosine kinases and Jak-STAT pathways. Although the precise mechanism and significance of this cross-talk remains unknown, further studies will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of the regulation of the growth of hematopoietic cells.

The Leishmania species are parasitic protozoa responsible for various clinical forms of leishmaniasis ranging from self-curing skin ulcers to an often fatal visceral disease. TheLeishmania parasite oscillates between two distinct host-specific developmental stages in the course of their life cycle. Flagellated promastigotes are found in the gut lumen of the sandfly vector, while nonmotile amastigotes exist intracellularly in the vertebrate host macrophages (1Molyneux D.H. Killick-Kendrick R. Peters W. Killick-Kendrick R. Leishmaniasis in Biology and Medicine. 1. Academic Press, New York1987: 121-176Google Scholar).The Leishmania donovani A2 gene family of proteins was shown to be amastigote stage-specific (2Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and essential for survival of this parasitic protozoan in its mammalian host (3Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Previously, it was demonstrated that the A2 gene regulatory system could be used as a model to study the regulation of gene expression in Leishmania cells (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The developmental expression of A2 gene transcripts and protein products can be induced in vitro in cultured promastigotes by a combination of pH and temperature shifts, conditions associated with the passage of the parasite from the insect vector to the phagolysosomal environment within the mammalian macrophage (2Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A2 gene expression is post-transcriptionally regulated, and selectable marker transcripts carrying the A2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region display amastigote-specific expression in transfected Leishmaniacells (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In this study, we tested whether the A2 regulatory sequences could be used to developmentally express suicide genes toward developing an attenuated L. donovani strain. The suicide genes tested were the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (hsv-tk) previously used by LeBowitz et al. (6LeBowitz J.H. Cruz A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as a negative selectable marker in Leishmania major and a truncated version of the L. donovani 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (3′NT/Nu). The native L. donovani 3′NT/Nu is an externally oriented surface membrane enzyme capable of hydrolyzing 3′nucleotides and nucleic acids (7Gottlieb M. Gardiner P.R. Dwyer D.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 83B: 63-69Google Scholar, 8Dwyer D.M. Gottlieb M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Developmental expression from both episomal and integrated A2-toxic gene chimeric constructs was tested in vitro in differentiated amastigotes. We demonstrate that the pattern of expression of these toxic genes under the control of A2 gene sequences was differential, although not completely amastigote-specific. The truncated 3′NT/Nu expression affected growth of amastigotes, and TK1expression induced sensitivity of amastigotes to the anti-herpes drug, ganciclovir.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLeishmania Strain and Culture MediaPromastigotes and amastigotes of a cloned line of L. donovani (1S, clone 2D from the 1S strain (10Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 41: 341-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Stauber L.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1966; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), World Health Organization designation, MHOM/SD/62/1S-cl2D) were cultured as follows. Promastigotes were grown at 26 °C in M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% defined heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and 25 mm HEPES (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH), pH 6.8. Axenic amastigotes were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 20 mm MES (Sigma), pH 5.5 (12Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cell growth assays of TK transfectants were performed in media supplemented with ganciclovir sodium (0.1m stock solution in deionized water; Cytovene; Hoffman-La Roche).Axenic amastigotes used in Western and Northern blot experiments were obtained by transferring late log-phase promastigotes to medium at 37 °C, pH 5.5. Cells were used 12–18 h after the transfer.Nucleic Acids Preparations and AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted from promastigotes and axenic amastigotes by the phenol-chloroform-guanidium isothiocyanate method using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA samples were prepared from promastigotes using the “mini-prep” procedure described by Medina-Acosta and Cross (13Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern blot hybridizations were carried out in 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate for 18 h at 65 °C. DNA probes were prepared from agarose gel-purified fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals Inc., 3,000 Ci/mmol) by nick translation.Plasmid ConstructsSchematic representations of plasmids used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1.NEOPT and pKSneoThe NEOPT plasmid was designed to allow the differential expression of the neo gene in amastigotes (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The construct carries the Pro (P) element, which represents the A2/A2rel intergenic region and the 5′ end of the A2rel gene coding sequence, a synthetic 92-base pair trans-splicing element (pyt), the neomycin resistance gene, and the Tail (T) element, which represents the 3′-untranslated region of A2. The construction of the pKSneo plasmid was described in Zhang et al. (5Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In distinction with the NEOPT plasmid, the neo gene in pKSneo is inserted upstream from the Pro element. The Pro element provides a polyadenylation site for the neo gene, whereastrans-splicing of neo at the 5′ end is controlled by a pyt element. Thus, in pKSneo, the neo gene mRNA is constitutively expressed in both promastigotes and amastigotes.pKSneo-3′NTA truncated version of the 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease gene (3′nt/nu) was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasmid Cl-2 (14Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which contains a 4.5-kb fragment carrying the3′nt/nu coding sequence (1.4 kb). The signal peptide and the terminal anchor sequences were not included in the PCR product. Hence, the sense oligonucleotide (5′-gactccatgg atgacgctcctcagtactgtcgca-3′) created an initiation codon, whereas the antisense oligonucleotide (5′-gacttgatca ctacacggcgacaatcgccgtcac-3′) created a stop codon. The PCR product (1.1 kb) was first inserted into the pCRII cloning vector (T/A cloning system, Invitrogen). Subsequently, the SpeI and XbaI restriction sites from the pCRII vector restriction cassette were used to subclone it into the SpeI site of the pKSneo vector.Constructs for Targeting tk into the A2 LocusThe neo gene was amplified from the pALTneo vector along with an α-tubulin intergenic region from L. enriettii, which provides a trans-splicing acceptor site and a polyadenylation acceptor site (15Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: sense, 5′-gg agatct acctttctctcttccgac-3′ (bases in bold represent a BglII site); antisense, 5′-tacgactcactatagggc-3′. The neo-intergenic region (Neo-IG) product (1.8 kb) was subclonedBglII/BamHI in the BamHI site of vector pGEM-11zf (Promega). The Pro and Tail elements were inserted on either side of the neo-intergenic orneo-intergenic-tk sequences to permit targeting by homologous recombination (Fig. 1 B). For the pGEMneo construct, the Tail was subcloned directionally at the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites. For the pGEMneo-TK plasmid, the tk gene was first inserted upstream from the Tail element on a KS pBluescript (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA) (KSTail plasmid). The 1.3-kb tk coding region was amplified from the pFG5 vector which contains the tk gene (16Colbere-Garapin F. Chousterman S.L. Horodniceanu F. Kourilsky P. Garapin A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3755-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: sense, 5′-gg tctagacgcttaacagcgtcaaca-3′; antisense, 5′-gg tctagaggtctcggtggggtatcg-3′ (bases in bold represent a XbaI site). The PCR product (1.3 kb) was first inserted in the PCRII cloning vector and then subcloned with the XbaI restriction sites from the PCRII vector in front of the Tail element. The plasmid-created KS/TK-Tail was digested BglII/HindIII (theBglII site is located upstream from the tkinitiation codon), and the TK-Tail element was subclonedBamHI/HindIII at the 3′ end of the pGEM construct.TransfectionsTransfections and selection of clones were performed as described previously (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Uncloned populations of recombinant promastigotes were used for experiments with episomal copies of the truncated 3′nt/nu and neo genes. Recombinant promastigotes carrying neo and tkgenes targeted into the chromosomal A2 gene cluster were selected with minimal doses of G418 (10 μg/ml), and clonal populations were selected by limiting dilutions.Protein AnalysesPromastigotes and amastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer. Pellets were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml in 2 × SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue), denatured by boiling for 10 min, and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).The 3′-nucleotidase activities of the native 3′NT/Nu and the truncated 3′NT/Nu were visualized in the SDS-PAGE gels by in situstaining using 3′-AMP as a substrate and malachite green as the staining agent (18Zlotnick G.W. Mackow M.C. Gottlieb M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 87B: 629-635Google Scholar). The 3′NT/Nu proteins were detected in Western blot analyses using a rabbit anti-3′NT/Nu peptide serum and a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) (as described in Ref. 14Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Bound secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In Fig. 4 B, the secondary antibody used was a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and bound antibodies were detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in a 0.03% H2O2 solution.Figure 4A, effect of the truncated 3′NT/Nu on cell growth is shown. pKSneo-3′NT transfectants were grown at different G418 concentrations.

Late log-phase promastigotes were used to infect macrophages. C, liver parasite burdens of infected mice are shown. Mice were infected with wild-type or transfectedLeishmania grown at various G418 concentrations (0, 100, 200, and 400 μg/ml). pKSneo control tranfectants were grown in 25 μg/ml G418. Mice were injected with promastigotes via the tail vein (1.5 × 108 promastigotes/mouse; n,3/group). Four weeks post-infection, the parasite burden was determined by counting amastigotes from liver impressions. Liver parasite burdens are expressed as Leishman-Donovan units calculated as the number of amastigotes/1000-macrophage nuclei × liver weight (g). The means per group are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Infection of Macrophages in CultureMouse bone marrow cell preparations and infections with L. donovani cells were performed as described previously (19Moore K.J. Labrecque S. Matlashewski G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar). Late log-phase promastigotes were used to infect cultures of macrophages at a ratio of 20 parasites/macrophage for 24 h at 37 °C, after which nonphagocytosed parasites were washed out by low speed centrifugation. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and intracellular infection levels were monitored daily by Giemsa staining.Infections in MiceInfections were performed as described in Zhang and Matlashewski (3Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In brief, female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Montreal, Canada) 6–8 weeks old were injected via the tail vein with 1.5 × 108 wild-type or transfected promastigotes. Four weeks post-infection, mice were examined for L. donovani parasite burden by counting the number of amastigotes in imprints of the liver stained with Giemsa. Liver parasite burdens are expressed as Leishman-Donovan units (number of amastigotes/1000 cell nuclei × liver weight (g)) (20Murray H.W Oca M. Granger A. Schreiber R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using the A2 gene regulatory system to generate L. donovanirecombinant lines in which attenuation is developmentally regulated during the promastigote to amastigote cytodifferentiation. The pattern of expression of toxic genes under the control of A2 gene sequences was differential, although not completely amastigote-specific. Whereas promastigotes were generally unaffected by low expression of the suicide genes, the growth of axenic amastigotes was hampered. Similarly, amastigote growth within host macrophages could be completely inhibited. We also showed by gene replacement that the A2 locus can control the expression of negative selection genes.Two different suicide gene systems carried on episomal and targeting constructs were tested. Both suicide genes were placed under the control of the A2 untranslated regions in recombinant L. donovani cells. In a first series of experiments, a truncated version of the 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease, an endogenousL.donovani enzyme, was inserted between two A2 noncoding sequences to be developmentally expressed in amastigotes. The 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease is an externally oriented surface membrane glycoprotein responsible for the hydrolysis of 3′ nucleotides and single strand nucleic acids (24Sacci J.B. Campbell T.A.

The truncated 3′NT/Nu used in our constructs, which lacked both the signal peptide and the membrane anchoring sequences, was expressed in the cytosol (data not shown), which led to reduced amastigote cell viability. The truncated 3′NT/Nu was not post-translationally modified by glycosylation because it was not targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, where its normal processing occurs. Campbell et al. (25Campbell T.A. Zlotnick G.W. Neubert T.A. Sacci Jr., J.B. Gottlieb M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the glycosylation of the native enzyme plays an important role in regulating its specific activity. This is consistent with the observation that the 3′NT/Nu expressed in Escherichia colihad a 50-fold lower activity than the native enzyme of Leishmania. 2A. Debrabant and D. Dwyer, unpublished data.To modulate the expression of the truncated3′nt/nu gene in amastigotes as well as in promastigotes, we took advantage of the increase in plasmid copy number resulting from the G418 selective pressure. Despite its low activity, high levels of truncated 3′NT/Nu expression resulted in a reduced amastigote viability. Decreased cell growth of axenic amastigotes correlated with a decreased replication of amastigotes in macrophages and mice. In the absence of G418, pressure-transfected DNA is maintained in Leishmania cells for a relatively long period of time (26Coburn C.M. Otteman K.M. McNeely T. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in vivo, transfectants would be expected to eventually begin to lose their plasmids. Thus, a generation of stable attenuated cell lines requires the chromosomal integration of the suicide gene. Clearly, the low specific activity of the truncated 3′NT/Nu that was observed, even at high copy number, was not suitable for the generation of attenuated lines.To directly assess the feasibility of differentially inducing in amastigotes the expression of suicide genes when targeted into the chromosomal A2 locus, we used the tk/ganciclovir suicide gene system. LeBowitz et al. (6LeBowitz J.H. Cruz A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Muyombwe et al. (27Muyombwe A. Olivier M. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Muyombwe A. Olivier M. Harvie P. Bergeron M.G. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) describe the expression of the hsv-tk gene on episomal vectors in L. major for the creation of ganciclovir-sensitive strains. We showed that the hsv-tkgene under the control of A2 regulatory sequences is differentially expressed in amastigotes. As expected, the expression of the herpes virus tk gene in transfected promastigotes results in sensitivity to nucleoside analogues, such as the anti-herpes drug ganciclovir. However, the EC50 calculated for axenic amastigotes was 5 times lower than for promastigotes, correlating with an up-regulation of the tk gene expression in amastigotes.The major advantage of the A2 gene regulatory system to establish attenuated cell lines is that attenuation can be developmentally regulated. Such attenuated L. donovani cell lines should prove useful in examining certain aspects of the immune response during infection, under conditions where the infection is not lethal. Further, it may hold potential for the development of an attenuated vaccine. The Leishmania species are parasitic protozoa responsible for various clinical forms of leishmaniasis ranging from self-curing skin ulcers to an often fatal visceral disease. TheLeishmania parasite oscillates between two distinct host-specific developmental stages in the course of their life cycle. Flagellated promastigotes are found in the gut lumen of the sandfly vector, while nonmotile amastigotes exist intracellularly in the vertebrate host macrophages (1Molyneux D.H. Killick-Kendrick R. Peters W. Killick-Kendrick R. Leishmaniasis in Biology and Medicine. 1. Academic Press, New York1987: 121-176Google Scholar). The Leishmania donovani A2 gene family of proteins was shown to be amastigote stage-specific (2Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and essential for survival of this parasitic protozoan in its mammalian host (3Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Previously, it was demonstrated that the A2 gene regulatory system could be used as a model to study the regulation of gene expression in Leishmania cells (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The developmental expression of A2 gene transcripts and protein products can be induced in vitro in cultured promastigotes by a combination of pH and temperature shifts, conditions associated with the passage of the parasite from the insect vector to the phagolysosomal environment within the mammalian macrophage (2Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A2 gene expression is post-transcriptionally regulated, and selectable marker transcripts carrying the A2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region display amastigote-specific expression in transfected Leishmaniacells (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether the A2 regulatory sequences could be used to developmentally express suicide genes toward developing an attenuated L. donovani strain. The suicide genes tested were the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (hsv-tk) previously used by LeBowitz et al. (6LeBowitz J.H. Cruz A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as a negative selectable marker in Leishmania major and a truncated version of the L. donovani 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (3′NT/Nu). The native L. donovani 3′NT/Nu is an externally oriented surface membrane enzyme capable of hydrolyzing 3′nucleotides and nucleic acids (7Gottlieb M. Gardiner P.R. Dwyer D.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 83B: 63-69Google Scholar, 8Dwyer D.M. Gottlieb M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Developmental expression from both episomal and integrated A2-toxic gene chimeric constructs was tested in vitro in differentiated amastigotes. We demonstrate that the pattern of expression of these toxic genes under the control of A2 gene sequences was differential, although not completely amastigote-specific. The truncated 3′NT/Nu expression affected growth of amastigotes, and TK1expression induced sensitivity of amastigotes to the anti-herpes drug, ganciclovir. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLeishmania Strain and Culture MediaPromastigotes and amastigotes of a cloned line of L. donovani (1S, clone 2D from the 1S strain (10Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 41: 341-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Stauber L.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1966; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), World Health Organization designation, MHOM/SD/62/1S-cl2D) were cultured as follows. Promastigotes were grown at 26 °C in M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% defined heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and 25 mm HEPES (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH), pH 6.8. Axenic amastigotes were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 20 mm MES (Sigma), pH 5.5 (12Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cell growth assays of TK transfectants were performed in media supplemented with ganciclovir sodium (0.1m stock solution in deionized water; Cytovene; Hoffman-La Roche).Axenic amastigotes used in Western and Northern blot experiments were obtained by transferring late log-phase promastigotes to medium at 37 °C, pH 5.5. Cells were used 12–18 h after the transfer.Nucleic Acids Preparations and AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted from promastigotes and axenic amastigotes by the phenol-chloroform-guanidium isothiocyanate method using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA samples were prepared from promastigotes using the “mini-prep” procedure described by Medina-Acosta and Cross (13Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern blot hybridizations were carried out in 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate for 18 h at 65 °C. DNA probes were prepared from agarose gel-purified fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals Inc., 3,000 Ci/mmol) by nick translation.Plasmid ConstructsSchematic representations of plasmids used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1.NEOPT and pKSneoThe NEOPT plasmid was designed to allow the differential expression of the neo gene in amastigotes (4Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The construct carries the Pro (P) element, which represents the A2/A2rel intergenic region and the 5′ end of the A2rel gene coding sequence, a synthetic 92-base pair trans-splicing element (pyt), the neomycin resistance gene, and the Tail (T) element, which represents the 3′-untranslated region of A2. The construction of the pKSneo plasmid was described in Zhang et al. (5Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In distinction with the NEOPT plasmid, the neo gene in pKSneo is inserted upstream from the Pro element. The Pro element provides a polyadenylation site for the neo gene, whereastrans-splicing of neo at the 5′ end is controlled by a pyt element. Thus, in pKSneo, the neo gene mRNA is constitutively expressed in both promastigotes and amastigotes.pKSneo-3′NTA truncated version of the 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease gene (3′nt/nu) was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasmid Cl-2 (14Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which contains a 4.5-kb fragment carrying the3′nt/nu coding sequence (1.4 kb). The signal peptide and the terminal anchor sequences were not included in the PCR product. Hence, the sense oligonucleotide (5′-gactccatgg atgacgctcctcagtactgtcgca-3′) created an initiation codon, whereas the antisense oligonucleotide (5′-gacttgatca ctacacggcgacaatcgccgtcac-3′) created a stop codon. The PCR product (1.1 kb) was first inserted into the pCRII cloning vector (T/A cloning system, Invitrogen). Subsequently, the SpeI and XbaI restriction sites from the pCRII vector restriction cassette were used to subclone it into the SpeI site of the pKSneo vector.Constructs for Targeting tk into the A2 LocusThe neo gene was amplified from the pALTneo vector along with an α-tubulin intergenic region from L. enriettii, which provides a trans-splicing acceptor site and a polyadenylation acceptor site (15Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: sense, 5′-gg agatct acctttctctcttccgac-3′ (bases in bold represent a BglII site); antisense, 5′-tacgactcactatagggc-3′.

https://openalex.org/W2075932045,"The activity of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) has previously been shown to be regulated by two discrete high and low affinity binding regions for diacylglycerols and phorbol esters (Slater, S. J., Ho, C., Kelly, M. B., Larkin, J. D., Taddeo, F. J., Yeager, M. D., and Stubbs, C. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 4627–4631). PKC is also known to interact with both cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins; however, less is known concerning the mode of activation of this non-membrane form of PKC. By using the fluorescent phorbol ester, sapintoxin D (SAPD), PKCα, alone, was found to possess both low and high affinity phorbol ester-binding sites, showing that interaction with these sites does not require association with the membrane. Importantly, a fusion protein containing the isolated C1A/C1B (C1) domain of PKCα also bound SAPD with low and high affinity, indicating that the sites may be confined to this domain rather than residing elsewhere on the enzyme molecule. Both high and low affinity interactions with native PKCα were enhanced by protamine sulfate, which activates the enzyme without requiring Ca2+ or membrane lipids. However, this “non-membrane” PKC activity was inhibited by the phorbol ester 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and also by the fluorescent analog, SAPD, opposite to its effect on membrane-associated PKCα. Bryostatin-1 and the soluble diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, both potent activators of membrane-associated PKC, also competed for both low and high affinity SAPD binding and inhibited protamine sulfate-induced activity. Furthermore, the inactive phorbol ester analog 4α-TPA (4α-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) also inhibited non-membrane-associated PKC. In keeping with these observations, although TPA could displace high affinity SAPD binding from both forms of the enzyme, 4α-TPA was only effective at displacing high affinity SAPD binding from non-membrane-associated PKC. 4α-TPA also displaced SAPD from the isolated C1 domain. These results show that although high and low affinity phorbol ester-binding sites are found on non-membrane-associated PKC, the phorbol ester binding properties change significantly upon association with membranes. The activity of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) has previously been shown to be regulated by two discrete high and low affinity binding regions for diacylglycerols and phorbol esters (Slater, S. J., Ho, C., Kelly, M. B., Larkin, J. D., Taddeo, F. J., Yeager, M. D., and Stubbs, C. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 4627–4631).

Protein kinase C (PKC)1constitutes a group of isozymes that are central in cellular signaling pathways that regulate numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). Each isoform can be classified into one of three major classes according to the cofactor and activator requirements. The “conventional” PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ isoforms are Ca2+- and anionic phospholipid-dependent, whereas the “novel” PKCδ, -ε, -η, and -θ and “atypical” PKCζ and -λ isozymes retain a phospholipid dependence but lack a Ca2+ requirement (2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In addition, the activities of all PKC isoforms, except atypical PKC, are potentiated by the lipid second messenger, diacylglycerol, derived from the receptor-G-protein and phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositides and phosphatidylcholines (3Exton J.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and also by the potent tumor-promoting phorbol esters (4Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ and phospholipid requirements for PKC activity differ according to the lysine and arginine content of the substrate (5Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). Thus, the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of the lysine-rich protein, histone H1, requires the presence of both Ca2+ and phospholipid, whereas the phosphorylation of the arginine-rich protein, protamine sulfate, requires neither cofactor (6Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L.

Biochem. 1987; 163: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation by protamine sulfate, which also acts as a substrate, has been suggested to involve a binding site(s) for arginine-rich proteins on the PKC molecule, separate from the active center of the enzyme (6Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Bruins R.H. Epand R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similar to that which occurs upon membrane association induced by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol or phorbol esters, interaction with protamine sulfate has been suggested to mediate in an allosteric activating conformational change resulting in the removal of a pseudosubstrate region from the active site which, in the inactive state, blocks substrate binding (12Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, use of protamine sulfate provides a useful model for the activation of PKC in the absence of lipids by interaction with other proteins. The question of the mechanism by which PKC activity induced by protein-protein interactions is regulated has become an urgent concern, since it has become apparent that there are a large number of non-membrane protein targets for the enzyme, such as, for example, cytoskeletal and nuclear elements (e.g. Refs. 13Murti K.G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although interaction with arginine-rich proteins such as protamine sulfate relieves the Ca2+ and phospholipid requirements for PKC activity, it is not known whether this non-membrane PKC activity is modulated by phorbol esters and/or diacylglycerols in a similar manner to the membrane-associated enzyme. Evidence supporting this possibility was provided recently by the finding that PKCδ is capable of binding phorbol esters with low affinity in the absence of membrane lipids (22Kazanietz M.G. Barchi Jr., J.J. Omichinski J.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14679-14684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that these compounds can induce binding of PKCε to filamentous actin (F-actin) (23Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrain D.M. Cell. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although F-actin itself was not found to be a substrate for this isoform, this may lead to enhanced phosphorylation of other protein targets. PKCβII has also been shown to bind F-actin which is reported to be a substrate for this isoform (24Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this respect, F-actin can be considered to be an example of a number of specific intracellular proteins that bind the activated form of PKC, termed “receptors for activated C-kinase” (RACKs) (20Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 21Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which allow precise targeting of PKC isoforms to specific cellular locations. However, the non-membrane, phorbol-induced interaction of PKC with F-actin departs from the original definition of RACKs that were described as proteins that bind PKC that has been activated by membrane association (25Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). For membrane-associated PKC, activation by diacylglycerol proceeds by two parallel mechanisms. The first involves an increased affinity for the membrane, which is revealed as a decrease in the concentrations of both Ca2+ and anionic phospholipid required for maximal activity (4Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 26Kishimoto A. Takai Y. Mori T. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

Second, interaction with diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine induces an activating conformational change that results in the folding out of an N-terminal pseudosubstrate region (12Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,28House C. Kemp B.E.

Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters have been suggested to potentiate PKC activity in a similar manner to diacylglycerol so that the two activator types initially appeared to share a single site or two identical sites of interaction on the enzyme (4Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 32Sharkey N.A. Leach K.L. Blumberg P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in recent studies of activator binding to PKCα, using the fluorescent phorbol ester sapintoxin D (SAPD), we showed that diacylglycerols and phorbol esters interact with differing affinities with two activator binding sites on the enzyme molecule (34Slater S.J.

Furthermore, it was shown that the site with low affinity for phorbol esters binds diacylglycerol with a relatively higher affinity, suggesting that the specificity of this site may differ from the high affinity phorbol ester-binding site (35Slater S.J.

Interaction of diacylglycerol with this low affinity phorbol ester-binding site was found to lead to an enhancement in the level of high affinity phorbol ester binding and consequently to a potentiated level of PKC activity. By contrast to diacylglycerol, the potent PKC activator and anti-tumor agent, bryostatin-1, was found to compete more effectively for high affinity phorbol ester binding and did not potentiate the level of phorbol ester-induced PKC activity. Based on these results, a model for PKC activation was proposed in which interaction of an activator with the low affinity for phorbol ester-binding site leads to an enhanced level of binding of either the same or a second activator to the high affinity phorbol ester-binding site and consequently to an elevated level of PKCα activity (35Slater S.J.

The activator binding site with relatively high affinity for phorbol esters likely resides within the C1 domain, which consists of two cystine-rich zinc finger motifs, termed C1A and C1B (37Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Interaction of phorbol esters with these subdomains has been extensively characterized by truncation/deletion and mutagenesis studies (38Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L.

(Tokyo). 1995; 117: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing either the C1A or C1B subdomains, it has been shown that both are capable of binding phorbol esters (39Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Quest A.F.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20000-20012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,46Irie K.

However, the phorbol ester binding affinities of the two subdomains may differ for each PKC isoform. For example, whereas PKCγ C1A and C1B appear to bind phorbol esters with similar affinities, in the case of the novel PKCs, PKCη and PKCδ C1B bind phorbol esters with higher affinity than C1B (47Yanai Y. Irie K. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 117-122Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 48Hunn M. Quest A.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that these isoform-specific differences in phorbol ester binding to C1A and C1B may be carried over into the native enzyme. While for PKCδ C1B has been identified as being a high affinity phorbol ester-binding site, due to its role in phorbol ester-induced intracellular translocation (49Szallasi Z. Bogi K. Gohari S. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18299-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), for PKCγ the high affinity site may correspond to C1A (46Irie K. Yanai Y. Oie K. Ishizawa J. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Kikkawa U. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1725-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first aim of this study was to determine if the high and low affinity activator binding sites, previously identified on membrane-associated PKCα (35Slater S.J. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Larkin J.D. Taddeo F.J. Yeager M.D. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4627-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), similarly exist on the non-membrane form of this isoform. Second, the effects of phorbol esters and other activators of membrane-associated PKC on lipid-independent activity induced by protein-protein interactions with protamine sulfate were determined. Finally, while the high affinity phorbol ester-binding site clearly resides with the C1 domain, whether the low affinity binding site is similarly located was also investigated. The results indicate that both high and low affinity phorbol ester-binding sites on non-membrane PKCα pre-exist in the absence of membrane lipids and that both sites are confined within the C1 domain of this isoform. However, phorbol esters, diacylglycerol, and bryostatin-1, although clearly described as being potent activators of membrane-associated PKCα, are shown in the present study to be potent inhibitors of non-membrane PKCα activity induced by protamine sulfate. SAPD was from Calbiochem. 4β-12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 4α-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (4α-TPA), and protamine sulfate were from Sigma. Bryostatin-1 was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Bovine brain phosphatidylserine (BPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and 1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-glycerol (OAG) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) was from Boehringer Mannheim, and [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Fisher. The recombinant conventional PKC isoform, PKCα (rat brain), was prepared using the baculovirusSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell expression system (50Burns D.J. Bloomenthal J. Lee M.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12044-12051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity, as described previously (51Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Ho C. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the PKCα preparation was typically ∼1 nmol min−1 μg−1. Based on evidence that GST stabilizes the isolated C1 domain and to ensure the production of only full-length peptides, the fusion protein, GST-C1-(His)6, was constructed. The nucleotide consensus sequence assigned to the C1 domain of PKCα was that described previously (52Quest A.F. Bardes E.S. Xie W.Q. Willott E. Borchardt R.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This was amplified by PCR withPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using full-length rat cDNA as the template. Primers were designed so thatEcoRI and HpaI restriction sites were inserted at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the domain, respectively, to facilitate insertion into pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reverse primer also encoded a blunt restriction site after the last amino acid of the domain which was utilized to insert a (His)6 sequence (5′-CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC TGA-3′). The domain fragment was subcloned into pGEX-5x-2 yielding a plasmid, the sequence of which was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University), that encoded GST-C1-(His)6, a protein-tagged N terminus with GST and C terminus with (His)6. Along with the GST-C1-(His)6, a fusion protein lacking the C1 domain was prepared by insertion of the (His)6 sequence alone into pGEX-5x-2 (GST-(His)6). Escherichia coli BL21 cells harboring the expression plasmids for GST-C1-(His)6 or GST-(His)6 were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the absorbance at 600 nm (A 600) was ∼1. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced at room temperature with 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 4 h, after which the cells were pelleted, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, re-pelleted, and stored at −80 °C. The fusion proteins were purified from the frozen E. coli pellets as described previously (52Quest A.F. Bardes E.S. Xie W.Q. Willott E. Borchardt R.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen cell pellets were homogenized at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10% ethylene glycol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 320 units of benzonase, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The homogenate was placed on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Sufficient dithiothreitol was added to the cleared lysate to a yield a final concentration of 1 mm which was then loaded slowly onto a 1-ml column containing glutathione agarose (Sigma) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The eluate was re-applied to the column two times followed by extensive washing with 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 15 mm NaCl, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100. The fusion proteins were eluted in a pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 10% v/v ethylene glycol, 15 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.4% w/v sucrose monolaurate. In order to isolate full-length peptides the crude preparation was further purified by metal affinity chromatography using TALON resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Fractions containing the purified fusion protein (detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining) were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 10% v/v ethylene glycol. The resultant product was finally concentrated by dialysis against the same buffer saturated with polyethylene glycol and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% v/v glycerol. To facilitate isolation and purification, a (His)6 affinity tag was added to the C terminus of PKCζ. Briefly, the last 1100 base pairs were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and using PKCζ cDNA as a template, which was cloned in this laboratory. 2Frank J. Taddeo, Mark D. Yeager, and Christopher D. Stubbs, manuscript in preparation. The reverse primer was designed so that the stop codon was eliminated, and the (His)6 sequence (CATCACCATCACCATCACTGA) followed by a stop codon and an HpaI restriction site was inserted in frame with the coding sequence. The PCR product was gel-purified on 1% agarose, A-tailed using TAQ polymerase and dATP, and subcloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University). The first 1203 nucleotides of PKCζ were excised from PKCζ/pCR2.1 using EcoRI/BlnI, and the last 576 nucleotides including the (His)6 tag were excised from PKCζ-3′(His)6/pCR2.1 usingBlnI/HpaI. The fragments were gel-purified, ligated into the EcoRI/StuI site of pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transformed into DH5α E. coli. A clone containing the full-length PKCζ coding sequence including the (His)6 tag was selected by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA. A recombinant baculovirus containing the PKCζ-(His)6 sequence was generated using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5, incubated for 3 days at 27 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and pellets stored at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were homogenized in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). PKCζ-(His)6 was then purified by metal affinity chromatography using TALON resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Fractions containing PKCζ-(His)6 were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol saturated with polyethylene glycol at 4 °C. The concentrated pool was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration XK 16/70 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The column was developed at 0.2 ml/min overnight. Fractions containing PKCζ-(His)6 were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. PKCα activity was determined in the presence of protamine sulfate, which acts both as a phosphate acceptor and an activator of the enzyme, as described previously (34Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay consisted of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, PKCα (0.04 ng/μl or 0.52 nm final), and protamine sulfate (0.4 mg ml−1). To this was added either TPA or 4α-TPA from 0.5 mm dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) stock solutions, OAG from a 10 mm methanol stock, or bryostatin-1 from a 50 μm methanol stock, so that the total assay volume was 75 μl. The assay was allowed to thermally equilibrate to 30 °C and initiated by the addition of ATP (15 μm), [γ-32P]ATP (∼1 μCi), and MgCl2 (15 mm) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. After 30 min, the assay was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of phosphoric acid (175 mm), 100 μl of which was transferred to Whatman P81 anion exchange papers. These were washed three times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, air-dried, and placed into scintillation mixture. The incorporation of 32P into protamine sulfate was then measured by scintillation counting. Results are expressed as specific activities. The linearity of the assay was confirmed in separate experiments (results not shown). The concentration of phorbol ester, diacylglycerol, or bryostatin-1 required to reduce protamine sulfate-induced activity by 50% (IC50) and the corresponding Hill coefficient (n) were determined by fitting activity data to a linear Hill equation by linear regression analysis (53Cornish-Bowden A. Principles of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworths & Co., London1976: 121Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1.logvIv0−vI=log IC50+n log[I](Eq. 1) where, v 0 and v I are the reaction velocities in the absence and presence of inhibitor. Binding of the fluorescent phorbol ester, SAPD, to PKCα, PKCζ-(His)6, or GST-C1-(His)6 in the absence of membranes was quantified as described previously by measuring the resonance energy transfer (RET) from tryptophans to the 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl fluor"

Tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns are a hallmark of vertebrate genomes (1Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 2Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the cytosines residing at the dinucleotide CG sequence are methylated; however, the identity of CG sequences that are methylated varies from tissue to tissue and at different developmental stages of the same cell type (2Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is now clear that DNA methylation patterns play an important role in encoding the epigenetic information of vertebrate genomes by regulating gene expression as well as other genome functions (3Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data have also associated aberrations in regulation of DNA methyltransferase with the oncogenic process (4El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is clear that to understand how epigenetic information is generated and maintained, it is critical to unravel what regulates the formation of DNA methylation patterns. The principal mystery that has not been resolved yet is the fact that only one DNA MeTase1 has been identified in mammalian cells by molecular cloning, which can potentially methylate any CpG site (6Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). An additional putative DNA methyltransferase has recently been cloned, but its ability to transfer methyl groups to DNA has not yet been demonstrated (7Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). How can one gene or possibly a small number of genes encoding DNA MeTase activity be responsible for generating all these diverse patterns of methylation?The most attractive and obvious explanation for the diversity of DNA methylation patterns is that a large number of DNA MeTases are encoded by the vertebrate genome, each with its distinct specificity and pattern of expression. Nevertheless, any previous attempts to identify additional DNA MeTase genes has been unsuccessful. However, there is an additional widespread biological principle that might allow the vertebrate genome to encode different mRNAs for a given gene, alternative splicing (8Choi E. Kuehl M. Wall R. Nature. 1980; 286: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that sex-specific 5′ exons of DNA MeTase are expressed in mammalian germ cells (9Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The known vertebrate DNA MeTase is a large protein that is believed to be composed based on its sequence similarity to other cytosine DNA methyltransferases, from at least three structural components (10Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar): A DNA methyltransferase domain at the 3′ end, an N terminus domain that is responsible for localization of the protein to the nucleus and the replication fork, and a poorly characterized domain in its central part (10Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 11Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that one can distinguish three functional regions in bacterial MeTases as well as in the methyltransferase domain of the mammalian enzyme: the evolutionarily conserved catalytic motif and S-adenosyll-methionine-binding regions and the variable target recognition region (10Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 12Kumar S. Cheng X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Swapping of alternative variable domains has been shown to alter the target recognition sequence of some bacterial DNA MeTases (13Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The answer to the question of whether alternative splicing of vertebrate DNA MeTase mRNA is a feasible mechanism is dependent on whether the gene structure is interrupted by a number of introns, generating alternative potential splice partners. The physical structure of the human DNA MeTase gene has recently been resolved (14Ramchandani S. Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is consistent with this hypothesis. The 3′ DNA methyltransferase catalytic domain is comprised of eleven exons. Four exons encode the previously proposed variable domain, which is believed to be responsible for sequence specificity. This domain is located in between the conserved domains of DNA MeTase and is a potential hot spot for splicing.We have used the rat as a model system because it allows easy access toin vivo material and the rat PC12 cell line as a well defined in vitro differentiation model (15Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar) to test the hypothesis that developmentally regulated alternative splicing is involved in the processing of DNA MeTase transcripts. The data presented in this paper suggest that one mechanism utilized by the vertebrate genome for generating diversity of DNA MeTases is alternative splicing.DISCUSSIONOne of the long-standing and fundamental questions in DNA methylation is “How are cell- and gene-specific patterns of methylation generated and maintained?” The specificity of the known cytosine DNA MeTase is more lax, and it can recognize any sequence that bears the dinucleotide CpG (6Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Despite the indiscriminate nature of the enzyme, DNA methylation patterns exhibit remarkable gene and tissue specificity. It is tempting to speculate that diversification of the variable domain of mammalian DNA MeTases can lead to generation of multiple DNA MeTases with a common core sequence specificity to CpG with different sequence context specificities. There are different biological mechanisms that can lead to such diversification, gene duplication (20Nebert D.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 27: 27-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), gene rearrangement (21Robertson M. Nature. 1982; 297: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), or alternative splicing (22Missler M. Sudhof T.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 20-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). For example, thousands of neurexin isoforms are generated from three genes by usage of alternative promoters and alternative splicing (22Missler M. Sudhof T.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 20-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).The data presented in this paper are the first body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that alternative in-frame splicing of the DNA methyltransferase domain encompassing the variable region is utilized by mammals to generate different forms of DNA MeTase mRNAs (Fig. 3). Thus, multiple DNA MeTases exist in mammals, but they are encoded by the same gene. Many questions remain as to the biological functionin vivo of the different forms of DNA MeTase mRNA identified in this study, as well as the significance of their developmental regulation. Do they encode fully functional proteins? Although it is clear that multiple forms of DNA MeTase exist, the degree of diversity is unclear. How many different forms exist? What percentage of the splice variants is ubiquitous and what is tissue- and developmental stage-specific? What is the relative role of splice variants in the DNA methyltransferase domain versus variants in other regions of DNA MeTase such as the N-terminal domain?A number of observations support the hypothesis that the results reported here do not reflect ectopic and biologically irrelevant phenomenon. First, alternative splicing is verified by two independent methods, RT-PCR and RNase protection. Second, all the splice variants are in frame with the known DNA MeTase coding sequence. It is highly improbable that all the in-frame splice variants reported in this study are generated randomly. Third, the alternative splicing exhibits tissue and developmental specificity.One obvious question is the relative abundance of the new formsversus the known published DNA MeTase sequence (17Bestor T.H. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 18Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D. Yu J.J. el-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The fact that a similar DNA MeTase has been cloned from different organisms suggests that the known cloned cDNA sequence is the most abundant form. This might seemingly lead one to discount the other forms that are presented at lower frequencies. However, if alternative splice variants play a role in delineating discrete methylation patterns, the relative abundance of each variant should be limited. We speculate that the difference in the relative abundance of the known DNA MeTaseversus the splice variants reflects a bimodal control of DNA methylation patterns. The abundant form of the DNA MeTase is responsible for the bulk of maintenance DNA methylation, whereas the discrete splice variants are involved in the fine tuning of the methylation pattern. This might explain why the relative frequency of specific splice variants is increased during differentiation.Lei et al. (23Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jutterman R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously reported that embryonic cells bearing a null mutation of the known DNA MeTase exhibit stable low level methylation and are able to methylate viral DNA as well as wild-type cells, thus providing evidence for a second de novo DNA MeTase. The null mutation described by Lei et al. (23Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jutterman R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) removes the exons corresponding to exons 32 and 33 (Fig. 3 A), which are naturally spliced in some of the alternative spliced DNA MeTase cDNA described in this study (Fig. 3). Thus, the mutated allele might still encode some of the normal alternatively spliced DNA MeTase isoforms. It is possible that some of these alternatively spliced DNA MeTase mRNAs bear the de novomethylation activity described in the null mutant. The main problem with this hypothesis is that these splice variants lack the predicted catalytic PC dipeptide. A possible explanation is that an additional conserved PC dipeptide that resides upstream from the catalytic domain at amino acids 584–585 might substitute for the bona fide PC motif in the alternatively spliced DNA MeTase isoforms. Our data, however, do not exclude the possibility suggested by Lei et al. (23Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jutterman R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that another DNA MeTase gene encodes the de novo DNA MeTase. Whereas our study opens up a large number of questions that should be resolved in future experiments, the data presented here lay out a new framework for understanding the diversity of DNA methylation patterns. Tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns are a hallmark of vertebrate genomes (1Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 2Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the cytosines residing at the dinucleotide CG sequence are methylated; however, the identity of CG sequences that are methylated varies from tissue to tissue and at different developmental stages of the same cell type (2Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is now clear that DNA methylation patterns play an important role in encoding the epigenetic information of vertebrate genomes by regulating gene expression as well as other genome functions (3Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data have also associated aberrations in regulation of DNA methyltransferase with the oncogenic process (4El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is clear that to understand how epigenetic information is generated and maintained, it is critical to unravel what regulates the formation of DNA methylation patterns. The principal mystery that has not been resolved yet is the fact that only one DNA MeTase1 has been identified in mammalian cells by molecular cloning, which can potentially methylate any CpG site (6Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). An additional putative DNA methyltransferase has recently been cloned, but its ability to transfer methyl groups to DNA has not yet been demonstrated (7Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). How can one gene or possibly a small number of genes encoding DNA MeTase activity be responsible for generating all these diverse patterns of methylation? The most attractive and obvious explanation for the diversity of DNA methylation patterns is that a large number of DNA MeTases are encoded by the vertebrate genome, each with its distinct specificity and pattern of expression. Nevertheless, any previous attempts to identify additional DNA MeTase genes has been unsuccessful. However, there is an additional widespread biological principle that might allow the vertebrate genome to encode different mRNAs for a given gene, alternative splicing (8Choi E. Kuehl M. Wall R. Nature. 1980; 286: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that sex-specific 5′ exons of DNA MeTase are expressed in mammalian germ cells (9Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The known vertebrate DNA MeTase is a large protein that is believed to be composed based on its sequence similarity to other cytosine DNA methyltransferases, from at least three structural components (10Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar): A DNA methyltransferase domain at the 3′ end, an N terminus domain that is responsible for localization of the protein to the nucleus and the replication fork, and a poorly characterized domain in its central part (10Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 11Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that one can distinguish three functional regions in bacterial MeTases as well as in the methyltransferase domain of the mammalian enzyme: the evolutionarily conserved catalytic motif and S-adenosyll-methionine-binding regions and the variable target recognition region (10Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 12Kumar S. Cheng X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Swapping of alternative variable domains has been shown to alter the target recognition sequence of some bacterial DNA MeTases (13Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The answer to the question of whether alternative splicing of vertebrate DNA MeTase mRNA is a feasible mechanism is dependent on whether the gene structure is interrupted by a number of introns, generating alternative potential splice partners. The physical structure of the human DNA MeTase gene has recently been resolved (14Ramchandani S. Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is consistent with this hypothesis. The 3′ DNA methyltransferase catalytic domain is comprised of eleven exons. Four exons encode the previously proposed variable domain, which is believed to be responsible for sequence specificity. This domain is located in between the conserved domains of DNA MeTase and is a potential hot spot for splicing. We have used the rat as a model system because it allows easy access toin vivo material and the rat PC12 cell line as a well defined in vitro differentiation model (15Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar) to test the hypothesis that developmentally regulated alternative splicing is involved in the processing of DNA MeTase transcripts. The data presented in this paper suggest that one mechanism utilized by the vertebrate genome for generating diversity of DNA MeTases is alternative splicing. DISCUSSIONOne of the long-standing and fundamental questions in DNA methylation is “How are cell- and gene-specific patterns of methylation generated and maintained?” The specificity of the known cytosine DNA MeTase is more lax, and it can recognize any sequence that bears the dinucleotide CpG (6Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Despite the indiscriminate nature of the enzyme, DNA methylation patterns exhibit remarkable gene and tissue specificity. It is tempting to speculate that diversification of the variable domain of mammalian DNA MeTases can lead to generation of multiple DNA MeTases with a common core sequence specificity to CpG with different sequence context specificities. There are different biological mechanisms that can lead to such diversification, gene duplication (20Nebert D.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 27: 27-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), gene rearrangement (21Robertson M. Nature. 1982; 297: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), or alternative splicing (22Missler M. Sudhof T.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 20-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). For example, thousands of neurexin isoforms are generated from three genes by usage of alternative promoters and alternative splicing (22Missler M. Sudhof T.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 20-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).The data presented in this paper are the first body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that alternative in-frame splicing of the DNA methyltransferase domain encompassing the variable region is utilized by mammals to generate different forms of DNA MeTase mRNAs (Fig. 3). Thus, multiple DNA MeTases exist in mammals, but they are encoded by the same gene. Many questions remain as to the biological functionin vivo of the different forms of DNA MeTase mRNA identified in this study, as well as the significance of their developmental regulation. Do they encode fully functional proteins? Although it is clear that multiple forms of DNA MeTase exist, the degree of diversity is unclear. How many different forms exist? What percentage of the splice variants is ubiquitous and what is tissue- and developmental stage-specific? What is the relative role of splice variants in the DNA methyltransferase domain versus variants in other regions of DNA MeTase such as the N-terminal domain?A number of observations support the hypothesis that the results reported here do not reflect ectopic and biologically irrelevant phenomenon. First, alternative splicing is verified by two independent methods, RT-PCR and RNase protection. Second, all the splice variants are in frame with the known DNA MeTase coding sequence. It is highly improbable that all the in-frame splice variants reported in this study are generated randomly. Third, the alternative splicing exhibits tissue and developmental specificity.One obvious question is the relative abundance of the new formsversus the known published DNA MeTase sequence (17Bestor T.H. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 18Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D. Yu J.J. el-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G.

https://openalex.org/W2060393630,"Type XI collagen, a heterotrimer specific to cartilage matrix, plays an important role in cartilage morphogenesis. We analyzed various α2(XI) collagen promoter-lacZreporter gene constructs in transgenic mice to understand tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. The −530 promoter sequence was sufficient to direct reporter gene expression specifically to cartilage. Further deletion to −500 abolished reporter gene expression in cartilage but activated the expression specific to neural tissues such as brain and neural tube. An additional 47-base pair deletion resulted in random tissue expression patterns. A 24-base pair sequence from −530 to −507 of the α2(XI) promoter was able to switch the activity of the heterologous neurofilament light gene promoter from neural tissues to cartilage. These results suggest that the α2(XI) collagen gene is regulated by at least three modular elements: a basal promoter sequence distal to −453, a neural tissue-specific element (−454 to −500), and a cartilage-specific element (−501 to −530), which inhibits expression in neural tissues and induces expression in cartilage.

Cartilage is a highly specialized tissue that serves as the template for the development of skeleton and lines the joint surface. Cartilage consists of an abundant extracellular matrix maintained by chondrocytes. The collagen network provides a scaffolding for proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and confers tensile strength important for resisting compression and shearing loads in cartilage. Cartilage collagen fibrils are heterotypic fibrils composed of types II, IX, and XI collagens. The type XI collagen molecules co-assemble stoichiometrically with the major collagen, type II collagen, to form cartilage fibrils, whereas type IX collagen is associated with the surface of the fibrils (1Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 2Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The type XI collagen molecule is composed of three distinct subunits: α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) (3Morris N.P. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α3(XI) chain is a post-translational variant of the α1(II) chain (4Furuto D.K. Miller E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains are distinct gene products (5Bernard M. Yoshioka H. Rodriguez E. van der Rest M. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17159-17166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kimura T. Cheah K.S.E. Chan S.D.H. Lui V.C.H. Mattei M.-G. van der Rest M. Ono K. Solomon E. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13910-13916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type XI collagen likely regulates the diameter of cartilage collagen fibrils (1Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7Petit B. Ronziére M.C. Hartmann D.J. Herbage D. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This putative function is supported by a null mutation in the α1(XI) gene of cho/cho(chondrodysplasia) mice, in which the cartilage lacks the α1(XI) collagen chain and perhaps collagen XI trimer molecules resulting in abnormally thick collagen fibrils (8Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, association of α2(XI) gene mutations with certain forms of human chondrodysplasia, Stickler syndrome, and otospondylo-megaepiphyseal dysplasia indicates that type XI collagen is intimately involved in skeletal morphogenesis (9Vikkula M. Mariman E.C.M. Lui V.C.H. Zhidkova N.I. Tiller G.E. Goldring M.B. van Beersum S.E.C. de Waal Malefijt M.C. van den Hoogen F.H.J. Ropers H.-H. Mayne R. Cheah K.S.E. Olsen B.R. Warman M.L. Brunner H.G. Cell. 1995; 80: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the fidelity of spatiotemporal expression of type XI collagen is crucial for the development and maintenance of the normal structure of cartilage. The expression patterns of the three subunits of type XI collagen molecules differ from each other. In addition to its presence in cartilage, mRNA for the α1(XI) chain is also found in a variety of non-cartilaginous tissues, including the bone, vitreous, heart, and cerebral neuro-epithelium (10Yoshioka H. Iyama K.-I. Inoguchi K. Khaleduzzaman M. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, mRNA for the α3(XI) chain is detected in various tissues besides cartilage (11Cheah K.S.E. Lau E.T. Au P.K. Tam P.P. Development (Camb.). 1991; 111: 945-953PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of the α2(XI) gene appears to be more restricted. Although low levels of alternatively spliced variants of α2(XI) transcripts are detected in non-cartilaginous tissues, the major transcript is predominantly found in cartilage (12Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Sugimoto M. Kimura T. Tsumaki N. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Kawabata H. Yasui N. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Ochi T. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the level of α2(XI) mRNA is lower than that of α1(XI) mRNA and much less than that of the α1(II) collagen gene (14Lui V.C.H. Kong R.Y. C Nicholls J. Cheung A.N.Y. Cheah K.S.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that expression of the α2(XI) gene may be rate-limiting for the trimer formation of type XI collagen molecules that is critical for the subsequent lateral growth of cartilage collagen fibrils. Recently, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-flanking region of the mouse α2(XI) collagen gene (Col11a2)1 and found that the retinoid X receptor β gene (Rxrb) is located 742 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of theCol11a2 gene (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We also showed that the −742-bp promoter sequence of the Col11a2 gene contains information for expression specific to the primordial cartilage of long bones and ribs (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further delineatedcis-regulatory elements of the Col11a2 promoter necessary for cartilage-specific expression using reporter gene constructs in transgenic mice. We found that the −530-bp sequence was sufficient for the cartilage-specific expression of theCol11a2 gene. Deletion of a sequence between −530 and −500 abolished reporter gene expression in cartilage. Interestingly, deletion of this sequence induced neural tissue-specific expression. We also showed that a 24-bp sequence in this region could activate reporter gene expression in cartilage when it was linked to the heterologous human neurofilament light gene (NF-L) promoter. Our data suggest a modular arrangement in which a basal promoter, a neural tissue-specific cis-element, and a cartilage-specificcis-element regulate transcription of tissue-specific expression of the Col11a2 gene. The transgene constructs, 742lacZ and 453lacZ, which bear 742- and 453-bp Col11a2 promoter sequences, respectively, linked to the β-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ) were described previously (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other transgene constructs containing various lengths of the Col11a2 promoter region were prepared by cloning into the expression vector pNASSβ (CLONTECH), which contains a SV40 RNA splice site, the β-galactosidase gene, and a SV40 polyadenylation signal. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For construction of 680lacZ, 530lacZ, 518lacZ, 530ΔlacZ, and 500lacZ, DNA fragments spanning −680 to +380, −530 to +380, −518 to +380, −530 to −517 and −500 to +380, and −500 to +380 of the Col11a2promoter, respectively, were generated by PCR with a genomic subclone from λNT8 (12Tsumaki N.

After digestion withEcoRI and XhoI, the PCR fragments were cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites upstream of the SV40 splice site of pNASSβ.

After digestion with EcoRI and SalI, the PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pNASSβ to create DNA construct NF-lacZ. For generation of the fusion promoter construct, complementary oligonucleotides 24-1 and 24-2 containing three tandem copies of a sequence (−530 and −507) of Col11a2 were synthesized and annealed to generate a double-stranded DNA fragment. The annealed fragment was cloned into theEcoRI/XhoI sites upstream of the neurofilament promoter (NF-lacZ) to create the construct 24×3-NF-lacZ.

A DNA fragment free from the plasmid sequence was prepared from each construct by digesting withEcoRI and PstI and microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from F1 hybrid mice (C57BL/6 × C3H) as described (17Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1994Google Scholar). Generation 0 (G0) embryos were sacrificed at 13.5 d.p.c. (days postconception) and processed for expression analysis of the reporter gene. Transgenic embryos were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from the placenta as described previously (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was analyzed by staining with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Sigma) according to the previously described technique (18Bonnerot C. Nicolas J.-F. Wassarman P.M. Depamphilis M.L. Application of lacZ Gene Fusions to Postimplantation Development. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 451-469Google Scholar). Briefly, the embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with X-gal for 2–7 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing in phosphate-buffered saline and postfixing in 4% paraformaldehyde. For histological examination, stained embryos were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned on a microtome. Then the sections were counterstained with eosin. A series of β-galactosidase reporter gene constructs containing various deletions between −742 and −453 of the promoter region were prepared to analyze tissue-specific activity of the α2(XI) gene promoter (Fig. 1). The DNA constructs were microinjected into fertilized ova, and generation 0 (G0) embryos were sacrificed at 13.5 d.p.c. and stained with X-gal to analyze the expression patterns of the reporter gene. The numbers of transgenic mice and mice expressing β-galactosidase are summarized in Table I.Table IExpression pattern of lacZ transgenic miceTransgene constructNumber of transgenic embryosNumber of transgenic embryos expressing β-galactosidaseX-gal-stained tissue742lacZ54Cartilage680lacZ32Cartilage530lacZ63Cartilage518lacZ32Neural tissue530ΔlacZ32Neural tissue500lacZ54Neural tissue453lacZ85RandomNF-lacZ63Neural tissue24×3-NF-lacZ22Cartilage, other tissues Open table in a new tab The 742lacZ construct containing the −742-bp promoter showed expression in the cartilage of transgenic mice, which is inconsistent with our previous finding (Fig. 2 A) (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further 5′-deletions of the Col11a2 promoter revealed that the constructs, 680lacZ and 530lacZ, containing the −680- and −530-bp promoter, respectively, were also capable of directing reporter gene expression specifically to the primordial cartilage in limbs and in ribs (Fig. 2, B and C). Histological analysis confirmed that X-gal staining of these mice was restricted to chondrocytes (Fig. 2 D). All reporter gene expressing transgenic mice with 742lacZ, 680lacZ, and 530lacZ showed similar expression specifically in cartilage (Table I). A 5′ 12-bp deletion of the −530-bp promoter (518lacZ) resulted in no reporter gene expression in cartilage, but expression was activated in neural tissues such as brain and neural tube (Fig. 2,E and F). Strong staining was observed in the roof of the neopallial cortex, in the primitive ectomeninx, and in a medial portion of the neural tube. An internal 16-bp deletion between −516 and −501 (530ΔlacZ) in the 530lacZconstruct also abolished expression in cartilage but induced neural tissue-specific expression (Fig. 2, G and H). The entire roof of the neopallial cortex, roof of the midbrain, and neural tube showed strong staining. A 5′ 30-bp deletion from 530lacZ (500lacZ) also resulted in the expression of β-galactosidase in neural tissue, but not in cartilage (Fig. 2,I and J). Intense X-gal staining was detected in the roof of the neopallial cortex. The overall β-galactosidase expression patterns of transgenic embryos for these three constructs, 518lacZ, 530ΔlacZ, and 500lacZ, were limited to neural tissues, although there were some variations in the relative staining intensity. Histological analysis confirmed specific expression of the reporter gene in neural tissue in transgenic mice bearing these constructs (Fig. 2 K). The 453lacZconstruct, which had an additional 57-bp deletion from 500lacZ at 5′-end, showed β-galactosidase expression in various tissues. No consistent tissue-specific reporter gene expression patterns were found in the five transgenic mice with this construct, agreeing with previous reports (Fig. 2 L; Ref. 15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the whole 30-bp sequence (−530 to −500) of the α2(XI) gene is required for cartilage-specific expression. Because a sequence between −530 and −500 of the Col11a2 promoter region appeared to be capable of converting reporter gene expression from neural tissue-specific to cartilage-specific expression, we investigated this activity with an heterologous promoter from the NF-L gene, which can direct expression in neural tissues. The 24×3-NF-lacZconstruct was prepared by placing three copies of a 24-bp sequence spanning −530 to −507 of the α2(XI) gene upstream of theNF-L promoter (−292 to +15). The NF-L promoter alone (NF-lacZ) specifically expressed β-galactosidase in the nervous system (Fig. 3, Aand B), in agreement with a previous report (16Charron G. Guy L.-G. Bazinet M. Julien J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30604-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the 24-bp segment to the NF-L promoter (24×3-NF-lacZ) showed activation of the reporter gene expression in the primordial cartilage of ribs, scapula, and neural arch (Fig. 3, C and D). Although reporter gene expression was observed in some other tissues such as the primordium of follicle of vibrissa at nose and some surface ectoderm in the limbs, the 24-bp sequence down-regulated neural tissue-specific expression directed by the NF-L promoter and activated the expression predominantly in cartilage. In this study, we have defined the minimal sequences responsible for cartilage-specific expression of the Col11a2 gene using a series of deletions in transgenic mice. We found that the −530-bp promoter sequence was sufficient to direct reporter gene expression specifically to cartilage. Further deletions showed that the −500-bp promoter sequence exclusively directed expression to the neural tissue, whereas the −453-bp promoter sequence expressed the reporter gene in various tissues. These results suggest that the Col11a2promoter consists of three modular elements: the basal promoter sequence located downstream from −453 conferring ability to activate transcription without any tissue specificity, the neural tissue-specific cis-element between −454 and −500, and the cartilage-specific cis-element between −501 and −530 of the α2(XI) promoter. The neural tissue-specific expression patterns of transgenic mice bearing 518lacZ and 530ΔlacZ suggest that the 30-bp sequence (−530 to −500) of the Col11a2 gene is necessary for cartilage-specific expression. A GGAGGAG sequence (−527 to −521) in this region may be important, because a homologous sequence was found in the complementary sequence of a silencer of the α1(II) collagen gene (19Savagner P. Miyashita T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6669-6674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the 3′-end of the 30-bp region of the α2(XI) promoter, there is a potential Sox9 binding motif for SRY and SOX proteins (TTCAAAG, −505 to −499). Sox9 was shown to bind to the enhancer of the α1(II) collagen gene and to activate its expression (20Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bell D.M. Leung K.K.H. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Thus, this site may be important for activation of the α2(XI) gene. It was surprising to find that a sequence within the α2(XI) promoter directed the expression of the reporter gene in neural tissues, becauseCol11a2 expression is restricted to cartilage and is hardly found in neural tissues (13Sugimoto M. Kimura T. Tsumaki N. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Kawabata H. Yasui N. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Ochi T. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the 30-bp sequence to the −500-bp promoter changed the expression pattern from neural tissues to cartilage. These results may suggest that the 30-bp cartilage-specificcis-element has dual activities, one for inactivation of transcription in neural tissues and the other for activation of transcription in cartilage. These activities were partly supported by the finding that the reporter gene expression was active in cartilage but inactive in neural tissues in transgenic mice bearing the fusion promoter construct, 24×3-NF-lacZ, containing the 24-bp sequence and the NF-L promoter. Because both cartilage and neural tissues are highly differentiated tissues, it is possible that genes expressed in these tissues may share common regulatory motifs and binding factors, which are responsible for tissue-specific gene expression. Nuclear factors bound to these sites remain to be elucidated. In addition to the 30-bp sequence in the promoter, the first intron sequence of the Col11a2 gene is also important for cartilage-specific expression. The first intron sequence induces cartilage-specific expression when combined with the −453-bp basal promoter of the gene. It also enhances the expression in cartilage when combined with the −742 promoter sequence (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that homologous sequence motifs to the 30-bp sequence are found within the first intron sequence. The regulation through multiple modulators for the α2(XI) collagen gene is clearly different from that for α1(II) collagen gene, which is regulated by a relatively compact enhancer region in the first intron. This diversity of the regulatory mechanisms between the two cartilage genes may have been evolved because different levels of α2(XI) collagen may be necessary for optimal function in different cartilage tissues.

Cyclins are expressed during mitogenesis and control eukaryotic cell proliferation. D-type cyclins are induced by mitogens and are considered to be growth factor sensors (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). They are rate-limiting and essential for G1 progression in normal mammalian cells since inhibition of either cyclin D1 (2Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F.

The addition of mitogen can lead to the expression of one, two, and sometimes all threeD-type cyclins during the G1 phase, depending upon the mitogen and the cell type. For example, CSF-11 induces the expression of cyclin D1 and to a lesser extent D2 (but not D3) in macrophages (8Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar,9Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D-type cyclins are essential cofactors for the kinases cdk4 and cdk6, and a key substrate for the cyclin D/cdk holoenzyme is the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) (see Ref. 1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar for review). Phosphorylation of pRB results in the release of its repression of specific transcription factors such as E2F, thereby allowing the transcription of a variety of genes required for proliferation (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). The data showing similar expression patterns and functions ofD-type cyclins have led to suggestions that they may act redundantly, although there are reports suggesting they may also have distinct roles (10Sweeney K.J. Sarcevic B. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol.

Recently it was shown that cyclin D1 can bind to the estrogen receptor and enhance its transcriptional activity, independent of any cdk4 activation (13Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E.

These data suggest that following mitogenic stimuli cyclin D1 plays additional roles independent of activating cdks. Complementary to their integral role in controlling proliferation, D-type cyclins have also been shown to prevent cell differentiation. For example, enforced expression of cyclins D2 or D3 inhibits granulocyte-CSF-induced differentiation of myeloid cells (12Kato J.Y. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11513-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), whereas enforced expression of cyclin D1 blocks myogenic differentiation (15Rao S.S. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4093-4100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These and other data have led to suggestions that cyclin D·cdk complexes may negatively influence the execution of differentiation programs (17Adachi M. Roussel M.F. Havenith K. Sherr C.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 126-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin) is a potent macrophage-activating agent. The addition of LPS to macrophages results in a number of functional responses including release of nitric oxide and cytokines and priming for respiratory burst activity (see Ref. 18Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholarfor review). Previously we have reported that LPS potently inhibits CSF-1-stimulated macrophage proliferation (19Vairo G. Argyriou S. Knight K.R. Hamilton J.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3469-3477PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this anti-mitogenic action, LPS inhibited CSF-1-induced cyclin D1 and cdk4 expression and pRB phosphorylation (9Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar). Given its inhibitory effect on CSF-1-induced cyclin D1 in macrophages, the present study examined the effect of LPS on expression of the other mitogen-inducedD-type cyclin in macrophages, cyclin D2. We unexpectedly found that despite its anti-mitogenic effects, LPS enhanced CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D2 expression in primary cultures of normal mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). Furthermore, the addition of LPS alone to quiescent BMM raised levels of cyclin D2 but not cyclin D1. By using specific kinase inhibitors we found that LPS induction of cyclin D2 was regulated by MAP kinase pathways. In addition, we found that elevation of intracellular cAMP did not induce cyclin D2 mRNA nor did it alter expression of LPS-induced cyclin D2 protein, showing that unlike cyclin D1, cyclin D2 in BMM does not appear to be regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathways. The data show that LPS can simultaneously elevate CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D2 while repressing CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D1, indicating inverse regulation of D-type cyclins. Importantly, the observation that LPS alone raises cyclin D2 demonstrates elevation of aD-type cyclin in the absence of proliferation. This implies that cyclin D2 has functions other than being a growth factor sensor and mediator of cell division and suggests it plays a role in macrophage activation by LPS. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: RPMI media from ICN-Flow Laboratories, Sydney, Australia; fetal calf serum from CSL Ltd., Parkville., Australia; L-cell conditioned medium was used as a source of CSF-1 and was prepared as described previously (21Vairo G.

Anti-cyclin D2 antibodies were either (a) a rabbit polyclonal antibody that was raised against cyclin D2 and weakly cross-reacts against cyclin D1, but not with cyclin D3, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., catalog number sc-181 (immunizing peptide was purchased from the same source), or (b) rat monoclonal anti-cyclin D2 antibody 34B1–3, purchased from Santa Cruz (catalog number sc-452).

PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolabs and was prepared as a 20 mm stock in Me2SO . Full-length mouse cyclin D2 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Charles Sherr, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN (8Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Primary cultures of normal mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were generated from CBA-C57Bl/6 mice, as described previously (21Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Prior to experiments subconfluent BMM were synchronized in a quiescent state (G0/early G1) by incubation for 18 h in the above media without growth factor (i.e. deficient inL-cell conditioned media and rhCSF-1). Northern blotting was performed essentially as described previously (22Hamilton J.A. Vairo G. Cocks B.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4028-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, quiescent BMM in a 10-cm tissue culture dish (approximately 5 × 106cells) was treated as described in the text, and total RNA was isolated based upon the procedure of Chomczynski and Saachi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. Prior to overnight transfer to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Corp.), gels were incubated in 50 mm NaOH, 10 mm NaCl for 45 min at room temperature, and then neutralized in 0.1m Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, for 45 min at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with 32P-radiolabeled cDNA, washed, and exposed to Kodak XAR autoradiographic film at −70 °C using intensifying screens. Membranes probed for cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 were exposed for 3–5 days and 1–2 weeks, respectively. The amount of RNA loaded in each lane was monitored by visualization of RNA in gels and on membranes by UV exposure following ethidium bromide staining and also by probing membranes for the expression of either of two “control” genes, β2-microglobulin (22Hamilton J.A. Vairo G. Cocks B.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4028-4035PubMed Google Scholar) or 36B4 ribosomal phosphoprotein (24Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Quiescent BMM in 10-cm dishes were stimulated with the agents described for 5 h and then washed gently in warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and metabolically labeled by re-addition of agents in methionine/cysteine-free media (ICN-Flow, New South Wales, Australia) containing 1% fetal calf serum and 150 μCi of Tran35S-label (mix of 35S-labeledl-Met (75%) and l-Cys (15%) purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) for a further 3 h in a final volume of 2.5 ml. Cells were gently washed (3 × 5 ml PBS), and 0.7 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture (100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 70 IU of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Pefablock (Calbiochem)) was added; cells were scraped and further disrupted by 3 passages through a 25-gauge needle, placed on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Peterson (25Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations were performed on 700 μg of protein. Lysates were pre-cleared by addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) slurry and rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and a second pre-clearing step was then performed using protein A-Sepharose beads that had been pretreated by incubation with non-immune rabbit serum. After pre-clearing, the samples were placed in a heat block at 95 °C for 4 min, chilled on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and antibody/antisera added at 1/150 dilution (final concentration of 0.67 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-cyclin D2 antibody). For control incubations containing cyclin D2 immunizing peptide, antibody was preincubated with 10-fold mass of peptide for 1 h at 37 °C before addition to lysate. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C with rotation, after which 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry was added for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Tubes were microcentrifuged, and the protein A-Sepharose pellet was washed (2 × 1 ml RIPA buffer), 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer added, tubes heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and samples loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Following electrophoresis gels were immersed in Amplify (Amersham Corp., UK) (10 min), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR Safety Film for up to 7 days at −80 °C, with intensifying screens. In experiments using anti-mouse cyclin D2 rat monoclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation a modification of this procedure was used. Briefly, the modification was lysis of cells in 1 ml of TNN buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min rotation at 4 °C the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared for 30 min with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and then incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-mouse cyclin D2 rat monoclonal antibody (34B1–3) at 4 °C with rotation for ∼4 h. Secondary antibody (rabbit anti-rat IgG; Dako) was added for 30 min prior to the addition of 30 μl of a 50% (w/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose, and the incubation was continued for 30 min. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with TNN buffer. Samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 4–20% gradient gels (Novex) and visualized as described above. Previously we have shown that LPS, a potent macrophage anti-mitogen (19Vairo G. Argyriou S. Knight K.R. Hamilton J.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3469-3477PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits the CSF-1-stimulated induction of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) (9Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar). Since macrophages also express cyclin D2 in response to CSF-1 (8Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), we were interested in the effects of LPS on expression of this D-type cyclin. The Northern blot data presented in Fig. 1show that addition of 5000 units/ml CSF-1 to quiescent BMM resulted in a relatively weak increase in the level of cyclin D2 mRNA which was maximal between 1 and 2 h and remained elevated for at least 8 h. The co-addition of 100 ng/ml LPS enhanced the CSF-1 induction of cyclin D2 from 2 h, reaching maximal levels around 4–8 h. Levels of cyclin D2 mRNA remained elevated for at least 24 h (data not shown). Fig. 1 also shows that when the same membrane was reprobed for cyclin D1, LPS was found to potently repress CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D1 mRNA levels, as previously reported (9Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel DNA synthesis assays showed that the mitogenic response to CSF-1 was inhibited approximately 90% by LPS in these experiments and that LPS alone had no effect on DNA synthesis when added to quiescent BMM (data not shown), as reported previously (26Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether LPS alone could raise cyclin D2 mRNA levels. Quiescent BMM were incubated with either CSF-1, CSF-1 plus LPS, or LPS alone. The data in Fig. 2 show that addition of LPS alone to quiescent BMM raised cyclin D2 mRNA levels. This increase was greater than that induced by CSF-1 alone but usually slightly less than that induced by the combination of LPS and CSF-1. These data suggest that the increase in cyclin D2 mRNA levels following addition of CSF-1 plus LPS was mostly due to the effect of LPS and that LPS and CSF-1 act additively to induce cyclin D2. By having observed the LPS-induced increases in cyclin D2 mRNA, we next determined whether these were reflected in levels of cyclin D2 protein. Since we were unable to consistently detect cyclin D2 using standard Western blotting procedures, we determined protein levels by immunoprecipitation of metabolically radiolabeled protein. Lysates prepared from radiolabeled cells were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin D2 antibody that weakly cross-reacts with cyclin D1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The data in Fig. 3 show that two major bands were immunoprecipitated in the 32–36-kDa region from lysates prepared from CSF-1-stimulated cells (C). Two bands were anticipated given the antibody reacts with both cyclins D1 and D2 and that D1 migrates slightly slower than D2 (4Lukas J. Bartkova J. Welcker M. Petersen O.W. Peters G. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2125-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The various treatments modulated the lower cyclin D2 band as they did the cyclin D2 mRNA levels, in that CSF-1 slightly increased the levels over those observed in unstimulated cells (U), whereas the levels were greatly increased by either CSF-1 plus LPS (CL) or LPS alone (L). The modulations of the upper cyclin D1 band correlate with our previously published data (9Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar) showing LPS lowers levels of CSF-1-induced cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (see also Fig. 1). Neither band was observed when non-immune rabbit serum was used for immunoprecipitations nor following prior neutralization of the cyclin antibody with the immunizing peptide. These data indicate that the observed changes in cyclin D2 mRNA were reflected in protein levels and were confirmed in experiments using a monoclonal anti-cyclin D2 antibody (34B1–3) which did not appear to cross-react with cyclin D1 (Fig. 5 Band data not shown). Thus, LPS enhanced CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D2 protein expression but inhibited CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D1 protein levels. In addition, LPS alone (L) raised levels of cyclin D2 protein, but not cyclin D1, in quiescent BMM.Figure 5cAMP does not induce cyclin D2 nor does it affect LPS-induced cyclin D2 expression. A, quiescent BMM (O) were treated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP) or 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. Total RNA was prepared for Northern blotting, and the membrane was probed for cyclin D2. The membrane was also probed for 36B4 expression to monitor RNA loading. These data are representative of four experiments.B, quiescent BMM were either untreated (US) or stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS in the presence or absence of 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 6 h, the final 3 h of which they underwent metabolic labeling with [35S]Met/Cys. Cyclin D2 immunoprecipitates (monoclonal antibody 34B1–3) were electrophoresed, and the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. These data are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mitogenic stimulation of D-type cyclin expression is regulated by MAP kinase family members in a number of cell types (28Lavoie J.N.

Given that LPS is known to activate members of the MAP kinase family in macrophages (see Ref. 32Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar for review), and BMM in particular (33Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we investigated whether these kinases regulated LPS-induced cyclin D2 expression. LPS was added to BMM in the presence or absence of either 100 μm PD98059, which specifically blocks activation of MEK (34Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) (which is an activator of ERK), or 2.5 μm SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase activity (32Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 show that PD98059 completely suppressed LPS-induced cyclin D2 mRNA (LP). The effect of PD98059 was concentration-dependent since 25 and 50 μmPD98059 also significantly inhibited LPS-induced cyclin D2 mRNA, but 10 μm usually had no effect (data not shown). By contrast, inhibition of p38 by SB202190 appeared to mildly but significantly and consistently enhance LPS-induced cyclin D2 mRNA levels (LS). The Me2SO vehicle alone had no effect on LPS-induced cyclin D2 (data not shown). Western blotting experiments using antibodies directed against phosphorylated forms of p44/42 ERKs or p38 showed, as expected, that addition of LPS to BMM resulted in phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 and that PD98059 inhibited this phosphorylation of the ERKs but not p38 (data not shown). That PD98059 had no effect on LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation indicated that the inhibition of LPS-induced cyclin D2 by PD98059 was not due to a nonspecific repression of BMM responsiveness to LPS. It was recently reported that activation of protein kinase A induced cyclin D2 mRNA in ovarian granulosa cells (35Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L.

The addition of the membrane-permeable, non-metabolizable analogue of cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm), had no effect on the level of cyclin D2 mRNA following 6 h of exposure (Fig. 5 A), despite having clear effects on cell morphology in these cultures (data not shown). We also examined the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on LPS-induced cyclin D2 since elevation of intracellular cAMP is known to block a number of macrophage LPS responses (Ref. 36Raddassi K. Petit J.F.

Whereas HslU/C261V could hydrolyze ATP and support the ATP-dependent proteolytic activity of HslV as well as the wild-type HslU, HslU/C287V could not hydrolyze ATP. Nevertheless, HslU/C287V could support the HslV-mediated proteolysis by forming the HslVU complex in the presence of ATP but not its absence, indicating that ATP binding but not its hydrolysis is essential for proteolysis. Whereas treatment of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) resulted in dissociation of the oligomeric HslU into monomers, the C261V mutation, but not C287V, prevented the NEM effect. These results suggest that Cys261 is involved in oligomerization and that Cys287 is related to the ATPase function of HslU.

Rapid degradation of many abnormal polypeptides and various regulatory proteins requires protease La (Lon), a heat-shock protein composed of four identical 87-kDa subunits. This homopolymer exhibits both ATP-dependent proteolysis and ATPase activity (16Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we described a new type of ATP-dependent protease in E. coli, the product of the hslVU operon, which encodes two heat-shock proteins: a 19-kDa HslV and a 50-kDa HslU (25Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene. 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HslV harbors the peptidase activity, whereas HslU provides an essential ATPase activity, both of which can function together as a novel two-component protease (26Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.C.

HslU itself has ATPase activity, whereas HslV by itself is a weak protease that slowly degrades certain hydrophobic peptides, such as N-carbobenzoxy (Cbz)1-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), and polypeptides, including insulin B-chain and casein (27Yoo S.J.

In the reconstituted enzyme, HslU markedly stimulates the proteolytic activity of HslV (more than 20-fold), whereas HslV increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HslU severalfold. The primary sequence of HslV is similar to that of certain β-type subunits of the 20S proteasomes from eukaryotes, certain eubacteria, and the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum (30Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In the 20S proteasomes, the N-terminal Thr residues of the mature β-type subunits serve as the catalytic site for proteolysis (30Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 31Fenteany G. Stanaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Like the β-type subunits of the enzyme, HslV has two such conserved N-terminal Thr residues (30Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the N-terminal Thr or its replacement by Val completely abolishes the proteolytic activity of the HslVU protease (32Yoo S.J. Shim Y.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, it is inhibited by lactacystin, aStreptomyces metabolite, which covalently modifies the N-terminal Thr residue on certain β-type subunits of the 20S proteasome (26Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H.

Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HslVU protease appears to function through a similar proteolytic mechanism as the mammalian and archaebacterial proteasomes, even though HslVU does not contain α-type proteasome subunits. All of the ATP-dependent proteases in E. colidescribed above show protein-activated ATPase activity. Moreover, inhibitors of the ATPase activity also prevent the protein degradation by the enzymes. For example, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibits ATP hydrolysis by HslU, and the NEM-treated HslU is unable to support the HslV-mediated degradation of both polypeptide and small peptide substrates (27Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Yoo S.J.

Therefore, it has been suggested that hydrolysis of both ATP and protein substrates occurs in a tightly coupled process. However, it has recently been revealed that β,γ-imido-ATP and ATPγS, both of which are nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, can support the proteolytic activity of the HslVU protease (33Huang H.-C. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21364-21372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that proteolysis by HslVU can be uncoupled from ATP cleavage. Whereas HslV has a single Cys residue in its C-terminal region, HslU contains two Cys residues in the second half of the ATP binding domain (25Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunket III, G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene. 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In order to define the role of the Cys residues of HslU in ATP hydrolysis and to clarify further the inhibitory effect of NEM, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to replace either the 261st or the 287th residue (Cys) in HslU with Val. We also replaced the 159th residue (Cys) in HslV with Ser or Ala to examine the effects of the mutations on the proteolytic function of the HslVU protease. In addition, we determined the cleavage specificity of the enzyme using insulin B-chain as a model substrate. All reagents for the site-directed mutagenesis and restriction endonucleases were purchased from Promega. Peptide substrates were obtained from Bachem Feinchemikalien AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. HslV, HslU, and their mutant forms were purified as described previously (27Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The pGEM-T vector carrying the hslVUoperon (named pGEM-T/HslVU) and the pBluescript KS+ vector containing the coding region for HslV only (named pBS/HslV) were constructed as described previously (27Yoo S.J.

Site-directed mutations were created by the PCR method, which consists of two sequential PCRs, using pGEM-T/HslVU for HslU and pBS/HslV for HslV as the templates. The primary PCRs were carried out using mutagenic primers, which were designed to replace Cys159 of HslV with Ala or Ser and Cys261 or Cys287 of HslU with Val (Fig. 1). Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of the template plasmids, 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase, 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mm each of dNTPs, and 20 pmol of the primers. The reactions were performed for 30 cycles using a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer). Prior to the secondary PCRs, the same amounts (0.1 μg each) of primary PCR fragments were mixed and subjected to annealing between the fragments by denaturation-renaturation reactions. The DNAs with recessed 3′-OH ends were extended using a Klenow fragment and used as the templates for the secondary PCRs. After the secondary PCR, the mutated fragments were ligated into pGEM-T vector. For HslU mutants, the resulting plasmids were digested with NruI and BglII, followed by ligation of the restriction fragments into the pGEM-T/HslVU plasmids that had also been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain XL2 Blue. Substitutions of the nucleotides by mutagenesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein breakdown was assayed using125I-labeled insulin B-chain as the substrate as described previously (35Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Hong Y.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29799-29805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Radioiodination of insulin B-chain was performed as described previously (35Kim K.I. Baek S.H.

Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained 10 μg of insulin B-chain and appropriate amounts of the purified HslV and HslU proteins in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25–2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Incubations were performed for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, radioactivity released into trichloroacetic acid-soluble form (final concentration, 10% (w/v)) was determined using a gamma counter. Peptide hydrolysis was assayed using Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC (0.1 mm) as the substrate by incubating the similar reaction mixtures for 10 min at 37 °C but containing only 110 the amount of the HslV and HslU proteins (27Yoo S.J.

ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating the similar reaction mixtures at 37 °C but in the absence of the peptide or protein substrate. After incubation, 0.2 ml of 1% SDS (w/v) was added to the samples, and the phosphate released was determined as described (37Ames B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified by their absorbance at 280 nm or by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211682) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots (4 μg each) of the HslU or HslV proteins or their mixture were incubated in 0.1 mHEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in the presence and absence of ATP in a total volume of 0.1 ml (34Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After incubations for 20 min at 37 °C, the samples were mixed with 30 μl of 0.75m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 7.5% SDS and 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. They were then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–8% (w/v) gradient slab gels containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205438) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gels were then visualized by silver staining. Oxidized insulin B-chain (10 μg) was digested with the purified HslV (2 μg) and HslU (8 μg) proteins for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm ATP. The cleavage products (0.2 ml each) were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (LC10AS, Shimadzu) using a Bondsphere column (2.1 × 150 mm, Waters). The peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient using solution A, containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and solution B, containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile. With solution B, elution was carried out for 0–60 min at 2–37.5%, 60–90 min at 37.5–75%, and 90–105 min at 75–98% acetonitrile. Elution of the peptides was monitored by their absorbance at 214 nm. Amino acid sequences were then determined by Edman degradation using a peptide sequencer (model 491, Perkin-Elmer) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager RP, PerSeptive Biosystems). In order to determine the effects of Cys mutations on the ATPase activity of HslU, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace either Cys261 or Cys287 in HslU with Val (Fig. 1). The resulting proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity and are referred to as HslU/C261V and HslU/C287V, respectively (Fig. 2). We then examined the effects of Cys mutations on the ATPase activity of HslU. Fig. 3 A shows that the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HslU/C261V is nearly identical to that of the wild-type HslU. In contrast, HslU/C287V was not capable of hydrolyzing ATP at all. Prolonged incubation with excess of the mutant protein (e.g., incubation for 4 h with 20 μg of HslU/C287V) did not show any ATP-cleaving activity either (data not shown). HslV has been shown to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by the wild-type HslU 2–4-fold (27Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine whether HslV can also activate the ATPase activity of the mutant forms, ATP hydrolysis was assayed in the presence of increasing amounts of HslV. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the HslV-mediated increase in the ATPase activity of HslU/C261V occurred in parallel with that of the wild-type HslU. However, ATP hydrolysis by HslU/C287V was not evident even in the presence of HslV. Thus, Cys287 but not Cys261 appears to be involved in the ATPase function of HslU.Figure 3Hydrolysis of ATP by HslU and its mutant forms. A, ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating 4 μg of HslU (•), HslU/C261V (○), or HslU/C287V (▴) and 1 mm ATP for various periods at 37 °C. B, assays were performed as above, except that 1 μg of the HslU proteins was incubated for 1 h in the presence of increasing amounts of HslV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine the ability of HslU and its mutant forms in supporting the HslV-mediated proteolysis, HslV was incubated with increasing amounts of the HslU proteins. Fig. 4 A shows that HslU/C261V supports the hydrolysis of 125I-labeled insulin B-chain by HslV as well as the wild-type HslU. Surprisingly, HslU/C287V, which is unable to hydrolyze ATP, could also support the HslV-mediated proteolysis in the presence of ATP, although to extents much less than those seen with HslU or HslU/C261V at low protein concentrations. Without ATP, however, only the basal activity of HslV could be seen whether or not HslU and its mutant forms were present (data not shown). Similar data were obtained for the hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC (data not shown). These results indicate that ATP binding but not its hydrolysis is essential for the proteolytic function of the HslVU protease and further support the previous suggestion that ATP hydrolysis can be uncoupled from cleavage of peptide bonds by HslVU (33Huang H.-C. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21364-21372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The HslVU protease shows a maximal proteolytic activity against insulin B-chain or casein when HslV and HslU are incubated at a mass ratio of 1:4, which is approximately equivalent to a molar ratio of 1:2 (29Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Shin D.H. Shim Y.K. Kang M.S. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Müller S.A. Huang H.-C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To achieve the maximal activity with HslU/C287V, however, an at least 2-fold higher amount of the protein was required as compared with HslU or HslU/C261V (i.e., at a mass ratio of 1:8; see Fig. 4 A). This finding raised a possibility that the C287V mutation results in reduction of the affinity of the HslU protein for ATP and hence in the decrease in the affinity between the HslU subunits and/or between the HslU and HslV oligomers. To test this possibility, HslV was incubated with HslU/C287V at a fixed mass ratio of 1:4 and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the ATP concentration required for the half-maximal activity in the presence of HslU/C287V was at least 5-fold higher than that with the wild-type HslU or HslU/C261V. Thus, it appears that the requirement of high amounts of HslU/C287V in supporting the HslV-mediated proteolysis is due to its decreased affinity for ATP. In order to determine whether the reduced affinity of HslU/C287V for ATP indeed influences the interaction between the HslU subunits and/or between the HslU and HslV oligomers, a cross-linking analysis was performed by incubation of HslU/C287V with glutaraldehyde in the presence of 0.5 or 2 mm ATP. As a control, HslU and HslU/C261V were also subjected to the same cross-linking analysis. In the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, both HslU and HslU/C261V formed an oligomeric complex of 300–350 kDa, which is likely to represent a hexameric or heptameric form of HslU, whereas more than 60% of HslU/C287V remained as a monomer of about 50 kDa (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, all of the HslU proteins were cross-linked to the high molecular mass, oligomeric form in the presence of 2 mm ATP. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of HslV, the amounts of the HslVU complex formed by incubation of HslU/C287V and HslV in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP was much less than that seen with 2 mm ATP (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, the amounts of the HslVU complex formed by incubation of HslU/C287V and HslV in the presence of two different ATP concentrations were approximately proportional to the amounts of the mutant HslU oligomers formed in the absence of HslV. On the other hand, HslU/C261V formed the complex with HslV nearly as well as the wild-type HslU at both ATP concentrations. Thus, it appears that the reduced ability of HslU/C287V in supporting the HslV-mediated proteolysis is due to its reduced ability in oligomerization at low ATP concentrations but not to any defect in the interaction between the ATP-bound HslU/C287V and HslV oligomers. We have previously shown that pretreatment of NEM blocks not only the ATPase activity of HslU but also its ability to support the HslV-mediated proteolysis, and we therefore suggested that hydrolysis of both ATP and peptide bonds occur in a tightly linked process (27Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This result is contradictory to the present findings that the HslV-HslU/C287V complex can hydrolyze protein and peptide substrates without ATP hydrolysis and to the previous findings that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs can support the proteolysis by HslVU (33Huang H.-C. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21364-21372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,34Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to clarify the discrepancy, we first compared the effect of NEM on the ATPase activity of HslU/C261V with that of the wild-type HslU. The HslU proteins were treated with 1 mm NEM for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting samples were incubated with 3 mm dithiothreitol to inactivate unreacted NEM and then assayed for ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of HslV. Table I (Experiment I) shows that both the basal and HslV-stimulated ATPase activities of the wild-type HslU were strongly inhibited by NEM to a similar extent (i.e., by about 80%) in accord with our previous report (29Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Shin D.H. Shim Y.K. Kang M.S. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the same NEM treatment resulted in less than 15% reduction of the ATPase activities of HslU/C261V. Similar data were obtained when assayed for the hydrolysis of insulin B-chain with and without the treatment of NEM (Table I, Experiment II). Furthermore, upon the NEM treatment, the ability of HslU/C287V to support the insulin B-chain degradation by HslV was inhibited to an extent similar to that seen with the wild-type HslU. Thus, it appears that, of the two Cys residues, Cys261 is the major site that is responsible for the NEM-mediated inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by HslU and for the HslU-activated proteolytic activity of HslV. On the other hand, Cys287 may be buried inside the HslU protein and therefore not be easily accessible to the sulfhydryl blocking reagent. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Cys287 may also be covalently modified by NEM and that the modified HslU protein is still capable of hydrolyzing ATP, although this possibility is much less likely because HslU/C287V lacks the ATPase activity.Table IEffect of NEM on the ATPase activities of HsIU and HsIU/C261V and on their ability to support the proteolysis by HsIVProteinsRelative ActivityWithout NEMWith NEM%Experiment I: for ATP hydrolysis HsIU10020 HsIU/C261V9482 HsIU plus HsIV28655 HsIU/C261V plus HsIV275239Experiment II: for Hydrolysis of insulin B-chain HsIU plus HsIV10017 HsIU/C261V plus HsIV10491 HsIU/C287V plus HsIV8915Aliquots (4 μg each) of HsIU, HsIU/C261V, and HsIU/C287V were incubated with 1 mm NEM for 1 h at 4 °C.
