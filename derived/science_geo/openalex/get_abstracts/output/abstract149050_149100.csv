https://openalex.org/W2039928024,"The hinge region on the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G interacts with at least four different natural protein scaffolds that bind at a common site between the C(H2) and C(H3) domains. This ""consensus"" site was also dominant for binding of random peptides selected in vitro for high affinity (dissociation constant, about 25 nanomolar) by bacteriophage display. Thus, this site appears to be preferred owing to its intrinsic physiochemical properties, and not for biological function alone. A 2.7 angstrom crystal structure of a selected 13-amino acid peptide in complex with Fc demonstrated that the peptide adopts a compact structure radically different from that of the other Fc binding proteins. Nevertheless, the specific Fc binding interactions of the peptide strongly mimic those of the other proteins. Juxtaposition of the available Fc-complex crystal structures showed that the convergent binding surface is highly accessible, adaptive, and hydrophobic and contains relatively few sites for polar interactions. These are all properties that may promote cross-reactive binding, which is common to protein-protein interactions and especially hormone-receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2105768236,"A checkpoint operating in the G2 phase of the cell cycle prevents entry into mitosis in the presence of DNA damage. UCN-01, a protein kinase inhibitor currently undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, abrogates G2 checkpoint function and sensitizes p53-defective cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents. In most species, the G2 checkpoint prevents the Cdc25 phosphatase from removing inhibitory phosphate groups from the mitosis-promoting kinase Cdc2. This is accomplished by maintaining Cdc25 in a phosphorylated form that binds 14-3-3 proteins. The checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Cds1, are proposed to regulate the interactions between human Cdc25C and 14-3-3 proteins by phosphorylating Cdc25C on serine 216. 14-3-3 proteins, in turn, function to keep Cdc25C out of the nucleus. Here we report that UCN-01 caused loss of both serine 216 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to Cdc25C in DNA-damaged cells. In addition, UCN-01 potently inhibited the ability of Chk1 to phosphorylate Cdc25C in vitro. In contrast, Cds1 was refractory to inhibition by UCN-01in vitro, and Cds1 was still phosphorylated in irradiated cells treated with UCN-01. Thus, neither Cds1 nor kinases upstream of Cds1, such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, are targets of UCN-01 action in vivo. Taken together our results identify the Chk1 kinase and the Cdc25C pathway as potential targets of G2 checkpoint abrogation by UCN-01.

UCN-01 potentiates the cytotoxicity of a variety of anticancer agents including cisplatin, camptothecin, and ionizing radiation (1.Wang O. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M.

These latter findings have encouraged the investigation of UCN-01 in combination stratagems for cancer treatment. A potential mechanism underlying the sensitization of cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents is the abrogation of cell cycle checkpoint function in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (1.Wang O. Fan S.

Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 791-797PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, abrogation of the G2 checkpoint appears to occur preferentially in cancer cells with defective p53 tumor suppressor function (1.Wang O. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). UCN-01-induced G2 checkpoint abrogation has previously been shown to occur through a Cdc2-dependent pathway resulting in premature activation of this mitosis-promoting kinase in DNA-damaged cells (1.Wang O.

The molecular mechanism(s) underlying Cdc2 activation and G2 checkpoint abrogation by UCN-01 are not known. Cdc2 is subject to multiple levels of regulation including periodic association with the B-type cyclins, reversible phosphorylation, and intracellular compartmentalization (for reviews see Refs. 5.Atherton-Fessler S.

Phosphorylation of human Cdc2 occurs on three regulatory sites as follows: threonine 14, tyrosine 15, and threonine 161 (8.Draetta G. Beach D.

In late G2, the Cdc25C phosphatase dephosphorylates Cdc2 on both Thr-14 and Tyr-15, leading to the activation of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes (27.Lee M.S. Ogg S. Xu M. Parker L.L. Donoghue D.J.

A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition to cyclin binding and reversible phosphorylation, Cdc2 is also regulated at the level of intracellular compartmentalization. Throughout interphase, Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (32.Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33.Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4127-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The apparent cytoplasmic localization of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes (35.Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) is due to a nuclear export signal (NES)1 in cyclin B1 which facilitates rapid export of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes from the nucleus. Phosphorylation of the NES in late prophase is proposed to block the nuclear export of cyclin B1 by interfering with the binding of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 leading to the nuclear accumulation of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes (33.Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 36.Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, entry into mitosis requires not only the activation of Cdc2 by Cdc25C but also the accumulation of active Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in the nucleus. Because UCN-01 disrupts G2 checkpoint function by prematurely activating Cdc2, UCN-01 could theoretically interfere with one or more of the Cdc2 regulatory pathways described above. We undertook a comprehensive study to examine the effects of UCN-01 on proteins that directly regulate Cdc2, including Wee1, Myt1, and Cdc25C. Previously we reported that UCN-01 abrogated G2 arrest following DNA damage through a Cdc2-dependent pathway but did not involve direct inhibition of the Wee1 kinase (4.Yu L. Orlandi L. Wang P. Orr M.S. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Silvestrini R. Watanabe N. Piwnica-Worms H. O'Connor P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33455-33464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, concentrations of UCN-01 as high as 1 μm did not affect the ability of Wee1 to phosphorylate Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in vitro. In the present study, we investigated effects of UCN-01 on a second Cdc2-inhibitory kinase, Myt1, and on the Cdc25C regulatory pathway. UCN-01 (NSC 638850) was provided by Jill Johnson (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Nocodazole (Aldrich) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. HeLa cells were harvested by trypsinization and then collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). Following washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in 75 mm KCl for 10 min. Cells were pelleted and then fixed in acetic acid/methanol (1:3 v/v). Fixed cells were stained with 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min, allowed to air-dry, and observed by light microscopy. A minimum of 500 cells were counted for each sample. HeLa total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by treatment with RNase-free DNase. First strand cDNA was prepared using 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit fromCLONTECH. A mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamers was used to prime the reverse transcriptase reaction. Degenerate primers were designed to conserved motifs in the forkhead-associated and kinase domains of Cds1Sp, Rad53Sc, Dun1Sc, an ovarian-specific Ser/Thr kinase from Drosophila present in GenBankTM (accession number 1848279), and a mouse EST clone (accession number AA762997). Primers 5′-AGTAGTAATGGTAC(C/T) TTTATAAAT) and 5′-TTC(A/T)GG(C/T)TTNA(A/T/G)(A/G)TCNC(T/G)(A/G)TG) were used in a PCR reaction with template prepared from HeLa cell total RNA. PCR products were cloned into the TA vector (InVitrogen) and sequenced. Full-length huCds1 cDNA was generated by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using Human HeLa Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH). Briefly, 2 sets each of forward and reverse primers were designed by selecting-GC rich regions within the 570-base pair PCR product of huCds1 (forward primers, 5′-GAAGTGGTGCCTGTGGAGAGGTAA and 5′-CAGCAAGAGAGGCAGACCCAGCTCTCAA, and reverse primers, 5′-GAGAGCTGGGTCTGCCTCTCTTGCTGAA and 5′-GCTTGCAGGTAGCTTCTT TCAGGCGTTT). These gene-specific primers were used in combination with the linker primer AP-1 to amplify 5′ and 3′ sequences of huCds1using a step-down PCR technique. Both 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions of huCds1 yielded single fragments (∼1.0 kilobase pair 5′ and ∼1.2 kilobase pairs 3′). These PCR fragments were cloned into the TA vector and sequenced. Sequence data were used to design new primers to amplify the full-length huCds1 cDNA. Full-length huCds1 cDNA was re-amplified from the HeLa library using the Advantage High Fidelity Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH) and cloned into the TA vector. All PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The coding sequence of full-length huCds1 was amplified by PCR using the following two primers: 5′-CCCGAATTCCATATGTCTCGGGAGTCGGATGTTG (NdeI primer) and 5′-ATAGAATTCCTCGAGTCACAACACAGCAGCACACAC (EcoRI/XhoI primer). The PCR product was ligated to the TA cloning vector, and the resulting plasmid pTA-huCds1 was digested with NdeI and EcoRI. The fragment encoding huCds1 was inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEX2TN to create pGEX2TN-huCds1. pTA-huCds1 was digested with NdeI andXhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET15b to generate pET15b-huCds1. pGEX2TN-huCds1 was digested with XbaI and EcoRI, and the fragment encoding huCds1 was cloned into the StuI site of pFASTBAC to create pFASTBAC-huCds1. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and protocols suggested by the manufacturer. Wild-type human Cdc25C andCdc25C(S216A) were isolated from pGEX-2T and pGEX-2TB, respectively, by digestion with BamHI and cloned into theBamHI site of pEGFPC-1 to create pEGFP-Cdc25C and pEGFP-Cdc25C(S216A). GST-Chk1, GST-Cds1, His-Myt1, GST-Cdc25C-motif, and GST-cyclin B1/Cdc2(K/R) were isolated from insect cells or bacteria as described previously (4.Yu L. Orlandi L. Wang P. Orr M.S. Senderowicz A.M.

Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). His-Myt1 kinase reactions were carried out with GST-cyclin B1/Cdc2(K/R) in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1; NEN Life Science Products) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample loading buffer and boiling for 5 min before being loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following autoradiography kinase reactions were quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). GST-Chk1 and GST-Cds1 kinase reactions were performed in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1; NEN Life Science Products), and 5 μg GST-Cdc25C-motif for 10 min at 30 °C. Radiolabeled GST-Cdc25C-motif was excised and radioactivity quantitated in a scintillation counter. We used either normal HeLa cells or HeLa cells expressing an inducible human Cdc25C transgene (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) to assess the action of UCN-01 on Cdc25C-serine 216 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 interaction. To monitor 14-3-3 association, we inducedCdc25C transgene expression by removal of tetracycline (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Cdc25C-expressing cells were then treated with 6 Gy of gamma rays and allowed to arrest in G2 for 12 h in the presence of nocodazole (0.15 μg/ml). Cells were then treated with or without UCN-01 (300 nm) and, at different times thereafter, were harvested and lysed in mammalian cell lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 μmmicrocystin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 mm leupeptin, and 20 mm pepstatin). For normal HeLa cells, total cell lysates were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with the Cdc25C monoclonal antibody (174-E10-3) (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Cdc25C immunoprecipitations were performed from Cdc25C-overexpressing cells with the same antibody, and the Cdc25C-immune complexes were split and samples resolved on either 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting with Cdc25C (174-E10-3) or 14-3-3 (K-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, respectively. Cdc2 and cyclin B1 immunoblotting of total cell lysates was performed using the Cdc2 antibody (SC-54) and cyclin B1 antibody (SC-245) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound primary antibodies were detected using the ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection system. HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of UCN-01 for 1 h before subjecting them to 0, 5, 10, or 20 Gy of gamma rays. At 2 h post-irradiation, cells were harvested and lysed in mammalian cell lysis buffer, and Cds1 was immunoprecipitated with an affinity purified huCds1 antibody. Cds1 immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with the Cds1 affinity purified antibody. BL21 cells were transformed with pET15b-huCds1. Cultures (1 liter) were grown at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.5, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After growing for an additional 4 h at 30 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in 40 ml of His lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin). After rocking at 4 °C for 15 min, cells were lysed by sonication (50% duty for 15 bursts). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and mixed with 2 ml of packed Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with 10 ml of His wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and transferred to a Bio-Rad disposable column. Protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 100 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and purified His-huCds1 protein was injected into New Zealand White rabbits. To purify antibodies specific for huCds1, GST-huCds1 was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After flowing huCds1 antiserum over the column and washing, antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. HeLa cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips and transfected with the plasmids pEGFP-Cdc25C or pEGFP-Cdc25C(S216A) using 20 μg/100-mm dish and the calcium phosphate transfection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing 3 times in PBS, cells were mounted on slides using the Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). Cells were viewed using a confocal laser microscope (MRC 1024, Bio-Rad). In some cases, 300 nm UCN-01 was added during the last 2 h of the transfection. Because UCN-01 is a protein kinase inhibitor, we first investigated whether UCN-01 was promoting mitotic entry in DNA-damaged cells through direct inhibition of the Cdc2-inhibitory kinase, Myt1 (25.Mueller P.R.

Furthermore, the concentration of UCN-01 required to inhibit Myt1 activity by 50% (IC50∼250 nm) was significantly higher than that required to abrogate G2 arrest following gamma irradiation of HeLa cells (IC50 ∼15–20 nm) (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these and previously published (4.Yu L. Orlandi L. Wang P. Orr M.S. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Silvestrini R. Watanabe N. Piwnica-Worms H. O'Connor P.M. J. Biol.

We next examined whether UCN-01 targeted the Cdc25C regulatory pathway. Cdc25C is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of serine 216 throughout interphase and upon G2 checkpoint activation (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). During interphase, Cdc25C migrates in SDS gels as two distinct electrophoretic forms, a slower migrating serine 216-phosphorylated form (species b, see Fig.2 A) that binds 14-3-3 proteins (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) and a faster migrating hypophosphorylated form (species a). In mitosis, Cdc25C becomes hyperphosphorylated which reduces its electrophoretic mobility further (species c) (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 40.O'Connor P.M. Ferris D.K. Hoffmann I. Jackman J. Draetta G. Kohn K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Throughout interphase and in the presence of unreplicated or damaged DNA, Cdc25C is phosphorylated on serine 216 and bound to 14-3-3 proteins (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). To determine whether UCN-01 treatment disrupted the Cdc25C regulatory pathway, HeLa cells induced to express Cdc25C (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) were subjected to gamma irradiation and then incubated with or without UCN-01 in the presence of nocodazole to trap any cells entering into mitosis (Fig. 2 A). In the absence of UCN-01, Cdc25C was found to be predominantly in the serine 216-phosphorylated form (species b) and bound to 14-3-3 proteins. Mitotic index measurements demonstrated that cells maintained their G2cell arrest under these conditions indicative of an intact checkpoint response. In contrast, UCN-01 addition caused the loss of Cdc25C-serine 216 phosphorylation (within 1 h) and the Cdc25C-14-3-3 complex disassembled. These events preceded Cdc2 dephosphorylation and entry of cells into mitosis at which time Cdc25C became hyperphosphorylated (species c). We next examined the effect of UCN-01 treatment on the intracellular localization of Cdc25C because 14-3-3 binding has been shown to contribute to the nuclear exclusion of Cdc25 (42.Lopez-Girona A.

Cdc25C and a mutant of Cdc25C that cannot bind to 14-3-3 proteins (Cdc25C(S216A)) (37.Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) were tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transiently expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of UCN-01, GFP-tagged wild-type Cdc25C localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (top left panel), whereas both nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence was detected in cells expressing GFP-tagged Cdc25C(S216A) (top right panel). These findings are consistent with those reported by Dalal et al. (46.Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. Decaprio J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A large fraction of Cdc25C(S216A), the 14-3-3 binding mutant of Cdc25C, was detected in the cytoplasm indicating that 14-3-3 binding is not the sole determinant regulating Cdc25C intracellular compartmentalization. A nuclear export sequence in Cdc25C likely contributes to the prominent cytoplasmic staining of both Cdc25C and of the Cdc25C(S216A) mutant protein. 2P. R. Graves and H. Piwnica-Worms, unpublished observations. Because UCN-01 treatment causes loss of 14-3-3 binding to Cdc25C, the fluorescence pattern of wild-type Cdc25C in the presence of UCN-01 was predicted to be similar to that of Cdc25C(S216A). This was indeed the case as GFP-Cdc25C was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells treated with UCN-01 (bottom left panel). The prominent cytoplasmic staining of Cdc25C in the presence of UCN-01 indicates that UCN-01 does not perturb Cdc25C NES function. In addition, UCN-01 treatment did not detectably alter the localization of Cdc25C(S216A) (bottom right panel). Although UCN-01-treated cells showed only modest nuclear accumulation of Cdc25C, this may be sufficient to initiate the autocatalytic loop that has been described for Cdc2 activation and mitotic entry (41.Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 47.Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). To determine the concentration of UCN-01 where loss of Cdc25C-serine 216 phosphorylation could first be observed, HeLa cells were incubated with varying concentrations of UCN-01, and the electrophoretic mobility of Cdc25C was monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 C). Serine 216 dephosphorylation was monitored by observing the accumulation of species a after 2 h of incubation with UCN-01. We found that Cdc25C was dephosphorylated on serine 216, as indicated by an increase of band a, with as little as 10 nm UCN-01. Although the majority of Cdc25C was not dephosphorylated until UCN-01 reached 300 nm, it is conceivable that a small amount of dephosphorylated Cdc25C may be able to initiate the autocatalytic loop and contribute to bypass of the arrest.

However, their tissue distribution is distinct, with the AC133 antigen being found on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and prominin on various epithelial cells. To determine whether the human AC133 antigen and mouse prominin are orthologues or distinct members of a protein family, we examined the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 for the possible expression of the AC133 antigen. By both immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, the AC133 antigen was found to be expressed on the surface of Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, immunoreactivity for the AC133 antigen, but not its mRNA level, was down-regulated upon differentiation of Caco-2 cells. The AC133 antigen was specifically located at the apical rather than basolateral plasma membrane. An apical localization of the AC133 antigen was also observed in various human embryonic epithelia including the neural tube, gut, and kidney. Electron microscopy revealed that, within the apical plasma membrane of Caco-2 cells, the AC133 antigen was confined to microvilli and absent from the planar, intermicrovillar regions. This specific subcellular localization did not depend on an epithelial phenotype, because the AC133 antigen on hematopoietic stem cells, as well as that ectopically expressed in fibroblasts, was selectively found in plasma membrane protrusions. Hence, the human AC133 antigen shows the features characteristic of mouse prominin in epithelial and transfected non-epithelial cells, i.e. a selective association with apical microvilli and plasma membrane protrusions, respectively. Conversely, flow cytometry of murine CD34+ bone marrow progenitors revealed the cell surface expression of prominin.

Chinese hamster ovary bone marrow mononuclear cells Hanks' balanced salt solution phycoerythrin sulfosuccinimidyl-6(biotinamido)-hexanoate biotinylating agent phosphate-buffered saline monoclonal antibody A characteristic feature of epithelial cells, which is a prerequisite for their function, is the selective association of certain proteins with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane (1.Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 2.Nelson W.J. Science. 1992; 258: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3.Simons K. Dupree P.

An example is the recently identified protein prominin, a 115-kDa five transmembrane domain protein found to be expressed on the apical surface of neuroepithelial cells and several other embryonic epithelia and on brush border membranes of adult kidney proximal tubules (4.Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Within the apical plasma membrane domain, prominin is selectively associated with microvilli and other related plasma membrane protrusions rather than the planar subdomain of the membrane. Studies with prominin-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells have shown that this selective association is due to a combination of apical sorting and retention in microvilli (5.Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, a plasma membrane protrusion-specific localization of prominin was also observed in prominin-transfected non-epithelial cells (i.e. CHO cells),1 showing that the mechanism underlying the selective association of membrane proteins with plasmalemmal protrusions is conserved between epithelial and non-epithelial cells (4.Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These studies were conducted with prominin derived from one species, the mouse. In independent studies, a novel marker of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was identified, characterized, and referred to as AC133 antigen (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human AC133 antigen appears to be related to mouse prominin in size (120 kDa), membrane topology (five transmembrane domains, two large extracellular loops), and sequence (8.Corbeil D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2625-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Buck D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4390-4391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tissue distribution reported for the human AC133 antigen (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is remarkably distinct from that reported for mouse prominin (4.Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In contrast to the epithelial expression of prominin (4.Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), the AC133 antigen was found to be selectively expressed on human CD34bright progenitors derived from bone marrow, fetal liver, and peripheral blood (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and on subsets of CD34+leukemia cells, i.e. non-epithelial cells, but not in epithelial tissues such as colon and kidney (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the sequence identity between mouse prominin and the human AC133 antigen is relatively low (average 60%), in particular in the three extracellular domains (54%), which comprise more than 70% of the polypeptide. This raises a major question. Is the AC133 antigen the human orthologue of prominin? If so, an explanation would be required as to why the AC133 antigen is apparently not expressed in epithelial tissues such as adult kidney (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in the case of mouse does express prominin (4.Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), although mRNA for the AC133 antigen is well detectable (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, one would then expect the AC133 antigen to be selectively associated with plasma membrane protrusion upon expression in fibroblasts, as previously observed in the case of prominin (4.Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Conversely, prominin should then be expressed also in murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. Or, alternatively, are prominin and the AC133 antigen distinct members of a protein family? In the support of this possibility is the occurrence of at least three open reading frames in theCaenorhabditis elegans genome related to mouse prominin and the human AC133 antigen (8.Corbeil D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2625-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that case, one would not necessarily expect the AC133 antigen to be selectively associated with plasma membrane protrusions. Answering this question is particularly important in light of a set of recent findings (10.Maw M.A. Corbeil D. Koch J. Hellwig A. Wilson-Wheeler J.C. Bridges R.J. Kumaramanickavel G. John S. Nancarrow D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Denton M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) that are as follows. First, a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding the AC133 antigen, which results in a truncated protein, causes retinal degeneration in humans. Second, a similar truncated version of mouse prominin does not reach the cell surface. Third, consistent with the detection of AC133 immunoreactivity in human retinoblastoma cells (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in mouse, prominin is found in photoreceptor cells where it is selectively associated with the plasma membrane evaginations at the base of the rod outer segment that are intermediates in disc formation. If the AC133 antigen was the human orthologue of prominin rather than a distinct member of the prominin family, this would suggest that the lack of appearance of this protein in the plasma membrane evaginations of the rod outer segment may lead to impaired disc formation and, eventually, to retinal degeneration. Here we report several lines of evidence strongly suggesting that the AC133 antigen is the human orthologue of prominin. The evidence includes the expression of the AC133 antigen in certain human epithelial cells. This apparent contradiction of previous observations (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is very likely explained by our finding that the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody AC133, which is thought to be a glycosylated structure (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is down-regulated upon differentiation of epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells (kindly donated by Drs. S. Robine and D. Louvard, CNRS-Institut Curie, Paris, France) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 10% CO2atmosphere. Cultures were used between passages 8 and 18. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For experiments studying polarized cell surface delivery, Caco-2 cells were plated at a density of 4.5 × 105cells/cm2 on permeable membranes (24-mm TranswellTM-COL chambers, 0.4-μm pore size). Media were changed every day, and the experiments were performed 11 days after seeding to allow the development of a tight monolayer. CHO cells were transfected with the pCR3.1-Uni plasmid containing the AC133 antigen-coding cDNA sequence under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. Cells expressing the neomycin resistance gene were then selected by introducing 600 μg/ml of G418 into the incubation medium. Two weeks later, G418-resistant colonies were pooled and expanded. To enhance the expression of the transgene, cells were incubated for 17 h with 10 mm sodium butyrate (11.Gorman C. Howard B. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7631-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were performed in medium lacking butyrate. Under these conditions 10–30% of neomycin-resistant cells expressed the recombinant AC133 antigen. Human bone marrow was aspirated into preservative-free heparin from the posterior iliac crest of normal adult volunteers according to procedures approved by the ethics committee of the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) were obtained following separation over Ficoll (Lymphoprep, Nygaard) and washed twice at 4 °C in HHF buffer (comprising calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 5% human AB serum and 5% fetal calf serum). CD34+ cells were isolated from BMNC suspensions by means of immunomagnetic beads (Dynal Pty. Ltd). Briefly, BMNC were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellet was suspended in 100 μl of CD34 Dynabeads to give a final cell:bead ratio of 4:1. After gentle vortexing for 2 min, the cells were resuspended in 4 ml of HHF and placed on a rotator for a further 30 min at 4 °C to ensure complete capture of CD34+ cells. Bead-rosetted CD34+ cells were isolated and purified by five sequential rounds of washing with HHF followed by capture on a magnet. The CD34 antibody-coated beads were released from the CD34+ cells by the addition of 200 μl of the CD34 Detachabead reagent (supplied with the kit) followed by incubation in a shaking waterbath for 45 min at 37 °C. After removal of the detached beads using the magnet, the cells were washed three times in HHF, and the aliquots were analyzed for purity using HPCA-2-PE (Becton Dickinson) and for expression of AC133 antigen using AC133-PE conjugates (Amcell). In all experiments, the purity of the CD34+ cell preparations obtained in this manner was >98%. Mouse bone marrow cells were obtained from 8–10-week-old BALB/c mice by flushing dissected femurs, using a syringe with 27G needle, with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Red blood cells were lysed by a 5-min incubation with red cell lysing buffer (Sigma), and BMNC were isolated on a Histopaque 1077 gradient (Sigma). Interface cells were harvested and washed twice with HBSS/bovine serum albumin at 4 °C and adjusted to a concentration of 2 × 107/ml prior to staining for flow cytometric analysis. Antibodies were purified from murine ascites or hollow fiber culture harvests (Cellmax QUAD artificial capillary system, Cellco Inc. Germantown, MD) by protein A affinity chromatography and phycoerythrin (PE) conjugates prepared as described previously (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 106 murine BMNC were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with biotinylated anti-mouse CD34 (RAM 34) and, after washing with HBSS/bovine serum albumin, stained with streptavidin-Cy-Chrome (Pharmingen). Cells were washed twice with HBSS/bovine serum albumin before incubation with 150 ng/test of PE-conjugated 13A4 antibody (anti-mouse prominin). Stained cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BDIS, San Jose, CA) with the scatter gates set on the lymphoid population. 50,000 events were acquired and analyzed using Cell Quest software (BDIS). Total RNA from Caco-2 cells was prepared using the acidic phenol/chloroform phase separation method (12.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses were performed usingCLONTECH multiple tissue Northern blot membrane and by resolving 20 μg of total RNA from Caco-2 cells on formaldehyde-agarose gels followed by RNA transfer to nylon membranes and hybridization with the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment (nucleotides 756–1195) derived from the human AC133 hematopoietic stem cell antigen cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberAF027208). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and washing were performed either at 65 °C using Church buffer as described elsewhere (13.Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blots were analyzed using a Fuji phosphoimager. All steps of cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation were carried out at 4 °C. Just prior to use, the membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin agent (Pierce) was dissolved in Ca/Mg-PBS (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2) to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. After repeated washing (three times) with Ca/Mg-PBS, Caco-2 cells (on 100-mm dishes) were incubated for 1 h in 3 ml of the biotin solution. The cells were washed three times with Ca/Mg-PBS and then incubated for 10 min with Ca/Mg-PBS containing 20 mmglycine to quench the residual biotin. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates obtained after centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g) were subjected to immunoprecipitation. For domain-selective cell surface biotinylation (14.Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), 11-day-old monolayers on duplicate Transwell filters were washed three times with Ca/Mg-PBS and then biotinylated from either the apical (1.5 ml) or basolateral (2.6 ml) chamber compartment. The compartment not receiving the sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was filled with Ca/Mg-PBS. After quenching, cells were scraped into ice-cold solubilization buffer, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Cell lysates corresponding to one confluent 100-mm dish or half of one 24-mm filter were diluted 4-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and monoclonal antibody (mAb) AC133 (10 μg/ml) was added. Samples were incubated overnight on an end-over-end shaker. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pre-adsorbed with rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and used for deglycosylation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and NeutrAvidin blotting (see below). Immune complexes containing the cell surface-biotinylated proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads using glycosidase buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) at 95 °C. Eluates were incubated for 6 h at room temperature in the absence or presence of 1 unit PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, pore size 0.45 μm) using standard procedures. After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 2 h in PBS containing 5% low fat milk powder and 0.3% Tween 20 and then washed extensively with PBS. Biotinylated proteins were identified with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Pierce) (diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) followed by incubation with the SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Cell surface immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (5.Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with Ca/Mg-PBS, first at room temperature and then on ice, and surface-labeled for 30 min at 4 °C by the addition of the mAb AC133 (10 μg/ml) or mAb AC141 (10 μg/ml) or double surface-labeled by an additional incubation for 10 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma). Both antibodies and wheat germ agglutinin were diluted in ice-cold immunofluorescence buffer (Ca/Mg-PBS containing 0.2% gelatin). Unbound antibodies or free wheat germ agglutinin were removed by five washes with ice-cold immunofluorescence buffer. Fixative (3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS) was added to the cells on ice, and the coverslips were placed at room temperature for 30 min. The fixative was removed by three washes with Ca/Mg-PBS, and the residual formaldehyde was quenched for 30 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with lissamine rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Dianova). Coverslips were rinsed sequentially with immunofluorescence buffer, PBS, and distilled water and mounted in Mowiol 4.88 (Calbiochem). In experiments with permeabilized cells, cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then rinsed with and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 50 mm ammonium chloride. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.2% saponin/0.2% gelatin in PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated sequentially with mAb AC133 (10 μg/ml), 1 mg/ml RNase A for 10 min at room temperature (to digest cytoplasmic mRNA), and CyTM2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Dianova), all in blocking solution. Nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide (0.3 μg/ml) during the incubation of secondary antibody. Coverslips were rinsed and mounted as described above. Cells were observed with a Leica TCS4D confocal laser scanning microscope. The confocal microscope settings were such that the photomultipliers were within their linear range. The images shown were prepared from the confocal data files using Adobe photoshop software. A human embryo at 32 days of development was obtained immediately after voluntary termination of pregnancy induced with the RU 486 antiprogestative compound. Informed consent for the use of the embryo in research was obtained from the patient, and the embryo was collected according to the guidelines and with the approval of both national and institutional ethics committees. Human embryonic tissue, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, was rinsed in PBS for several hours and then twice in 15% sucrose in PBS for at least 24 h. The tissue was then embedded in 15% sucrose, 7.5% gelatin in PBS, and frozen at −70 °C. Five-micron-thick frozen sections were thawed, hydrated in PBS, and endogenous peroxidases were inhibited for 20 min in PBS containing 0.2% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then washed with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS and the mAb AC133 (20 μg/ml) was added overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-Triton X-100, incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO) and subsequently with peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (DAKO). Peroxidase activity was revealed with 0.025% (v/v) 3.3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.015% hydrogen peroxide. Slides were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin, and mounted in XAM neutral medium (BDH). Caco-2 cells or CHO cells stably transfected with the human AC133 gene cultured on collagen-coated 60-mm Petri dishes (Collagen R, Serva) were washed with 200 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Caco-2 cells) or 8% paraformaldehyde (CHO cells) in Hepes buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. CHO cells were embedded in 10% gelatin in PBS. Ultrathin cryosections were prepared as described previously (5.Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling of cryosections using either mAb AC133 (0.5–1.5 mg/ml) or mAb AC141 (0.15–2.3 mg/ml) followed by goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to 15-nm gold particles (Aurion) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Aurion) with minor modifications. Human CD34+hematopoietic progenitor cells were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with saturating concentrations of AC133 antibody and with an equivalent concentration of an IgG1 isotype-matched nonbinding control antibody, 1B5 (generously supplied by Dr. Graham Mayerhofer, Hanson Center for Cancer Research). After two washes with HHF buffer, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to colloidal gold particles of average diameter of 10 nm (GAM-Au10, Janssen Pharmaceutica) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, washed three times with HHF buffer, and then fixed in a 3% (v/v) solution of EM-grade glutaraldehyde (Agar Aids) in 150 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). Additional aliquots of CD34+ cells were stained in parallel using an identical protocol with mAb DREG-56 (anti-CD62L) and with mAb 7E10 (an antibody prepared in P. J. Simmons' laboratory, which identifies a class 3 epitope on the CD34 molecule (15.Nishio H. Tada J. Hashiyama M. Hirn J. Ingles-Esteve J. Suda T. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. von dem Borne A.E.G.K.

Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1997: 974-976Google Scholar)). Immunolabeled cells were then washed three times in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide (Johnson Matthey Chemical Ltd.) in the same buffer, and then dehydrated by exposure to a graded series of ethanol. Following dehydration in 100% ethanol, the cells were transferred to propylene oxide (BDH) prior to infiltration with epon-araldite resin overnight at room temperature. The resin was polymerized for 8 h at 80 °C after which ultrathin sections were cut and examined without counterstaining in a transmission electron microscope (Jeol) operating at 80 kV. The qualitative and quantitative statements about the distribution of the various antigens between protrusions and planar regions of the plasma membrane are based on the examination of 80–100 cells and the counting of at least 250 gold particles for each antibody. Both previously described (6.Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mouse mAb against the human AC133 hematopoietic stem cell antigen, mAb AC133 (Fig. 1 A) and mAb AC141 (Fig. 1 B) were found to stain, on cell surface immunofluorescence, Caco-2 cells, a human intestine-derived epithelial cell line (16.Fogh J. Fogh J.M. Orfeo T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 59: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The staining showed a punctate pattern, which is characteristic of a microvilli-associated antigen. Caco-2 cells did not show any staining when primary antibodies were omitted (Fig.1 C). The antigen recognized by mAbs AC133 and AC141 on the surface of Caco-2 cells was characterized. Both mAb AC133 (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A.

We therefore labeled the surface of Caco-2 cells with the membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and subjected the antigen immunoprecipitated with mAb AC133 to incubation with and without PNGase F, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Fig.2 A). Without PNGase F treatment, a band with an apparent molecular mass of ≈120 kDa was detected (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Deglycosylation yielded a 95-kDa band (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). These apparent molecular masses are those expected for the AC133 antigen (7.Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Wa"

By using metabolically competent rat brain slices as a model, we found that selective inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A by okadaic acid induced an Alzheimer-like hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau. The hyperphosphorylated tau had a reduced ability to bind to microtubules and to promote microtubule assembly in vitro. Immunocytochemical staining revealed hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in pyramidal neurons in cornu ammonis and in neocortical neurons. The topography of these changes recalls the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain. Selective inhibition of protein phosphatase 2B with cyclosporin A did not have any significant effect on tau phosphorylation, accumulation, or function. These studies suggest that protein phosphatase 2A participates in regulation of tau phosphorylation, processing, and function in vivo. A down-regulation of protein phosphatase 2A activity can lead to Alzheimer-like abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau.

Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase microtubule-associated protein paired helical filaments protein phosphatase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. Although the pathogenesis of the disease is not yet understood, AD is characterized by the presence of two histopathological hallmark brain lesions, extracellular deposits of β-amyloid in neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The latter is composed of bundles of paired helical filaments (PHF), the major protein subunit of which is the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau (1.Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Quinlan N.M.

It is abnormally hyperphosphorylated, aggregated into filaments, and does not bind to microtubules or stimulate microtubule assembly (for review see Ref. 5.Iqbal K. Alonso A.del C. Gong C.-X. Gong S. Khatoon Pei J.-J. Wang J.Z. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Neural Transm. 1998; 53: 169-180Google Scholar). In addition to PHF, the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau is also observed in pretangle neurons as amorphous aggregates (6.Bancher C. Brunner C. Lassmann H. Budka H. Jellinger K. Wiche G. Seitelberger F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Wisniewski H.M. Brain Res. 1989; 477: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), which can be isolated from the 27,000 to 200,000 × gfraction of AD brain homogenate (7.Köpke E. Tung Y.-C. Shaikh S. Alonso A.del C. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24374-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pool of abnormal tau, which is soluble in biological buffer conditions, disrupts microtubules and inhibits their assembly in vitro (8.Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc.

Evidence from several studies has indicated that the hyperphosphorylation of tau is responsible for its loss of biological activity and its resistance to proteolytic degradation, and probably plays a key role in neurofibrillary degeneration in AD (8.Alonso A.del C.

Brain Res. 1996; 38: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).A fundamental question for understanding the mechanism of neurofibrillary degeneration of AD is why and how tau becomes abnormally hyperphosphorylated. The phosphorylation state of a phosphoprotein is the consequence of relative activities of the protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) toward it. Among several different protein kinases that have been implicated in the phosphorylation of tau are glycogen synthase kinase-3 (14.Ishiguro K. Shiratsuchi A. Sato S. Omori A. Arioka M. Kobayashi S. Uchida T. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), neuronal Cdc-like protein kinases (Cdk5) (15.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), casein kinase I (18.Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1420-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (19.Jicha G.A. Weaver C. Lane E. Vianna C. Kress Y. Rockwood J. Davies P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7486-7494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Less is known about the protein phosphatases participating in the regulation of tau phosphorylation.To date, all the 21 phosphorylation sites that have been identified in AD hyperphosphorylated tau are either on serine or threonine residues. Thus, phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl protein phosphatases (PP) are expected to be involved in the regulation of the phosphorylation of tau in AD brain. PP are generally classified into four types (20.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar), namely PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C. They are all expressed in neurons of human brain (21.Pei J.-J. Sersen E. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Brain Res. 1994; 655: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). By using the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau isolated from AD brain as a substrate, we have previously found that PP2A, PP2B, and, to a less extent, PP1 but not PP2C can efficiently dephosphorylate tau in vitro (12.Wang J.-Z.

Similar findings have also been reported by using 32P-labeled tau with various protein kinases as a substrate in vitro (25.Goedert M. Cohen E.S. Jakes R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 26.Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or using in vivo phosphorylated tau as a substrate (27.Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Baumann K. Gorris J. Merlevede W. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28.Mawal-Dewan M. Henley J. Van de Voorde A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, to date it is not known which of these three phosphatases regulates tau phosphorylation in vivo and by what mechanism tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in AD brain. In part, this is due to the lack of a model system for AD neurofibrillary lesions. Attempts to study the regulation of tau phosphorylation by protein phosphatases have been carried out in cultured cells (29.Saito T. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Miyamoto E. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S.-I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31.Tanaka T. Zhong J. Iqbal K. Trenkner E. Iqbal-Grundke I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but this regulation in cultured cells is most likely different from that in mature mammalian brain. This is because all commonly used neuronal cell lines only express fetal type tau that is highly phosphorylated and composed of only the shortest isoform. Tau in normal mature brain is less phosphorylated and composed of six isoforms due to alternative mRNA splicing of a single gene (28.Mawal-Dewan M. Henley J. Van de Voorde A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30981-30987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein phosphatase profile in cultured cell lines may also be different from that in brain. For instance, PP2B is not expressed in SY5Y cells (31.Tanaka T. Zhong J. Iqbal K. Trenkner E. Iqbal-Grundke I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas it is the major protein phosphatase in mammalian brain (20.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). In brains of transgenic mice lacking the catalytic subunit Aα of PP2B, hyperphosphorylation of tau was restricted in the mossy fibers of the hippocampus (32.Kayyali U.S. Zhang W. Yee A.G. Seidman J. Potter H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar attempt to investigate PP2A has been unsuccessful since the selective knockout of PP2A expression is fatal (33.Gotz J. Probst A. Ehler E. Hemmings B. Kues W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 21: 12370-12375Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Alternatively, selective PP inhibitors have been employed to be infused into animal brain or to incubate brain tissue (34.Harris K.A.

However, no convincing conclusion has been drawn due to lack of the data of the actual inhibition and/or the functional consequence.In the present study, we have used metabolically competent rat brain slices as a model system to investigate the regulation of tau phosphorylation by protein phosphatases. The use of brain slices is a well established technique widely employed in electrophysiological and pharmacological studies (36.Alger B.E. Dhanjal S.S. Dingledine R. Garthwaite J. Henderson G.

We found that the selective inhibition of PP2A by treatment of the slices with okadaic acid induced both accumulation and phosphorylation of tau at several abnormal hyperphosphorylation sites as seen in AD brains. This hyperphosphorylation of tau occurred predominantly in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex. Selective inhibition of PP2B did not cause similar consequences. The phosphorylation of tau induced by PP2A inhibition in the brain slices significantly reduced its ability to bind to microtubules and to stimulate microtubule assembly.DISCUSSIONThe biological activity of tau, which is the major microtubule-associated protein of normal mature neurons, is known to be regulated by the degree of its phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau depresses its activity to promote microtubule assembly and to maintain the structure of microtubules (8.Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 9.Alonso A.del C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K.

Thus, understanding the regulation of tau phosphorylation is of great importance not only in AD, which is characterized by the accumulation of the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in the affected neurons, but also in normal neurobiology. In vitro studies employing purified enzymes have shown that tau can be dephosphorylated by PP2A, PP2B, and PP1 but not by PP2C (12.Wang J.-Z. Gong C.-X. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4854-4860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22.Gong C.-X. Grundke-Iqbal I. Damuni Z. Iqbal K.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present studies employing metabolically active rat brain slices, we have found that the phosphorylation of tau at some of the same sites phosphorylated in AD is regulated by PP2A and that the inhibition of the activity of the phosphatase also results in an increase in the level of tau due to a decrease in its turnover. Inhibition of PP2B by cyclosporin A, deltamethrin, or calmidazonium did not result in any significant increase in tau level nor tau hyperphosphorylation at any of the sites examined. Tau isolated from cyclosporin A-treated rat brain tissue had normal activity to bind to microtubule and to promote microtubule assembly. These data taken together suggest that the phosphorylation and processing of tau in vivo are regulated mainly by PP2A and that PP2B is minimally involved in regulating the phosphorylation of tau at the sites that affect its microtubule binding and assembly activities.The present findings are consistent with previous reports, which found the following: 1) that a pool of PP2A is associated with microtubules (58.Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 59.Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C.

Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25490-25498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar); 2) that in three different cell lines, coexpression of tau with SV40 small t, a specific endogenous PP2A inhibitor, increased tau phosphorylation and decreased microtubule stabilization (59.Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar); 3) that the inhibition of protein phosphatases by okadaic acid and calyculin A in cultured fetal rat hippocampal neurons resulted in a modification of the neuritic tree structure with loss of neuronal process and decrease in the number of synapses as seen in AD brain (60.Malchiodi-Albedi F. Petrucci T.C. Picconi B. Iosi F. Falchi M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); 4) that colchicine or nocodazole treatment of NT2N cells or SY5Y cells induced dephosphorylation of tau at Ser-202 and Thr-205, and this dephosphorylation could be blocked by PP2A inhibitor but not by PP2B inhibitor (61.Merrick S.E.

Brain Res. 1998; 798: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); 5) that a complete block of PP2B activity in the knockout mice induced hyperphosphorylation of tau only in the mossy fibers of CA3 region of the hippocampus, where PP2B is most dominant (32.Kayyali U.S. Zhang W. Yee A.G. Seidman J. Potter H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); and 6) that a 38% inhibition of PP2B induced by injection of cyclosporin A into rat brain hippocampus failed to induce hyperphosphorylation of tau (63.Tanaka T. Takeda M. Niiguwa H. Hariguchi S. Nishimura T. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 15: 77-87PubMed Google Scholar). Tau in both normal human brains and animal brains but not in AD brain are subjected to rapid enzymatic dephosphorylation during postmortem (64.Matsuo E.S. Shin R.-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Connor M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PP2A activity is declined in AD brain as compared with controls (65.Gong C.-X. Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar,66.Gong C.-X. Shaikh S. Wang J.-Z. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the phosphorylation of tau is regulated by PP2A in vivo, and a defect in PP2A activity may contribute to hyperphosphorylation and consequent aggregation and loss of biological function of tau in AD brain.The regulation of the phosphorylation of tau appears quite complex. Tau has been reported to serve as a bridge between PP1 and microtubules, and a pool of PP1 copurifies with microtubules (76.Liao H. Li Y. Brantigan D.L. Gundersen G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The association of PP1 with tau increases the phosphatase activity 3–4-fold in vitro. In contrast, the holoenzyme of PP2A has been shown to bind to both tau and microtubules, and this binding inhibits PP2A activity toward tau (75.Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Brandt R. Kamibayashi C. Kuret J. White III, C.L. Mumby M.C. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25490-25498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that PP2A may dephosphorylate tau primarily, if not extensively, when tau is dissociated from microtubules, and the dephosphorylated tau regains its ability to bind to microtubules. Thus, as observed in the present study, the inhibition of PP2A activity keeps tau dissociated from microtubules and available for continuous phosphorylation by various protein kinases in neurons.The relative activities of tau protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) determine the degree of phosphorylation of the protein in the cells. When PP2A is inhibited or declined, the balance of tau phosphorylation will shift toward the hyperphosphorylation side. In addition to the direct action of PP2A on tau, the activation of tau protein kinases can also induce tau hyperphosphorylation. We (31.Tanaka T. Zhong J. Iqbal K. Trenkner E. Iqbal-Grundke I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and others (73.Easom R.A. Tarpley J.L. Filler N.R. Bhatt H. Biochem. J. 1988; 329: 283-288Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the treatment of cultured cells by okadaic acid activated transiently the activities of several protein kinases including MAP kinase, cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdc2 kinase and Cdk5), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, all of which are able to phosphorylate tau in vitro (15.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16.Drewes G. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Döring F. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Goris J. Dorée M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Hence, the tau hyperphosphorylation we observed in okadaic acid-treated brain slices could also be the result of the activation of these kinases. However, okadaic acid does not seem to have any direct effect on protein kinases; the activation of these kinases appears to be the result of inhibition of PP2A/PP1 (73.Easom R.A. Tarpley J.L. Filler N.R. Bhatt H. Biochem. J. 1988; 329: 283-288Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 74.Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of MAP kinase and Cdc2 kinase is unlikely involved in the hyperphosphorylation of tau observed in the present study. MAP kinase has been reported not to participate to tau phosphorylation in vivo (67.Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Latimer D. Davis D.R. Andertron B.H. Gallo J.-M. Hanger D. Mulot S. Marquardt B. Stabel S. Woodgett J.R. Miller C.J,. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), even though it can phosphorylate several phosphorylation sites of tauin vitro (16.Drewes G. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Döring F. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Goris J. Dorée M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The Cdc2 kinase is usually inactive in mature neurons, and one of its preferred phosphorylation sites, Thr-231 (68.Vulliet R. Halloran S.M. Braun R.K. Smith A.J. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22570-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not phosphorylated in the okadaic acid-treated tissue slices as determined with antibody M4 in the present study.PHF-tau is highly phosphorylated. To date, 21 phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHF-tau, only some of which are partially phosphorylated in normal brain (64.Matsuo E.S. Shin R.-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A.

Watanabe A. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 375-380Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau displays a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (3.Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.-C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4854-4860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and a loss of its ability to bind to microtubules and to promote microtubule assembly (8.Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 12.Wang J.-Z. Gong C.-X. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4854-4860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), although the exact phosphorylation sites responsible for these changes have not yet been fully understood. In the present study, of the sites examined the inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid induced hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser-198, Ser-199, Ser-202, Ser-262, Ser-356, Ser-396, Ser-404 and Ser-422, all of which are among the abnormal hyperphosphorylated sites found in PHF-tau (69.Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Watanabe A. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 375-380Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid might have also induced phosphorylation of tau at the sites in addition to those examined. The mobility shift, the resistance to degradation, and the functional inhibition of the tau reported in AD brain were also observed in the okadaic acid-treated rat brain tissue. However, unlike AD abnormal tau, the okadaic acid-induced phosphorylated tau only displayed partial inhibition to bind to microtubules and to stimulate their assembly. Thioflavin-S staining of the okadaic acid-treated rat brain sections indicated no PHF formed from this hyperphosphorylated tau. These results suggest that the inhibition of PP2A activity for an extended period might be required and/or other factors might be involved in the formation of PHF.AD brain is characterized by containing numerous extracellular neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made from the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. The latter are widely distributed through out the gray matter of AD brain, especially in entorhinal cortex and CA1 sector of the hippocampus (70.Hyman B.T. Van Hoesen G.W. Damasio A.R Barnes C.L. Science. 1984; 225: 1168-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Among various neurons, pyramidal cells are most susceptible to Alzheimer neurofibrillary degeneration. The distribution of neurons containing the hyperphosphorylated tau in the okadaic acid-treated rat brain slices as examined by immunocytochemical staining with 12E8 and R145 was similar to that of neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain. This further supports our hypothesis that a down-regulation of PP2A may be involved in neurofibrillary degeneration in AD.Okadaic acid is a well documented inhibitor of PP2A and PP1, with an IC50 of ∼1 nm and 0.1–0.5 μm, respectively, in vitro (54.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). It can also inhibit PP2B activity at a much higher concentration (IC50 = 4–5 μm). This compound has been widely used for selective inhibition of protein phosphatases. However, due to the high concentration of protein phosphatases and the complexity inside the cell, the intracellular selectivity of phosphatase inhibition cannot be speculated according to its in vitro potency to each protein phosphatase. This has made the interpretation of the data inconclusive, often unable to distinguish between the roles of PP2A and PP1. In this study, we have employed various concentrations of okadaic acid to treat the brain slices and quantitated the remaining activity of each phosphatase. Surprisingly, we found that only PP2A activity of the slices was inhibited by okadaic acid at concentrations up to 5 μm, which can completely block PP1 activity in vitro (54.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1"
https://openalex.org/W1990283519,"beta-Lapachone activates a novel apoptotic response in a number of cell lines. We demonstrate that the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) substantially enhances the toxicity of beta-lapachone. NQO1 expression directly correlated with sensitivity to a 4-h pulse of beta-lapachone in a panel of breast cancer cell lines, and the NQO1 inhibitor, dicoumarol, significantly protected NQO1-expressing cells from all aspects of beta-lapachone toxicity. Stable transfection of the NQO1-deficient cell line, MDA-MB-468, with an NQO1 expression plasmid increased apoptotic responses and lethality after beta-lapachone exposure. Dicoumarol blocked both the apoptotic responses and lethality. Biochemical studies suggest that reduction of beta-lapachone by NQO1 leads to a futile cycling between the quinone and hydroquinone forms, with a concomitant loss of reduced NAD(P)H. In addition, the activation of a cysteine protease, which has characteristics consistent with the neutral calcium-dependent protease, calpain, is observed after beta-lapachone treatment. This is the first definitive elucidation of an intracellular target for beta-lapachone in tumor cells. NQO1 could be exploited for gene therapy, radiotherapy, and/or chemopreventive interventions, since the enzyme is elevated in a number of tumor types (i.e. breast and lung) and during neoplastic transformation."

To test whether hZip2 is a zinc transporter, we examined65Zn uptake activity in transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing hZip2 from the CMV promoter. hZip2-expressing cells accumulated more zinc than control cells because of an increased initial zinc uptake rate. This activity was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and saturable with an apparentK m of 3 μm. hZip2 zinc uptake activity was inhibited by several other transition metals, suggesting that this protein may transport other substrates as well. hZip2 activity was not energy-dependent, nor did it require K+ or Na+ gradients. Zinc uptake by hZip2 was stimulated by HCO3− treatment, suggesting a Zn2+-HCO3−cotransport mechanism. Finally, hZip2 was exclusively localized in the plasma membrane.

Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Zinc is also implicated as a neuromodulator of certain postsynaptic neurons in the brain (2.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Because of these important functions, nutritional zinc deficiency can have devastating consequences to human health including growth retardation, immune system dysfunction, and mental disorders. Although severe zinc deficiency is rare, mild deficits may compromise the health of a large portion of the world's population (3.Walsh C.T. Sandstead H.H. Prasad A.S. Newberne P.M. Fraker P.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 5-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Genetic factors also influence zinc status in humans. Acute zinc deficiency is observed in individuals with the genetic disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE)1 (4.Dillaha C.J. Lorincz A.L. Aavik O.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1953; 152: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AE shows a autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Although the responsible gene has not been identified, the physiological lesion is known; AE decreases zinc uptake in the small intestine (5.Atherton D.J. Muller D.P.R. Aggett P.J. Harries J.T. Clin. Sci. 1979; 56: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and other cells of the body (6.Vasquez F. Grider A. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1995; 50: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In mammals, zinc is absorbed from the diet through the brush border membrane of the epithelial cells lining the small intestine. After absorption, zinc is transported across the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells into the portal blood where most of the metal ion is loosely bound by albumin. Zinc uptake by mammalian cells has been studied in a variety of tissues and cell types (for review see Ref. 7.Reyes J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C401-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have clearly demonstrated that zinc uptake is mediated by transporters located in the plasma membrane of these cells. The specific transporters involved, their biochemical mechanisms of action, their regulation in response to zinc availability, and the specific form of zinc (e.g. Zn2+, zinc-histidine complexes, etc.) they transport remain unresolved. Molecular insight into zinc uptake in other eukaryotes comes from recent studies of zinc transporters in fungi and plants. TheZRT1 and ZRT2 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode high and low affinity zinc transporters, respectively (8.Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 9.Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Zrt1 and Zrt2 are both similar to the Irt1 transporter of Arabidopsis thaliana (10.Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Although originally identified as an Fe2+ transporter, Irt1 can transport Zn2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+ as well (11.Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Four additional and related Arabidopsis proteins, Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, and Zip4, are implicated in zinc transport (12.Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These proteins are members of a transporter superfamily found in a diverse array of eukaryotic organisms. This family, referred to collectively as the ZIP (ZRT1, IRT1-likeprotein) family for ZRT, IRT-like protein (13.Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), now contains more than 30 members including 16 in plants (13 inArabidopsis alone) and 8 in nematodes. The results obtained from studies of fungal and plant ZIP transporters suggest a remarkably conserved role for the ZIP family in zinc uptake. In this report, we embark on a characterization of the mammalian members of this transporter family with an analysis of a human ZIP protein that we have designated hZip2. Our results indicate that hZip2 is indeed a zinc transporter. This work opens the door to further molecular analysis of zinc uptake in humans and other mammalian species.

This fragment was digested with NotI and XbaI and inserted into pRc-CMV vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCMV-hZIP2. hZip2 was epitope-tagged at its carboxyl terminus with three tandem copies of the hemagglutinin antigen (3×HA) epitope. The 3×HA DNA fragment was generated by PCR using the plasmid pMPY-3×HA (18.Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Butcher A.B.

Clonally derived stable transfectant cell lines were generated by the limiting dilution method using G418 selection. These cell lines were maintained selectively in 350 μg/ml G418. Cell number was determined with a hemacytometer, and cultures were examined weekly for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were grown to 50% confluence, harvested by centrifugation, and washed once in cold uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0). The cells were resuspended in uptake buffer and preincubated for 10 min in a shaking 37 °C water bath. The cells were then mixed with an equal volume of prewarmed uptake buffer containing 65ZnCl2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 15 min unless indicated otherwise. Assays were stopped by adding an equal volume of cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were collected by filtration on glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and washed three times in stop buffer (10 ml total). Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter. Chloride salt stock solutions (100 mm) of cadmium, copper, cobalt, and manganese were prepared in distilled water. A ZnCl2 stock was prepared at 100 mm in 0.02n HCl, and an FeCl3 stock was prepared at 50 mm in 0.1 n HCl. Sodium ascorbate (1 mm) was added to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Ascorbate treatment alone did not alter zinc uptake activity (data not shown). Sodium bicarbonate stocks (1 m) were prepared fresh before use. The statistical significance of differences in values was determined using STATVIEW software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) and subjected to one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants were determined using Cleland Kinetic software (20.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 43: 103-138Crossref Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Cell lines were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold methanol, and attached to polylysine-coated microscope slides. The fixed cells were incubated in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (1:200 dilution) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 60 min at 20 °C, washed, and then probed with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to Alexa 488 (1:200) (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at 20 °C. Cells were permeabilized prior to antibody addition by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature. The cells were mounted in 50% glycerol and viewed by epifluorescence and Nomarski optics. To identify potential zinc transporters in mammals, the amino acid sequences of the fungal and plant ZIPs were compared with mammalian expressed sequence tag sequences in the current data bases. This analysis identified several mammalian cDNAs capable of encoding related proteins. Three human genes (designated hZIP1, hZIP2, andhZIP3), one mouse gene (mZIP1; accession numberAA690621), and one rat gene (rZIP1; accession numberAI233196) were identified. An apparently full-length cDNA sequence of hZIP1 and a partial sequence of hZIP3 were available (Fig. 1). A plasmid (phZIP2) bearing a full-length cDNA clone of hZIP2 was isolated from a prostate cDNA library (see “Experimental Procedures”) and sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF186081). The cDNA insert in phZIP2 is 1358 base pairs long and contains an open reading frame that encodes a 309-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). It appears that the cDNA insert in phZIP2 is full-length; a 16-base poly(A)+ tail was present at the 3′ end, and two in-frame stop codons are present upstream of the putative initiation codon. The hZip2 protein product shows significant similarity (>34%) to members of the ZIP family, e.g. the yeast Zrt1 andArabidopsis Zip2 zinc transporters (Fig. 1). hZip1 and hZip3 show an equal degree of similarity to the fungal and plant proteins. The three mammalian proteins are more closely related to one another, sharing greater than 49% similarity, than they are to the fungal and plant proteins. Zrt1, Zip2, and the two full-length mammalian ZIPs are predicted to have eight transmembrane domains and the same topology with both the amino and carboxyl terminus located on the extracellular surface of the cell. These features are shared by many of the ZIP family members (13.Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The available hZip3 sequence appears to begin after transmembrane domain II. A number of other features found in hZip2 are conserved in other ZIPs. A potential metal binding motif containing three histidine residues ( … HSHGHL … ) is found in a region between transmembrane domains 3 and 4. This motif is conserved in many of the ZIP family members including Zrt1 (13.Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but its function is unknown. Three of the transmembrane domains of hZip2 (II, IV, and V) contain histidine residues that are conserved among most family members (Fig. 1) (13.Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transmembrane domain IV contains a serine that is conserved in almost all family members. These residues are predicted to lie on the polar face of amphipathic α-helices, suggesting a possible role in metal ion transport. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of these residues in Irt1 eliminated zinc uptake activity. 2E. E. Rogers, D. J. Eide, and M. L. Guerinot, submitted for publication. Given that all of the fungal and plant ZIP transporters characterized to date have been implicated in Zn2+ transport, we hypothesized a similar role for the mammalian ZIP genes. To test the ability of hZip2 to transport zinc, we first attempted to express hZip2 in a yeastzrt1 zrt2 mutant that is defective for zinc uptake. Although this approach was successful for characterizing many of the plant ZIP genes (12.Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), hZip2 expression in yeast failed to complement the yeast mutant, and there was no detectable increase in zinc uptake activity (data not shown). Lacking an antibody probe against hZip2, we could not assess whether the protein was produced in yeast or localized in the plasma membrane. Therefore, we tested an alternative expression system, human K562 erythroleukemia cells, in which we expected the protein to be expressed well and properly localized. This particular cell line was chosen because of its ability to grow in suspension, a simplifying factor for zinc uptake assays. The hZIP2 open reading frame was cloned into pRc-CMV (generating pCMV-hZIP2) for expression from the CMV promoter. Stable K562 transfectants were generated with pCMV-hZIP2 and the pRc-CMV vector. Northern blot analysis demonstrated thathZIP2 is expressed at a high level, approximately 0.1% of total mRNA, in the pCMV-hZIP2 transfectants (data not shown). NohZIP2 expression was detected in the vector-only control, demonstrating that hZIP2 is not normally expressed at a high level in K562 cells. 65Zn accumulation was examined in the stable transfectants expressing hZip2 or the vector-only control, hereafter referred to as K562-hZIP2 and K562-Vec, respectively. At 4 °C, little zinc accumulation was detectable with either cell type (Fig.2 A). At 37 °C, zinc accumulation in K562-Vec cells indicated the presence of endogenous zinc uptake systems. Consistent with an ability of hZip2 to transport zinc, 65Zn accumulation was greatly stimulated in K562-hZIP2 cells. To test whether the increased zinc accumulation in K562-hZIP2 cells was due to an increased initial zinc influx rate rather than, for example, decreased zinc efflux activity,65Zn accumulation was assayed over a much shorter time period (i.e. 0–60 s). K562-hZIP2 cells had an initial zinc uptake rate of 5 pmol Zn/min/106 cells that was approximately 2-fold higher than the endogenous activity (2.3 pmol Zn/min/106 cells) (Fig. 2 B). Endogenous zinc uptake activity measured in K562-Vec cells was concentration-dependent and saturable. When assayed over a range of zinc concentrations, this system showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K m of 3 μmzinc and a V max of 33 pmol Zn/min/106 cells (Fig. 2 C). Zinc accumulation in K562-hZIP2 cells was also concentration-dependent and saturable. The specific contribution of hZip2 to zinc uptake activity was estimated by subtracting the vector control values from the K562-hZIP2 values (Fig. 2 C, dashed line). hZip2-dependent zinc uptake estimated in this manner had a similar apparent K m for zinc as the endogenous system (3 μm Zn) and aV max of 58 pmol Zn/min/106 cells. Thus, both the hZip2-dependent uptake activity and endogenous zinc uptake activity in K562 cells are time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent. These results indicate that the hZIP2 gene encodes a zinc transporter. Most zinc in serum is bound to albumin. Therefore, an important question regarding the physiological relevance of hZip2 zinc uptake activity is whether this protein can function in the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin. Adding serum levels of albumin (40 mg/ml) to our uptake assays decreased the uptake rates of both the hZip2-dependent and endogenous systems by approximately 80%, but did not change the qualitative effects of hZip2 expression. Thus, hZip2 can function in the presence of albumin. To assess whether the endogenous K562 zinc uptake system or hZip2 is potentially capable of transporting substrates other than zinc, we tested several transition metals for their ability to inhibit zinc uptake activity (Fig.3 A). In these assays,65Zn was supplied at 3 μm, and the other metals were added at >6-fold excess (i.e. 20 μm) concentrations. Zinc uptake by the K562 endogenous system was not inhibited by Fe2+ or Co2+ but was significantly inhibited by Cd2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ (p < 0.05). Although the mechanism of this inhibition is not known, these data suggest that the inhibitory metals are potential substrates for the endogenous system. In contrast, hZip2 zinc uptake activity was strongly inhibited by all metals tested. Again, although other mechanisms are possible, hZip2 may be capable of transporting many different metal ion substrates. Zinc uptake by both the endogenous activity in K562 cells and hZip2 was not energy-dependent. Treatment with several different electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors (i.e. oligomycin, antimycin A, CN−, N3−, rotenone, and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone) did not decrease zinc uptake activity (data not shown). Zinc uptake by either system also appeared to be independent of membrane potential. Our standard assay buffer contains a concentration of K+ (150 mm) that is sufficient to depolarize the plasma membrane. However, no effect on uptake activity was observed when cells were incubated in low K+(1 mm) assay buffer or in the presence of 2 μm valinomycin, a K+ ionophore. Likewise, Na+ was not required for zinc uptake by these systems because it was not included in the standard uptake buffer, and addition of Na+ (6 mm or 150 mm) had no effect on uptake activity. The sulfhydryl-reactive agentN-ethylmaleimide inhibited both hZip2 and endogenous uptake activities by greater than 50%, suggesting that one or more cysteine residues are important for their function. Although the endogenous zinc uptake system was pH-independent, hZip2 zinc uptake was inhibited at pH levels below 7.0 and stimulated at higher pH (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). One explanation for this effect is that as pH increases, the concentration of HCO3−, which is present in the assay solution because of equilibration with atmospheric CO2, also increases. HCO3− treatment is known to stimulate zinc uptake activity in cultured fibroblasts and erythrocytes (6.Vasquez F. Grider A. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1995; 50: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22.Savigni D.L. Morgan E.H. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 837-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23.Alda Torrubia J.O. Garay R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of HCO3− on the endogenous and hZip2 activities. HCO3− treatment (0.5 mm) had no significant effect on the endogenous activity but stimulated hZip2 activity (Fig. 3 C). Control experiments indicated that this level of HCO3− did not change the pH of the solution (data not shown). When assayed at pH 8.0, HCO3− addition failed to further increase hZip2 uptake activity. This result suggests that effects of high pH are indeed caused by the indirect effects of pH on HCO3− concentrations. The hypothesized role of hZip2 as a zinc uptake transporter suggests that this protein is found in the plasma membrane. To test this prediction, we epitope-tagged the carboxyl terminus of hZip2 with three tandem copies of theHaemophilus influenzae hemagglutinin antigen (HA) to generate hZIP2-3×HA. This allele was cloned into the pRc-CMV expression vector and transfected into K562 cells. Zinc uptake assays of hZIP2-3×HA transfectants demonstrated that the tagged allele was functional, i.e. an approximately 2-fold increase in uptake activity was observed (data not shown). Localization of the hZip2–3×HA protein was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-HA antibody. Little fluorescence was detected in detergent permeabilized or nonpermeabilized cells expressing untagged hZip2 (Fig. 4,A–D). In contrast, permeabilized cells expressing hZip2–3×HA showed a bright rim of fluorescence at the cell periphery (Fig. 4, E and F) consistent with plasma membrane localization of the epitope-tagged protein. Plasma membrane staining was also observed in nonpermeabilized cells expressing the HA-tagged protein (Fig. 4, G and H). These results indicate that the carboxyl terminus of hZip2 is located on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane as we anticipated from its predicted topology. The human genome contains at least three ZIP family members. Our current hypothesis is that these genes encode zinc uptake transporters. Several lines of evidence from our studies of hZip2 support this hypothesis. First, hZip2 is closely related to several previously characterized zinc transporters from both fungi and plants. Second, hZip2 is localized in the plasma membrane when expressed in K562 cells. Third and most importantly, expression of hZip2 in K562 cells increased the initial rate of zinc uptake in a time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent fashion. This zinc uptake activity was clearly distinct from the endogenous activity expressed by the cells. These characteristics are indicative of a carrier-mediated transport process dependent on hZip2. Additional support for our hypothesis regarding the human ZIP genes comes from recent studies of zinc uptake in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells. Costello et al. (24.Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) showed that hZIP1 is expressed in PC-3 cells and that its expression was coordinately regulated with zinc uptake activity in response to testosterone and prolactin treatment. Furthermore,hZIP1 expression was regulated by zinc availability; zinc treatment of PC-3 cells decreased hZIP1 mRNA levels. Similar regulation of zinc transporter expression has been observed for the yeast and plant ZIP genes (8.Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12.Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although our results demonstrate the ability of this protein to transport zinc, it may also be capable of transporting other physiologically relevant metal ions such as Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ and nonphysiological substrates like Cd2+ and Co2+. This potentially broad substrate range is not unprecedented in the field of metal ion transport. The Dmt1 transporter plays an important role in iron accumulation (25.Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 26.Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) but is also capable of transporting Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ (27.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Irt1, a plant member of the ZIP family, can transport Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+ (10.Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 11.Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Determining the physiological role of hZip2 in transporting zinc and other metal ions into cells of various tissues may ultimately require an animal model (e.g. knockout mice) for studying mammalian ZIP function. We can gain some insight into ZIP function in humans by considering the tissues where these proteins are expressed. Repeated attempts to detecthZIP2 mRNA on Northern blots of poly(A)+RNAs derived from different human tissues and cultured cell lines failed to give positive results. It is possible that this gene is normally expressed at low levels and that a more sensitive detection method will be required. Alternatively, hZIP2 may be expressed in only a limited number of tissues and cell types that were not represented on these blots. The available information in the expressed sequence tag data base is consistent with either hypothesis. Only four hZIP2 expressed sequence tag clones have been isolated and these were only from prostate and uterine cDNA libraries. The observation that these particular tissues expresshZIP2 may be instructive, e.g. cells of the prostate contain the highest zinc level of any soft tissue in the body. Thus, expression of hZIP2 in these tissues might help meet their particular needs of zinc metabolism. In contrast,hZIP1 and hZIP3 have been cloned as expressed sequence tags from a large number of different tissues, indicating that these genes are widely expressed and may play general housekeeping roles. hZIP2 was previously identified by subtraction cloning from primary uterine epithelial cells because the gene (designated as “clone 6A1”) was induced when these cells reached contact inhibition (28.Yamaguchi S. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1995; 62: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Given the clear membership of this gene in the ZIP family, we propose “hZIP2” as its designation. 6A1/hZIP2 expression was not detected in two of four carcinoma cell lines, leading to the proposal that this protein plays a direct role in contact inhibition. We see no growth inhibitory effect of hZIP2 overexpression in K562 cells (data not shown), suggesting that this hypothesis is incorrect. Rather, an alternative explanation for the observed induction is that at high cell densities, zinc levels in the medium may be decreasing and triggering a transcriptional response to nutrient limitation. Another unanswered question for hZip2 is its mechanism of transport. Surprisingly, zinc uptake by hZip2 was energy-independent. This observation conflicts with results obtained with the yeast zinc transporters that show a strict energy-dependence (8.Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 9.Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fungal and human ZIPs may work by different mechanisms. Zinc uptake by hZip2 was not dependent on the plasma membrane K+ or Na+ gradients but was stimulated by increased pH and treatment with HCO3−. We believe that the pH and HCO3− effects on hZip2 arise from the same mechanism. At pH 7, the [HCO3−] is calculated as 0.07 mm, whereas at pH 8, this concentration rises to 0.7 mm. Because 0.5 mmHCO3− was saturating for the effect (data not shown), adding HCO3− to assay buffer at pH 8 would not be expected to increase activity. Based on these considerations, we propose that zinc uptake by hZip2 in vivo is mediated by a Zn2+-HCO3− symport mechanism. Zinc uptake could be driven by the high concentration of HCO3− in serum (10–20 mm) and, presumably, the concentration gradient of labile zinc across the plasma membrane. Although the total zinc level in a cell is high, very little of that zinc is present in a labile form. Estimates of the labile zinc pool are in the nanomolar range (21.Suhy D. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 557-578Google Scholar). These important mechanistic issues await future study. A final interesting aspect of the observed stimulation of hZip2 activity by HCO3− is its potential relationship to acrodermatitis enteropathica. Vasquez and Grider (6.Vasquez F. Grider A. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1995; 50: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have shown that zinc uptake in fibroblasts involves two different uptake systems, one stimulated by HCO3−and a second that is unaffected by this treatment. They also showed that fibroblasts derived from AE patients retained only the system that was unresponsive to HCO3−. These results suggested that AE interferes specifically with a HCO3−-responsive zinc uptake activity, and in light of our data, this system may be hZip2 or a related ZIP transporter. Thus, with the identification of human ZIP transporters, we now have new molecular tools to examine zinc uptake, its genetics, and its regulation in human cells.

For example, the proteasome catalyzes both the constitutive turnover of the bulk of intracellular proteins and the conditional degradation of specific proteins that regulate various cellular processes. The 26 S proteasome is also a component of the quality control machinery that selectively degrades proteins with abnormal structures. Most known protein substrates of the 26 S proteasome are covalently modified with a polyubiquitin chain as a prerequisite for their proteolysis (1.DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). This requirement seems to have evolved, at least in part, because of the unique structure of the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome is composed of two 700,000-dalton subcomplexes, the 20 S proteasome and PA7001(1.DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

The 20 S proteasome, the catalytic core of the complex, is a cylindrical particle consisting of four stacked heptameric rings that contain a hollow center in which all six of the catalytic sites are located (5.Bochtler M.

This topology excludes both folded and aggregated substrates from contact with, and hydrolysis by, the active sites. The role of initial substrate recognition and binding by the complex is relegated to PA700, a 20-subunit regulatory complex (7.Hoffman L. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

In addition to binding protein substrates, PA700 also regulates the access of substrates to the active sites of the proteasome. ATP-dependent binding of PA700 to the outer rings of the proteasome probably induces a conformational change in the proteasome that creates narrow pores in the center of the outer rings, thereby exposing the interior catalytic sites to the exterior (2.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 3.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E.

This effect explains, in part, the PA700-dependent activation of the proteasome's hydrolysis of short nonubiquitinated peptides, which can freely cross the pores without need for interaction with or structural modification by PA700 (8.Ma C.-P. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the PA700-dependent opening of pores in the proteasome does not explain fully how PA700 promotes the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins with native or partially folded structures because such proteins are too large to traverse the pores (15.Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is commonly assumed that as an essential feature of 26 S proteasome-catalyzed proteolysis, PA700 must unfold the bound, ubiquitinated proteins and processively translocate them through the pores to the catalytic sites of the proteasome. This model would explain the known ATP requirement for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by the assembled 26 S proteasome, because it predicts that substrate unfolding and/or translocation are coupled to ATP hydrolysis by one or more of the six AAA protein subunits of PA700 (7.Hoffman L. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Adams G.M. Falke S. Goldberg A.L. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Gogol E.P. J.

This attractive model, however, has little direct experimental support and, with the exception of ATPase activity, the properties of PA700 required for such activities are poorly defined. To mediate unfolding and/or translocation, PA700 must contain a binding site for the non-native structures characteristic of both the products of the unfolding reaction and the substrates for the translocation reaction. Precendent exists for this from studies of the bacterial Clp protease system, which, like the proteasome, has occluded active sites and capping ATPases ClpA and ClpX. These AAA ATPases are known to mediate molecular chaperone and unfoldase activities (17.Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To gain insight into the recognition of protein substrates by PA700 we have analyzed interactions of PA700 with several model proteins in native and non-native conformations. Our data demonstrate that PA700 can directly interact with non-native structures of nonubiquitinated proteins and suggest models for how such interactions can participate in the degradation or refolding of protein substrates. PA700 (21.DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A. Song X. Hisamatsu H. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Lid was purified as an isolated complex, whereas, the base was purified bound to 20 S proteasome. Details of the purification and characterization of these complexes will be published elsewhere. 2K. Hakala and G. N. DeMartino, manuscript in preparation. ΔF508 mutant CFTR-NBD1 from residues 404–589 was expressed with a six-histidine tag and purified as described previously (25.Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Porcine heart citrate synthase was purchased from Sigma; it was dialyzed into TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA), concentrated to 4.65 mg/ml, and stored at −20 °C in aliquots. Porcine insulin was from Calbiochem. Aggregation of ΔF-NBD1 was performed as described previously (26.Strickland E. Qu B.-H. Millen L. Thomas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25421-25424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) at 2 μm final protein concentration in Buffer R (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.385 ml-arginine hydrochloride, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)). Aggregation was initiated by rapid dilution from 6 m GdnHCl, while vortexing into a solution of 37 °C Buffer R, and was monitored by the increase in turbidity at 400 nm. 26 S proteasome, PA700, or 20 S proteasome were present at 100 nm prior to the addition of ΔF-NBD1 unless otherwise noted. The 26 S proteasome was assembled in an ATP-dependent reaction from purified 20 S proteasome and PA700 components, as described previously (8.Ma C.-P. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly conditions contained 2-fold molar excess of 20 S proteasome with respect to PA700. Less than 10% of the PA700 was unbound to the proteasome after the assembly reaction. A 2 mm stock solution of porcine insulin was prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Aggregation assays were performed by a modification of previously reported methods (27.Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 28.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C in a final volume of 250 μl containing 45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 4 mm reduced glutathione, 0.4 mm oxidized glutathione, 160 μm insulin, and concentrations of various proteins as indicated for specific experiments. Aggregation was monitored continuously as an increase in turbidity at 650 nm. In independent experiments, the length of the lag phase prior to initial detection of turbidity with insulin alone varied typically from about 300 s to about 1100 s. However, within a given experiment, repetitions varied by less than 10%. All reported results were obtained in at least three to four independent experiments. Thermal aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) was carried out by adding 150 nm(monomer) CS to a solution of 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, heated to 43 °C (29.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Aggregation was followed by light scattering at 500 nm in a PTI fluorometer at right angles with 2 nm excitation and 4 nm emission slit widths. PA700 was present before the addition of CS unless stated otherwise. The reactivation of citrate synthase was monitored in a multi-step assay as described previously (30.Lee G.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the first step, native CS was denatured in 6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature. Reactivation of denatured CS was then initiated by dilution into a reactivation buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl and allowed to continue at room temperature. Experiments containing ATP (2 mm) also included 5 mm MgCl2. The activity of the reactivated CS was then assayed spectrophotometrically according to the method of Srere and Kosicki (31.Srere P.A. Kosicki G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2557-2559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at various time points with freshly prepared oxaloacetic acid and acetyl-CoA. Experiments done at single time points were assayed after a 45-min reactivation. The slope of the initial rate during the linear portion of the progress curve was plotted relative to the activity of mock-treated native CS. During the time course of the activity assay, which is short relative to the time course of reactivation, no further reactivation occurred. To ensure uniformity in initiating the reactivation, denatured CS was added to the reactivation mixture while vortexing. The fraction of citrate synthase that could be reactivated was reproducible within an experiment but varied between 25 and 75% among different citrate synthase preparations. Each experiment was repeated multiple times with consistent results obtained with multiple preparations. To understand better the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the recognition and processing of misfolded proteins, we studied the interaction of the 26 S proteasome with ΔF-NBD1. ΔF-NBD1 is the nucleotide binding domain of CFTR that contains the common cystic fibrosis disease-causing mutation responsible for impaired folding of the full-length CFTR protein (25.Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32.Qu B.H. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. J. Bioenerg.

In refolding experiments, less ΔF-NBD1 reaches the native state than does wild-type NBD1. A certain fraction, instead, forms large aggregates of misfolded, mutant protein (25.Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26.Strickland E. Qu B.-H. Millen L. Thomas P. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 36.Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (37.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 38.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Therefore, ΔF-NBD1 aggregation provides a useful and physiologically relevant in vitro model system for studying interactions of unfolded or misfolded proteins with components of the cellular quality control machinery. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the 26 S proteasome completely inhibited aggregation of ΔF-NBD1. The lack of turbidity observed in the presence of the 26 S proteasome was not due to the degradation of ΔF-NBD1 into small, soluble peptides (data not shown). To determine whether either subcomplex of the 26 S proteasome was sufficient to inhibit aggregation, 20 S proteasome and PA700 were assayed individually for their ability to inhibit the aggregation of ΔF-NBD1. The 20 S proteasome did not affect aggregation, whereas PA700 inhibited aggregation as effectively as the intact 26 S proteasome (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of the 26 S proteasome can be attributed to PA700. To determine whether the ability of PA700 to interact with the non-native conformation of ΔF-NBD1 is a general property, analogous experiments were conducted with two additional proteins whose misfolding can be initiated under different conditions. Insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains, A and B, linked by two disulfide bonds. Upon reduction of the disulfides, the chains separate, and the B chain aggregates (27.Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 28.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, PA700 inhibited this aggregation as effectively as the 26 S proteasome, whereas the 20 S proteasome had no inhibitory effect. To extend further the generality of this effect, we tested the ability of PA700 to inhibit the aggregation of thermally denatured citrate synthase, a protein commonly utilized for studying chaperone activity (29.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30.Lee G.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39.Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Native citrate synthase is a homodimer; when heated to 43 °C, the population of partially folded conformations of citrate synthase increases, leading to aggregation. As with the other tested proteins, citrate synthase aggregation was inhibited by PA700 at low molar ratios (Fig. 3). PA700 increased the lag period of citrate synthase aggregation in a manner similar to its effect on insulin. Together, these data demonstrate that PA700 interacts with non-native forms of a variety of proteins. The ability of PA700 to inhibit aggregation is specific to PA700 and is not a property of either of two related multiprotein proteasome regulator complexes. First, a protein complex, termed “modulator,” consisting of two of the ATPase subunits found in PA700 and a third novel protein not found in PA700, enhances PA700-dependent activation of the proteasome (21.DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A. Song X. Hisamatsu H. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 3112-3118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar) but was not effective at inhibiting the aggregation of insulin (Fig. 2 B). Second, the proteasome activator PA28 (23.Ma C.-P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to associate with the 20 S proteasome, did not inhibit the aggregation of insulin (Fig.2 B). In addition, PA700 that has been heat-treated for 15 min at 75 °C is no longer effective in retarding the aggregation of insulin (data not shown). These data provide further evidence for specificity of the PA700-dependent inhibition of aggregation. The extent of inhibition of insulin aggregation was directly proportional to the concentration of PA700; but surprisingly, inhibition occurred at PA700 concentrations 1000-fold less than those of the substrate insulin. Furthermore, PA700 increased the lag time of insulin aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, simple reduction of the insulin concentration in the absence of PA700 reduced the rate of aggregation but did not have a significant effect on the lag phase in this concentration range (data not shown). These results suggest that PA700 interacts with a subpopulation or with a transient intermediate of misfolding insulin which is particularly prone to aggregation (see “Discussion”). In addition to inhibiting aggregation of misfolding proteins, many molecular chaperones promote refolding of these proteins to native structures. Therefore, we tested the ability of PA700 to promote reactivation of chemically denatured citrate synthase. Native citrate synthase was first denatured with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, and then refolding was initiated by rapid dilution into a nondenaturing buffer. The restoration of native structure was monitored by the recovery of enzymatic activity. Under these conditions, denatured citrate synthase refolds poorly in the absence of chaperones (Fig. 4 and Refs. 29.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30.Lee G.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, and39.Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of PA700, enzymatic activity was recovered in both a time-dependent and PA700 concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 4). These effects were achieved at the same low molar ratios required for inhibition of aggregation. Thus, by inhibiting aggregation of misfolded citrate synthase, PA700 promotes its refolding. Many well characterized molecular chaperones utilize ATP to modulate the rate of substrate turnover as they inhibit aggregation and/or promote refolding (40.Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc.

To determine whether PA700, a known ATPase (16.DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Ma C.-P. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32538-32545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), requires ATP for these activities, we repeated the described assays in the presence and absence of Mg2+ or ATP. Mg2+ or ATP had no significant effect on the ability of PA700 to inhibit the aggregation of ΔF-NBD1, insulin, or citrate synthase (Fig.5, A–C). In addition, neither ADP nor the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS influenced the results. ATP also did not affect the ability of PA700 to reactivate citrate synthase (Fig. 5 E). To confirm this result, PA700 was treated withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which abolishes its ATPase activity (16.DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Ma C.-P. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NEM-treated PA700 effectively inhibited the aggregation of insulin (Fig. 5 D) and promoted the reactivation of citrate synthase (Fig. 5 E). These data indicate that the interaction of PA700 with non-native protein substrates does not depend upon ATP. The substoichiometric PA700:substrate ratios required for inhibition of aggregation and promotion of refolding and the progressively increased delay in onset of aggregation in the presence of PA700 suggest that PA700 interacts with a subpopulation of non-native conformations. To test this possibility further, PA700 was added to either the citrate synthase aggregation assay or reactivation assay after each process had begun. As shown in Fig.6, PA700 remained effective at inhibiting the thermal aggregation of initially folded citrate synthase when added 20 s after the initiation of misfolding. However, PA700 was progressively less effective at inhibiting aggregation when addition was delayed for longer times. These results cannot be explained by simple stoichiometric binding of PA700 because of the large excess of unfolded monomer and, thus, imply that PA700 may act on a species critical for initiation of aggregation. Furthermore, once citrate synthase aggregates were formed, PA700 could not disassemble and solubilize them (data not shown). Likewise, PA700 promoted the reactivation of citrate synthase when present at the start of reactivation, but not when added 2 min later. In sum, these results suggest that PA700 acts on a non-native conformation not yet fully committed to off-pathway aggregation. PA700 is composed of 20 distinct subunits, including six AAA-ATPases (16.DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Ma C.-P. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The functions of the remaining subunits are unknown. To determine which PA700 subunits are responsible for the effects on inhibition of protein aggregation we repeated some of the experiments described above using subcomplexes of PA700 essentially equivalent to the base and lid complexes described for yeast PA700 (24.Glickman M.H.

The bovine base (in a complex with the 20 S proteasome) inhibited aggregation as effectively, if not more effectively, as intact PA700 when compared on a molar basis (Fig.7 A). The base contains all the ATPases of PA700 and two other subunits (data not shown). In contrast, lid, which contains the polyubiquitin chain binding subunit, inhibited aggregation of insulin very poorly (Fig. 7 B). Similar effects of base and lid were observed with inhibition of citrate synthase aggregation (data not shown). These results suggest that the various functions of PA700 described here are localized to the base component of PA700. This work demonstrates that PA700, the regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, recognizes non-native conformations of proteins. PA700 inhibited the aggregation of three misfolding proteins and promoted the refolding of a denatured protein to the native state. These newly discovered functions of PA700 are defining features of molecular chaperones (50.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 51.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 52.Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 53.Clarke A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and, in combination with the previously established function of PA700 in regulating the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, place PA700 in a unique and central position for determining the fate of protein substrates as part of the quality control machinery of the cell. Like known chaperones, PA700 could bind to non-native proteins, thereby inhibiting their aggregation and permitting refolding subsequent to their release (Fig. 8). Alternatively, by inhibiting the competing aggregation reaction, PA700 could promote entry of non-native proteins into the degradation pathway, as has been reported for a known molecular chaperone (54.Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The possible role of PA700 as a molecular chaperone in the cell may be analogous to known chaperone functions played by ClpA and ClpX, the regulatory subcomplexes of prokaryotic ATP-regulated proteases (55.Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In addition, PA700 recently has been shown to play a nonproteolytic role in nucleotide excision repair in yeast, perhaps by exerting a chaperone-like activity that disassembles or structurally rearranges the repair complex (56.Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Several features of the effects of PA700 reported here are atypical of many well characterized molecular chaperones and provide insights regarding their possible physiological significance. PA700 inhibited the aggregation of misfolded proteins at very low PA700:protein substrate ratios, whereas other chaperones normally require near stoichiometric ratios for function. For example, 30–100 times more Hsc70 was required to achieve the same degree of inhibition accomplished by PA700 in the assays reported here (data not shown and Ref. 26.Strickland E. Qu B.-H. Millen L. Thomas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25421-25424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PA700 interacts with a subpopulation of proteins in a conformation prone to aggregation. Thus, to inhibit aggregation effectively, PA700 need not bind each substrate molecule, but only those disposed to off-pathway associations. Additionally, order-of-addition experiments suggest that PA700 likely recognizes a conformation early in the misfolding process. These features are consistent with the observation that PA700 lengthens the lag phase for aggregation of both insulin (Fig. 2 C) and citrate synthase (Fig. 3) in a concentration-dependent manner. The lag phase observed in each of these aggregation processes is likely due to the formation of a specific conformation or nucleus prone to self-association that PA700 may recognize and interact with. Finally, PA700 does not require ATP either to inhibit aggregation or to promote refolding. Many previously characterized molecular chaperones utilize ATP hydrolysis as a timing mechanism to coordinate the rate of substrate binding and release with the rate of substrate folding, rather than utilizing the hydrolytic energy to promote an otherwise unfavorable reaction. Therefore, the current results may indicate that the known ATP requirement for protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome supports energy-dependent unfolding or processive translocation of unfolded substrates to the proteasome active sites by PA700. While this manuscript was in preparation, Braun et al. (57.Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.-M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) reported that the 26 S proteasome inhibited the aggregation and promoted the refolding of citrate synthase, one of the substrates used in the current study. Both of these activities were localized to the base of PA700. Although the results of the two studies are in general agreement, they differ in several important ways. First, much higher protein:substrate ratios were required for the effects reported by Braun et al. (57.Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.-M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) than for those needed here. Second, ATP promoted a small stimulation of inhibition in their experiments. Third, consistent with the low stoichiometry or possibly the dynamic nature of the complex, we were unable to detect significant amounts of association of either insulin or citrate synthase with PA700 during density gradient centrifugation (data not shown). The basis for these differences is unclear but may have significant consequences for interpretation of the mechanisms in which these processes are involved (see below). What are the physiological implications of the current results? Regardless of whether PA700, either alone or as part of the 26 S proteasome, functions independently as a molecular chaperone in the cell, the novel activities described here are directly relevant to its established function in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. For example, PA700 must contain a binding site for non-native protein structures as an essential feature for its role in proteolysis because non-native structures are the products of unfolding reactions and the substrates for translocation reactions that are part of the putative proteolytic mechanism. The potential function of this site for both protein folding and protein degradation is illustrated in the model proposed in Fig. 8. In this model, PA700 may bind to: (i) native ubiquitinated proteins (via recognition of polyubiquitin chains), (ii) non-native nonubiquitinated proteins (via recognition of non-native protein structure), or (iii) non-native ubiquitinated proteins (via recognition of both polyubiquitin chains and non-native protein structure). These multiple recognition and binding modes would allow PA700 to serve a central editing function that determines the final fate of substrates. For example, the known isopeptidase activity of PA700 may promote the removal of polyubiquitin chains from both native and non-native proteins (49.Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Inappropriately ubiquitinated native proteins, thus, could be recovered directly, whereas release of the non-native conformer would be less likely due to interactions with the non-native binding site. Alternatively, PA700 may promote the unfolding of bound native or partially folded, ubiquitinated proteins as a prerequisite for their degradation. This process requires a site for binding the product of the unfolding reaction, and the current data provide strong evidence for the existence of such a site on PA700. Finally, as discussed above, PA700 may contribute directly to the recognition and disposition of non-native nonubiquitinated proteins. Elucidation of the relative affinities and coupling between the polyubiquitin and non-native protein binding sites and isopeptidase active site of PA700, depicted in the thermodynamic cycle shown in Fig.8, will be required for understanding the molecular details of how the 26 S proteasome determines the ultimate fate of protein substrates.

Interestingly, the spatial distribution of HO-1 expression in diseased brain is essentially identical to that of pathological expression of tau. In this study, we explored the relationship between HO-1 and tau, using neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with sense and antisense HO-1 constructs as well as with the vector alone. In transfected cells overexpressing HO-1, the activity of heme oxygenase was increased, and conversely, the level of tau protein was dramatically decreased when compared with antisense HO-1 or CEP transfected cells. The suppression of tau protein expression was almost completely reversed by zinc-deuteroporphyrin, a specific inhibitor of heme oxygenase activity. The activated forms of ERKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) were also decreased in cells overexpressing HO-1 although no changes in the expression of total ERK-1/2 proteins were observed. These data are in agreement with the finding that the expression of tau is regulated through signal cascades including the ERKs, whose activities are modulated by oxidative stresses.

Biliverdin is converted to a potent antioxidant (2.Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar), bilirubin, and carbon monoxide has been implicated to be a physiological regulator of cGMP and vascular tone (3.Verma A.

Hypertension. 1995; 25: 166-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HO system is the rate-limiting step in heme degradation. To date, three HO isoforms (HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3) have been identified that catalyze this reaction. HO-1 is a 32-kDa heat shock protein (1.Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 5.Shibahara S. Muller R.M. Taguchi H. J. Biol.

Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HO-3 is related to HO-2 but is the product of a different gene, and its ability to catalyze heme degradation is much less than that of HO-1 (9.McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Within the brain, the majority of HO activity is attributed to the HO-2 isozyme (8.Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The expression of HO-1 is normally very low in the brain but increases markedly after heat shock, ischemia, or glutathione depletion (8.Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem.

Brain Res. 1994; 666: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the normal rat brain, HO-1 is restricted to select neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations in the forebrain, diencephalon, cerebellum, and brainstem (10.Ewing J.F. Haber S.N. Maines M.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, after heat shock or ischemia, increased HO-1 is seen in neuronal and glial cells throughout the brain (10.Ewing J.F. Haber S.N. Maines M.D. J.

While the long-lived lesions of Alzheimer disease (AD) provide ample opportunity for oxidative modification because of their low rate of turnover (15.Mattson M.P. Carney J.W. Butterfield D.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 481Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the more important issue is when, during the course of AD, oxidative abnormalities actually develop. Recent studies show that the oxidative damage associated with AD is represented by lipid peroxidation (16.Sayre L.M. Zelasko D.A. Harris P.L.R. Perry G. Salomon R.G. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), nitration (17.Smith M.A. Richey P.I. Harris P.L.R. Sayre L.M. Beckman J.S. Perry G. J.

Nature. 1996; 382: 120-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and nucleic acid oxidation (19.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are all increased in vulnerable neurons whether or not they contain neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). NFT are composed of a hyper-phosphorylated form of the tau protein. In fact, an inverse relationship between oxidative damage and NFT was noted in one case (19.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these findings raise the question as to the relationship between tau abnormalities and oxidative stress. We have previously demonstrated that HO-1 is associated with degenerating neurons (20.Smith M.A. Kutty R.K. Richey P.L. Yan S.D. Stern D. Chader G.J. Wiggert B. Petersen R.B. Perry G. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Castellani R. Smith M.A. Richey P.L. Kalaria R. Gambetti P. Perry G.

Brain Res. 1996; 737: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and that specific induction of HO-1, but not HO-2, parallels the regional susceptibility of neuronal degeneration (23.Premkumar D.R.D. Smith M.A. Richey P.L. Petersen R.B. Castellani R. Kutty R.K. Wiggert B. Perry G. Kalaria R.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1399-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, the spatial distribution of HO-1 expression in AD brain is essentially identical to that of the pathogenic conformational changes of tau protein, the major component of the intraneuronal lesion of AD, neurofibrillary tangles (24.Takeda, A., Smith, M. A., Avila, J., Nunomura, A., Siedlak, S. L., Perry, G., and Sayre, L. M. (2000) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that when HO-1 is overexpressed, physiological expression of tau was suppressed and, at the same time, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-cascade was inactivated. This suggests that a change in oxidation state not only induces HO-1 expression but may also play a role in the regulation of the tau gene. The HindIII fragment from pRc/CMV-human HO-1 (25.Abraham N.G. Lavrovsky Y. Schwartzman M.L. Stoltz R.A. Levere R.D. Gerritsen M.E. Shibahara S. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) containing the human heme oxygenase-1 coding sequence was cloned into the episomal vector pCEP-4β (see Fig. 1 A). This places the coding sequence in either a sense or antisense orientation under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene enhancer-promoter. The orientation of positive clones was determined by digestion with SacII. Sense and antisense clones were transfected into the human neuroblastoma cell line M-17, using the cationic lipid DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (26.Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were maintained at 37 °C in Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). For the HO inhibition study, cells were cultured in the same medium with the addition of 5 μm of zinc-deuteroporphyrin (Porphyrin Products) following the transfection. Cells were transferred to serum-free Opti-MEM with or without hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mm). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. Data were obtained from four separate experiments and expressed as the percentage of dead (stained) cells compared with total (stained and unstained) cells. HO activity was measured using a microassay that measures the conversion of [14C]heme to [14C]bilirubin as described previously (27.Laitinen J.T. Juvonen R.O. Brain Res. 1995; 694: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 100 μl of ice-cold KPB (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) containing 50 μm PMSF and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatants (10–15 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 11 μm[14C]heme (specific activity 52 Ci/mol) and 2 mm NADPH. The resultant [14C]bilirubin was extracted into toluene (1 ml), and the radioactivity was determined using a Wallac LKB 1214 Rackbeta with 95.5% counting efficiency. HO activity was expressed as pmol [14C]bilirubin formed/hr/mg of protein. Statistical analyses were using one-way analysis of variance. Cells were lysed in a buffer (lysis buffer B) consisting of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 10 mm EDTA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. Protein from the supernatants was precipitated by adding 5 volumes of methanol, and the resulting pellet was then dissolved in sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for 16 h at 25 V. The membranes were blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and probed with each primary antibody for 16 h at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies, Tau1, to a dephosphorylated epitope of tau, and G7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), to a phosphorylated epitope of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1/2 (JNK-1/2), rabbit antisera to HO-1, HO-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK-1), ERK-2, ERK-1/2 (StressGen), or ferritin (Dako), and affinity purified antisera specific to phosphorylated (activated) ERKs (Promega). Prior to the incubation with Tau1, the membrane was treated with 10 units/ml alkaline phosphatase (P5931; Sigma) in 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 2 h. After 1 h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the membranes were extensively washed in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and visualized on x-ray film after reaction with chemiluminescent reagent (Renaissance; NEN Life Science Products). Quantification of the results was performed using a computer-assisted scanning system (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). The data obtained were expressed as optical densities and analyzed statistically using one-way analysis of variance. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Ultraspec RNA (Biotecx), size separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus Membranes; NEN Life Science Products) and hybridized with G6PDH (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) or HO-1 cRNA labeled with [32P]cytidine triphosphate. For RT-PCR experiments, cDNAs were prepared with random hexamers (First-strand cDNA synthesis kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as templates for subsequent PCR. For HO-1 and HO-2 cDNA amplification, primers and PCR procedures were as described previously (28.Kutty R.K. Kutty G. Nagineni C.N. Hooks J.J. Chader G.J. Wiggert B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 738: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For tau cDNA amplification, samples were heated at 94 °C for 2 min and then subjected to thermocycling (18 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C), using the specific primers 5′-CGCCAGGAGTTCGAAGTGATG-3′ and 5′-TGTCATCGCTTCCAGTCCCGTC-3′. The PCR products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and visualized with UV light after ethidium bromide staining. Human neuroblastoma cells, M-17, were transfected with a full-length human HO-1 cDNA subcloned into a mammalian expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 1 A) (26.Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transfected cells expressed high levels of HO-1 mRNA (Fig. 1 B) and protein (Fig. 3). The HO activity of cells transfected with sense HO-1 cDNA was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than mock (CEP) transfected cells (Fig. 1 C), while cells transfected with the antisense clone were not significantly different from CEP-transfected cells with respect to HO activity (Fig. 1 C). There were no obvious differences in the growth rate or morphology in any of the transfected cells. To test whether overexpression of HO-1 could protect the cells from oxidative insult, the transfected cells were exposed to 0.3 mm H2O2 in serum-free Opti-MEM for 24 h. The HO-1 overexpressing cells showed a significantly higher survival rate compared with the CEP transfected control cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, there was a significant difference in cell survival between HO-1 overexpression and controls even under the basal experimental conditions without H2O2 exposure (Fig. 2).Figure 2Changes in cell viabilities induced by oxidative stress. HO-1 overexpression significantly improved cell viability in serum-free media with or without the addition of hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mm). *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore a possible relationship between HO-1 expression and cytoskeletal abnormalities, we compared tau protein expression in normal cells or cells overexpressing HO-1. In untransfected M-17 cells (data not shown) and CEP transfected cells (Fig. 3), the monoclonal antibody Tau1 recognized presumptive tau protein around 50 kDa. In the cells overexpressing HO-1, the expression of tau protein was dramatically suppressed (Fig. 3). The suppression of tau protein was partially alleviated by the addition of zinc-deuteroporphyrin, an HO inhibitor, to the medium (Fig. 3). The antisense-transfected cells showed no obvious change in tau expression (Fig. 3). The addition of HO inhibitor did not affect the HO-1 protein level nor were there any apparent changes in HO-2 and ferritin expression (Fig. 3). RT-PCR experiments demonstrated decreased expression of tau transcripts in HO-1 transfected cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the antisense HO-1 cells, a comparable amount of tau transcript to that of untransfected or CEP transfected cells was detected (Fig.4). In immunoblots, rabbit antisera specific for activated (dually phosphorylated) ERK-1/2 recognized two bands, the size of which were consistent with those of ERK-1 (p44 in Fig. 5, A and B) and ERK-2 (p42 in Fig. 5, A and B). Reprobing of the same membrane with anti-ERK-1 or anti-ERK-2 serum revealed that each band could be specifically recognized, respectively (data not shown). The expression of the activated form of ERK-1 was decreased in HO-1 transfected cells; however, with the addition of an HO-inhibitor, activated ERK-1 was increased over basal levels when compared with CEP and antisense transfected cells (p44 in Fig. 5 A). The changes in expression of activated ERK-2 showed a similar pattern (p42 in Fig. 5 A). The amount of total (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) ERK-1/2 protein was unchanged among these cells (Fig.5 B). In contrast, no changes were observed in JNK-1/2 expression or activation (p46 and p54 in Fig. 5 C). The quantification of each band revealed that expression changes in the activated form of ERK-1 were statistically significant (p < 0.05) both in sense HO-1 cells and in HO-1 cells with an HO-1 inhibitor (Fig. 5 D). In the present study, we successfully transfected sense- and antisense-human HO-1 cDNA into human neuroblastoma cells using an episomal vector. The transfection of the DNA constructs did not affect the morphology or growth rate of the cells. Cells transfected with the sense HO-1 cDNA exhibited a severalfold induction of HO-1 transcripts (Fig. 1 B) and protein (Fig. 3), which was mirrored in a more than 3-fold increase in HO activity (Fig.1 C). Overexpression of the HO-1 gene considerably enhanced resistance of the cells to oxidative injury produced by H2O2, which is consistent with previous reports showing that HO-1 overexpression is cytoprotective in non-neuronal cells (25.Abraham N.G. Lavrovsky Y. Schwartzman M.L. Stoltz R.A. Levere R.D. Gerritsen M.E. Shibahara S. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 29.Lee P.J. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Choi A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10393-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although heme catabolism mediated by HO-1 produces a potential pro-oxidant, iron, the present data suggest that HO-1 protects neuronal cells as well from oxidative stresses. The increased iron released from heme catabolism has been thought to induce expression of ferritin, which sequesters excess iron and may protect cells against oxidative stresses (30.Vile G.F. Tyrrell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14678-14681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, our data clearly show that overexpression of HO-1 does not affect ferritin expression. On the other hand, in the antisense transfected cells, there was residual HO activity below the basal level that is probably because of the expression of intrinsic HO-2. In fact, HO-2 expression was not affected by transfection of the present series of cDNA constructs (Fig.3). One notable effect of HO-1 overexpression was that expression of tau protein was specifically suppressed. This suppression was partially alleviated by treatment with an HO inhibitor, suggesting that the regulation of tau expression might depend on HO activity. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein and is expressed predominantly in neurons and neuron-derived cells (31.Johnson G.V.W. Jenkins S.M. Alzheimer's Dis. Rev. 1996; 1: 38-54Google Scholar). The detailed regulatory mechanism for tau gene expression is still unknown, but recently, ERKs, which are prominent members of the MAPK family, were shown to induce tau promoter activity (32.Sadot E. Jaaro H. Seger R. Ginzburg I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our study, HO-1 overexpression decreased the phosphorylated (activated) forms of ERK-1 and ERK-2, which is consistent with the observed suppression of tau expression. When the HO inhibitor was added, the phosphorylated form of ERK-1 increased over the control levels, suggesting that ERK-1 activation was down-regulated by the increased HO activity and that the HO inhibitor suppressed not only the overexpressed HO-1 activity but also the intrinsic HO-2 activity. Although the level of the activated form of ERK-1 was increased and that of ERK-2 was restored to control levels by the addition of HO inhibitor, only partial recovery of tau protein expression was observed. This suggests that tau gene expression is not directly controlled by ERK cascades. In fact, tau has been classified as a “late gene” and the effect of MAPK cascades on its expression is thought to be indirect and mediated by additional downstream transcription factors (32.Sadot E. Jaaro H. Seger R. Ginzburg I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, changes in cell growth and morphology were not observed in HO-1 overexpressing cells even though tau protein expression was suppressed. This implies that other molecules can substitute for the tau protein, which has also been suggested in previous reports using a cell culture model (33.Xie H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in knockout mice (34.Harada A. Oguchi K. Okabe S. Kuno J. Terada S. Ohshima T. Sato-Yoshitake R. Takei Y. Noda T. Hirokawa N. Nature. 1994; 369: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). ERK-1 (p44) and ERK-2 (p42) are major components of the ERK family and are believed to be functionally redundant. They play a pivotal role in stress signaling and are activated in cells exposed to environmental stresses, such as UV irradiation and H2O2 (35.Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). HO-1 is also a stress-inducible protein, and its product, bilirubin, is a potential antioxidant. The data, demonstrating the increase in survival of HO-1 overexpressing cells under normal conditions (Fig. 2), imply that there is a basal level of oxidative stress to cells in culture. This finding is also in good agreement with the results showing a basal level of activation of ERKs in control cells. The HO-1 overexpressing cells showed increased resistance to H2O2 exposure, suggesting that HO-1 can potentiate the ability of the cell to withstand such oxidative stresses. By its ability to reduce stress, activation of the ERKs may be suppressed by HO-1 overexpression. Alternatively, carbon monoxide, which is another product of HO-1-mediated heme catabolism, may play a role in ERK inactivation. Carbon monoxide is a potential signaling molecule that functions by activating guanyl cyclase (3.Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Elevation of cGMP was shown to block the activation of MAPK cascades (36.Yu S.M. Hung L.M. Lin C.C. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and therefore, carbon monoxide may also be a suppressor of ERK activation. In AD brain, the expression of HO-1 is closely associated with pathological changes in the tau protein (24.Takeda, A., Smith, M. A., Avila, J., Nunomura, A., Siedlak, S. L., Perry, G., and Sayre, L. M. (2000) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar), suggesting that there is a common underlying mechanism mediating tau pathology and HO-1 expression. Recently, widespread distribution of the activated form of ERKs was demonstrated in vulnerable neurons in AD brain that preceded the accumulation of phosphorylated tau (37.Perry G. Roder H. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Friedlich A. Zhu X. Raina A.K. Holbrook N. Siedlak S.L. Harris P.L.R. Smith M.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, in the AD brain, ERKs may play pivotal roles in tau gene regulation and phosphorylation. ERKs also up-regulate HO-1 gene expression (38.Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Bonkovsky H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8922-8931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and nearly all vulnerable neurons that exhibit induction of the HO-1 gene show ERK activation. 2A. Takeda and M. A. Smith, unpublished observation. In each cell, tau protein is located not only in the cytosol but also in the nucleus and nucleolus (31.Johnson G.V.W. Jenkins S.M. Alzheimer's Dis. Rev. 1996; 1: 38-54Google Scholar), and its expression is inducible by neurotoxins such as glutamate (39.Esclaire F. Lesort M. Blanchard C. Hugon J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or MPTP (40.Song X. Ehrich M. Neurotoxicology. 1998; 19: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar), whose toxicities are mediated by oxidative stress. Thus, it is plausible that tau has additional functions beyond its well known role in the dynamics of microtubules. We hypothesize that the co-localization of HO-1 and the pathological form of the tau protein may be protective responses against oxidative stress in neuronal cells (41.Lesort M. Blanchard C. Yardin C. Esclaire F. Hugon J. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which may be mediated through ERK cascades. In fact, neurons that express phosphorylated tau are more resistant to cell death (41.Lesort M. Blanchard C. Yardin C. Esclaire F. Hugon J. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) supporting this hypothesis. Further studies on the tau/HO-1 relationship will be required before a comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative processes involving cytoskeletal abnormalities is achieved."

To perform these functions, an array of diffusible radicals and reactive oxidant species may be formed through oxidation reactions catalyzed at the heme center of the enzyme. Myeloperoxidase and inducible nitric-oxide synthase are both stored in and secreted from the primary granules of activated leukocytes, and nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide; NO) reacts with the iron center of hemeproteins at near diffusion-controlled rates. We now demonstrate that NO modulates the catalytic activity of MPO through distinct mechanisms. NO binds to both ferric (Fe(III), the catalytically active species) and ferrous (Fe(II)) forms of MPO, generating stable low-spin six-coordinate complexes, MPO-Fe(III)·NO and MPO-Fe(II)·NO, respectively. These nitrosyl complexes were spectrally distinguishable by their Soret absorbance peak and visible spectra. Stopped-flow kinetic analyses indicated that NO binds reversibly to both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms of MPO through simple one-step mechanisms. The association rate constant for NO binding to MPO-Fe(III) was comparable to that observed with other hemoproteins whose activities are thought to be modulated by NO in vivo. In stark contrast, the association rate constant for NO binding to the reduced form of MPO, MPO-Fe(II), was over an order of magnitude slower. Similarly, a 2-fold decrease was observed in the NO dissociation rate constant of the reducedversus native form of MPO. The lower NO association and dissociation rates observed suggest a remarkable conformational change that alters the affinity and accessibility of NO to the distal heme pocket of the enzyme following heme reduction. Incubation of NO with the active species of MPO (Fe(III) form) influenced peroxidase catalytic activity by dual mechanisms. Low levels of NO enhanced peroxidase activity through an effect on the rate-limiting step in catalysis, reduction of Compound II to the ground-state Fe(III) form. In contrast, higher levels of NO inhibited MPO catalysis through formation of the nitrosyl complex MPO-Fe(III)-NO. NO interaction with MPO may thus serve as a novel mechanism for modulating peroxidase catalytic activity, influencing the regulation of local inflammatory and infectious events in vivo.

Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Functions and Clinical Disorders. Elsevier Science Publisher B. V., Amsterdam1978: 1-810Google Scholar). This hemeprotein is stored in granules and secreted from leukocytes following activation into the extracellular space and phagolysosomal compartment. MPO uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated during a respiratory burst to form cytotoxic oxidants and diffusible radical species (2.Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3822) Google Scholar, 3.Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol.

For example, MPO preferentially catalyzes the 2-electron oxidation of halides (Cl−, Br−, and I−) and pseudo-halides (SCN−), generating their respective hypohalous acids (6.Agner K. Akeson A. Ehrenberg A. Structure and Function of Oxidation-Reduction Enzymes. Pergamon Press, Terrytown, NY1972: 329-335Google Scholar, 7.Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol.

MPO also oxidizes multiple organic substrates, forming free radical intermediates by the classical peroxidase cycle (10.Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidase in Chemistry and Biology. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar). Reactive intermediates generated by the MPO/H2O2 system possess potent microbicidal and viricidal activities and are thought to play an essential role in normal leukocyte function. Recent studies with mice containing targeted gene disruption for MPO demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to fungal and yeast infections (11.Aratani Y. Koyama H. Nyui S.-i. Suzuki K. Kura F. Maeda N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and similar defects in immune responses have been reported in humans with MPO deficiency (12.Nauseef W.M. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the beneficial functions of MPO come at a price: the oxidants derived from MPO also have the capacity to damage host tissues. Indeed, MPO has been linked to oxidative damage and inflammatory tissue injury in a variety of disorders (1.Klebanoff S.J. Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Functions and Clinical Disorders.

Despite the central role MPO plays in host defense mechanisms as well as its potential role in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders, little is known about the factors that influence MPO catalytic activityin vivo.MPO is a highly cationic and glycosylated hemeprotein composed of two identical subunits joined by a single disulfide bridge (18.Nauseef W.M. Malech H.L. Blood. 1986; 67: 1504-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit is made up of a light chain and a heavy chain derived from a single gene product (19.Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. McCormick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9546-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The heavy chain contains an iron bound by a novel protoporphyrin IX derivative (20.Dugad L.B. La Mar G.N. Lee H.C. Ikeda-Saito M. Booth K.S. Caughey W.S. J. Biol.

The heme prosthetic groups are ∼50 Å apart, appear functionally identical, and presumably operate independently in the oxidation of Cl− and in the enzyme's bactericidal activity (22.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity appears to be primarily regulated by the availability of peroxide and substrates (10.Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidase in Chemistry and Biology. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar), although interaction with either superoxide or organic reductants can promote formation of inactive forms of the enzyme (Compound III and MPO-Fe(II), respectively) (23.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar).Nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide; NO) is a ubiquitous signaling molecule involved in the regulation of many processes, including activities of the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems (24.Ignarro L.J.

(Oxf.). 1994; 42: 129-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). NO is generated from l-arginine in an NADPH- and O2-dependent stepwise reaction that is catalyzed by various isoforms of NO synthase (28.Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NO is a relatively long-lived free radical and does not directly nitrate or oxidize lipid and protein targets at neutral pH; however, a variety of reactive nitrogen species derived from NO are potent oxidants and, like MPO-generated oxidants, are thought to contribute to both host defenses and inflammatory tissue injury (29.Nathan C.

Many of the biological actions of NO are thought to result from its facile reaction with heme or iron-sulfur centers of effector proteins (31.Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S.

Carpenter A. Springall D.P. Polak J.M. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9553-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). During leukocyte activation such as during phagocytic ingestion of bacteria, MPO and NO synthase are secreted into the phagolysosome and extracellular space, and nitration of bacterial proteins is observed (39.Evans T.J. Buttery L.D.K. Carpenter A. Springall D.P. Polak J.M. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9553-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that MPO functions in biological environments replete with NO, the potential interaction between NO and the distal heme moiety of MPO has not yet been explored. We now show that NO binds rapidly to both ferric (Fe(III)) and ferrous (Fe(II)) forms of MPO, forming stable six-coordinate nitrosyl complexes. We used both direct spectroscopic and rapid kinetic methods to show that NO binding to MPO is reversible and associated with biphasic modulation of classical peroxidase catalytic activity. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike other hemeproteins thus far described, the reduced form of MPO, MPO-Fe(II), binds to NO over an order of magnitude slower compared with the Fe(III) form, suggesting that collapse of the heme pocket occurs with reduction, rendering the distal iron center inaccessible to NO.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study demonstrate for the first time that NO binds to the heme moiety of MPO and modulates peroxidase catalytic activity. Using both direct spectroscopic and rapid kinetic measurements, NO was shown to bind to both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms of MPO, consistent with formation of the corresponding stable low-spin six-coordinate Fe(III)·NO and Fe(II)·NO complexes. Stopped-flow analyses demonstrated that the binding of NO to either MPO-Fe(III) or MPO-Fe(II) followed a simple reversible single-step mechanism.A kinetic model for MPO catalysis that incorporates our current findings is presented in Fig. 4. This working model consists of three major pathways: Pathway A, the classical peroxidase cycle; Pathway B, the reaction of MPO heme with oxygen species; and Pathway C, the binding of NO to both MPO-Fe(III) and MPO-Fe(II). In Pathway A, MPO-Fe(III) reacts in a rapid and reversible manner with H2O2 to form Compound I ((I)), a 2-electron oxidized intermediate possessing a Fe(IV)=O group and a resonance-stabilized porphyrin π cation radical. This redox intermediate has a reduction potential of approximately −1.1 V (10.Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidase in Chemistry and Biology. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar), enabling it to oxidize halides via a single 2-electron oxidation step to their respective hypohalous acids (47.Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Compound I may oxidize multiple substrates through two sequential 1-electron steps, forming Compound II ((II)) and ground-state MPO-Fe(III), respectively. In Pathway B, MPO-Fe(III) can by reduced by a variety of species, generating an inactive intermediate, MPO-Fe(II) (23.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

MPO-Fe(III) and MPO-Fe(II) bind to O⨪2 and O2, respectively, to form another intermediate, Compound III ((III), MPO-Fe(II)·O2) (Fig. 4, Pathway B) (48.Kettle A.J. Sangster D.F Gebicki J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Addition of H2O2 to Compound III results in spectral changes consistent with formation of Compound II (49.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whether this occurs directly or via MPO-Fe(III) as an intermediate has not been established. The net results, however, are that Compound III may still promote 1-electron peroxidation reactions (Fig. 4). In Pathway C, both MPO-Fe(III) and MPO-Fe(II) reversibly bind to NO to form dead-end Fe(III)·NO and Fe(II)·NO complexes, respectively.The results of this study also demonstrate for the first time that NO influences the catalytic activity of a leukocyte peroxidase. At biologically relevant levels of H2O2 (10 μm final concentration), NO served to modulate MPO peroxidase activity in a concentration-dependent fashion by at least two distinct mechanisms. First, low levels of NO enhanced peroxidation of substrate. Stopped-flow kinetic studies suggested that the mechanism was by accelerating the rate-limiting step in catalysis: reduction of Compound II to MPO-Fe(III). Thus, one mechanism through which NO might influence MPO activity in vivo is by minimizing the accumulation of Compound II during steady-state catalysis. Enhancement of peroxidase catalysis due to reduction of MPO Compound II to MPO-Fe(III) has been noted with other physiological reductants such as superoxide (49.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and ascorbic acid (50.Bolscher G.J.M.B. Zoutberrg G.R. Cuperus R.A. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and reduction of heme groups by NO is well documented (51.Sharma V.S. Isaacson R.A. John M.E. Waterman M.R. Chevion M Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3897-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, the activating effect of NO on MPO catalysis was minimized at high levels of H2O2, conditions that favor accumulation of Compound II (10.Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidase in Chemistry and Biology. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar, 23.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Second, exposure of MPO to higher NO levels readily promoted reversible inhibition of peroxidase activity, presumably through formation of the six-coordinate nitrosyl complex MPO-Fe(III)·NO. Ligation of NO to the distal heme would prevent access of H2O2 to the catalytic site of the enzyme. As depicted in Fig. 4, the effect of NO on MPO-Fe(III) peroxidase activity will depend on multiple factors, including the concentration of NO versusH2O2, the affinity of MPO-Fe(III) heme for NOversus H2O2, the rate of MPO-Fe(III)·NO breakdown, and the availability of O⨪2. MPO in neutrophils and monocytes performs its biological functions in a large variety of environments with dynamic NO production rates, availability of reducing agents, and concentrations of reduced oxygen species (O⨪2 and H2O2). NO-dependent modulation of MPO activity in vivowill therefore be complex.The Soret and visible regions of the absorbance spectrum of MPO are sensitive to microscopic changes in the heme pocket upon ligand binding. For example, significant shifts are observed in both the Soret and visible regions of MPO-Fe(III) and MPO-Fe(II) upon iron binding to ligands such as CN−, N3−, NH2OH, and O2 (42.Odajima T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 206: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 52.Agner K. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1941; 2: 8Google Scholar, 53.Newton N. Morell D.B. Clarke L.

We observed that NO binding to MPO-Fe(III) was accompanied by a modest shift in the Soret absorbance peak (Table I) and a significant increase in bands in the visible region of the spectrum (Fig. 1 A). Comparable Soret absorbance optima and visible band changes have been reported for low-spin six-coordinate Fe(III)·NO complexes of other hemeproteins (38.Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these results contrast with the effect of halides such as Cl−, a preferred substrate, on the Soret and visible regions of the absorbance spectrum of MPO-Fe(III), where only nominal changes were noted (53.Newton N. Morell D.B. Clarke L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 96: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported for the native enzyme that Cl− binds directly to the heme iron, EPR studies of the interactions between halides and the cyanide complex of MPO-Fe(III) suggest that Cl− binds to an amino acid in the immediate vicinity of the iron center, rather than to the iron directly (61.Lee H.C. Booth K.S. Caughey W.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The observed alterations in the absorbance spectra of the nitrosyl complexes of MPO suggest that significant structural perturbations are likely to occur in the distal heme pocket upon NO binding.One of the more remarkable findings in this study is the dramatic decreased rate of NO binding and the large red shift observed in the Soret spectrum of MPO-Fe(II) versus MPO-Fe(III). This contrasts significantly with the data reported for other hemeproteins, where NO binding to Fe(II) forms was typically similar to or faster than that observed with Fe(III), and only modest (<10 nm) shifts in Soret absorbance optima were noted upon reduction of the heme (57.Sharma V.S. Traylor T.G. Gardiner R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 60.Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh K.D. Stuehr D.J.

A simple mechanism that could account for these results would be that upon reduction, MPO-Fe(III) undergoes a significant conformational change that alters the accessibility of NO to the distal heme pocket of the enzyme. Consistent with this hypothesis, the off-rate for NO binding to MPO-Fe(II)·NO was also significantly lower than that observed for MPO-Fe(III)·NO (Table I). Structural studies have demonstrated that the heme of MPO lies at the base of a deep and narrow pocket (22.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 63.Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10967-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Substrate binding to the sixth coordinate position on the distal heme group is limited by the close proximity of surrounding amino acids (22.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 61.Lee H.C. Booth K.S. Caughey W.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochim. Biophys.

The x-ray crystal structure of MPO-Fe(III) reveals that the imidazole ring of His95 is located only 5.7 Å from the heme iron (22.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 63.Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10967-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The guanidinium group of Arg239 and the side chain of Gln91 also lie close to the heme surface with minimum interatomic distances of 7.0 and 4.5 Å, respectively, to the iron atom (22.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 63.Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10967-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At ground state, none of these side chains appears to be directly coordinate to the heme iron of MPO-Fe(III); instead, a loosely bound water molecule forms a high-spin six-coordinate complex (22.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 63.Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10967-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A conformational change associated with heme reduction that causes narrowing or collapse in the heme pocket might therefore convert the catalytic site of MPO to one with limited access to ligands even as small as NO. Another possibility is that reduction of MPO-Fe(III) to MPO-Fe(II) converts the heme from a high-spin to a low-spin six-coordinate complex by increasing the affinity for the sixth ligand or by replacement of H2O with one of the amino acids located above the heme moiety. The slow rate of NO binding to MPO-Fe(II) observed would then result from ligand replacement (NO for the axial sixth position). Changes in heme pocket geometry upon ligand binding (e.g. movement of a number of amino acid residues and a rearrangement of active-site water molecules) have been described for cytochrome c peroxidase (64.Edwards S.L. Kraut J. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and slower rates of NO binding to the Fe(III) forms of a number of hemeproteins have been attributed to ligand replacement (60.Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh K.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 65.Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S.

To enable utilization of this phosphatase for numerous substrates in different pathways, PP2A is regulated at multiple levels, including covalent modifications, interaction with inhibitory proteins and lipids, and association with the various B-type subunits. For example, B′ subunits were recently shown to target PP2A to the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor scaffolding protein, physically associating PP2A with specific substrates and thus regulating Wnt-β-catenin signaling (10.Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). PP2A has also been shown to form complexes with CaM-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) (11.Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PP2A in Ca2+-dependent signaling. This possibility is further supported by patch clamp experiments with both neuronal (12.Tian L. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. J. Biol.

To better understand how PP2A is targeted to various microenvironments and signal transduction pathways within the cell, we have looked for additional PP2A targeting subunits. Here we report the identification of two PP2A-associated proteins that may represent a novel family of B-type subunits. These two proteins contain WD40 repeats and bind to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner. One member of this family, striatin, is localized to the post-synaptic densities of neuronal dendrites (15.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F.

Striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes contain several additional unidentified proteins, suggesting that striatin and SG2NA may function as scaffolding proteins involved in Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with IP wash buffer (0.135m NaCl, 1% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and then were lysed in 1 ml of IP lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.135m NaCl, 1% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.03 units/ml aprotinin, and 1–2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) while rocking for 20 min at 4 °C.

Immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation for 1 min at 700 × g, and the supernatants were removed.

Control immunopurifications were performed with 7-34-1 mAb chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose using five 15-cm dishes of cells. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Bio-Rad). Specific spots at 93 and 110 kDa were subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The ion trap was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of full scan MS over alternating ranges of 395–800m/z or 800–1300 m/z, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in those full scans. These data-dependent scans allowed: 1) the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass and 2) MS/MS spectra for peptide sequence information. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30%, an isolation width of 2.5 daltons, and dynamic exclusion of ions from repeat analysis. Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of the peptides was facilitated by programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility and by data base correlation with the algorithm SEQUEST (19.Chittum H.S.

Calmodulin-Sepharose precipitations were performed as for immunoprecipitations described above, except that complexes from ionomycin-treated cells were washed in IP lysis buffer with 2 mm CaCl2 and TNC, and those from untreated cells were washed in IP lysis buffer with 1 mm EGTA and TNE. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium for NIH3T3 cells stably expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged B subunit2 was supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin. In the case of the GREonly, 36wt, 301Stop, and T304A cell lines (22.Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin and 25 μg/ml geneticin. In an effort to discover previously unknown members of the B′ family of PP2A subunits, a pan-B′ subunit antibody termed AR-1 was generated against a sequence highly conserved in all known B′ subunits (Figs. 1 Aand 2 A). AR-1 recognized known B′ subunits that migrated at 56 and 74 kDa, as well as three unknown proteins that migrated at 93, 110, and 131 kDa (Fig. 1 A). In a parallel attempt to identify PP2A-associated proteins, PP2A immunoprecipitations were prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled NIH3T3 cells using a monoclonal antibody (1d6) directed against the carboxyl terminus of the PP2A C subunit. Several specific spots were observed on 2D gels, including two at 93 and 110 kDa (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the 93- and 110-kDa proteins in 1d6 immunoprecipitates were the same proteins detected in AR-1 immunoblots of whole cell lysates (Fig.1 A), 1d6 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with AR-1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2). The two proteins that migrated at 93 and 110 kDa were specifically recognized by the AR-1 antisera, suggesting that they might be novel B′-type subunits.Figure 2Sequence alignments showing potential interaction motif between A/C heterodimer and B′ subunits or striatin and SG2NA.

D, AR-1 immunoprecipitates immunoblotted with striatin and SG2NA antisera. AR-1 immunoprecipitations (lanes 2–5) were carried out in 20% Triton either with no peptide added or preincubated with 100 μg/ml of the STR277, RDM277, or AR-1 peptides, respectively. Each setof lanes is from the same gel, but the lanes were not all originally adjacent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the 110-kDa protein, a large scale direct immunoprecipitation using the AR-1 antisera was subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis, and peptide sequences were obtained by ion trap mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 D). These sequences corresponded to a previously cloned gene of unknown function, striatin, which was originally purified from rat brain (15.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Striatin has been reported to bind CaM with a 40 nm K D in a calcium-dependent manner at a half-maximal Ca2+concentration of 0.5 μm (23.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, striatin contains two polybasic domains that may facilitate association with the post-synaptic membrane (15.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling has shown that striatin is excluded from neuronal axons but is found throughout dendrites and is abundant in the post-synaptic densities of neuronal dendritic spines (15.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data suggest that striatin targets PP2A to a cellular microenvironment in which it may play a role in the modulation of calcium-dependent neuronal signaling. Although striatin was originally described as a brain-specific protein, we have observed striatin protein in murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human Jurkat T lymphocytes. We have also detected striatin mRNA in human HeLa cervical cancer cells, and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found in the dBEST data base that represent partial striatin cDNAs from human B lymphocytes, human heart, murine myotubules, and murine testis (data not shown). Thus, striatin is present in both dividing and non-dividing cells and is much more widely expressed than previously thought. To identify the 93-kDa protein and obtain further peptide sequence from the 110-kDa protein, large scale PP2A (1d6) immunoprecipitations were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometric sequencing revealed multiple additional peptides from striatin for the 110-kDa protein and identified the 93-kDa protein to be a highly related protein, S/G2 nuclear autoantigen (SG2NA) (Fig.1 D). Little is known about SG2NA other than that it is localized to the nucleus, it contains WD40 repeats, and as assayed by immunofluorescence, its expression appears to be cell cycle-regulated, peaking during the S and G2 phases (16.Muro Y. Chan E.K. Landberg G. Tan E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Striatin and SG2NA bear little homology to the B, B′, or B′′ subunits, raising the possibility that they might comprise a new family of PP2A B-type subunits. At least one homolog of striatin and SG2NA exists inCaenorhabditis elegans (GenBankTM accession no. CAA94873) (24.Wilson R Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), suggesting that this form of PP2A may play an important role in all metazoans. Although there is no obvious homolog for either of these proteins in yeast, potential WD40-containing open reading frames of unknown function with some homology to striatin and SG2NA do exist in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae, (GenBankTM accession no. CAA89144) andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (GenBankTMaccession no. CAA21906). Because striatin and SG2NA showed no obvious homology to PP2A B′ subunits, it was puzzling that they were recognized efficiently by the pan-B′ antiserum, AR-1. However, a careful comparison revealed that, whereas neither striatin nor SG2NA contains the precise consensus sequence used to generate the AR-1 antisera, they both contain sequences that share some homology with this motif at positions corresponding to striatin 277–294 and 551–566 (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether the AR-1 antisera recognized either or both of these sequences, two peptides were synthesized corresponding to these two sequences as well as two control peptides corresponding to randomized sequences containing the same amino acids. A dot blot (Fig.2 C) demonstrated that the AR-1 antisera recognizes the STR277 peptide corresponding to striatin 277–294 but not the striatin 551–566 peptide or the control peptides. The STR277 peptide was also tested to determine whether it could block immunoprecipitations with the AR-1 antisera (Fig. 2 D). As expected, both the STR277 peptide and the AR-1 peptide used to generate the AR-1 antisera were effective at blocking immunoprecipitation of both striatin and SG2NA, whereas the randomized control peptide did not block AR-1 immunoprecipitations. The conservation of the sequence (D/E)X 2D(S/T)X(D/E)X 1–2(R/K)EX(D/E)(F/Y)LXT between most B′ subunits and striatin and SG2NA suggests that it may be involved in interactions between these proteins and the A/C heterodimer. Consistent with this hypothesis, AR-1 was able to immunoprecipitate striatin and SG2NA only in the presence of 20% Triton. Under these conditions, little or none of the PP2A A and C subunits are co-immunoprecipitated (data not shown), suggesting that 20% Triton may have dissociated striatin and SG2NA from the A/C heterodimer, revealing the AR-1-specific epitope. To facilitate the investigation of striatin and SG2NA interactions with the A/C heterodimer, polyclonal antisera were raised to both proteins. The striatin antiserum was raised against a peptide antigen corresponding to amino acids 373–387 of human striatin. This sequence is located within a basic domain that may be important for striatin association with the cellular membrane (15.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although this region is 100% identical between mouse and human striatin, it is not found in SG2NA (Fig. 1 D). The SG2NA antisera was raised against a peptide antigen corresponding to amino acids 227–243 of human SG2NA in a region that has little homology with striatin sequences. 1d6 immunoprecipitations of PP2A were probed with the anti-striatin and anti-SG2NA antisera, confirming that these antisera recognize the 110- and 93-kDa proteins, respectively (Fig. 1 C). To confirm that striatin and SG2NA form stable complexes with PP2A, striatin and SG2NA complexes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-striatin and anti-SG2NA antisera, respectively, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with a commercially obtained mAb to PP2A C subunit (Fig. 3 A). The C subunit was present in immunoprecipitations of both striatin and SG2NA but not in immunoprecipitations using preimmune sera from the same rabbits. The presence of A subunit was similarly detected (Fig.3 A). Several lines of evidence support the observation that no other B-type subunits were present in striatin-A/C or SG2NA-A/C complexes. First, 2D analysis of striatin and SG2NA immune complexes labeled with [35S]methionine or stained with Coomassie Blue showed no spots that corresponded to the known migration positions of the B, B′, or B′′ subunits (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Second, it has previously been shown (22.Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that the 1d6 mAb used to precipitate the striatin-A/C or SG2NA-A/C complexes does not immunoprecipitate any B subunit. Third, immunoblots of striatin and SG2NA immune complexes with the AR-1 antisera do not detect any other B′ subunits (Fig. 1 C). Finally, immunoblots of NIH3T3 whole cell lysates did not detect the presence of any B′′ subunits (data not shown). Because striatin previously has been shown (23.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to bind to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner in a region (amino acids 149–166) that is nearly identical with SG2NA, we hypothesized that SG2NA would also bind to CaM. Both striatin (data not shown) and SG2NA (Fig. 4 A) were precipitated with CaM-Sepharose from NIH3T3 cells stimulated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin but not from untreated control cells, as expected. This is the first evidence that SG2NA binds to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner similar to striatin. However, immunoblots of striatin and SG2NA immunoprecipitations probed with anti-CaM antibodies failed to detect CaM in both treated and untreated cells (data not shown). One hypothesis for the failure to detect CaM in immunoblots of striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes is that the immunoprecipitating antibodies to striatin and SG2NA may sterically interfere with CaM binding. To test whether immunoprecipitated striatin/PP2A and SG2NA/PP2A complexes contained enzymatically active PP2A, phosphatase assays were performed using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as a substrate, and sensitivity to the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid was measured. Immunoprecipitations using antisera to striatin, SG2NA, and C subunit (4e1) all contained significant phosphatase activity (Fig.3 B). The measured activity was largely inhibited by 2 nm okadaic acid, as expected for PP2A. These assays were performed in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, indicating that calcium is not required for the activity of striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes. The addition of 2 mm calcium to these phosphatase reactions had a variable but slightly inhibitory effect on PP2A activity (data not shown). Different B-type subunits have been shown to differentially activate the PP2A A/C heterodimer toward different substrates. For example, B subunit is the only known B-type subunit reported to activate A/C heterodimers toward cdc2-phosphorylated histone H1 substrate (50–100-fold) (25.Ferrigno P. Langan T.A. Cohen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26.Sola M.M. Langan T. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27.Agostinis P. Derua R. Sarno S. Goris J. Merlevede W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of striatin and SG2NA in PP2A complexes modulates the activity of A/C heterodimers, radiolabeled cdc2-phosphorylated histone H1 substrate was used to compare the activity of striatin and SG2NA complexes with other forms of PP2A. Immunoprecipitations were prepared from NIH3T3 cells that stably express HA-tagged C subunit (36wt cells) using two different mAbs to the carboxyl terminus of C subunit (1d6 and 4e1) and one mAb to the amino-terminal epitope tag (12CA5). Approximately 10–30% of 12CA5 complexes prepared from 36wt cells contain B subunit, whereas approximately 5% of 1d6 complexes contain striatin and SG2NA (data not shown); 4e1 complexes contain C subunit alone and A/C heterodimers (18.Ogris E. Du X. Nelson K.C. Mak E.K., Yu, X.X. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14382-14391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Striatin and SG2NA complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-striatin and anti-SG2NA antisera, respectively, were highly activated toward histone H1 substrate compared with PP2A in 4e1 and 1d6 immune complexes (Fig. 3 C). PP2A immunoprecipitated by 12CA5 had similar (within 2-fold) activity to striatin and SG2NA complexes. Based on our estimate of the percentage of 12CA5 complexes containing B subunit, we would estimate that striatin and SG2NA activate A/C heterodimers less than B subunit toward histone H1. Similar experiments using NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged B subunit2confirmed this hypothesis (Fig. 3 D), with striatin and SG2NA complexes approximately 35 and 29% as active, respectively, as B subunit complexes against cdc2 phosphorylation sites. The high level of observed histone H1 phosphatase activity suggests that striatin and SG2NA are not bound to the A/C heterodimers via the catalytic site. Chemiluminescence quantitation of immunoblots containing both lysates and immunoprecipitations indicated that approximately 0.1–0.5% of the total C subunit present in lysates was immunoprecipitated with the striatin and SG2NA antisera (data not shown). This finding contrasts with the observation that 5% of 1d6 immunoprecipitates contain striatin and SG2NA. Potential explanations for this difference are: 1) not all of the striatin and SG2NA present in lysates was immunoprecipitated; 2) the striatin and SG2NA antisera may partially destabilize complex formation with the A/C heterodimer; or 3) that 1d6 may bind preferentially to striatin/PP2A and SG2NA/PP2A complexes. The observation that striatin and SG2NA bind to both CaM and PP2A and contain WD40 repeats suggested that these proteins might function as molecular scaffolds for PP2A signaling complexes. To test whether striatin and SG2NA interact with additional proteins, NIH3T3 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with both the anti-striatin and anti-SG2NA antiseras. Immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis and A subunit, C subunit, striatin, and SG2NA were detected in striatin and SG2NA immunoprecipitations, but not in pre-immune controls (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Immunoblots of SG2NA immunoprecipitates with affinity-purified SG2NA antisera revealed multiple additional immune-specific bands, suggesting that other members of the SG2NA family may exist (Fig. 4 Band data not shown). Consistent with a role for striatin and SG2NA as molecular scaffolds, several unidentified proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with striatin and SG2NA (Fig. 4 B). We have previously suggested that the methylation state of the C subunit might regulate the association of A/C heterodimers with B-type subunits (22.Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine the methylation state of the C subunit in striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes, a portion of the C subunit in striatin and SG2NA immunoprecipitations was subjected to demethylation by base treatment. Both untreated and demethylated samples were analyzed by immunoblot with a methylation-sensitive mAb (Fig.5 A) that recognizes only the demethylated C subunit.2 The level of C subunit detected by the methylation-sensitive antibody was substantially enhanced in base-treated samples relative to untreated controls, and chemiluminescence quantitation determined that more than 90% of the C subunits associated with striatin and SG2NA are methylated. This result indicates that C subunit methylation does not prevent striatin and SG2NA association with the A/C heterodimer, but it does not indicate whether methylation is needed for formation of striatin-PP2A and SG2NA-PP2A complexes. Although the C subunit carboxyl terminus is essential for formation of PP2A heterotrimers containing the cellular B subunit, it is not required for formation of heterotrimers containing the viral B-type subunit, polyoma virus middle tumor antigen (MT) (22.Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of the C subunit carboxyl terminus for the formation of A/C/striatin and A/C/SG2NA heterotrimers, striatin and SG2NA immunoprecipitations were performed from cell lines expressing HA-tagged C subunit mutants (22.Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The final nine amino acids that contain sites of both phosphorylation (Tyr-307) (28.Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and methylation (Leu-309) (29.Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19192-19195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are deleted in one of these mutants (301Stop). The 301Stop mutant was co-immunoprecipitated with striatin and SG2NA at least as efficiently as the wt C subunit (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that striatin and SG2NA interact with the core A/C heterodimer in a fundamentally different manner than the B subunit, behaving more like polyoma virus MT than B subunit in their binding to the A/C heterodimer. Thus, the association of striatin and SG2NA with the A/C heterodimer is probably not directly affected by the covalent modification of the C subunit carboxyl terminus. However, the association of striatin and SG2NA with the A/C heterodimer could be indirectly affected by modifications that influence competition for the A/C heterodimer by altering the affinity of other B-type subunits. Consistent with this possibility, the C subunit mutant, T304A, which has been shown to have an increased affinity for B subunits (22.Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), was reduced 5-fold in its ability to form complexes with striatin and SG2NA compared with the wild-type HA-tagged C subunit (36wt, Fig. 5 C). Taken together, the following observations all strongly suggest that striatin and SG2NA represent a novel family of B-type subunits: 1) striatin and SG2NA complex with the PP2A A/C heterodimer; 2) these complexes contain okadaic acid-sensitive, PP2A-like phosphatase activity; 3) striatin and SG2NA share a conserved epitope with B′ subunits; 4) no known B-type subunits can be observed in these complexes; 5) unlike B subunits, the association of striatin and SG2NA with the A/C heterodimer is independent of the C subunit carboxyl terminus, yet they can activate the A/C heterodimer toward cdc-2 phosphorylated histone H1; and 6) their relative binding to wt and T304A C subunits is opposite that of B subunit (implying that B subunit may even compete with them for binding to the T304A mutant form of the A/C heterodimer). However, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that some other undiscovered B-type subunit that is not recognized by any of the B, B′, or B′′ antisera could be present in these complexes. Our conclusion that striatin and SG2NA may be members of a new class of B-type subunits would be further strengthened by additional evidence of competition with other B-type subunits or demonstration of direct interaction between bacterially expressed recombinant striatin and SG2NA and recombinant PP2A A subunit or A/C heterodimer. Should further evidence conclusively demonstrate that striatin and SG2NA are members of a novel family of B-type subunits, we propose that they be designated the B′′′ (or B93/110) family. The finding that striatin and SG2NA form stable complexes with PP2A and might represent a novel (B′′′) family of PP2A subunits is the first description of a function for these highly related WD40 repeat proteins. The fact that striatin is highly abundant in post-synaptic membranes, whereas SG2NA appears to be targeted to the nucleus, provides yet another mechanism for the localization of PP2A to different cellular microenvironments. The observation that SG2NA, as well as striatin, binds to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner indicates that these proteins probably link PP2A to calcium-dependent signaling pathways and cellular events. Although PP2A complexes with CaMKIV have been detected by cross-linking (11.Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), it is not yet known whether this interaction is direct or requires a molecular scaffold. Although we were not able to detect CaMKII or CaMKIV in immunoblots of striatin or SG2NA immunoprecipitations, we have detected kinase activity in these immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Furthermore, the large number of stably associated proteins observed in SG2NA immunoprecipitations suggests that striatin and SG2NA function as molecular scaffolds for the interactions of PP2A with large signal transduction complexes. The identification of additional cellular components of these complexes will provide new insights into the cellular function of striatin, SG2NA, and PP2A.

EPCR binds to both protein C and activated protein C (APC) with high affinity. A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits APC anticoagulant activity. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which sEPCR modulates APC function. Soluble EPCR inhibited the inactivation of factor Va by APC only in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. By using flow cytometric analysis in the presence of 3 mmCaCl2 and 0.6 mm MgCl2, sEPCR inhibited the binding of protein C and APC to phospholipid vesicles (K i = 40 ± 7 and 33 ± 4 nm, respectively). Without MgCl2, the K ivalues increased approximately 4-fold. Double label flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein-APC and Texas Red-sEPCR indicated that the APC·sEPCR complex does not interact with phospholipid vesicles. By using surface plasmon resonance, we found that sEPCR also inhibited binding of protein C to phospholipid in a dose-dependent fashion (K i = 32 nm). To explore the possibility that sEPCR evokes structural changes in APC, fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed to monitor sEPCR/Fl-APC interactions. sEPCR binds saturably to Fl-APC (K d = 27 ± 13 nm) with a maximum decrease in Fl-APC fluorescence of 10.8 ± 0.6%. sEPCR also stimulated the amidolytic activity of APC toward synthetic substrates.

The pathway is initiated when thrombin binds to thrombomodulin (TM)1 on the endothelial cell surface. The thrombin·TM complex rapidly activates protein C to generate the anticoagulant enzyme activated protein C (APC). APC, in combination with its cofactor protein S, limits the amplification and progression of the coagulation cascade by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa, a process that occurs on the phospholipid surface. Recently, an additional component of the protein C anticoagulant pathway has been identified (3.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

The interaction between EPCR and protein C/APC is mediated primarily by the Gla domain of the latter (5.Regan L.M. Mollica J.S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Binding of EPCR to protein C enhances the rate of protein C activation by the thrombin·TM complex on the endothelial cell surface (6.Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L.

This is physiologically relevant since theK m for protein C activation by the thrombin·TM complex is significantly higher (≈1 μm) than the circulating plasma concentration of protein C (65 nm) (9.Owen W.G.

Since reconstitution experiments revealed little affinity of EPCR for TM (8.Xu J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6704-6710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the main determinants of protein C activation appear not to be direct protein-protein interactions between EPCR and TM but rather the lateral mobility of EPCR in the membrane and the ability of EPCR to bind and present protein C to the thrombin·TM activation complex on the cell surface. Unlike TM, which is expressed at comparable density on the surface of the endothelium in most large and small blood vessels, EPCR is expressed at the highest levels on the endothelium of large vessels (7.Fukudome K.

We hypothesize that one of the physiological roles of EPCR is to concentrate protein C on the endothelium and regulate blood coagulation on the surface of large vessels. A soluble form of EPCR has recently been detected in normal human plasma (13.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind protein C and APC with an affinity similar to that of intact membrane-bound EPCR (4.Fukudome K.

In healthy individuals, sEPCR circulates at a concentration of ≈2.5 nm, a level that can increase up to 5-fold in patients with sepsis or systemic lupus erythematosus (14.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Carson C.W. D'Angelo A. Della Valle P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 725-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to membrane-bound EPCR, sEPCR inhibits protein C activation over large vessel endothelium in culture. This presumably reflects competition between the sEPCR and cell surface EPCR. sEPCR also inhibits APC anticoagulant activity (15.Regan L.M. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J. Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17499-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the mechanism responsible for this inhibition remains unclear. Since EPCR interacts with the membrane-binding Gla domain of protein C (15.Regan L.M. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J. Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17499-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is possible that binding to sEPCR and phospholipid is mutually exclusive. Alternatively, sEPCR could mask the factor Va-binding site on APC or alter the macromolecular substrate specificity of the enzyme by altering the conformation of the extended substrate binding pocket. The goal of the current study is to elucidate which, if any, of the above mechanisms are responsible for the ability of sEPCR to modulate APC function. Human protein C and APC (16.Esmon C.T.

Recombinant soluble EPCR (sEPCR) was isolated as described by Fukudomeet al. (4.Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Sonicated vesicles were prepared as described previously (18.Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J.

PC:PS:PE vesicles were 40% PC, 20% PS, and 40% PE. Factor Va (0.2 nm), unilamellar, sonicated PC:PS:PE vesicles (10 μg/ml), and various concentrations of sEPCR (up to 1 μm) were incubated in the absence and presence of APC (5 or 20 pm) in HBS (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) containing 3 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% gelatin. All reactions were run at room temperature in 96-well polyvinyl chloride plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). After 30 min, the APC was inactivated by the addition of p-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride (30 μm). Residual factor Va activity was monitored by its ability to enhance prothrombin activation in the presence of excess factor Xa (2 nm), prothrombin (1.4 μm), and 3 mm CaCl2. After activation for 5 min, the reactions were stopped with EDTA (8 mm). Thrombin formed during the activation was determined by amidolytic activity with Spectrozyme PCa as the substrate (0.2 mm). APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein was prepared as described by Bock (19.Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6.5 ml of 0.2 mg/ml APC was incubated with 6-fold molar excess ofN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-FPR-chloromethyl ketone (ATA-PPACK) (Molecular Innovations Inc., Royal Oak, MI) in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA. The labeling reaction was allowed to proceed until the APC was 99% inactive as monitored by the loss of enzymatic activity using Spectrozyme PCa (typically 1 h at room temperature). Excess ATA-PPACK was removed by centrifuging the sample in a molecular mass 10-kDa cut-off Centricon 10 filter (Amicon Inc.) for 15 min at 6,000 × g. All subsequent steps were performed in the dark. 10-Fold molar excess of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and 1/10 volume of 1 m hydroxylamine (in 1 m Hepes, pH 7.4) was added to the ATA-PPACK-APC and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Free fluorescein was removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the labeled APC was stored at −70 °C. HPC2, a monoclonal antibody against human protein C, was labeled with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate as described by Goding (20.Goding J.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1976; 13: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). sEPCR was labeled with the amine-reactive probe Texas Red succinimidyl ester as described by the supplier (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Briefly, 350 μl of 1.72 mg/ml sEPCR in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate was incubated with 26 μl of 10 mg/ml Texas Red (in Me2SO) for 1 h at room temperature. The conjugate was then separated from unreacted probe on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using HBS as the elution buffer. The average degree of labeling was determined using the formula (Ax ÷ ε) × (M r of protein ÷ mg/ml protein) = mol of probe per mol of protein, where Ax is the absorbance value of the probe at 595 nm, and ε is the molar extinction coefficient of the dye (80,000 m−1cm−1). A 5% suspension of polystyrene latex beads (Sigma) (500 ml) was pelleted in Eppendorf tubes and washed 3 times with HBS by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 1 min. Liposomes (200 ml at 2 mg/ml total phospholipid in HBS) were added to the beads and incubated overnight at room temperature with shaking. 30 μl of 140 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to the mixture and mixed for an additional 2 h. After three washes with HBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, the beads were resuspended in HBS containing 0.02% NaN3. Total phospholipid concentration was determined by counting [14C]PC tracer included in the phospholipid mixtures using a Beckman model LS 6000 SE scintillation counter. The final concentration of phospholipid was 685 μg/ml latex suspension. The affinities of Fl-APC and protein C for PC:PS:PE phospholipids were determined as follows. Briefly, liposome-adsorbed latex beads (0.1 mg of total phospholipid/ml) were suspended in HBS containing 3 mm CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, in the absence or presence of 0.6 mm MgCl2. The solution was incubated with increasing concentrations of Fl-APC at 25 °C for 10 min in the dark. To monitor protein C binding to the liposome-adsorbed beads, the solution was first incubated with various concentrations of protein C for 15 min at room temperature, then with 8 nm Fl-HPC2, a fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody to protein C for 10 min at room temperature. Binding was analyzed on a FACsCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Values of K d were determined by fitting binding isotherms with a hyperbolic equation using the TableCurveTM program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). To calculate K i values, 22 nm Fl-APC or 22 nm protein C (+Fl-HPC2) was incubated with 4.5 μm PC:PS:PE in the presence of increasing amounts of sEPCR. 4.5 μm PC:PS:PE corresponds to ≈140 nm protein C/APC-binding sites, assuming ≈32 phospholipid molecules (18 of which are phosphatidylserine molecules), bind to 1 molecule of protein C/APC (21.Nelsestuen G.L. Broderius M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4172-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22.Prigent-Dachary J. Faucon J.-F. Boisseau M.-R. Dufourcq J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). TheK i(app) was determined using the following quadratic Equation 1, FFo=1−([E]+[I]+[Ki(app)])−([E]+[I]+[Ki(app)]) 2−(4[E][I])2[E]Equation 1 where [E] is the initial fractional concentration of Fl-APC or protein C and [I] is the concentration of sEPCR. TheK i value was then calculated fromK i(app) using the following relationship (shown in Equation 2), Ki(app)=Ki1+[L]KdEquation 2 where [L] is the lipid-binding site concentration, andK d is the experimentally determined dissociation constant for the protein C- or APC-lipid interaction. All data were fitted to the indicated equations using TableCurveTM. Real time biomolecular interactions between sEPCR, protein C, and lipid were studied using a BIAcoreTM 1000 biosensor instrument (Biacore Inc.). Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.6 mmMgCl2. All buffer solutions were filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane and degassed thoroughly prior to use. Phospholipid vesicles were captured onto the surface of a Pioneer L1 sensor chip (Biacore Inc.), which contains dextran modified with lipophilic compounds. Unilamellar, sonicated PC (100%), PC:PS (80:20), or PC:PS:PE (40:20:40) vesicles, at a concentration of 76 μg/ml, were introduced onto the surface of the sensor chip for 30 s, which produced a signal of approximately 2000 resonance units (RU). Binding of protein C or protein C·sEPCR complexes to the phospholipid membrane was then monitored in real time by measuring changes in RU (1000 RU corresponds to ≈1 ng of bound protein/mm2). After each protein injection, the sensor chips were regenerated by the injection of 10 μl of 40 mm octyl glucoside, followed by washing for 2 min with buffer before reinjecting phospholipid vesicles for the next cycle. For each set of experiments, the proteins were introduced onto the surface of a sensor chip that lacked phospholipids (control sensor chip). The sensorgrams of the control sensor chip were subtracted from the sensorgrams of the lipid-containing flow cells to remove the effects of nonspecific binding to the dextran surface. The determination of kinetic parameters for the binding reactions was performed using the BiaEvaluation 3.0 software. The dissociation rate constant (k off) and association rate constant (k on) were determined separately from individual dissociation and association kinetics data, respectively, using a simple 1:1 binding model. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant, K d, was calculated from the ratiok off/k on. The association between sEPCR and APC was monitored by the sEPCR-dependent fluorescence intensity change of Fl-APC. Fluorescence studies were performed on 900 μl of 12.5 nm Fl-APC in a 1- × 1-cm quartz cuvette using an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorometer. The sample was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 490 and 520 nm, respectively, with excitation and emission slit widths of 4 nm. After readings were taken of Fl-APC alone (Io), known quantities of sEPCR were then added to the cuvette, and after 10 min of mixing, the change in fluorescence was monitored (I). K d values were calculated by plotting I/Io versus sEPCR concentration after correcting for volume changes due to EPCR addition. The parametersK d and α were calculated by nonlinear regression using the quadratic Equation 3, IIo=α2×1+Kd+[sEPCR][Fl−APC]−Equation 3 1+Kd+[sEPCR][Fl−APC]2−4x[sEPCR][Fl−APC]+1where α is the maximum fluorescence change and assumes a stoichiometry of 1:1 (23.Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The chromogenic activity of 5 nm APC in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) gelatin was determined with 0–2.5 mm various chromogenic substrates in the absence or presence of 200 nmsEPCR. A 50-μl aliquot of reaction solution was mixed with 50 μl of chromogenic substrate on a microtiter plate, and the change in absorbance with time at 405 nm was determined onV max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). All samples were assayed in duplicate. For each substrate, theK m (nm) and k cat(s−1) values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation in Tablecurve (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Previous studies demonstrated that sEPCR inhibits APC anticoagulant activity in plasma in a dose-dependent fashion (15.Regan L.M. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J. Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17499-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a purified factor Va inactivation assay to investigate the membrane dependence of this phenomenon. As expected, in the presence of PC:PS:PE liposomes, sEPCR inhibited APC-mediated factor Va inactivation as measured by residual prothrombinase activity (Fig.1 A). However, in the absence of phospholipids, sEPCR had no effect on the ability of APC to inactivate factor Va (Fig. 1 B). Thus, sEPCR prevented inactivation of factor Va by APC in a lipid-dependent manner. One possible explanation for the lipid dependence of the inhibitory effect of sEPCR on APC activity is that sEPCR inhibits the binding of APC to phospholipids. To explore this possibility, flow cytometry was used employing PC:PS:PE vesicles immobilized on polystyrene beads. Our studies were performed in the presence of 3 mmCaCl2 and 0.6 mm MgCl2, conditions that have previously been shown to be optimal for the binding of membrane-bound EPCR to APC (4.Fukudome K.

The data are summarized in TableI. Protein C and Fl-APC bind to PC:PS:PE vesicles with similar affinities both in the presence and absence of MgCl2. Holding the protein C and Fl-APC concentrations constant (22 nm), binding of these proteins to the liposomes decreased as a function of increasing sEPCR concentration, until virtually all of the binding was inhibited (not shown). The equilibrium inhibition constant (K i) for sEPCR bound to protein C and Fl-APC at the liposome surface was 40 ± 7 and 33 ± 4 nm, respectively (Table I). In the absence of MgCl2, the K i values increased approximately 4-fold, suggesting that the interaction between sEPCR and protein C and APC is magnesium- as well as calcium-dependent.Table IDissociation and inhibition constants for the interaction of protein C and APC with PC:PS:PE in the absence or presence of sEPCR+CaCl2, +MgCl2+CaCl2, no MgCl2K d to PC:PS:PEK i of sEPCRK d to PC:PS:PEK i of sEPCRnmnmProtein C186 ± 840 ± 7198 ± 21129 ± 51Fl-APC137 ± 5833 ± 4116 ± 41134 ± 56The affinities of protein C and Fl-APC for PC:PS:PE-coated latex beads were measured by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inhibition constants for sEPCR bound to protein C or Fl-APC were defined by a kinetic equation describing competitive inhibition (Eq. 1 and 2). The experiments were performed in HBS containing 3 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm MgCl2. The values correspond to the mean and the S.E. of at least two determinations.

The experiments were performed in HBS containing 3 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm MgCl2. The values correspond to the mean and the S.E. of at least two determinations. We next used double label flow cytometric analysis to see if Texas Red-sEPCR (sEPCR labeled with the amine-reactive probe Texas Red) could bind to the lipid surface in an APC-dependent fashion. The average degree of labeling of Texas Red-sEPCR was 3.2 indicating that all three of the primary amino groups of the protein were labeled. The labeling reaction did not alter the affinity of sEPCR for Fl-APC based on K i determinations with flow cytometry (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, holding the Texas Red-sEPCR concentration constant (310 nm), no binding of this protein to lipids was observed with increasing concentrations of Fl-APC as monitored by the fluorescence-2 channel. In contrast, the fluorescent-1 channel detected Fl-APC binding to the liposomes in a roughly dose-dependent manner. The apparent low level of Fl-APC binding seen at the lower concentrations is presumably due to complex formation with Texas Red-sEPCR that decreases binding of APC to the lipid. In the absence of Texas Red-sEPCR, the amount of Fl-APC bound to the liposomes is higher since sEPCR is not present to reduce the concentration of free Fl-APC available for lipid binding (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the sEPCR·APC complex has no measurable affinity for PC:PS:PE vesicles. We next used surface plasmon resonance to see if the binding characteristics of the sEPCR·protein C complex to lipids are similar to those of the sEPCR·Fl-APC complex to lipids. Surface plasmon resonance is an optical, label-free measuring technique that monitors the binding interactions between molecular partners. Binding parameters were determined for the interaction between protein C or the protein C·sEPCR complex with immobilized PC:PS:PE vesicles formed on a lipophilic surface. The interaction between protein C and immobilized PC:PS:PE vesicles was monitored by flowing various concentrations of protein C (from 0 to 7.5 μm) over the lipid-coated chip surface. From the overlaid dose-response binding curves, theK d values of protein C binding to PC:PS:PE were calculated as 203 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures” (not shown). To determine the binding characteristics of the protein C·sEPCR complex to PC:PS:PE vesicles, a fixed amount of protein C (0.5 μm) was preincubated with sEPCR at molar ratios of 1:0, 1:0.2, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5 and injected over the surface of the lipid-coated chip. As shown in Fig.3 A, at a protein C:sEPCR molar ratio of 1:5, no binding of protein to the lipid surface was observed. The arrows indicate the start and end of the association phase of the interaction. These studies suggest that protein C, when in complex with sEPCR, loses the ability to bind phospholipid vesicles. A plot of the maximum RUs of the binding isotherms shown in Fig.3 A versus sEPCR concentration was constructed. The K i(app) (224 nm) was obtained by fitting the data to Equation 1 using nonlinear regression (Fig. 3 B). By using the relationship shown in Equation 2 and making the assumptions that (a) 1000 RU corresponds to ≈1 ng of bound phospholipid and (b) the volume of a flow cell is 60 nl, the K i value was calculated to be 32 nm. To explore the possibility that sEPCR evokes structural changes in APC upon binding, fluorescence intensity changes of Fl-APC were analyzed as a function of sEPCR concentration (Fig. 4). sEPCR elicited a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence emission intensity both in the presence and absence of MgCl2. The curve in the absence of MgCl2 was right-shifted, however, indicating decreased affinity between the proteins. To calculate the affinity of the Fl-APC-sEPCR interaction, the I/Io values were plotted versus sEPCR concentration. The data was fit to Equation 3 using nonlinear regression. In the presence of 3 mm CaCl2 and 0.6 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 4 A), the calculatedK d value was 27 ± 13 nm and a maximum decrease in Fl-APC fluorescence of 10.8 ± 0.6%. In the absence of MgCl2, the K d value increased to 71 ± 39 nm, again suggesting that the interaction between sEPCR and Fl-APC is magnesium- as well as calcium-dependent. The observed sEPCR-dependent changes in Fl-APC fluorescence intensity were specific because (a) there was no change in fluorescence intensity of Fl-APC when chicken egg albumin was used in place of sEPCR, (b) titration of the formed Fl-APC·sEPCR complex with unlabeled APC returned the I to the initial value of unbound Fl-APC, and (c) addition of 10 mm EDTA to the formed Fl-APC·sEPCR complex returned the I to the initial value of the unbound Fl-APC (data not shown). We also examined the effect of sEPCR on the rates of APC-mediated hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates. These chromogenic substrates interact on the unprimed side of the primary specificity pocket of APC. The kinetic parameters of APC toward synthetic substrates in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of sEPCR are shown in Table II. The enhanced catalytic activities observed are consistent with the active site environment being altered upon binding of sEPCR to APC.Table IIEffect of sEPCR on the rates of APC-mediated hydrolysis of chromogenic substratesSubstrate+APC+APC + sEPCRK mk catk cat/K mK mk catk cat/K mμms −1s −1μ"

The active site zinc is coordinated by a Cys-Asp-His-Cys tetrad that is strictly conserved among the β-CAs. No water molecule is found in a zinc-liganding radius, indicating that the zinc-hydroxide mechanism in α-CAs, and possibly in γ-CAs, is not directly applicable to the case in β-CAs.

No water molecule is found in a zinc-liganding radius, indicating that the zinc-hydroxide mechanism in α-CAs, and possibly in γ-CAs, is not directly applicable to the case in β-CAs. Zinc coordination environments of the CAs provide an interesting example of the convergent evolution of distinct catalytic sites required for the same CO2 hydration reaction. carbonic anhydrase multiwavelength anomalous diffraction Carbonic anhydrase (CA,1EC 4.2.1.1) is a zinc-containing enzyme which catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2. CA is ubiquitously distributed in nature and is involved in fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis, and ion transport (1.Tashian R.E. Bioessays. 1990; 10: 186-192Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2.Badger M.R. Price G.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 369-392Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homologies, CAs are classified into three evolutionarily distinct groups, designated α-, β-, and γ-CAs (3.Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). α-CAs are found in mammals, algae, and prokaryotes, β-CAs in higher plants, algae, and prokaryotes, and γ-CA has been identified in the archaeon, Methanosarcina thermophila, although gene homologies have been recently found in higher plants and prokaryotes (4.Kisker C. Schindelin H. Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of α-CAs from several mammals (5.Liljas A. Kannan K.K. Bergstén P.C. Waara I. Fridborg K. Strandberg B. Carlbom U. Järup L. Lövgren S. Petef M. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 235: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 6.Håkansson K. Carlsson M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) have revealed a common overall structure dominated by β-sheets. The catalytically active zinc is liganded by three histidine residues with a hydroxide or a water molecule as a fourth ligand, giving a tetrahedral coordination geometry. For the CO2 hydration reaction, the zinc-bound hydroxide initiates a nucleophilic attack on the substrate CO2 to form zinc-bound HCO3− which is then displaced by a water molecule (7.Coleman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5212-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regeneration of zinc-bound hydroxide requires an intramolecular proton shuttle from the zinc-bound water to the bulk solvent for each cycle of catalysis. The proton transfer is rate-limiting in the catalysis (8.Steiner H. Jonsson B.H. Lindskog S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of γ-CA from M. thermophila has been reported (4.Kisker C. Schindelin H. Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This is a trimeric CA with a peculiar left-handed β-helical folding motif. The active site zinc is located at subunit interfaces and coordinated by two histidines from one subunit and one histidine from a neighboring one. In addition, at an electron dense region which occupies the fourth coordination site, a putative water molecule is recognized. Although the polypeptide assembly forming the active site of the γ-CA is different from those of the α-CAs, the geometry around the zinc of γ-CA is quite similar to those of α-CAs. Kinetic studies of β-CAs from higher plants show high catalytic efficiency at high pH with k cat values between 105 and 106 s−1 per subunit andk cat/K m values between 107 and 108m−1s−1 (9.Johansson I.M. Forsman C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10.Rowlett R.S. Chance M.R. Wirt M.D. Sidelinger D.E. Royal J.R. Woodroffe M. Wang Y.F. Saha R.P. Lam M.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13967-13976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that the higher plant β-CAs are catalytically as efficient as human CA II. On the other hand, extended x-ray absorption fine structure suggests that the coordination sphere of zinc in β-CAs of higher plants should have one or more sulfur ligands (10.Rowlett R.S. Chance M.R. Wirt M.D. Sidelinger D.E. Royal J.R. Woodroffe M. Wang Y.F. Saha R.P. Lam M.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13967-13976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11.Bracey M.H. Christiansen J. Tovar P. Cramer S.P. Barlett S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 33: 13126-13131Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in contrast to those in α- and γ-CAs. Moreover, the circular dichroic spectrum of a higher plant β-CA is distinct from that of human CA II (9.Johansson I.M. Forsman C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, x-ray structure of any of the β-CAs has not yet been elucidated. In photosynthetic CO2 fixation, CO2 and not HCO3− is the substrate for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. However, HCO3− is the dominant species in alkaline chloroplast stroma, and the rate of spontaneous interconversion between CO2 and HCO3− is insufficient to cope with the metabolic demand (2.Badger M.R. Price G.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 369-392Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar). It has thus been proposed that CA plays an essential role in the fixation of CO2 in the Calvin-Benson cycle. CA in the red alga, Porphyridium purpureum, is thought to be involved in the CO2-concentrating mechanism which maintains a favorable CO2 level at the carboxylation site and compensates for the relatively lower affinity of algal ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase for CO2(12.Aizawa K. Miyachi S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 215-233Crossref Google Scholar, 13.Yagawa Y. Muto S. Miyachi S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1253-1262Google Scholar). The CA monomer has a molecular mass of ≈55 kDa and contains two atoms of zinc per monomer. We have isolated cDNA clones of the CA (14.Mitsuhashi S. Miyachi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28703-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The clones encode a 571-residue polypeptide in which two domains, each equivalent to that of other β-CAs (≈25–30 kDa), are arranged in tandem and exhibit ≈70% identity with each other. Thus, it is suggested that the CA gene of P. purpureum has been formed by duplication and fusion of a primordial β-CA gene. In this report, we describe the x-ray structure of P. purpureum CA. The study not only provides an understanding of the protein fold of the β-CA family but also reveals the novel architecture of the catalytic site, which is quite distinct from those of the α- and γ-CA enzymes. Protein crystallization are described elsewhere. 2S. Mitsuhashi, T. Mizushima, E. Yamashita, S. Miyachi, and T. Tsukihara, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the hanging-drop, vapor diffusion method was used to crystallize P. purpureum CA, wherein 5 μl of the purified protein preparation (30 mg ml−1 in 20 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5) was equilibrated against 5 μl of the reservoir solution (24% polyethylene glycol 4000, 300 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.75) at 20 °C. For data collection under cryogenic conditions, crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution for 1 h, supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Diffraction data for the frozen crystal were collected at 100 K using RIKEN beamline I (BL45XU) at SPring-8, Japan (15.Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Fujisawa T. Ueki T. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1998; 5: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data for intrinsic zinc atoms were collected at remote (1.0000 Å), peak (1.2823 Å), and edge (1.2825 Å) wavelengths. Diffraction data were recorded on a R-AXIS IV image-plate detector with a crystal-to-detector distance of 250 mm. Two data sets at remote and edge wavelengths were simultaneously recorded in the same image plate. Diffraction data were processed with DENZO and intensity data were scaled together using SCALEPACK (16.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

The anomalous Patterson map showed very clear peaks for all vectors among four zinc atoms in the asymmetric unit. The x-ray structure of CA was determined at 2.2-Å resolution using intrinsic zinc MAD phasing (17.Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Refinement of atomic parameters of zinc and MAD phase determination were performed at 2.2-Å resolution by program SHARP (18.de a Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). The figure of merit was 0.48 for 50,294 reflections. The electron density map calculated with the MAD phases was refined by the solvent flattening method and by the noncrystallographic symmetry averaging method using program SOLOMON (19.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The R-factor, R = Σ(F o −F c)/ΣF o, for the refined electron density map was 0.246, where F o andF c are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. An initial model was built using program O (20.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and TURBO-FRODO. The model was refined at 2.2-Å resolution with program X-PLOR (21.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints for the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The model were revised manually in omit maps or F o − F c maps after each cycle of X-PLOR refinement. Twenty cycles of simulated annealing, positional, and temperature factor refinement reduced theR-factor to 0.208 and the R free to 0.274, where R free was a R-factor estimated for 5% reflections excluded from the refinement. In the final model, interpretable electron density begins with residue Val84 and ends with Gly564 without interruption. The geometry of the final model, as calculated using program PROCHECK (22.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), is satisfactory with 91.7% of the residues falling into the most favored regions, 8.3% into the additional allowed regions in a Ramachandran plot. The final model also includes 4 zinc ions and 613 water molecules for the dimer. Results of MAD phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The monomeric structure of P. purpureum CA is shown in Fig.1 A. There are essentially two symmetrical structural motifs in one monomer, resulting from two homologous repeats (≈70% sequence identity) in the CA polypeptide (Ref. 14.Mitsuhashi S. Miyachi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28703-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Fig. 2). The two motifs are related to each other by a pseudo 2-fold axis. Upon superposition of these two halves (N-terminal half, residues 86–309 and C-terminal half, residues 340–563), the root mean square deviations between the Cα atoms are 0.73 Å in monomer A and 0.74 Å in monomer B.Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignment of the representatives of β-CAs. Strictly conserved residues among all of the CAs are indicated byboxes. Zinc coordinated by ligands of the N- and C-terminal halves are designated Zn-N and Zn-C, respectively, as described in the text. Fourteen residues are clustered on the concave surface of the active site clefts and classified into two groups: Group I residues (in the boxes with blue background) are located around Zn-N and Zn-C and reside in the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein, respectively. Zinc ligands are marked by open circles. Group II residues (in theboxes with red background) from the C- and N-terminal halves of the protein are oriented toward Zn-N and Zn-C, respectively. The location of secondary structure elements of theP. purpureum CA are indicated over the aligned sequences. Wedges represent cleavage sites to generate mature enzymes of higher plants.

The α/β domain consists of α-β-α units exhibiting Rossmann fold (23.Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) and an anti-parallel β-strand (Fig. 1 A). The motif is obviously distinct from that of either α- or γ-CAs. The three projecting α-helices run on the surface of the α/β domain formed by the opposite half of the same monomer. Six main chain hydrogen bonds are formed between the N- and C-terminal halves of a monomer. This means that the N- and C-terminal halves contact each other so intimately that they are unable to divide into two independent structural domains. Internal sequence repeats suggest that the structure of the monomer (≈55 kDa) has evolved through gene duplication and fusion of an ancestral CA monomer. On the other hand, β-CA of pea has been reported to be an octameric enzyme with monomers of ≈27 kDa (9.Johansson I.M. Forsman C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is likely that two monomers of the unduplicated β-CA oligomers, such as pea CA, contact each other similarly as do the two halves of P. purpureum CA. An asymmetric unit cell of a crystal contains a dimer of two identical subunits, each with a molecular mass of 55 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This CA also exists as a dimer in solution based on gel filtration. 3S. Mitsuhashi, N. Kurano, S. Harayama, and S. Miyachi, unpublished results. The dimer has approximate dimensions of 90 Å × 70 Å × 60 Å. The two monomers are related by a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the pseudo 2-fold axis in the monomer. Consequently, the dimer has a pseudo 222 symmetry. Each monomer makes close contacts with its symmetry counterpart with a contact surface area of 4,000 Å2 of each monomer (19% of a monomer's surface area). A long turn segment (residues 310–339) connecting the N- and C-terminal halves sticks out from one monomer toward the surface of the counter monomer (Fig. 1 B). The two zinc-binding sites reside in two clefts (Fig. 3 A) on both sides of a monomer. They are located at the C-terminal ends of the parallel β-sheets, as often found in α/β enzymes with Rossmann folds. One of the catalytic zinc atoms is coordinated in a tetrahedral manner with the S-γ atom of Cys149, the O-δ2 of Asp151, the N-ε2 of His205, and the S-γ of Cys208 in the N-terminal half and the other is with equivalent atoms of Cys403, Asp405, His459, and Cys462 in the C-terminal half (Fig.3 B). These residues are strictly conserved among all β-CAs sequenced to date (Fig. 2). Here, zinc coordinated by the former tetrad is designated Zn-N and that by the latter Zn-C. The electron density of a water molecule is not found within coordination radius to the zinc atoms, not only in the initial MAD map but also in the F o − F c map calculated after the final refinement cycle, indicating that no water or hydroxide participates in zinc coordination in the present x-ray structure. This is the most remarkable difference from the structures of α- and γ-CAs in which a hydroxide or water molecule occupies the fourth liganding site and the fourth ligand has been suggested to be a nucleophile of the CO2 hydration reaction. Thus, we propose that the zinc-hydroxide mechanism is not directly applicable to β-CAs. Previously, two research groups proposed a Cys-His-Cys-H2O ligand scheme to bind zinc at the active site in higher plant β-CAs based on extended x-ray absorption fine structure (10.Rowlett R.S. Chance M.R. Wirt M.D. Sidelinger D.E. Royal J.R. Woodroffe M. Wang Y.F. Saha R.P. Lam M.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13967-13976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11.Bracey M.H. Christiansen J. Tovar P. Cramer S.P. Barlett S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 33: 13126-13131Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) presuming that a zinc-hydroxide catalytic mechanism similar to that of α-CAs exists in β-CAs. The three zinc-liganding residues other than the Asp suggested in these earlier studies are in agreement with those found in the structure ofP. purpureum CA. Kinetic studies of β-CAs of higher plants have revealed that a basic form of the enzyme is the active species and the pK a for the activity linked group is approximately 8.5 (10.Rowlett R.S. Chance M.R. Wirt M.D. Sidelinger D.E. Royal J.R. Woodroffe M. Wang Y.F. Saha R.P. Lam M.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13967-13976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The present x-ray structure has been determined at pH 6.75. Considering that the side chain carboxyl groups of Asp151 and Asp405 would be more deprotonated at higher pH values, these residues should firmly bind the zinc under more alkaline conditions. In other words, zinc liganding by these Asp residues at neutral pH may not be a crystallization artifact and can also be observed in the basic forms of the enzyme. Based on the structure of P. purpureum CA, the extended x-ray absorption fine structure data indicate that one of the nitrogen/oxygen atoms involved in the zinc coordination is not that of a water molecule, but of the Asp residue. It is also of interest to note the results of the site-directed mutagenesis analysis of potential zinc ligands in the β-CA of spinach (15.Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Fujisawa T. Ueki T. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1998; 5: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which the Asn residue was substituted for Asp152 (corresponding to Asp151 and Asp405 in P. purpureum CA). The mutant enzyme retained little CO2 hydration activity, although the mutant enzyme could bind 80% of the zinc compared with the wild type CA. This result indicates that only one of the two carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp152 is necessary for zinc binding, and the other carboxyl oxygen or its negative charge is essential for catalytic activity. The zinc-binding geometries of the N- and C-terminal halves of theP. purpureum CA monomer are shown superimposed on each other in Fig. 3 C. Using the zinc atoms and all atoms of the four ligands as references, a root mean square deviation of 0.73 Å is obtained. Coordination geometries of the two zinc atoms are very similar to each other. However, side chain conformations of the two equivalent Asps are different from each other. These residues have higher temperature factors than the other three zinc ligands and may have lower occupancy and flexibility resulting in conformational variations. The similarity in the coordination geometries is consistent with the results obtained with CA mutants of P. purpureumCA. When each of the zinc-binding residues in the N- and C-terminal halves was mutated, each of the mutants retained nearly half of the wild-type CA activity.3 However, results with these mutants differ from previous observations, in which the C-terminal half-polypeptide lost activity but the N-terminal half one retained activity (14.Mitsuhashi S. Miyachi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28703-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal half-polypeptide with the long turn segment was expressed, this segment may have seriously impaired folding around the active site. Out of 23 residues which are strictly conserved in the β-CAs in Fig. 2, including that from higher plants, algae, and prokaryotes, 14 residues are clustered on concave surfaces of the clefts (Fig. 3 A). For purpose of clarity, only the cleft surrounding Zn-C is discussed here, but that surrounding Zn-N is basically equivalent. It should be noted that Zn-C is not exclusively surrounded by residues from C-terminal half of the protein. The conserved residues in the cleft are classified into two groups: group I includes residues located around Zn-C and reside in the C-terminal half of the protein, whereas group II includes residues that surround Zn-C and are present in the N-terminal half of the CA polypeptide. Group I residues are Ser406, Arg407, Gly463, Tyr543 and 4 zinc ligands (Cys403, Asp405, His459, and Cys462), while group II are Gln140, Pro142, Gly165, Phe168, Tyr190, and Leu195. The four zinc ligands are involved in a number of hydrogen bond formations with residues in the immediate vicinity of the active site cleft (Fig. 3 D). Each of the zinc-liganding cysteine residues is fixed by two NH-S hydrogen bonds. Tyr190 (group II) and Tyr543 (group I) are each hydrogen-bonded to zinc ligands, Asp405 and His459, respectively, through water(s). These hydrogen bonds may provide a possible proton pathway between an activated water and the bulk solvent (see below). Pro142, Phe168, and Leu195 (all from group II) provide a hydrophobic environment by being positioned just besides Asp151. This may act as a site for possible CO2 association (see below). If these conserved residues of group II are actually essential for catalytic activity, they may provide an explanation for internally duplicated structures of the CA involving close contact between the N- and C-terminal halves in forming the active site clefts. Site-directed mutagenesis of zinc ligands of higher plant β-CAs (11.Bracey M.H. Christiansen J. Tovar P. Cramer S.P. Barlett S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 33: 13126-13131Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24.Provart N.J. Majeau N. Coleman J.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and of P. purpureum CA3 have demonstrated that zinc is essential for catalysis. Although there is no water bound directly to zinc in the x-ray structure, a water molecule exists near each of the sites of zinc in an F o −F c electron density map (Fig. 3 B). The water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to O-ε1 of the zinc-liganding Asp151 and Asp405, but the water does not exist in the direct zinc coordination radius. The CO2 hydration reaction should require a catalytic water molecule which acts as a nucleophile and which must be at least transiently bound to the zinc. In addition, averaged temperature factors of main chain atoms for tripeptides starting from zinc-liganding Asp are 37 Å2 and 39 Å2 for Asp151-Ser152-Arg153 and Asp405-Ser406-Arg407 of monomer A, respectively, and 37 Å2 and 40 Å2 for those of monomer B, respectively, while those for all residues of monomer A and B are 21 Å2 and 21 Å2, respectively. The tripeptide sequence is strictly conserved in β-CAs. The ligands other than the Asps have temperature factors of main chain atoms as low as around 12 Å2. Higher temperature factors for the tripeptide segments, including the Asp ligands, suggest that the segments are mobile. We propose a possible mechanism of CO2 hydration cycle as shown in Fig. 4. Hydrophobic pockets formed by Pro142, Phe168, and Leu195 beside Zn-C and Pro396, Phe422, and Leu449 beside Zn-N are candidates for the site of CO2 association. Presumably, the CO2 association triggers the subsequent catalytic steps. The zinc-bound aspartate functions as a base to accept a proton from its hydrogen-bonded water and yields a nucleophilic hydroxide (Fig. 4,step 1). As a consequence, the protonated aspartate will be released from the zinc and the resulting nucleophilic hydroxide moves toward and binds the zinc (Fig. 4, step 2). In the next step, the hydroxide attacks the CO2 molecule to generate zinc-bound HCO3−. The proton is transferred from the protonated aspartate to the bulk solvent or buffer, possibly through one of the hydrogen-bonded pathways immediately surrounding the zinc ligands (Fig. 3 D and Fig.4, step 3). Then the zinc-bound HCO3− is replaced with a deprotonated Asp, releasing the HCO3− and leaving a zinc-bound Asp (Fig. 4, step 4). Finally, a water molecule binds O-ε1 of the zinc-bound Asp to regenerate the initial stage (Fig. 4, step 5). The present results show that β-CA differs from α- and γ-CAs, not only in overall protein folding, but also in the nature of the architecture coordinating and surrounding the catalytic zinc. The absence of a water molecule in the zinc coordination sphere suggests that the zinc-hydroxide mechanism in α-CAs, and possibly in γ-CAs, is not directly applicable in the case of β-CAs. Knowledge of the x-ray structure of P. purpureum CA should provide a more detailed description of the catalytic mechanism of β-CAs. We are very grateful to Y. Hara (Osaka University) for screening crystallization conditions. We thank S. Harayama and N. Kurano (Marine Biotechnology Institute) for helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W1970330182,"Whereas the tumor acidic extracellular pH plays a crucial role in the invasive process, the mechanism(s) behind this acidification, especially in low nutrient conditions, are unclear. The regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and invasion by serum deprivation were studied in a series of breast epithelial cell lines representing progression from non-tumor to highly metastatic cells. Whereas serum deprivation reduced lactate production in all three cells lines, it inhibited NHE activity in the non-tumor cells and stimulated it in the tumor cells with a larger stimulation in the metastatic cells. The stimulation of NHE in the tumor cell lines was the result of an increased affinity of the internal H+regulatory site of the NHE without changes in sodium kinetics or expression. Serum deprivation conferred increased cell motility and invasive ability that were abrogated by specific inhibition of the NHE. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant or wortmannin incubation inhibited NHE activity and invasion in serum replete conditions while potentiating the serum deprivation-dependent activation of the NHE and invasion. These results indicate that the up-regulation of the NHE by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent mechanism plays an essential role in increased tumor cell invasion induced by serum deprivation. Whereas the tumor acidic extracellular pH plays a crucial role in the invasive process, the mechanism(s) behind this acidification, especially in low nutrient conditions, are unclear. The regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and invasion by serum deprivation were studied in a series of breast epithelial cell lines representing progression from non-tumor to highly metastatic cells. Whereas serum deprivation reduced lactate production in all three cells lines, it inhibited NHE activity in the non-tumor cells and stimulated it in the tumor cells with a larger stimulation in the metastatic cells. The stimulation of NHE in the tumor cell lines was the result of an increased affinity of the internal H+regulatory site of the NHE without changes in sodium kinetics or expression. Serum deprivation conferred increased cell motility and invasive ability that were abrogated by specific inhibition of the NHE. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant or wortmannin incubation inhibited NHE activity and invasion in serum replete conditions while potentiating the serum deprivation-dependent activation of the NHE and invasion. These results indicate that the up-regulation of the NHE by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent mechanism plays an essential role in increased tumor cell invasion induced by serum deprivation. intracellular pH Na+/H+ exchanger phosphoinositide 3-kinase intrinsic buffering capacity intracellular buffering capacity phosphate-buffered saline 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride Carcinogenesis is a dynamic process resulting in the accumulation of genetic alterations of varying character (1.Lengauer C.

The progression of epithelial carcinoma has been broadly classified into normal, hyperplastic, dysplastic, in situ, and invasive carcinoma. This progression from healthy tissue to metastatic disease occurs via a graded series of genetic/biochemical alterations that are still not clearly understood. As metastatic spread of malignant cells via invasion to distant tissues is the primary cause of treatment failure and subsequent death in cancer patients, one of the fundamental problems in oncology is understanding the mechanisms driving neoplastic progression and controlling invasion (3.Farber E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 4.D'Amato G. Patarca R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 275-373PubMed Google Scholar). One of the principal in vivo tumor hallmarks is the presence of severe extracellular areas of low pH, low serum levels, and hypoxia that develop early in the development of the tumor (5.Vaupel P.W. Kallinowski F. Okunieff P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6449-6465PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are usually closely linked and define the tumor metabolic microenvironment (6.Vaupel P.W. Klin. Padiatr. 1997; 209: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7.Fodstad O. Kjinniksen I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8.Reynolds T.Y. Rockwell S. Glazer P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5754-5757PubMed Google Scholar). There is now considerable evidence indicating that exposure to these factors increases the metastatic potential of cancer cells by increasing such processes as invasion (9.Cuvier C. Jang A. Hill R.P.

This appreciation of the critical importance of the response of a tumor cell to its own microenvironment as one of the main driving forces for progression has shifted emphasis to determining the role of the various components of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of tumor pathophysiological processes and determining how this contributes to neoplastic progression. There has been increasing evidence for the role of the acid component of the tumor microenvironment in controlling self-organized growth, invasive capacity, and subsequent malignant progression (10.Gatenby R.A. Gawlinski E.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5745-5753PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Martinez-Zaguilan R. Seftor E.A. Seftor R.E.B. Chu Y. Gillies R.J. Hendrix M.J.C. Clin. Exp.

However, the mechanisms by which a tumor cell acidifies its microenvironment and how these mechanisms are, in turn, regulated by the other components of the tumor microenvironment are still unclear. Whereas lactate production/release is commonly considered to be the primary tumor microenvironmental acidification mechanism (22.Webb S.D. Sherratt J.A. Fish R.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 196: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), tumors in nude mice derived from cells lacking lactate dehydrogenase were fully able to acidify their microenvironment (23.Yamagata M. Hasuda K. Stamato T. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 77: 1726-1731Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work in vivo has shown that in serum replete conditions the major component of extracellular acidification is lactate release, whereas in serum deprived conditions, common to aggressive tumors, lactate production/release stopped while the microenvironment continued to acidify (24.Parkins C.S. Stratford M.R. Dennis M.F. Stubbs M. Chaplin D.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Clearly, there is another mechanism of cellular pH regulation that contributes to extracellular acidification particularly in nutrient deprived conditions. Intracellular pH (pHi)1 is stringently regulated at levels somewhat higher than stoichiometrically predicted by various mechanisms including several plasma membrane ion transporters and an intrinsic cytosolic buffering capacity (25.Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). There are data demonstrating that the cell membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) is the prinicipal pHi-regulating mechanism in tumor cells (26.Boyer M.J. Tannock I.F. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4441-4447PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Stubbs M. Veech R.L. Griffiths J.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28.Hopkins D.M. Morris J.A. Oates K. Huddart H. Staff W.G. J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), suggesting that altered regulation of this transporter could constitute that mechanism. However, its altered regulatory response to serum deprivation, the role of the tumors neoplastic state in this response, and what role the NHE plays in the aberrant regulation of both intracellular and extracellular tumor pH have not yet been fully elucidated. This study was undertaken to characterize the unique effects of serum deprivation, which mimics in vivo tumor conditions, on the basic properties of the Na+/H+ exchanger of tumor cells and on their invasive potential: (a) is the response qualitatively different between tumor and normal cells, (b) does the response differ quantitatively between tumor cells of differing neoplastic status, (c) which modifications of the Na+/H+ exchanger are responsible for its altered activity, (d) which signal transduction pathways underlie this altered regulation of the exchanger, and (e) is the altered Na+/H+ exchange activity involved in increased tumor cell invasive capacity. To this scope the studies were simultaneously conducted on three well studied human mammary epithelial cell lines that represent distinct phases of neoplastic progression. These are a highly differeniated, spontaneously immortalized, non-tumor epithelial cell line, MCF-10A (29.Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar); a less differentiated, more aggressive cell line isolated from a primary tumor, MCF-7 (30.Soule H.D. Vasquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar); and a undifferentiated, very aggressive, very invasive metastatic cell line isolated from a pleural influsion of a metastatic tumor, MDA-MB-435 (31.Cailleau R. Olivé M. Cruciger Q.V.J. In Vitro. 1978; 14: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the tumor cell response is the opposite of normal cells to serum deprivation; in the normal cells serum deprivation results in a decrease in NHE activity, whereas in the tumor cells NHE activity was up-regulated by serum deprivation and this stimulation of NHE activity increases with an increasing neoplastic state. In the tumor cells the kinetics of the stimulation of exchanger activity with serum deprivation was consistent with an increase of the affinity of the internal proton regulatory site without a change in either sodiumK m or exchanger protein expression. We observe that during serum deprivation there is a reversal of the usual, positive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory pathway for NHE1 found in the presence of serum such that the serum deprivation-dependent activation of tumor cell NHE activity was potentiated by inhibition of PI3K. Our data demonstrate that with serum deprivation, tumor cells developed an increased capacity for acid extrusion into their environment and, subsequently, to invade. We conclude that an increased NHE activity is the probable tumor extracellular acidification mechanism during serum deprivation and this increase is directly responsible for the increased invasive potential observed in these conditions. MCF-10A is a spontaneously immortalized, untransformed human breast cell line derived from a patient with mild fibrocystosis (29.Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar); MCF-7, is a human breast tumor cell line derived from a primary, non-malignant tumor (30.Soule H.D. Vasquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) and MDA-MB-435, is a human breast tumor cell line derived from a pleural effusion of a malignant tumor (31.Cailleau R. Olivé M. Cruciger Q.V.J. In Vitro. 1978; 14: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). MCF-10A cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium high glucose (4500 mg/l) supplemented with NaHCO3 (3700 mg/l), 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 40 units/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium-pyruvate (1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MCF-7 and MDA cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (4500 mg/l) supplemented with NaHCO3 (3700 mg/l), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium-pyruvate (1 mg/ml) and penicillin (100 units)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All three lines were grown in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified incubator at 37 °C. For Na+/H+ exchange experiments, 200 μl of complete medium containing 200,000 cells were seeded onto a glass coverslip. After seeding, cells were returned to the incubator for at least 2 h to allow attachment, after which the unattached cells were removed, and the attached cells were immersed in fresh complete medium and returned to culture. With this routine seeding density, cells formed a confluent monolayer in 2 days and were immediately used for experiments. To be sure that pHi was measured in healthy cells, trypan blue exclusion measurements were performed on a representative coverslip before continuing the experiment. If more than 5% of the cells could not exclude the dye, experiments were not carried out. A pGEX-2T plasmid containing the dominant-negative p85α subunit of PI3 kinase (p85INT Tag) was kindly provided by M. Falasca (Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Santa Maria Imbaro, Chieti, Italy). Transient transfections on monolayers on glass coverslips were performed with the LipoTaxi reagent (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of plasmid cDNA or empty vector was incubated with 100 μl of LipoTaxi reagent in 2 ml of simple Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium for 30 min at room temperature. 200 μl of this mixture were pipetted onto confluent monolayers on glass coverslips and placed in an incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 6 h. The medium was replaced with fresh complete medium (10% serum) for 24 h in normal growth conditions. Cells were then treated, and NHE activity was measured. During all experiments presented, cells were initially perfused with medium resembling culture medium in its ionic content but without added CO2 (“Na+ringer,” containing 135 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgSO4, 18 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). A second medium was also used in whichn-methylglucamine completely replaced Na+(“n-methylglucamine ringer”). The osmolarity in these mediums, as determined by an osmometer, was identical to that of the culture medium. In some experiments, Na+ andn-methylglucamine medium were blended together to give intermediate Na+ concentrations. To manipulate intracellular pH, cells were exposed to 135 mmNa+ medium to which 20 mm NH4Cl was added from a stock solution of 4M. Cytoplasmic pHi was measured spectrofluorimetrically at 37 °C with the fluorescent pH-sensitive probe, BCECF, trapped intracellularly in cell monolayers grown on glass. Cells were loaded for 1 h at room temperature with the acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF (10 μm) in Na+ ringer. After loading, coverslips with confluent monolayers were inserted at an angle of 60° in a fluorometer cuvette designed to permit easy solution change with multiple perfusion solutions as described previously (32.Krayer-Pawlowska D. Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Krapf R. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored in a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorometer using alternately 440 nm (pH-insensitive) and 490 nm (pH-sensitive) as excitation wavelengths utilizing a xenon light source (5-nm bandwidth). Emission was measured at 530 nm (15-nm bandwidth). pHi was calculated from the fluorescence emission ratio of the two excitation wavelengths using a standard calibration procedure based on the use of nigericin (0.5 μm) in high potassium K-clamp ringer (20 mmNaCl, 110 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 18 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm KH2PO4) buffered at pH values from 6.5 to 8.5 in steps of 0.5 pH units. The activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger was measured by monitoring pHi recovery after an intracellular acid load produced with the NH4Cl prepulse technique (33.Boron W.F. DeWeer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The initial rate of Na+-dependent alkalinization was determined by linear regression analysis of the first 15 points taken at 4-s intervals after the readdition of sodium. The use of CO2/HCO3-free solutions minimizes the likelihood that Na+-dependent HCO3transport was responsible for the observed pHi changes. The pHi dependence of intracellular buffer capacity (βi),i.e. the buffering power of all non-HCO3-CO2-buffers, was computed by the NH4 pulse method (33.Boron W.F. DeWeer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). βi refers to the ability of intrinisic cellular components, excluding HCO3-CO2, to buffer changes in pHi and is defined as the moles of H+ required to produce a one-unit shift in pHi/liter of intracellular fluid. Estimations of βi were carried out in HEPES-buffered solutions, and extracellular sodium was removed to block all Na+-dependent pHi regulatory mechanisms. βi was calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbach equation from the measured pHi changes and the calculated changes of [NH4]i during stepwise reductions of [NH4]o in HCO3-CO2-free solution. One assumes that [NH3]o is equal to [NH3]i, a low NH4 conductance, and a pK a of 9.25. Lowering [NH4]othus produces a decrease in both [NH3]i and [NH4]i and the buffering capacity is calculated as follows. βi=[NH4] i/pHiEquation 1 The actual activity of the exchanger in terms of proton flux rate (mm H+/min) is determined by multiplying the rates in pHi change by the cells intrinsic buffering capacity (βi) at the pHi in which the measurement was being made. VH+ (mM/min)=βi (mM/pHi)×pHi/t (pHi/min)Equation 2 A quantitative measure of the degree of in vitro motility or invasion of the cells was obtained in Transwell chambers (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) assayed as described previously (34.Tedone T. Correale M. Barbarossa G. Casavola V. Paradiso A. Reshkin S.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For cell migration, assays were performed using filters coated with 5 μg of collagen I and placed in the apparatus, whereas for the invasion assays the filters were coated with 0.4 mg of matrigel. Alternatively, invasion was measured as the ability to infiltrate into live, confluent MCF-10A monolayers essentially as described by Habetset al. (35.Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) who, instead, utilized fibroblast monolayers. After adding tumor cells in suspension to the complete medium, plus or minus treatment, of the MCF-10A monolayers, culture dishes were returned to the incubator for 4 h. Unattached cells were then removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and infiltrated cells were released by differential trypsinzation and counted in a Burker Chamber. Cell monolayers were depleted of intracellular lactate by incubation for 10 min in a buffer without glucose (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaPi, 50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4). The cells were then washed two times in the same buffer, and glycolysis was initiated by the addition of 20 mm glucose. The concentration of lactate released into the buffer was measured in an enzyme-linked assay system as described (36.Brandt R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed two times in ice-cold PBS, and ATP was extracted in 0.5 N perchloric acid. The extract was centrifuged for 2 min at top speed in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was neutralized by adding a solution of 5m KOH and 2 m KH2PO4. ATP concentration in the resulting solution was measured with the kit from Sigma. For the analysis of NHE1 expression, a crude membrane fraction was prepared as described previously (37.Reshkin S.J. Pezzetta A. Albarani V. Paradiso A. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 371-375PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of 60 μg of protein was heated at 100 °C in SDS sample buffer and separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P (Millipore) for immunoblotting. The membrane was first washed for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and was then blocked with 5% dried fat-free milk in PBS for 1 h followed by washing twice with PBS. The blocked nitrocellulose was incubated with the primary antibody for 2.5 h at room temperature followed by three washes with PBS. NHE1 was detected by BCIP/NBT after sequential incubations with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min, three washes with PBS, incubation with the substrate, and subsequent color development. NHE1 protein abundance was quantitated by densitometry (Molecular Analyst, System LKB-GS 700). The kinetic coefficients for sodium and proton dependence of exchange activity were estimated by the nonlinear curve-fitting regression utilizing the iterative Marquardt procedure on the KALIDIOGRAPH® (Abelbeck Software) program. The sodium data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, V = (V max[Na])/(K m + [Na]) in which V is the rate of Na+/H+ exchange, [Na] is the experimental concentration of sodium, V max is the maximum rate of the exchanger, and K m is the apparent affinity for sodium. The proton data were fit to the Hill equation, V = (V max[H]n)/(K m + [H] n) in which V andV max are as above, [H] is the cytosolic proton concentration, K m is the apparent affinity for protons, and n is the apparent Hill coefficient. The effect of increasing serum concentration on invasive capacity as measured by the cells ability to cross a layer of matrigel in a Boyden Chamber was determined (Fig.1). MDA-MB435 cells (squares) had a 2-fold greater basal invasive capacity in the absence of serum than did MCF-7 cells (circles). In both cell lines invasion was concentration-dependent and already stimulated at the lowest serum concentration used (0.0025%). However, the slope of the serum invasion-response curve was higher in the metastatic MDA-MB435 cells. Further, whereas the invasive response of MCF-7 cells to serum concentration slowed down after about 0.25% serum, the MDA-MB435 cells continued a linear response of invasive capacity to serum even to 4% serum. MCF-10A cells (triangles) had a very low basal invasion rate that was not stimulated by serum (15 ± 6versus 21 ± 7 cells/filter in 0% and 1% serum, respectively) in line with their reported lack of invasive and metastatic capacity (28.Hopkins D.M. Morris J.A. Oates K. Huddart H. Staff W.G. J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The steady-state, resting pHi in the Na+-HEPES-buffered solution at 37 °C was determined in all three cell lines by spectrofluorometry and increased with increasing neoplastic state: 6.98 ± 0.07 (n = 43) to 7.26 ± 0.06 (n = 37) to 7.53 ± 0.05 (n = 52) for MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. Steady state lactate production also increased with increasing neoplastic state: 271.8 ± 19.4 (n = 6) to 637.8 ± 59.9 (n = 7) to 840.3 ± 118.6 (n = 5) nmol/h/106 cells for MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. The effect of serum deprivation on lactate production was then measured to determine if there are differences between normal and tumor cells and with neoplastic state. Serum deprivation resulted in a decrease in steady-state lactate production in all three cell lines: 179.6 ± 15.3 (n = 10, −33.9%, p < 0.001) to 526.5 ± 43.8 (n = 6, −17.4%, p< 0.001) to 771.7 ± 89.4 (n = 7, −8.2%,p < 0.01) nmol/h/106 cells for MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. As can be seen, although lactate production decreased with serum deprivation, the effect was lessened with increasing neoplastic state. All together these data show that resting pHi, lactate production, serum independence of growth, and invasiveness increased with increased neoplastic status and support the use of these cell lines to study the change in regulation of pH homeostasis with neoplastic progression. Cytoplasmic buffer capacity (βi) is an important mechanism to maintain pHi at a constant level during acute pHi displacements. The response of the relation of βi to pHi (33.Boron W.F. DeWeer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) in serum deprived and nondeprived cells for each cell line was measured next. As can be seen in Fig. 2, all three cell lines had a linear relationship of βi to intracellular pH. Serum deprivation had a strong negative impact on the βi of the normal cells, reducing the slope of the curve by about 4-fold, whereas in both tumor cell lines the relationship of βi versus pHiwas unaffected. All studies were conducted in nominally HCO3−free HEPES-buffered solutions to measure only the Na+/H+ exchanger. BCECF-loaded cells initially perfused with HEPES-buffered, bicarbonate-free Na+ medium were exposed for 5 min to 20 mm NH4Cl. The medium was replaced by a Na+-free,n-methylglucamine chloride solution resulting in an acidification of the cytoplasm. When the cells reached a stable acid pHi, the addition of Na+ medium produced a rapid rise in pHi, and the initial rate of cellular pHi-recovery (dpHi/dt) was determined. In all three cell lines pHi recovery was completely inhibited by 2 μm5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), a specific inhibitor of NHE (data not shown). Fig. 3illustrates representative experiments comparing pHi recovery in serum deprived (D) and nondeprived (ND) monolayers in all three cell lines at 135 mm external sodium. As can be seen in MCF-10A cells, 24 h of deprivation resulted in a reduction in dpHi/dt, whereas 24 h of deprivation in both the tumor cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435) stimulated dpHi/dt. The Na+/H+ exchanger activity from the initial pHi recovery was then calculated as H+ extrusion rate from the βi as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average alteration in Na+/H+exchanger activity in all three cell lines with different times of serum deprivation is shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the inhibition of transport activity in the normal cells (MCF-10A, inset) was already maximum by 8 h of serum removal. In the two tumor cell lines serum deprivation-dependent up-regulation of NHE activity differed in both the time course of stimulation and in amplitude. The cells derived from a primary tumor (MCF-7, lightly dotted bar) had their maximum response at two days of deprivation with approximately a 1.65-fold increase over nondeprived cells. The malignant cells (MDA-MB-435, stippled bar) had a later maximum response (three days) and a greater stimulation of activity at all time points with a maximum stimulation of almost 3-fold over nondeprived cells. The data demonstrate that tumor cells have an opposite response than normal cells to serum deprivation and that the extent of the tumor-specific response increases with increasing neoplastic state. To determine if the observed changes in V max are dependent on a change in transporter expression, the effect of serum deprivation on the expression and glycosylation state of the NHE1 isoform in the three cell lines was analyzed by Western blot of this isoform in a crude membrane fraction using antibodies generated against a fusion protein of NHE1 (38.Siczkowski M. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C745-C752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane protein was loaded in equal amounts (60 μg) from all three cell lines and treatments (Fig.5 A). The antibody recognized a protein in all three cell lines. Although the amount of protein decreased with increasing neoplastic state (Fig. 5 B), serum deprivation did not result in any change in NHE1 protein expression. Although glycosylation did not change with serum deprivation, the relative level of glycosylation of NHE1 was reduced with the increased neoplastic"

We have solved this problem by employing a short, symmetrical, heteropolymeric RNA primer-template that we refer to as “sym/sub.” Formation of 3Dpol-sym/sub complexes is slow owing to a slow rate of association (0.1 μm−1 s−1) of 3Dpol and sym/sub and a slow isomerization (0.076 s−1) of the 3Dpol-sym/sub complex that is a prerequisite for catalytic competence of this complex. Complex assembly is stoichiometric under conditions in which competing reactions, such as enzyme inactivation, are eliminated. Inactivation of 3Dpol occurs at a maximal rate of 0.051 s−1 at 22 °C in reaction buffer lacking nucleotide. At this temperature, ATP protects 3Dpol against inactivation with aK 0.5 of 37 μm.

In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, these processes are catalyzed by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).1 Specific inhibitors of the RdRP should serve as potent antiviral agents. Indeed, inhibitors of viral DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptase (RT) are used clinically to treat infection by herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus (1.Elion G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983; 12 Suppl. B: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.De Clercq E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 724: 438-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Of course, cellular polymerases are also potential targets for antiviral chemotherapeutics that inhibit viral polymerases. Therefore, target specificity is of central importance to the development of clinically useful compounds. In some cases, drug activation only occurs in virus-infected cells thereby increasing specificity and diminishing toxicity (1.Elion G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983; 12 Suppl. B: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In others, however, infected cell-specific, activation mechanisms are not an option, and other approaches are required (2.De Clercq E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The “structural era” for the RdRP has begun with the recent solution of the x-ray crystal structure for the RdRP from poliovirus, 3Dpol (29.Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For this reason, poliovirus 3Dpol is the ideal model system to use in the study of RdRP function. Unfortunately, detailed, mechanistic information regarding 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation is sparse. The existing gap derives from the inability to assemble stoichiometrically 3Dpol-primer-template complexes that permit nucleotide incorporation to be followed by extension of end-labeled primers.Previous studies of 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation that utilized short, heteropolymeric RNA primer-templates as substrates demonstrated that this enzyme binds to primer-template such that some enzyme has the 3′-OH from the “primer” strand in the catalytic center (“correct” orientation) and some enzyme has the 3′-OH from the “template” strand in the catalytic center (“incorrect” orientation) (30.Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When bound in the “incorrect” orientation, 3Dpol adds non-templated nucleotides to the blunt end of primer-template (30.Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Of course, heterogeneous binding of 3Dpol to primer-template further complicates mechanistic analysis of this enzyme. In this report, we demonstrate that the use of a symmetrical primer-template substrate (sym/sub) permits the assembly of stable, elongation-competent 3Dpol-primer-template complexes. The sym/sub system will facilitate quantitative analysis of the kinetics and mechanism of 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation.DISCUSSION -We have used a symmetrical primer-template substrate (sym/sub) to assemble stable, elongation-competent 3Dpol-sym/sub complexes suitable for analysis of the kinetics and mechanism of nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by this enzyme. Our current model for the mechanism of 3Dpol-sym/sub complex assembly is presented in Scheme FS1. 3Dpol undergoes iterative cycles of binding and release of sym/sub until the complex isomerizes into a catalytically competent elongation complex. After each cycle of dissociation, enzyme inactivation can occur. 3Dpolinactivation results in substoichiometric assembly of elongation complexes. The fraction of enzyme that will be inactivated during the assembly process depends upon the partitioning between the two pathways. Maximizing the rate of 3Dpol-sym/sub complex formation and minimizing the rate of 3Dpol inactivation will permit stoichiometric assembly of elongation complexes. By using concentrations of sym/sub in a range greater than or equal to 10 μm, the rate of assembly will be maximized (Fig.9 B). By assembling complexes at lower temperatures in the presence of nucleotide, the rate of 3Dpol inactivation will be minimized (Fig. 4). It may also be possible to assemble complexes efficiently by using Mn2+ as the divalent cation cofactor and then diluting these mixtures into Mg2+-containing buffer to prevent error-prone RNA synthesis (Fig. 1 and Ref. 30.Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Once complexes form, they are very stable (Fig. 6 A), support a fast rate of nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 7), and produce complexes that are significantly more stable than the initial complex (Fig.6 B). The rate of complex disassembly limits the rate of primer utilization (Fig. 8). The rate of complex disassembly is faster from the end of template than from internal positions (Fig. 8). Therefore, the number of primers utilized during the course of a reaction can be increased by following incorporation of all four nucleotides instead of a single nucleotide.We were also able to fit the data by using an alternative model with a slow association step without a conformational change step. In this case, the rate constant for association was 0.035 μm−1 s−1, and the rate constant for dissociation was that measured directly, 0.0006 s−1(Fig. 6). However, in order to obtain a good fit, it was necessary to reduce artificially the concentration of sym/sub employed from 0.5 to 0.4 μm. We observe stoichiometric (0.5 μm) utilization of sym/sub in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig.1 C). This observation confirms that all of the substrate is competent for primer extension. Kinetic simulation should always be constrained by parameters determined empirically. Therefore, this model was not considered further. Attempts were also made to add a monomer-oligomer equilibrium to the mechanism in order to fit the kinetics of assembly in the presence of excess (5 μm) 3Dpol (Fig. 9 A). These attempts failed owing to the lack of empirical data (and corresponding constraints) to describe this reaction. Direct analysis of 3Dpol oligomerization should provide information necessary to explore this possibility more rigorously.Whether the mechanism of assembly described herein can be related to initiation of transcription or replication in vivo remains to be determined. These studies employ an artificial primer-template; therefore, the kinetic scheme and associated parameters may only be relevant for the model system. The kinetic properties may be different for a reaction of the polymerase with a natural template in the presence of other protein factors. Replication of the poliovirus genome initiates within the poly(A)-tract at the 3′-end of genomic RNA from a complex comprising viral factors 3AB, 3B (VPg), 3CD, and 3Dpol (Fig. 10) (36.Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Once 3Dpol initiates RNA synthesis from the protein primer, an elongation-competent complex is formed. As indicated in Fig. 10, a single template is thought to support multiple, continuous cycles of initiation. The nascent RNA chain is only annealed to template over a short distance, and the RNA is spooled through a channel formed by the polymerase (37.Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). Whether or not a helicase is required to disrupt base pairing between template and nascent RNA is not known.We hypothesize that 3Dpol-sym/sub complexes mimic complexes formed during elongation of poliovirus plus- and minus-strand RNAs by 3Dpol (Fig. 10). In support of this hypothesis is the observation that a 3Dpol derivative with an amino acid substitution in conserved structural motif B that has less than a 2-fold reduction in poly(rU) polymerase activity but a 15-fold reduction in the observed rate of elongation measured by using the sym/sub system produces virus with significantly impaired growth properties relative to wild-type virus. 3S. Crotty, J. J. Arnold, D. W. Gohara, R. Andino, and C. E. Cameron, unpublished observations. Moreover, the rate of nucleotide incorporation into sym/sub and stability of the 3Dpol-sym/sub complex predicts processive replication of the complete genome by a single polymerase molecule in approximately 100 s. This value is in agreement with the value of 45 s measured in vivo (37.Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). As long as 3Dpol can proceed along the template unimpeded by RNA secondary structure, additional factors may not be required to assist in elongation.Within infected cells, replication occurs in spherical compartments formed by virus-induced vesicles that are 0.5 μm in diameter (38.Bolten R. Egger D. Gosert R. Schaub G. Landmann L. Bienz K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8578-8585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This diameter predicts a volume of 0.065 μm3. Enclosure of as few as 10 RNA molecules within this structure would correspond to a concentration in the micromolar range. Nonstructural proteins, such as 3Dpol, are present in a 1:1 stoichiometry with structural proteins that are required in 60-fold molar excess of RNA for virion assembly (37.Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration of 3Dpol within replication complexes will also be in the micromolar range. However, metabolic labeling experiments have shown that in virus-infected cells the polymerase subunit can be found in precursor (P3 and 3CD) and processed forms (3Dpol and 3D′). 3D′ is a proteolytic fragment of 3Dpol that presumably lacks polymerase activity. The ratio of P3:3CD:3Dpol:3D′ is 2:4:1:1 after a 10-min labeling period, thus reducing the concentration of 3Dpol available for transcription and replication. We conclude that the concentration of sym/sub and 3Dpolemployed in this study is in the biologically relevant range. In addition, the calculated K d value (k +1/k −1, Table IV) of 1 μm for sym/sub reported herein along with the micromolarK m and K d values for nucleic acid reported previously by us (30.Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34.Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and others (39.Beckman M.T.L. Kirkegaard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6724-6730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are in a physiological range. Despite the fact that polymerase is present in excess of RNA and both are in the micromolar range, given an association rate constant of 0.1 μm−1s−1, it is possible that formation of the initial 3Dpol-sym/sub complex could be the rate-limiting step for initiation.In vivo, the density of polymerase molecules on any template has been determined to be ∼6–8 (37.Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). If it takes 100 s for the polymerase to traverse the entire genome, then this would set a lower limit of 0.06–0.08 s−1 on the rate of initiation. This value is remarkably close to that measured for the rate of the conformational change step (0.076 s−1) in our model for assembly. This conformational change after binding of sym/sub to 3Dpol may reflect repositioning of the primer strand into the “exit channel” for nascent RNA. Such reorganization could maximize polymerase-nucleic acid interactions. Indeed, this isomerization greatly enhances the stability of this complex; the rate constant for dissociation is decreased from 0.1 s−1 to 0.0006 s−1. This difference corresponds to at least 5 kcal/mol, consistent with the formation of 5–10 hydrogen bonds. A conformational change upon complete occupancy of the polymerase nucleic acid-binding site by single-stranded RNA has also been proposed by Kirkegaard and colleagues (39.Beckman M.T.L. Kirkegaard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6724-6730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Perhaps a conformational change that positions the protein primer into the exit channel limits and regulates the rate of initiation in vivo. An alternative possibility for the conformational change step observed kinetically comes from structural studies of the RdRP from hepatitis C virus (40.Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains exist in this enzyme which completely encircle the catalytic center of the enzyme. Similar interactions should be possible for 3Dpol; therefore, the observed conformational change step may reflect “closing” of the enzyme. The increased stability of this complex would derive from the additional interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains.The steady-state kinetic experiments (Fig. 8) were performed by using excess sym/sub; therefore, the y intercept reflects the active concentration of enzyme used in the reaction. The value measured in all cases was 80% of the value expected based on the concentration determined by absorbance at 280 nm (31.Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Ghosh S.K.B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The value of 80% was also corroborated by the assembly experiments shown in Fig. 9 B. That 20% was inactive was supported by the necessity to consider this species in our modeling of the kinetics of assembly in reactions that vary 3Dpol concentration (Fig. 9 A). Taken together, these data suggest that a 3Dpol monomer is an active form of the enzyme. Oligomerization of this enzyme clearly can occur in the presence and absence of nucleic acid (29.Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39.Beckman M.T.L. Kirkegaard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6724-6730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutations in 3Dpol-coding sequence that are predicted to shift the monomer-oligomer equilibrium in favor of monomer render the virus inviable (41.Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 863-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that sym/sub binding to 3Dpol oligomers produces catalytically inactive complexes, thus precluding quantitative assembly of active complexes when a high concentration of 3Dpol is employed (Fig. 9 A). In addition, it is possible that the inactive fraction (20%) observed at 1 μm 3Dpol may represent an oligomeric species. The role of 3Dpol oligomerization in vivo remains elusive and warrants continued investigation.Consistent with previous results (30.Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), 3Dpol incorporates 2′- and 3′-dNMPs (Table III). During the first cycle of incorporation, NTP/2′-dNTP selection is low (121-fold) relative to 2′-dNTP/NTP selection by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (103-106-fold) from Escherichia coli(42.Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and reverse transcriptase (105-fold) from human immunodeficiency virus (7.Zinnen S. Hsieh J.-C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24195-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, NTP/2′-dNTP selection is similar to that observed for the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (80-fold) from bacteriophage T7 (43.Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Incorporation of 2′-dNMPsin vivo should be minimized by the low cytosolic availability of dNTPs relative to rNTPs. Of course, active mechanisms that preclude single and/or multiple cycles of dNMP incorporation cannot be ruled out at this time (30.Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whether the observed NTP/2′-dNTP selection is a ground state, transition state, or combined effect requires another study but can be determined by using the sym/sub system. In addition, elucidation of the structural basis for NTP/dNTP selection should be facilitated by using the sym/sub system.The use of the sym/sub system to study 3Dpol will advance our understanding of the RdRP to the level of the other classes of nucleic acid polymerase. The sym/sub system should be useful for the analysis of other RdRPs, especially members of the supergroup I family (44.Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2197-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). We have used this substrate to identify and characterize the active form of the feline calicivirus polymerase. 4L. Wei, K. Green, and C. E. Cameron, unpublished results. In contrast, the RdRPs from bovine viral diarrhea virus and hepatitis C virus, members of the supergroup II family (44.Koonin E.V. J. Gen.

Critical to the multiplication of all viruses are transcription and replication of the viral genome. In the case of positive-strand RNA viruses, these processes are catalyzed by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).1 Specific inhibitors of the RdRP should serve as potent antiviral agents. Indeed, inhibitors of viral DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptase (RT) are used clinically to treat infection by herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus (1.Elion G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983; 12 Suppl. B: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.De Clercq E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 724: 438-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Of course, cellular polymerases are also potential targets for antiviral chemotherapeutics that inhibit viral polymerases. Therefore, target specificity is of central importance to the development of clinically useful compounds. In some cases, drug activation only occurs in virus-infected cells thereby increasing specificity and diminishing toxicity (1.Elion G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983; 12 Suppl. B: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In others, however, infected cell-specific, activation mechanisms are not an option, and other approaches are required (2.De Clercq E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

https://openalex.org/W2065547399,"EmrE is an Escherichia coli 12-kDa protein that confers resistance to toxic compounds, by actively removing them in exchange with protons. The protein includes eight charged residues. Seven of these residues are located in the hydrophilic loops and can be replaced with either Cys or another amino acid bearing the same charge, without impairing transport activity. Glu-14 is the only charged residue in the membrane domain and is conserved in all the proteins of the family. We show here that this residue is the site of action of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a carbodiimide known to act in hydrophobic environments. When Glu-14 was replaced with either Cys or Asp, resistance was abolished. Whereas the E14C mutant displays no transport activity, the E14D protein shows efflux and exchange at rates about 30-50% that of the wild type. The maximal DeltapH-driven uptake rate of E14D is only 10% that of the wild type. The mutant shows a different pH profile in all the transport modes. Our results support the notion that Glu-14 is an essential part of a binding domain shared by substrates and protons but mutually exclusive in time. This notion provides the molecular basis for the obligatory exchange catalyzed by EmrE."

Transient kinetic studies show that the conversion of Fe3+-heme to Fe3+-verdoheme is biphasic. Electron transfer to the heme (0.11 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.49 s−1 at 25 °C) followed by rapid O2 binding yields the ferrous dioxy complex. Transfer of an electron (0.056 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.21 s−1 at 25 °C) to this complex triggers the formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme and its subsequent O2-dependent fragmentation to Fe3+-verdoheme. The conversion of Fe3+-verdoheme to Fe3+-biliverdin is also biphasic. Thus, reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+-verdoheme (0.15 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.55 s−1 at 25 °C) followed by O2 binding and an electron transfer produces Fe3+-biliverdin (0.025 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.10 s−1 at 25 °C). The conversion of Fe3+-biliverdin to free biliverdin is triphasic. Reduction of Fe3+-biliverdin (0.035 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.15 s−1 at 25 °C), followed by rapid release of Fe2+ (0.19 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.39 s−1 at 25 °C), yields the biliverdin-enzyme complex from which biliverdin slowly dissociates (0.007 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.03 s−1 at 25 °C). The rate of Fe2+ release agrees with the rate of Fe3+-biliverdin reduction. Fe2+ release clearly precedes biliverdin dissociation. In the absence of biliverdin reductase, biliverdin release is the rate-limiting step, but in its presence biliverdin release is accelerated and the overall rate of heme degradation is limited by the conversion of Fe2+-verdoheme to the Fe3+-biliverdin.

The enzyme, which employs heme as both the prosthetic group and substrate, regiospecifically oxidizes the heme at the α-mesoposition. This enzyme is physiologically important, in part because of the biological properties of its organic reaction products. Biliverdin is reduced by biliverdin reductase to bilirubin, which is then excreted as the glucuronic acid conjugate (2.Schmid R. McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 6. Academic Press, New York1979: 257-292Google Scholar). The excretion of bilirubin is frequently impaired in newborn children as well as in individuals with genetic glucuronyltransferase deficiencies (3.Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 203-266Google Scholar). High concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin are neurotoxic, and the prevention of its accumulation through phototherapy or inhibition of heme oxygenase is of clinical importance (4.Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M.

Recovery of both the iron-histidine coordination and full catalytic activity when imidazole binds to the heme·H25A mutant confirms the role of His-25 as the proximal iron ligand (23.Wilks A. Sun J.

The intermediates and reaction steps involved in the formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme and its subsequent conversion to verdoheme have been the focus of several studies (18.Wilks A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-meso-Hydroxylation, the first step, proceeds via a P450 reductase-dependent reduction of the iron to the ferrous state, binding of oxygen to the reduced iron, and a second one-electron reduction of the ferrous-dioxy complex (28.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The resulting ferric peroxide complex undergoes electrophilic addition of the distal oxygen to the porphyrin ring to yield α-meso-hydroxyheme (28.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The α-meso-hydroxyheme exists as a resonance mixture of the Fe(III) phenolate, Fe(III) keto anion, and Fe(II) π neutral radical. Oxygen rapidly reacts with the Fe(II) π neutral radical structure, via as yet undetected intermediates, to give Fe3+-verdoheme (29.Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even less is known about the reaction intermediates involved in the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin. Yoshida and Kikuchi (35.Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the reconstituted heme·HO-1 complex was oxidized to the Fe3+-biliverdin complex instead of free biliverdin when ascorbate was used as a surrogate-reducing agent. The Fe3+-biliverdin thus obtained was readily converted to free biliverdin when NADPH and P450 reductase were added (35.Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not establish that the ferric complex is a true precursor of biliverdin in the P450 reductase-dependent oxidation of heme by heme oxygenase.Through the use of stopped-flow spectroscopy, we provide here kinetic and spectroscopic evidence on the reaction steps involved in the conversion of Fe3+-verdoheme to biliverdin. Our findings indicate that Fe3+-verdoheme is first reduced to Fe2+-verdoheme, which upon binding of oxygen and transfer of a second electron is converted to the Fe3+-biliverdin complex. One-electron reduction of the Fe3+-biliverdin complex by P450 reductase is followed by release of the ferrous iron atom. In the final step of the catalytic cycle, the metal-free biliverdin dissociates from the enzyme. Determination of the rate constants for formation of verdoheme, Fe3+-biliverdin, and the subsequent steps of the reaction establish that biliverdin dissociation is the rate-limiting step in the heme degradation pathway in the absence of biliverdin reductase. In the presence of biliverdin reductase, the overall rate of heme degradation appears to be limited by the conversion of Fe2+-verdoheme to Fe3+-biliverdin.DISCUSSIONHeme oxygenase catalyzes a complicated reaction sequence that proceeds through two well defined intermediates, consumes three molecules of O2 and five electrons provided by P450 reductase, and releases three physiologically active products. The well defined intermediates are α-meso-hydroxyheme and verdoheme, and the three physiologically relevant products are iron, CO, and biliverdin. Intermediates other than these two are likely to exist, but none have been identified.The conversion of heme to α-meso-hydroxyheme requires reduction of the heme from the ferric to the ferrous state, binding of O2, uptake of a second electron to give a ferric peroxide complex, and electrophilic addition of the peroxide to the porphyrin ring. The subsequent conversion of α-meso-hydroxyheme to ferric verdoheme requires a molecule of O2 but no other cofactor (29.Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, although not required, α-meso-hydroxyheme could possibly be reduced to the ferrous state prior to formation of verdoheme, in which case the verdoheme is obtained in the ferrous rather than ferric state (33.Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two rate constants have been determined that encompass the sequence of steps from heme to ferric verdoheme: k 1, the rate of conversion of the ferric HO-heme complex to the ferrous dioxy complex, and k 2, the rate of conversion of the ferrous dioxy HO·heme complex to the ferric verdoheme complex. The rate constant k 1 (0.11 and 0.49 s−1at 4 and 25 °C, respectively) actually describes the rate of reduction of the ferric to the ferrous heme complex because O2 binding has been reported from flash photolysis studies to be very fast (40.Migita C.T. Matera K.M. Ikeda-Saito M. Olson J.S. Fujii H. Yoshimura T. Zhou H. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 945-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The rate constant k 2(0.056 and 0.21 s−1 at 4 and 25 °C, respectively) probably corresponds to the rate of reduction of the ferrous dioxy heme complex because conversion of α-meso-hydroxyheme to verdoheme reportedly occurs within the dead time of a stopped-flow instrument (33.Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The failure of any spectroscopically detectable intermediate to accumulate between the ferrous dioxy and ferric verdoheme complexes is consistent with assignment ofk 2 to reduction of the ferrous dioxy complex.Conversion of the ferric verdoheme to the ferric biliverdin complex has been dissected into two kinetic steps. In the first step, the HO·verdoheme complex is reduced from the ferric to the ferrous state at a rate given by k 3 (0.15 and 0.55 s−1 at 4 and 25 °C, respectively). In the second step, characterized by the rate constant k 4 (0.025 and 0.10 s−1 at 4 and 25 °C, respectively), the ferrous HO·verdoheme complex is converted to the ferric biliverdin complex. The rate constant k 4 thus includes an O2 binding step and whatever intermediates intervene in cleavage of the verdoheme ring system, none of which accumulate in measurable amounts.The rate constants for the final steps of the catalytic process have been teased out in greater detail. Thus, reduction of the HO·ferric biliverdin complex is given by k 5, loss of the ferrous iron to give the metal-free biliverdin complex byk 6, and dissociation of the biliverdin from HO to regenerate the free enzyme by k 7. The values for these rate constants are 0.035, 0.19, and 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.15, 0.39, and 0.03 s−1 at 25 °C. These results provide the first clear evidence that iron release precedes biliverdin release and that the iron is released in the ferrous rather than ferric state. This is evident from the rate constants for ferrous iron release (k 6 = 0.19 s−1 at 4 °C) and biliverdin release (k 7 = 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C) and the fact that the ferric biliverdin complex does not dissociate in the time frame of the present experiments. The release of iron in the ferrous state may be physiologically important. Ferrous iron is suitable for uptake into normal transport and storage sites, whereas ferric iron has a low solubility and must be reduced before it can be similarly processed (41.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). It has been reported that in HO-1 knockout mice iron accumulates in liver and kidney and is associated with increased oxidative damage at the same time that the fraction of iron in hemoglobin decreases (42.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The first report of a human with a heme oxygenase deficiency suggests that a similar derangement of iron homeostasis is present (43.Yachie A. Niida Y. Wada T. Igarashi N. Kaneda H. Toma T. Ohta K. Kasahara Y. Koizumi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the absence of heme oxygenase heme is degraded in inappropriate compartments or by non-physiological, peroxidative pathways that release ferric iron in a form unsuitable for efficient physiological utilization.The rate-limiting step in the single turnover of heme oxygenase is dissociation of biliverdin from the protein. The rate constantk 7 = 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C for biliverdin dissociation is one-third as large ask 4 = 0.025 s−1, the next smallest rate constant. A similar difference is observed at 25 °C. However, at least two other factors may alter the rate-limiting step. First, the rate of binding of heme to HO-1, if slow, could limit catalytic turnover. The physiological rate of heme binding is difficult to ascertain because it is difficult to define the concentration of heme and whether it is free or bound to proteins. Second, under physiological conditions, heme oxygenase turnover occurs in the presence of biliverdin reductase, and interactions with this second protein could alter the enzyme kinetics. Indeed, we show here that biliverdin reductase accelerates biliverdin release sufficiently that the rate-limiting step becomes the conversion of ferrous verdoheme to ferric biliverdin (k 4). The increase in the biliverdin dissociation rate caused by interaction of heme oxygenase with biliverdin reductase presumably involves an allosteric weakening of the binding of biliverdin to HO-1 or even a direct transfer of biliverdin from HO-1 to biliverdin reductase. The crystal structure of human HO-1 indicates that the heme is bound in a cleft with an edge exposed to the solvent (27.Schuller D. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential of the amino acids surrounding the cleft and exposed heme edge is positive. This led to the proposal that P450 reductase, which is negatively charged (44.Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), binds directly over the exposed heme edge. It is possible that biliverdin reductase binds in a similar manner and helps to extract the biliverdin product. However, efforts to demonstrate that heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase form a stable complex have been unsuccessful,2 indicating that any such protein-protein interaction is transient.In sum, the rate constants for seven steps in the heme oxygenase catalytic sequence have been determined in single turnover studies by stopped-flow spectroscopy. The final steps have been shown to involve mandatory reduction of the heme oxygenase ferric biliverdin complex, release of ferrous iron, and release of iron-free biliverdin. The last step of this sequence is the slowest, but it is accelerated in the presence of biliverdin reductase so that reduction of verdoheme becomes the rate-limiting step. This finding suggests that biliverdin reductase exerts an allosteric or direct effect on biliverdin release via some form of protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, release of ferrous rather than ferric iron may be an important feature of heme oxygenase catalysis in terms of the iron homeostasis of the organism. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the NADPH and P450 reductase-dependent oxidation of heme1 to biliverdin, iron, and CO (1.Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). The enzyme, which employs heme as both the prosthetic group and substrate, regiospecifically oxidizes the heme at the α-mesoposition. This enzyme is physiologically important, in part because of the biological properties of its organic reaction products. Biliverdin is reduced by biliverdin reductase to bilirubin, which is then excreted as the glucuronic acid conjugate (2.Schmid R. McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 6. Academic Press, New York1979: 257-292Google Scholar). The excretion of bilirubin is frequently impaired in newborn children as well as in individuals with genetic glucuronyltransferase deficiencies (3.Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 203-266Google Scholar). High concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin are neurotoxic, and the prevention of its accumulation through phototherapy or inhibition of heme oxygenase is of clinical importance (4.Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M.

CO, the other organic product of heme oxygenase, appears to play a role akin to nitric oxide as a signaling molecule (7.Verma A. Hirsch D.L. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 8.Stevens C.F. Wang Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 9.Zhuo M. Small S.A. Kandel E.R.

A role for CO in signaling pathways has received strong support from recent studies with heme oxygenase knockout mice (10.Burnett A.L. Johns D.G. Kriegsfield L.J. Klein S.L. Calvin D.C. Demas G.E.

The existence of two heme oxygenase isoforms, HO-1 and HO-2, is well established (12.Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). HO-1 is induced by chemical agents and a variety of stress conditions and is found in highest concentration in the spleen and liver. HO-2 is not induced by exogenous stimuli and is found in highest concentrations in the brain and testes. The heme oxygenases are membrane-bound proteins (16.Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Müller R.M.

Replacement of the proximal histidine residue by an alanine produces a catalytically inactive protein that binds heme without providing a strong axial iron ligand (22.Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recovery of both the iron-histidine coordination and full catalytic activity when imidazole binds to the heme·H25A mutant confirms the role of His-25 as the proximal iron ligand (23.Wilks A. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2925-2926Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The assignment of His-25 as the proximal iron ligand is confirmed by the human HO-1 crystal structure (27.Schuller D. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The HO-1-catalyzed oxidation of heme involves sequential α-meso-hydroxylation, oxygen-dependent fragmentation of the α-meso-hydroxyheme to verdoheme, and oxidative cleavage of verdoheme to biliverdin (28.Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

The intermediates and reaction steps involved in the formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme and its subsequent conversion to verdoheme have been the focus of several studies (18.Wilks A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-meso-Hydroxylation, the first step, proceeds via a P450 reductase-dependent reduction of the iron to the ferrous state, binding of oxygen to the reduced iron, and a second one-electron reduction of the ferrous-dioxy complex (28.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The resulting ferric peroxide complex undergoes electrophilic addition of the distal oxygen to the porphyrin ring to yield α-meso-hydroxyheme (28.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The α-meso-hydroxyheme exists as a resonance mixture of the Fe(III) phenolate, Fe(III) keto anion, and Fe(II) π neutral radical. Oxygen rapidly reacts with the Fe(II) π neutral radical structure, via as yet undetected intermediates, to give Fe3+-verdoheme (29.Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even less is known about the reaction intermediates involved in the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin. Yoshida and Kikuchi (35.Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the reconstituted heme·HO-1 complex was oxidized to the Fe3+-biliverdin complex instead of free biliverdin when ascorbate was used as a surrogate-reducing agent. The Fe3+-biliverdin thus obtained was readily converted to free biliverdin when NADPH and P450 reductase were added (35.Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not establish that the ferric complex is a true precursor of biliverdin in the P450 reductase-dependent oxidation of heme by heme oxygenase. Through the use of stopped-flow spectroscopy, we provide here kinetic and spectroscopic evidence on the reaction steps involved in the conversion of Fe3+-verdoheme to biliverdin. Our findings indicate that Fe3+-verdoheme is first reduced to Fe2+-verdoheme, which upon binding of oxygen and transfer of a second electron is converted to the Fe3+-biliverdin complex. One-electron reduction of the Fe3+-biliverdin complex by P450 reductase is followed by release of the ferrous iron atom. In the final step of the catalytic cycle, the metal-free biliverdin dissociates from the enzyme. Determination of the rate constants for formation of verdoheme, Fe3+-biliverdin, and the subsequent steps of the reaction establish that biliverdin dissociation is the rate-limiting step in the heme degradation pathway in the absence of biliverdin reductase. In the presence of biliverdin reductase, the overall rate of heme degradation appears to be limited by the conversion of Fe2+-verdoheme to Fe3+-biliverdin. DISCUSSIONHeme oxygenase catalyzes a complicated reaction sequence that proceeds through two well defined intermediates, consumes three molecules of O2 and five electrons provided by P450 reductase, and releases three physiologically active products. The well defined intermediates are α-meso-hydroxyheme and verdoheme, and the three physiologically relevant products are iron, CO, and biliverdin. Intermediates other than these two are likely to exist, but none have been identified.The conversion of heme to α-meso-hydroxyheme requires reduction of the heme from the ferric to the ferrous state, binding of O2, uptake of a second electron to give a ferric peroxide complex, and electrophilic addition of the peroxide to the porphyrin ring. The subsequent conversion of α-meso-hydroxyheme to ferric verdoheme requires a molecule of O2 but no other cofactor (29.Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, although not required, α-meso-hydroxyheme could possibly be reduced to the ferrous state prior to formation of verdoheme, in which case the verdoheme is obtained in the ferrous rather than ferric state (33.Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two rate constants have been determined that encompass the sequence of steps from heme to ferric verdoheme: k 1, the rate of conversion of the ferric HO-heme complex to the ferrous dioxy complex, and k 2, the rate of conversion of the ferrous dioxy HO·heme complex to the ferric verdoheme complex. The rate constant k 1 (0.11 and 0.49 s−1at 4 and 25 °C, respectively) actually describes the rate of reduction of the ferric to the ferrous heme complex because O2 binding has been reported from flash photolysis studies to be very fast (40.Migita C.T. Matera K.M. Ikeda-Saito M. Olson J.S. Fujii H. Yoshimura T. Zhou H. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 945-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The rate constant k 2(0.056 and 0.21 s−1 at 4 and 25 °C, respectively) probably corresponds to the rate of reduction of the ferrous dioxy heme complex because conversion of α-meso-hydroxyheme to verdoheme reportedly occurs within the dead time of a stopped-flow instrument (33.Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The failure of any spectroscopically detectable intermediate to accumulate between the ferrous dioxy and ferric verdoheme complexes is consistent with assignment ofk 2 to reduction of the ferrous dioxy complex.Conversion of the ferric verdoheme to the ferric biliverdin complex has been dissected into two kinetic steps. In the first step, the HO·verdoheme complex is reduced from the ferric to the ferrous state at a rate given by k 3 (0.15 and 0.55 s−1 at 4 and 25 °C, respectively). In the second step, characterized by the rate constant k 4 (0.025 and 0.10 s−1 at 4 and 25 °C, respectively), the ferrous HO·verdoheme complex is converted to the ferric biliverdin complex. The rate constant k 4 thus includes an O2 binding step and whatever intermediates intervene in cleavage of the verdoheme ring system, none of which accumulate in measurable amounts.The rate constants for the final steps of the catalytic process have been teased out in greater detail. Thus, reduction of the HO·ferric biliverdin complex is given by k 5, loss of the ferrous iron to give the metal-free biliverdin complex byk 6, and dissociation of the biliverdin from HO to regenerate the free enzyme by k 7. The values for these rate constants are 0.035, 0.19, and 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.15, 0.39, and 0.03 s−1 at 25 °C. These results provide the first clear evidence that iron release precedes biliverdin release and that the iron is released in the ferrous rather than ferric state. This is evident from the rate constants for ferrous iron release (k 6 = 0.19 s−1 at 4 °C) and biliverdin release (k 7 = 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C) and the fact that the ferric biliverdin complex does not dissociate in the time frame of the present experiments. The release of iron in the ferrous state may be physiologically important. Ferrous iron is suitable for uptake into normal transport and storage sites, whereas ferric iron has a low solubility and must be reduced before it can be similarly processed (41.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). It has been reported that in HO-1 knockout mice iron accumulates in liver and kidney and is associated with increased oxidative damage at the same time that the fraction of iron in hemoglobin decreases (42.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The first report of a human with a heme oxygenase deficiency suggests that a similar derangement of iron homeostasis is present (43.Yachie A. Niida Y. Wada T. Igarashi N. Kaneda H. Toma T. Ohta K. Kasahara Y. Koizumi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the absence of heme oxygenase heme is degraded in inappropriate compartments or by non-physiological, peroxidative pathways that release ferric iron in a form unsuitable for efficient physiological utilization.The rate-limiting step in the single turnover of heme oxygenase is dissociation of biliverdin from the protein. The rate constantk 7 = 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C for biliverdin dissociation is one-third as large ask 4 = 0.025 s−1, the next smallest rate constant. A similar difference is observed at 25 °C.

The values for these rate constants are 0.035, 0.19, and 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C and 0.15, 0.39, and 0.03 s−1 at 25 °C. These results provide the first clear evidence that iron release precedes biliverdin release and that the iron is released in the ferrous rather than ferric state. This is evident from the rate constants for ferrous iron release (k 6 = 0.19 s−1 at 4 °C) and biliverdin release (k 7 = 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C) and the fact that the ferric biliverdin complex does not dissociate in the time frame of the present experiments. The release of iron in the ferrous state may be physiologically important. Ferrous iron is suitable for uptake into normal transport and storage sites, whereas ferric iron has a low solubility and must be reduced before it can be similarly processed (41.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). It has been reported that in HO-1 knockout mice iron accumulates in liver and kidney and is associated with increased oxidative damage at the same time that the fraction of iron in hemoglobin decreases (42.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The first report of a human with a heme oxygenase deficiency suggests that a similar derangement of iron homeostasis is present (43.Yachie A. Niida Y. Wada T. Igarashi N. Kaneda H. Toma T. Ohta K. Kasahara Y. Koizumi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the absence of heme oxygenase heme is degraded in inappropriate compartments or by non-physiological, peroxidative pathways that release ferric iron in a form unsuitable for efficient physiological utilization. The rate-limiting step in the single turnover of heme oxygenase is dissociation of biliverdin from the protein. The rate constantk 7 = 0.007 s−1 at 4 °C for biliverdin dissociation is one-third as large ask 4 = 0.025 s−1, the next smallest rate constant. A similar difference is observed at 25 °C. However, at least two other factors may alter the rate-limiting step. First, the rate of binding of heme to HO-1, if slow, could limit catalytic turnover. The physiological rate of heme binding is difficult to ascertain because it is difficult to define the concentration of heme and whether it is free or bound to proteins. Second, under physiological conditions, heme oxygenase turnover occurs in the presence of biliverdin reductase, and interactions with this second protein could alter the enzyme kinetics. Indeed, we show here that biliverdin reductase accelerates biliverdin release sufficiently that the rate-limiting step becomes the conversion of ferrous verdoheme to ferric biliverdin (k 4). The increase in the biliverdin dissociation rate caused by interaction of heme oxygenase with biliverdin reductase presumably involves an allosteric weakening of the binding of biliverdin to HO-1 or even a direct transfer of biliverdin from HO-1 to biliverdin reductase. The crystal structure of human HO-1 indicates that the heme is bound in a cleft with an edge exposed to the solvent (27.Schuller D. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential of the amino acids surrounding the cleft and exposed heme edge is positive. This led to the proposal that P450 reductase, which is negatively charged (44.Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), binds directly over the exposed heme edge. It is possible that biliverdin reductase binds in a similar manner and helps to extract the biliverdin product. However, efforts to demonstrate that heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase form a stable complex have been unsuccessful,2 indicating that any such protein-protein interaction is transient. In sum, the rate constants for seven steps in the heme oxygenase catalytic sequence have been determined in single turnover studies by stopped-flow spectroscopy. The final steps have been shown to involve mandatory reduction of the heme oxygenase ferric biliverdin complex, release of ferrous iron, and release of iron-free biliverdin. The last step of this sequence is the slowest, but it is accelerated in the presence of biliverdin reductase so that reduction of verdoheme becomes the rate-limiting step. This finding suggests that biliverdin reductase exerts an allosteric or direct effect on biliverdin release via some form of protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, release of ferrous rather than ferric iron may be an important feature of heme oxygenase catalysis in terms of the iron homeostasis of the organism.

The present work describes the cloning and characterization of RAP250, a novel human nuclear receptor coactivator. The results of in vitro and invivo experiments indicate that the interaction of RAP250 with nuclear receptors is ligand-dependent or ligand-enhanced depending on the nuclear receptor and involves only one short LXXLL motif called nuclear receptor box. Transient transfection assays further demonstrate that RAP250 has a large intrinsic glutamine-rich activation domain and can significantly enhance the transcriptional activity of several nuclear receptors, acting as a coactivator. Interestingly, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses reveal that RAP250 is widely expressed with the highest expression in reproductive organs (testis, prostate and ovary) and brain. Together, our data suggest that RAP250 may play an important role in mammalian gene expression mediated by nuclear receptor.

The complex genetic programs regulated by NRs include biological processes such as growth, cell differentiation, and homeostasis (1.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

They can be divided into several subfamilies on the basis of characteristics such as dimerization status, nature of the ligand, or structure of the DNA response element. NRs are characterized by a common domain structure, including a highly variable N-terminal region that contains a constitutive activation function (AF-1), a highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) responsible for recognition of specific DNA response elements, a conserved multifunctional C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), containing a dimerization and a ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) (2.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). The liganded NRs bind to their cognate hormone response elements, located in the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes, and stimulate transcriptional activation by transmitting signals to the transcriptional machinery via direct protein-protein interactions (3.Beato M.

A. 1995; 92: 8288-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, another class of proteins, called coactivators, are recruited and serve as bridging molecules between the transcription initiation complex and NRs (for reviews, see Refs. 6.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar and 7.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

Bona fide AF-2 coactivators include the three related members of the p160/SRC family, as well as the cointegrators CBP and p300 (for review, see Ref. 6.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Because these coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and function in complex with other acetyltransferases, such as P/CAF, it has been proposed that functional connections exist between NR activation and the histone acetylation status. Evidence for the existence of NR-coactivator complexes came from biochemical studies identifying the TRAP/DRIP complex (13.Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to coactivators, other AF-2-binding proteins, such as RIP140 (17.Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), may serve important regulatory functions by inhibiting NR activation. To identify new potential coactivators, a mouse embryo cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system with PPARα as bait. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of RAP250, a new NR coactivator. All constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Details of each construction are available upon request. The partial mouse RAP250 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 782–1138 was released from the EcoRI site of the pGAD10 clone isolated by the yeast two-hybrid system and subcloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-hERα (aa 249–595) and GST-hTRα (aa 122–410) have been described previously (19.Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20.Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mutated variant of RAP250 was constructed by two independent PCRs with the flanking primers and two mutagenesis primers: 5′-TTAACGAGCCCATTGGCGGTCAACGCACTACAGAGTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCACTCTGTAGTGCGTTGACCGCCAATGGGCTCGTTAA-3′. The corresponding PCR products were isolated and combined together by an additional PCR with the flanking primers. The product of this PCR was digested byEcoRI and cloned into the corresponding site of pGEX-4T1. GST-RAP250 (aa 818–931) was generated by PCR and cloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pGEX-4T1. NRs for in vitro translation have been expressed from the following previously described plasmids: pBKCMVrPPARα (T3), pSG5mPPARγ2 (T7), pCMVhTRα (T3), pCMVhTRβ (T7) (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), pBKCMVrRXRα (T3) (21.Wiebel F.F. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pT7hERα (aa 1–595), and pT3hERβ (aa 1–485) (19.Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Plasmids with mutated forms of TRα and RXRα have been described previously (21.Wiebel F.F. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Saatcioglu F. Bartunek P. Deng T. Zenke M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RAP250 deletion constructs were made by PCR and subcloned into the NotI/NheI sites of the plasmid pSG5Gal4(GBT9J). These plasmids were used both for transient transfection experiments and/or to in vitro translate RAP250 partial fragments. The following eukaryotic expression vectors were used to express NRs: pSG5mPPARγ2, pSG5-cTRα (22.Saatcioglu F. Bartunek P. Deng T. Zenke M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and pCMX-rRXRα (21.Wiebel F.F. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pVP16-mRAP250 (aa 782–1138) was made by subcloning anEcoRI fragment from pGAD10-mRAP250 into pCMV-VP16. The luciferase reporter plasmids used were DR4-tk-Luc (21.Wiebel F.F. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), UAS-tk-Luc, PPRE-tk-Luc (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and DR1-tk-Luc (23.Feltkamp D. Wiebel F.F. Alberti S. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10421-10429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). pSG5-RAP250 plasmid used to transfect mammalian cells in the coactivation assay was obtained by subcloning the human full-length RAP250 cDNA (obtained by fusion of the 5′end cDNA to the KIAA0181 plasmid) into pSG5 vector. To isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with PPARα, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out as described previously for the isolation of hRIP140 (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As bait, Gal4-PPARα LBD/AF-2 was used to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library (CLONTECH) in the vector pGAD10. One clone revealed no homology with any characterized proteins but a strong homology with a human EST sequence of 6504 bp named KIAA0181 (24.Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tanaka A. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Kazusa DNA Research Institute provided us the human homologue cDNA. We used RACE PCR to obtain the remaining 5′end sequence of the human RAP250. This PCR amplification was performed using human testis Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as template. The first amplification was performed using the adaptor primer 1 and the gene-specific primer 5′-ATAGGAAATCCCGCCTCCATCCTA-3′ for 30 cycles followed by a final elongation of 7 min. Each cycle consisted of 10 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 63 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 68 °C; 1 μl of the PCR product was used as a template for the second amplification with the adaptor primer 2 and the nested gene-specific primer 5′-CTGGTTGTTGCTCTGAGCAAGGAT-3′ for 30 cycles, using essentially the same conditions as those used for the first amplification. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and 10 independent clones were sequenced. Human multiple tissue Northern blots with approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane were hybridized according to the protocol of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The probe used to detect RAP250 expression was a 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment (nucleotides 1104–1828) of hRAP250 cDNA radioactively labeled by the random-prime method (Rediprime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GAPDH cDNA was also used as a control probe. Some variations of the control GAPDH levels were observed, showing a strong expression in skeletal muscle and heart, as it is often the case with these two tissues. Nevertheless, according to manufacturer, these variations in GAPDH expression reflect a tissue-specific expression rather than a nonequal loading of the samples. Adult male and female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, NMRI mice, and postnatal mice (1.5, 4, 8, and 14 days) were decapitated, and the tissues were excised and frozen on dry ice. Embryonic mice (e9–e17) and rats (e12–e21) were excised from pregnant females and frozen. The tissues were sectioned with Microm HM-500 cryostat at 14 μm and thawed on Polysine glasses (Menzel, Germany). In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously. Two oligonucleotide probes directed against the mouse RAP250 mRNA (nucleotides 3185–3219 and 3448–3479 as numbered on human sequence) were used. The sequences had 100% (3185GCACCCCCACCACAGCCACCACAGCAGCAGCCACA3219) and 96% (3448GCAAGGACCTGCCTCTGTGCCACCATCACCTG3479) homology to human RAP250 and less than 70% homology with any other known gene compared with the known sequences in the GenBankTM data base. Both probes produced similar results when used separately and were usually combined to intensify the hybridization signal. Several probes to nonrelated mRNAs with known expression patterns, with similar length and GC content, were used as controls to verify the specificity of the hybridizations. The human full-length RAP250 cDNA cloned in pSG5 was in vitrotranscribed and translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT coupled in vitro system Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled protein was separated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was then dried and autoradiographed. Cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(pLys) carrying the pGEX fusion constructs (RAP250, ERα, and TRα) were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and supplemented with 2% glucose. AtA 600 0.6, the cultures were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2–3 h at 30 °C. GST and GST-RAP250 proteins were purified as described previously (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and the bacteria expressing GST fused to NRs were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and frozen on dry ice. After thawing, lysozyme were added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 15 min. Then, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mm and Sarcosyl to 1.5%. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C the lysates were added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To produce pure GST fusion protein for electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the proteins were eluted with 4 volumes of 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding procedure (Bio-Rad). All the NRs that we tested in pull-down assays werein vitro transcribed and translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT-coupled in vitro system Promega) according to manufacturer's recommendations with [35S]methionine. Approximately 5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in each assay. The beads were incubated for 3 h with rotation at +4 °C with 2 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled protein in the presence of 2 μl of the appropriate ligand in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or ethanol at final concentrations of 100 μm Wy14643 (PPARα), 200 nm T3 (TRs), 1 μmE2 (ERs), 100 μm BRL 49653 (PPARγ), or vehicle alone in a total volume of 200 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes KOH (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Beads were separated by centrifugation (2000 × g) and washed three times for 15 min with incubation buffer without bovine serum albumin. Washed beads were resuspended in 60 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, and an aliquot was subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Before autoradiography, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to control for the stability of the GST fusion proteins and equal loading. TRα and RXRα were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate by using the TNT-coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides DR4-TRE 5′-TCGATCAGGTCATTTCAGGTCAGAG-3′ were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl in 1× reaction buffer (5% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm KCl, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 0.05% Triton X-100), 0.5 ng of labeled probe, 2 μl of each in vitro translated receptor protein, and, when indicated, 2 μl of the appropriate ligand in Me2SO. Finally, 0.5 μg per reaction of the purified GST-RAP250 was added as indicated in results. The binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min on ice before the reaction mixtures were loaded on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After 3 h of electrophoresis in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer at 4 °C, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies Inc.). For transient transfection assays, COS-7 cells were plated onto 6-well plates (Falcon) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin as instructed by the manufacturer (Life Technologies Inc.). For each well, 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of Gal4 expression plasmid were transfected. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity as described (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells, and Western blotting using a mouse anti-Gal4-DBD monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechology) was carried out as described previously (19.Johansson L.

In the mammalian interaction and/or coactivation assays, 100 ng of wild type NR plasmids (TRs, RXR, and PPARs) and 0.5 μg of VP16 or VP16-mRAP250 plasmid (interaction assay) or 0.5 μg of pSG5 or pSG5-hRAP250 plasmid (coactivation assay) were transfected into COS-7 cells together with 0.5 μg of the appropriate reporter plasmid. Transfections were carried out for 4–6 h; the cells were then grown in presence of appropriate ligand or Me2SO for 36 h and then harvested and analyzed as described previously (18.Treuter E.

The human RAP250 nucleotide and protein sequences have been submitted to GenBankTM data base with accession number AF128458, and the partial mouse RAP250 nucleotide and protein sequences have been submitted with accession number AF135169. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library with PPARα-LBD as a bait as described previously (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol.

Of the isolated clones, more than 50% were isoforms of RXR, and a majority of the other clones were interacting parts of SMRT, N-CoR, TIF-2, and TRAP220 as described by Treuter et al. (18.Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, one of the interacting clones revealed no homology with any described protein, and data base searches revealed a strong homology with a human EST sequence of 6504 bp named KIAA0181 (24.Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tanaka A. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Compared with the human clone, this positive mouse clone only contained a partial cDNA sequence of 1.1 kb encoding 355 amino acids, corresponding to amino acids 782–1138 of the human sequence (Fig. 1 A) and showing 90% identity with the human protein (Fig. 1 C). The human clone contained a long open reading frame starting at nucleotide position 60 and a stop codon at nucleotide 6020. A downstream polyadenylation signal was also present in this cDNA, indicating that the 3′-end of the gene was intact. However, the first in-frame ATG codon of this human clone was not in an optimal context for translational initiation (no perfect Kozak site (26.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) and no in-frame stop codon upstream of this first methionine), suggesting that it perhaps was not the real initiation codon. In order to get a longer 5′-end sequence, we performed a 5′-RACE PCR and amplified an additional sequence of 433 nucleotides, which included 231 nucleotides encoding 77 additional amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of the reconstituted full-length cDNA is 6878 bp in length. It contains a short 5′-untranslated region of 202 bp with an upstream stop codon in frame with the first methionine, a longer 3′-untranslated region of 484 bp, and a 6189-bp open reading frame that encodes a protein of 2063 amino acids with a calculated mass of 220 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The beginning of the coding sequence was defined by the first ATG downstream of an in-frame stop codon at position −51. The sequence (ACCATGGTTTTG) surrounding the ATG essentially conforms to the Kozak site ((A/G)cc ATG Gat) (26.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). To determine the size of the protein, we performed an in vitrotranslation after synthesis of mRNA via a bacteriophage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. As shown in Fig.1 B, the estimated M r of the most prevalent in vitro synthesized protein is 250,000, which is consistent with the calculated size. This protein was designated RAP250 (nuclear receptor-activating protein 250) to signify both its potential coactivation function and its size in kilodaltons. The human RAP250 shows some specific features such as a Gln-rich region flanked by two poly-Gln stretches in the N-terminal region (see Fig. 1 A) and two copies of the LXXLL motif (LVNLL, aa 887–891, and LSQLL, aa 1494–1495) that are consistent with a coactivator function. Of the two LXXLL motifs present in the human sequence, the mouse partial clone only contains the first one (Fig.1 C). Northern blot analysis of human RNAs revealed a widespread major RAP250 transcript of approximately 7.5 kb in length, which was present at different levels depending on the tissue (Fig.2 A). High levels were detected in reproductive organs, such as ovary, testis, and prostate, as well as in peripheral blood leukocytes, brain, and heart, and intermediate levels were observed in pancreas, kidney, liver, colon, spleen, and placenta. RAP250 mRNA levels were low but still detectable in small intestine, thymus, and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, in testis, a second transcript of approximately 4.5 kb in length was also detected. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of this shorter mRNA indicated that it was an alternatively spliced form of RAP250 with an open reading frame encoding a 1070-amino acid-protein and encompassing amino acids 1–971 and 1965–2063 (data not shown). Thus, considering mRNA levels, testis appears to be the main RAP250 expressing organ. In peripheral blood leukocytes, a second 6-kb transcript was also detected that might represent either another alternatively spliced mRNA or a closely related but different gene product. The levels of RAP250 mRNA in mouse and rat embryos were quite similar. RAP250 mRNA was widely detected during ontogeny. At embryonic day 9 (e9), clear signal was present in placenta, and lower expression could be seen in uterus (Fig. 2, Ba). At this stage, neural tube expressed high levels of RAP250 mRNA and the expression in central nervous system was high throughout ontogeny (Fig. 2, Ba–Bc). The expression in spinal cord and in cerebrum was high and became more restricted during later stages of development (e17 onwards) and postnatal life. High expression was seen in cerebellum during development of this subregion of the brain (Fig. 2, Bc). Also, sensory ganglia and retina showed high expression from e11 onwards (Fig. 2, Bd). In the alimentary tract (oral cavity, stomach, and intestine), expression was seen from e13 and thereafter (Fig. 2, Bb and Bc). The developing teeth and salivary gland were also labeled (Fig. 2, Bc). Olfactory epithelium was strongly labeled from e13 onwards (Fig. 2, Bband Bc). Strong expression was present in liver (from e11) and kidney (from e13 onwards), and these levels decreased at later stages of development (Fig. 2, Bb and Bc). Lung had moderate signal from e13 and this level decreased during postnatal life (Fig. 2, Bc). Prominent signal was seen in thymus from e15 onwards, and in spleen from e17 and during early postnatal life, and subsequently, the expression decreased (Fig. 2, Bb andBc). Low to moderate signal was seen in brown fat, as well as developing muscles, bones, and intervertebral discs. In adult mouse and rat, expression of RAP250 mRNA was more restricted than during embryonic development. High expression was observed in male and female rat genital organs. In testis, seminiferous tubules exhibited a strong signal and expression in separate tubules varied, indicating that RAP250 may be expressed in a stage-specific manner during spermatogenesis (Fig. 2, Be). In dipped sections, RAP250 mRNA could be seen in primary spermatocytes. Prominent expression was also seen in the epithelium of prostate, whereas epididymis and seminal vesicles had low signals (Fig. 2, Bf). In ovary, the strongest signal was seen in interstitial cells and in the granulosa cells of different size follicles (Fig. 2, Bg). In the central nervous system, high expression was present in olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex, whereas other areas exhibited lower levels of RAP250 mRNA (Fig. 2, Bh). The partial mouse RAP250 clone was originally isolated via its interaction with the PPARα-LBD bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. To determine whether the mouse RAP250 could interact with other NRs, we set up an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay with the mouse partial RAP250 clone (aa 782–1138) fused to GST, referred to here as GST-RAP250, and radioactively labeled in vitro translated NRs. As shown in Fig.3, PPARs, TRs and ERs specifically interacted with GST-RAP250 but not with GST. The addition of appropriate ligands in the binding buffer increased the interaction between GST-RAP250 and most of NRs (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3, and Fig. 4), indicating a ligand-dependent interaction in the cases of TRs, and a ligand-enhanced interaction for ERs and PPARs. To investigate whether the LXXLL motif (LVNLL, aa 891–895) of mouse RAP250 was responsible for the interaction with NRs, the leucine core motif was mutated to AVNAL, as shown in Fig. 3 A. Mutation of this motif abolished the interaction of GST-RAP250 with all tested NRs both in absence or presence of ligands (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and6), indicating that the interaction between RAP250 and NRs was mediated by an LXXLL motif, the integrity of which is required to function as an NR box.Figure 4The NR interaction domain of RAP250 contains only"

Although CC chemokine receptors have been found predominantly on leukocytes, recent studies have suggested that vascular smooth muscle cells respond to CC chemokines. We now report that human smooth muscle cells express CCR5, a co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus. CCR5 mRNA was detectable by RNA blot hybridization in human aortic and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. The cDNA generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from aortic smooth muscle cells had 100% identity throughout the entire coding region with the CCR5 cloned from THP-1 cells. By immunohistochemistry, CCR5 and the CCR5 ligand, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), were detected in smooth muscle cells and macrophages of the atherosclerotic plaque. In smooth muscle cell culture, MIP-1β induced a significant increase in intracellular calcium concentrations, which was blocked by an antibody to CCR5. In addition, MIP-1β caused a calcium-dependent increase in tissue factor activity. Tissue factor is the initiator of coagulation and is thought to play a key role in arterial thrombosis. These data suggest that human arterial smooth muscle cells express functional CCR5 receptors and MIP-1β is an agonist for these cells. CC chemokine receptors are important modulators of inflammation.

In the normal arterial wall, SMCs are in a quiescent, contractile state and function primarily to regulate vascular tone. In atherosclerosis, SMCs modulate to a synthetic phenotype, allowing them to proliferate and migrate to form part of the intimal plaque (1.Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). SMC proliferation and hypertrophy are also features of hypertension (2.Alexander R.W. Brock T.A.

A variety of growth factors and cytokines found in the atherosclerotic plaque and in the injured arterial wall have been shown to be agonists for SMCs and to modulate their growth and migratory properties (3.Wilcox J.N.

Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). These proteins play a crucial role in a variety of inflammatory processes by acting as leukocyte activators and chemoattractants (6.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J.

CC chemokines bind to a family of G protein-coupled receptors, CC chemokine receptors (CCRs), characterized by seven transmembrane spanning domains (8.Kelvin D.J. Michiel D.F. Johnston J.A. Lloyd A.R. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CCRs have been identified predominantly on leukocytes (9.Neote K.

We recently reported that the CC chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) specifically binds to human aortic SMCs and induces tissue factor (TF), the initiator of the clotting cascade (11.Nemerson Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In these cells, the mRNA encoding the known MCP-1 receptor, CCR2 (12.Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, these cells did not express mRNA for other CCRs, including CCR1 (13.Gao J.L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp.

However, the responsiveness of SMCs to MCP-1 suggested that they expressed a member(s) of the CCR family. Since our initial report, several additional CCRs have been identified (17.Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Chantry D. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In particular, CCR5 has been shown to be the receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1) α and β (18.Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and to be a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic or dual-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (19.Alkhatib G.

Science. 1996; 272: 1955-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar).We now report that cultured human arterial SMCs possess CCR5 mRNA and protein. The SMC CCR5 was functionally coupled, responding to MIP-1β with increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and in TF activity. Antibody to CCR5 blocked both the increases in [Ca2+]i and in TF activity. CCR5 and MIP-1β antigens were also detected in SMCs of the atherosclerotic arterial wall. CCR5 and its ligand, MIP-1β, may play a role in mediating the inflammatory and prothrombotic responses associated with atherosclerosis.DISCUSSIONThis report describes the presence of functional CCR5 in human vascular SMCs. CCR5 is a member of the family of CCRs and the only known receptor, to date, that binds MIP-1β at physiologic concentrations (7.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCRs have been found largely on leukocytes and have been shown to mediate a variety of biologic processes, including inflammation, chemotaxis, proliferation, and cell activation (6.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar, 32.Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar,33.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). CCR5 has received particular attention because of its role as a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of HIV (34.Moore J.P. Trkola A. Dragic T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).There has been little information about the presence of CCR5 or other CCRs on cells of the arterial wall. CCR5 antigen was identified in blood vessels from a variety of tissues using monoclonal antibodies (35.Rottman J.B. Ganley K.P. Williams K. Wu L. Mackay C.R. Ringler D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1341-1351PubMed Google Scholar). Staining was largely confined to the endothelium but some staining was reported in SMCs underlying positive endothelium. Luoet al. (36.Luo Y. D'Amore P.A. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2143-2148PubMed Google Scholar) examined the binding and activity of the CC chemokine, TCA3, in rat aortic SMCs. Mouse TCA3, MIP-1α, and MCP-1 stimulated chemotaxis of SMCs and increased SMC adhesiveness to type III collagen. Rat SMCs exhibited high affinity (3 nm) binding sites for TCA3. Mouse MIP-1β had no binding to or biologic effect on rat SMCs.We recently reported (29.Schecter A.D. Rollins B.J. Zhang Y.J. Charo I.F. Fallon J.T. Rossikhina M. Giesen P.L. Nemerson Y. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28568-28573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that human aortic SMCs express TF in response to MCP-1. Although high affinity MCP-1 binding sites were identified, RT-PCR failed to demonstrate mRNA for the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, or for CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and DARC in cells grown in 10% serum. In a study also employing RT-PCR (37.Hayes I.M. Jordan N.J. Towers S. Smith G. Paterson J.R. Earnshaw J.J. Roach A.G. Westwick J. Williams R.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), mRNAs for CCR1 and CCR2 were expressed by human saphenous vein SMCs incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR1, and CXCR2 mRNA were not identified in these cells. The detection of CCR5 in our study may be due to differences in study conditions. The former study (37.Hayes I.M. Jordan N.J. Towers S. Smith G. Paterson J.R. Earnshaw J.J. Roach A.G. Westwick J. Williams R.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) utilized saphenous vein SMCs, whereas the present study used only arterial SMCs. There were also differences in the culture conditions. Our mRNA was isolated from cells grown in 10% serum, whereas theirs was harvested from cells grown in serum-free medium. Our data demonstrate that in addition to possessing CCR5 mRNA, human SMCs contain significant amounts of CCR5 antigen. Most importantly, CCR5 appears to be functionally active, in that these cells respond to MIP-1β, the ligand specific for CCR5. Although it is possible that MIP-1β could be acting through a different CC chemokine receptor, the ability of antibodies to CCR5 to completely block the calcium response and TF induction by MIP-1β strongly argues that CCR5 is responsible.MIP-1α and β are small heparin-binding proteins that are produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells (13.Gao J.L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). MIP-1α and β are chemotactic agents and activators of monocytes and lymphocytes and, as such, exhibit potent proinflammatory properties. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that SMCs respond to MIP-1β. MIP-1β caused increases in [Ca2+]i in SMCs derived from aorta, coronary, and internal mammary arteries. The magnitude and time to induction (1–4 min) are similar to those shown for the response of SMCs to platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (38.Morgan K.G. DeFeo T.T. Wenc K.

This increase was blocked by antibody to CCR5 and by BAPTA/AM, suggesting that its induction was due to CCR5-mediated [Ca2+]i mobilization.

Several experimental animal models of HIV are associated with vascular abnormalities. Transgenic mice carrying a replication-defective HIV-1 provirus with expression restricted to SMCs were shown to develop extensive vasculopathy, characterized by intimal thickening, significant luminal narrowing, and thrombotic occlusion (49.Tinkle B.T.

A severe arteriopathy, also characterized by intimal thickening, luminal narrowing, and thrombosis, was seen in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (50.Chalifoux L.V. Simon M.A. Pauley D.R. MacKey J.J. Wyand M.S. Ringler D.J. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 338-349PubMed Google Scholar).To our knowledge, there have been no reports of direct SMC infection by HIV. The expression of functional CCR5 on SMCs suggests that the question of their infectability should be reexamined. SMCs do not express CD4; however, data using SIV indicate that many primary strains use CCR5 in the absence of CD4. For example, simian microvascular brain endothelial cells that express CCR5 but lack CD4 can be infected with neurotropic SIV strains. This infection can be blocked using CCR5 ligands (51.Edinger A.L. Mankowski J.L. Doranz B.J. Margulies B.J. Lee B. Rucker J. Sharron M. Hoffman T.L. Berson J.F. Zink M.C. Hirsch V.M. Clements J.E. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that soluble CD4, through its binding to GP120, induces conformational changes that facilitate SIV binding and infection via CCR5 (52.Wyatt R. Kwong P.D. Desjardins E. Sweet R.W. Robinson J. Hendrickson W.A. Sodroski J.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 53.Schutten M. Andeweg A.C. Bosch M.L. Osterhaus A.D. Scand. J.

Thus, it is possible that CD4-independent, CCR5-dependent strains of HIV can be generated that would have the potential to infect SMCs. SMCs could play a role in HIV infection without actually incorporating virus. Infected cells within the vessel wall may elaborate MIP-1β that would then activate SMCs. This could contribute to the arteriopathies reported in patients with AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma (56.Ensoli B. Barillari G. Gallo R.C. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1991; 5: 281-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).MIP-1 antigens and/or mRNAs have been identified at various sites of inflammation (57.Lukacs N.W. Chensue S.W. Smith R.E.

By in situ hybridization, low levels of MIP-1 mRNA were found in human carotid endartarectomy specimens (3.Wilcox J.N. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Gordon D. Schall T.J. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1994; 1 Suppl. 1: S10-S13Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that MIP-1β antigen is abundant in SMC-rich areas of the plaque. Significantly, intimal and medial SMCs also possess the CCR5 receptor and therefore appear to be competent to respond in vivo to MIP-1β. This report thus raises the possibility that MIP-1β plays a role in the inflammatory and prothrombotic response of SMCs in atherosclerosis. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs)1 are the predominant cellular elements of the arterial media. In the normal arterial wall, SMCs are in a quiescent, contractile state and function primarily to regulate vascular tone. In atherosclerosis, SMCs modulate to a synthetic phenotype, allowing them to proliferate and migrate to form part of the intimal plaque (1.Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). SMC proliferation and hypertrophy are also features of hypertension (2.Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Rittenhouse S.E. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 447-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of growth factors and cytokines found in the atherosclerotic plaque and in the injured arterial wall have been shown to be agonists for SMCs and to modulate their growth and migratory properties (3.Wilcox J.N.

CC chemokines are members of a family of highly related proteins characterized by two adjacent cysteine residues (6.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). These proteins play a crucial role in a variety of inflammatory processes by acting as leukocyte activators and chemoattractants (6.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar, 7.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CC chemokines bind to a family of G protein-coupled receptors, CC chemokine receptors (CCRs), characterized by seven transmembrane spanning domains (8.Kelvin D.J. Michiel D.F. Johnston J.A. Lloyd A.R. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CCRs have been identified predominantly on leukocytes (9.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10.Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the CC chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) specifically binds to human aortic SMCs and induces tissue factor (TF), the initiator of the clotting cascade (11.Nemerson Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In these cells, the mRNA encoding the known MCP-1 receptor, CCR2 (12.Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) could not be identified by RNA blot hybridization or by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, these cells did not express mRNA for other CCRs, including CCR1 (13.Gao J.L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), CCR3 (14.Kitaura M. Nakajima T. Imai T. Harada S. Combadiere C. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), CCR4 (15.Youn B.S. Kim S.H. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Taub D.D. Kwon B.S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4448-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DARC (16.Horuk R. Martin A. Hesselgesser J. Hadley T. Lu Z.H. Wang Z.X. Peiper S.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), as determined by RT-PCR. However, the responsiveness of SMCs to MCP-1 suggested that they expressed a member(s) of the CCR family. Since our initial report, several additional CCRs have been identified (17.Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Chantry D. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In particular, CCR5 has been shown to be the receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1) α and β (18.Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and to be a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic or dual-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (19.Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Broder C.C. Feng Y. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1955-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). We now report that cultured human arterial SMCs possess CCR5 mRNA and protein. The SMC CCR5 was functionally coupled, responding to MIP-1β with increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and in TF activity. Antibody to CCR5 blocked both the increases in [Ca2+]i and in TF activity. CCR5 and MIP-1β antigens were also detected in SMCs of the atherosclerotic arterial wall. CCR5 and its ligand, MIP-1β, may play a role in mediating the inflammatory and prothrombotic responses associated with atherosclerosis. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the presence of functional CCR5 in human vascular SMCs. CCR5 is a member of the family of CCRs and the only known receptor, to date, that binds MIP-1β at physiologic concentrations (7.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCRs have been found largely on leukocytes and have been shown to mediate a variety of biologic processes, including inflammation, chemotaxis, proliferation, and cell activation (6.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar, 32.Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar,33.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). CCR5 has received particular attention because of its role as a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of HIV (34.Moore J.P. Trkola A. Dragic T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).There has been little information about the presence of CCR5 or other CCRs on cells of the arterial wall. CCR5 antigen was identified in blood vessels from a variety of tissues using monoclonal antibodies (35.Rottman J.B. Ganley K.P. Williams K. Wu L. Mackay C.R. Ringler D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1341-1351PubMed Google Scholar). Staining was largely confined to the endothelium but some staining was reported in SMCs underlying positive endothelium. Luoet al. (36.Luo Y. D'Amore P.A. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2143-2148PubMed Google Scholar) examined the binding and activity of the CC chemokine, TCA3, in rat aortic SMCs. Mouse TCA3, MIP-1α, and MCP-1 stimulated chemotaxis of SMCs and increased SMC adhesiveness to type III collagen. Rat SMCs exhibited high affinity (3 nm) binding sites for TCA3. Mouse MIP-1β had no binding to or biologic effect on rat SMCs.We recently reported (29.Schecter A.D. Rollins B.J. Zhang Y.J. Charo I.F. Fallon J.T. Rossikhina M. Giesen P.L. Nemerson Y. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28568-28573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that human aortic SMCs express TF in response to MCP-1. Although high affinity MCP-1 binding sites were identified, RT-PCR failed to demonstrate mRNA for the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, or for CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and DARC in cells grown in 10% serum. In a study also employing RT-PCR (37.Hayes I.M. Jordan N.J. Towers S. Smith G. Paterson J.R. Earnshaw J.J. Roach A.G. Westwick J. Williams R.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), mRNAs for CCR1 and CCR2 were expressed by human saphenous vein SMCs incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR1, and CXCR2 mRNA were not identified in these cells. The detection of CCR5 in our study may be due to differences in study conditions. The former study (37.Hayes I.M. Jordan N.J. Towers S. Smith G. Paterson J.R. Earnshaw J.J. Roach A.G. Westwick J. Williams R.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) utilized saphenous vein SMCs, whereas the present study used only arterial SMCs. There were also differences in the culture conditions. Our mRNA was isolated from cells grown in 10% serum, whereas theirs was harvested from cells grown in serum-free medium. Our data demonstrate that in addition to possessing CCR5 mRNA, human SMCs contain significant amounts of CCR5 antigen. Most importantly, CCR5 appears to be functionally acti"

The signal from the cell-binding domain is mediated by integrins, whereas the signal from the heparin-binding domain is recognized by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, of which syndecan-4 has been hypothesized to be involved in focal adhesion formation. We generated mice deficient in syndecan-4 to study its role directly. Even in fibroblasts from syndecan-4-deficient mice, focal adhesions were formed, and actin fibers terminated normally at focal adhesions when they were cultured on coverslips coated with fibronectin or with a mixture of its cell-binding and heparin-binding fragments. However, when the cells were cultured on the cell-binding fragment and the heparin-binding fragment was added to the medium, focal adhesion formation was impaired in the syndecan-4 null fibroblasts as compared with that in wild-type cells. Therefore, syndecan-4 is essential for promoting focal adhesion formation only when the signal of the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin is delivered as a soluble form, most probably from the apical surface.

Focal adhesions are linked to actin stress fibers and also serve as signaling complexes involved in triggering intracellular signaling cascades. When cells are plated on fibronectin, focal adhesion formation requires two independent signals delivered from the cell-binding domain and the heparin-binding domain of the molecule (2.Woods A.

To evaluate the precise role of syndecan-4 in focal adhesion formation, we generated mice deficient in the syndecan-4 gene (Synd4)1 and examined fibroblasts from these animals. Intact human fibronectin and its cell-binding fragment (CBF) were purchased from Wako Chemical Co. Heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin (HBF), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin, anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-syndecan-4 ectodomain antibody (@-Synd4) was prepared as described (13.Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Taguchi O. Saito H. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and anti-syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain antibody was a gift of Dr. N. W. Shworak (14.Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C.

The syndecan-4 targeting vector was constructed from a basic targeting vector with MC1neo (polyoma virus thymidine kinase gene promoter and neomycin resistance gene) andDTA (diphtheria toxin fragment A gene) (15.Igakura T.

To delete 2452 bases containing exons II and III and part of exon IV ofSynd4 (HindIII ∼ApaI sites, Fig.1 A), a 2.3-kb BglII/HindIII fragment was used as the 5′ arm, and a 4.4-kb ApaI/SmaI fragment was used as the 3′ arm (Fig. 1 A). Generation of targeted D3 ES cells and blastocyst injection were performed as described (15.Igakura T. Kadomatsu K. Kaname T. Muramatsu H. Fan Q.W. Miyauchi T. Toyama Y. Kuno N. Yuasa S. Takahashi M.

The male chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6J female mice, and F1 mice with the homologously recombined genome were mated with each other to yield the null mutant mice. The mutant (Synd4(−/−)) or wild-type (Synd4(+/+)) embryos were obtained by crossing F2 Synd4(−/−) or F2 Synd4(+/+) mice. Southern blot analysis was performed as described previously (15.Igakura T. Kadomatsu K. Kaname T. Muramatsu H. Fan Q.W. Miyauchi T. Toyama Y. Kuno N. Yuasa S. Takahashi M. Senda T. Taguchi O. Yamamura K. Arimura K. Muramatsu T. Dev.

After digestion with BamHI and hybridization with an external probe (a 692-base pair BamHI/BglI fragment; Fig.1 A), the homologously recombined genomic DNA gave a 4-kb band, whereas the wild-type DNA gave an 11-kb band (Fig. 1,A and B). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously, using 32P-labeled probes of the syndecan family members (13.Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Taguchi O. Saito H. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The proteoglycan fraction was prepared, and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (13.Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Taguchi O. Saito H. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Glass coverslips (24 × 24 mm, Matsunami) were coated with fibronectin or other proteins dissolved in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight. The coverslips were washed with PBS three times, incubated with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min, and then washed again with PBS three times. Fibroblasts were obtained by mincing three embryos of Synd4(−/−) or Synd4(+/+) on day 13.5 of gestation. After two or three passages, the cells were stocked in liquid nitrogen and used between the second and fifth passages from the stocks. Unless otherwise specified, the cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Subconfluent fibroblasts were trypsinized and then harvested with 10% FCS/DMEM. The cells were rinsed twice with DMEM and then suspended in DMEM (2 × 104 cells/ml). Four hundred μl of the cell suspension was seeded onto the coverslips. The experimental procedures were as described by Woodset al. (3.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4.Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, subconfluent fibroblasts were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Nacalai tesque) for 2 h. Cycloheximide was present throughout all steps to prevent endogenous fibronectin secretion. The cells were trypsinized, harvested, and seeded onto coverslips according to the procedure described above; this was followed by incubation for 2 h. Then, DMEM was changed to fresh DMEM or to fresh DMEM with added proteins. The cells were further incubated for 2 h and then fixed and examined. The fixation and immunocytochemical straining were performed as described by Woods and Couchman (10.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Actin fibers were stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. An interference reflection microscope (Olympus) was used to confirm focal adhesion formation in Synd4(−/−) fibroblasts fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. A laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad) was used for observation and for recording immunofluorescence. More than 15 fields at a magnification of ×200 were recorded, and then more than 100 cells were scored in each assay. In the present study, we considered that focal adhesions were formed if, even in a part of a cell, the cell contained streaks stained with anti-vinculin antibody where actin fibers terminated. Cells that did not spread sufficiently were excluded for scoring. There were no differences in the numbers of attached and spread cells between Synd4(+/+) and Synd4(−/−) cells; about 80% of seeded cells attached, and more than 90% of them spread in all experiments. Observations, recording, and scoring were performed in a blind manner. Experiments were performed four times using two independent fibroblast stocks. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView 4.5 (Abacus). The coding region ofSynd4 is distributed over 5 exons (16.Tsuzuki S. Kojima T. Katsumi A. Yamazaki T. Sugiura I. Saito H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We deleted exons II and III and part of IV, which correspond to the ectodomain with three putative glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, by replacing them with the neomycin resistance gene, employing the positive-negative selection strategy (Fig. 1 A). Of 252 ES clones obtained, three were found to have a homologously recombined gene. Blastocyst injection of the ES clones yielded chimeric mice, one of which transmitted the homologously recombined gene into the germ line. Synd4(+/−) mice were crossed to yield the knockout mice. Southern, Northern, and Western blot analyses confirmed that the knockout mice lacked Synd4, syndecan-4 mRNA, and the syndecan-4 protein (Fig. 1, B–E). No gross abnormalities were found by macroscopic observation in theSynd4(−/−) mice. Furthermore, the Synd4(−/−) mice reproduced normally. Focal adhesions were detected inSynd4(−/−) fibroblasts cultured on fibronectin for 3 h by immunocytochemical staining (Fig. 2,A–C) and interference reflection microscopy (Fig. 2 D). The latter method revealed focal adhesions asdark streaks (Fig. 2 D), whereas the former detected vinculin as green streaks (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, actin fibers terminated at focal adhesions even inSynd4(−/−) fibroblasts (Fig. 2, B andC), although the vinculin plaques appeared fewer in number/cell and smaller than in Synd4(+/+) cells (Fig.2 E). We then compared the incidence of the cells that spread and formed focal adhesions at 1.5, 3, and 9 h after seeding onto coverslips coated with fibronectin. More than 90% of theSynd4(−/−) fibroblasts spread and about 80% of them formed focal adhesions at each point; there were no significant differences between the Synd4(+/+) andSynd4(−/−) fibroblasts (data not shown). Thus, syndecan-4 was not essential for focal adhesion formation and actin fiber termination at focal adhesions. It has been reported that syndecan-4 is colocalized with endogeneous fibronectin in focal adhesions (11.Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar), although it is not known whether syndecan-4 directs the deposition of fibronectin. Thus, we examined the distribution of endogeneous fibronectin and found that syndecan-4 did not influence the distribution of endogeneous fibronectin, present at or near focal adhesions in both Synd4(−/−) (Fig.2 F) and Synd4(+/+) fibroblasts (data not shown). To evaluate the effects of the two fragments of fibronectin, fibroblasts were treated with cycloheximide to suppress the synthesis of endogeneous fibronectin. Even under these conditions,Synd4(−/−) fibroblasts formed focal adhesions on fibronectin-coated coverslips with efficiency similar to that ofSynd4(+/+) fibroblasts (Fig.3, columns 1 and2). Both Synd4(−/−) and Synd4(+/+) fibroblasts poorly formed focal adhesions on coverslips coated only with the CBF (Fig. 3, columns 3 and 4). However, when the fibroblasts were seeded onto coverslips coated with CBF and incubated for 2 h, and then the HBF was added to the medium, the incidence of focal adhesion formation increased inSynd4(+/+) but not in Synd4(−/−) fibroblasts (Fig. 3, columns 5 and 6). When fibroblasts were cultured on coverslips coated with a mixture of CBF and HBF, the efficiency of focal adhesion formation increased in bothSynd4(+/+) and Synd4(−/−) fibroblasts (Fig. 3,columns 7 and 8). Inhibition of the HBF action by heparin (Fig. 3, columns 9 and 10) confirmed that HBF itself, but not a possible contaminant in the preparation, exerted the effect. Thus, we concluded that syndecan-4 is essential for receiving the signal from soluble HBF, most probably at the apical surface, but is not essential for signal reception from the substratum-bound HBF. We next examined the effects of anti-syndecan-4 antibody (@-Synd4). When added instead of HBF, @-Synd4 in either the soluble or substratum-bound form cooperated with CBF to induce focal adhesion formation in Synd4(+/+) fibroblasts (Fig. 3, columns 11 and 13; Ref. 12.Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, inSynd4(−/−) fibroblasts, α-Synd4 added not only in the medium (Fig. 3, column 12) but also as a substratum-bound form (Fig. 3, column 14) did not exert this effect. @-Synd4 recognizes only the syndecan-4 molecule; however, HBF reacts not only with syndecan-4 but also with other molecules. Thus, the different results obtained by @-Synd4 and HBF lead to two conclusions: 1) Syndecan-4 is confirmed to be involved in the signal reception for focal adhesion formation; 2) some other molecule(s), which may have heparan sulfates, compensate(s) for the loss of syndecan-4 in the signal reception from the substratum-bound HBF. The molecules that compensate for the loss of syndecan-4 may be other members of the syndecan family. A previous study demonstrated that antibody-induced clustering of syndecan-1 led to the reorganization of actin fibers, although the study did not examine focal adhesion formation (17.Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Tucker B. Bendt K.A. Cizmeci-Smith G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, syndecan-1 mRNA as well as syndecan-2 and -3 mRNAs were strongly expressed in both Synd4(−/−) and Synd4(+/+) fibroblasts; the mRNA levels of these molecules were not different between Synd4(−/−) andSynd4(+/+) fibroblasts (data not shown). Synd4(−/−) mice showed no macroscopic abnormalities and reproduced normally. Thus, the syndecan-4 requirement for a soluble form of HBF to promote focal adhesion formation is not essential for ontogenesis and reproduction. However, when inflammation or wounding occurs, fibronectin is degraded by proteases (18.Brown G.M. Brown D.M. Donaldson K. Ann. Occup. Hyg. 1991; 35: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Grinnell F. Zhu M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that syndecan-4 is expressed in infiltrating macrophages in ischemic areas of myocardial infarction (20.Li J. Brown L.F. Laham R.J. Volk R. Simons M. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), granulation tissues adjacent to skin wounds (21.Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and vascular smooth muscle cells at injured arteries (22.Cizmeci-Smith G. Langan E. Youkey J. Showalter L.J. Carey D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that focal adhesions may be involved in cell migration (2.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Collagen Relat. Res. 1988; 8: 155-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, syndecan-4 might participate in the processes of inflammation and wound recovery through focal adhesion formation and actin fiber organization in response to the signal from the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin. We thank Dr. Masahiro Maeda for helping to prepare the anti-syndecan-4 ectodomain antibody, Dr. N. W. Shworak for a generous gift of the anti-syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain antibody, and M.

Together with the structurally related protein, Rom-1, it forms a complex along the rims of rod and cone disc membranes. We have compared the oligomeric structure of these proteins from nonreduced and dithiothreitol reduced membranes by velocity sedimentation, SDS-gel electrophoresis, immunoaffinity chromatography, and chemical cross-linking. Under reducing conditions peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 existed as homomeric and heteromeric core complexes devoid of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Under nonreducing conditions core complexes associated through intermolecular disulfide bonds to form oligomers. One intermediate-size oligomer contained monomers and disulfide-linked dimers of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1, while larger oligomers consisted only of disulfide-linked peripherin/Rds dimers when analyzed on nonreducing SDS gels. Consistent with this result, disc membranes contained twice as much peripherin/Rds as Rom-1. Peripherin/Rds individually expressed in COS-1 cells also formed disulfide-linked oligomers bridged through Cys-150 residues, whereas Rom-1 showed little tendency to form oligomers. These results indicate that peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 associate noncovalently to form multisubunit core complexes. Peripherin/Rds containing core complexes interact through specific intermolecular disulfide bonds to form oligomers which may play a crucial role in photoreceptor disc morphogenesis and retinal degenerative diseases.

This compartment consists of a stack of highly ordered discs surrounded by a plasma membrane. A disc is composed of two closely spaced lamellar membranes that are fully (rods) or partially (cones) circumscribed by a hairpin membrane called the disc rim. This rim region is generally thought to play an essential role in the morphogenesis and stabilization of the outer segment, although the molecular mechanism and interactions are not yet known (1.Steinberg R.H.

Peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 are two membrane proteins that are localized along the rim and incisures of rod and cone disc membranes (5.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Peripherin/Rds is required for rod and cone outer segment morphogenesis and stabilization since rds mice homozygous for the disrupted peripherin/rds gene fail to develop outer segments and mice heterozygous for this gene defect form highly disorganized structures consisting of whorls of membranes (10.Sanyal S.

Moreover, mutations in the peripherin/rds gene have been linked to a variety of inherited human retinal diseases including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and related pattern dystrophies (15.Farrar G.J.

Recent studies with transgenic mice have confirmed that disease-linked mutations in peripherin/rdscause outer segment disorganization and photoreceptor degeneration (21.Kedzierski W. Lloyd M. Birch D.G. Bok D. Travis G.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 498-509PubMed Google Scholar). Rom-1 plays a more ancillary role in outer segment structure. In the absence of Rom-1, characteristic rod and cone outer segments containing stacks of discs are evident (22.Clarke, G., Goldberg, A. F. X., Vidgen, D., Collins, L., Ploder, L., Schwarz, L., Molday, L. L., Rossant, J., Szél, A., Molday, R. S., Birch, D. G., and McInnes, R. R. (2000) Nat. Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar). The discs in rod cells, however, tend to be slightly longer than normal and occasionally have a disorganized appearance. Furthermore, to date mutations in the rom-1 gene have been linked only to a digenic form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (23.Kajiwara K. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 24.Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Kajiwara K. Berson E.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1972-1982PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the disease phenotype is evident only in individuals who inherit a L185P mutation inperipherin/rds along with a rom-1 mutation. Peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 are similar in size and exhibit many common structural features (25.Molday R.S. Prog. Ret. & Eye Res. 1994; 13: 271-299Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They both contain four putative membrane spanning segments, an extended cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, a large intradiscal loop of approximately 150 amino acids that joins the third and forth transmembrane segments, and seven highly conserved cysteine residues (6.Connell G. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7.Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I.

Sutcliffe J.G. Bok D. Neuron. 1991; 6: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The C terminus of peripherin/Rds has been reported to induce membrane fusion in vitro suggesting a possible role for this domain in the outer segment renewal process (27.Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The large intradiscal loop of peripherin/Rds, however, contains most disease causing missense mutations and appears to play a crucial role in protein-protein interactions important for disc formation and stabilization (28.Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 assemble into a multisubunit protein complex (7.Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 8.Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Earlier biochemical studies suggest that this complex is a tetramer composed of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 subunits (31.Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Intermolecular disulfide bonds have been generally thought to be involved in maintaining the structure of this complex since a significant fraction of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 migrates as disulfide-linked dimers on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, mutagenesis studies have identified a single cysteine residue (Cys-150) in the large intradiscal loop of peripherin/Rds that is responsible for the formation of disulfide-linked peripherin/Rds dimers (29.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further define the role of intermolecular disulfide bonds in the structure of the peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complex, we have analyzed the oligomeric structure of these proteins from reduced and nonreduced ROS1 and monkey kidney COS-1 cell membranes by velocity sedimentation, SDS-gel electrophoresis, immunoaffinity chromatography and covalent cross-linking. We report here that peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 associate noncovalently to form a mixture of homomeric and heteromeric core proteins. A significant fraction of peripherin/Rds-containing core complexes further link together through intermolecular disulfide bonds to form higher order oligomers. These studies lead to a new model for the oligomeric structure of peripherin/Rds containing proteins in ROS and provide insight into the possible role of these complexes in outer segment morphogenesis and retinal degeneration. ROS were isolated from frozen bovine retina by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (33.Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to peripherin/Rds (Per2B6) and Rom-1 (Rom1C6) have been reported (5.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar). ROS were washed three times under dim red light with 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in the same buffer. Reduction in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 was initiated at 25 °C by the addition of DTT, cysteine, or glutathione to yield a final concentration of 10 mm. Aliquots were removed at 5-min intervals and added to an equal volume of stop buffer (2% Triton X-100, 120 mm NEM, 0.2 mg/ml PMSF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The samples were centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions for analysis by Western blotting as described below. For kinetic analysis, the decrease in peripherin/Rds or Rom-1 dimer as a function of time was quantified by scanning the ECL exposed film with a laser densitometer. Kinetics were fitted to a single exponential decay using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). ROS were washed three times in PBS (0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and the final pellet was resuspended at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in PBS in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT. After 90 min at 25 °C, ROS samples were solubilized by the dropwise addition of an equal volume of ice-cold solubilization buffer (2% Triton X-100 and 0.2 mg/ml PMSF in PBS) containing 100 mmNEM to obtain a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The solution was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min to remove any residual insoluble material and the supernatant (solubilized ROS) was used either directly for velocity sedimentation measurements and cross-linking studies or for purification of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1. Peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complex was typically purified from Triton X-100-solubilized ROS on a Per2B6-Sepharose immunoaffinity matrix as described previously (30.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of solubilized ROS were incubated with 50 μl of matrix for 1 h at 4 °C in Millipore Ultrafree MC 0.45-μm filter unit. The matrix was then washed three times with 0.4 ml of solubilization buffer by low speed centrifugation to remove unbound protein, and the bound peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complex was eluted with 200 μl of solubilization buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of the 2B6 competing peptide (DAGQAPAAG). pcPER (wild-typeperipherin/rds), pcPER-C150S (C150S mutantperipherin/rds), and pcROM (wild-type rom1) plasmids used for COS-1 cell transfections have been previously described (29.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For heterologous expression, COS-1 cells (∼6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with 30 μg of plasmid using calcium chloride and harvested 72 h post-transfection as described (30.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 270 μl of PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml PMSF and either 10 mm DTT or 40 mm NEM. After 90 min at 25 °C, the cells were solubilized by the addition of 30 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and incubated for 20 min on ice. The solution was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected and maintained on ice until use. Triton X-100-solubilized protein from DTT- or NEM-treated ROS or COS-1 cell membranes or immunoaffinity-purified peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 was applied to 5–20% (w/w) 2-ml sucrose gradients prepared in PBS and containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Routinely, 1 mm DTT was included in the gradients for DTT-treated samples. After centrifugation for 12 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor at 4 °C, the bottom of the centrifuge tube was punctured and four-drop fractions were collected by gravity flow. Fractions were incubated with 40 mm NEM for 30 min at 25 °C to block free sulfhydryl groups and neutralize any remaining DTT. The samples were then added to an equal volume of SDS mixture in the absence (or presence) of reducing agent and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Reduced or nonreduced, Triton X-100-solubilized ROS (0.1 mg/ml) or purified peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complex (4 μg/ml) was treated with 50 mm NEM and subsequently incubated with 0.001% or 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 15–30 min at 37 °C. Samples were added to an equal volume of SDS mixture containing β-mercaptoethanol for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 subunits, used as standards for quantitative analysis, were isolated as follows: DTT-treated ROS membranes were solubilized with an equal volume of 1% SDS in PBS containing 100 mm NEM and PMSF. After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 and PMSF. Peripherin/Rds was selectively bound to Per2B6-Sepharose and Rom-1 was bound to Rom1C6-Sepharose. After extensive washing in the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with 2% SDS containing PMSF for 15 min at 37 °C. The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Kaplan and Pedersen assay (34.Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the purified preparation of the peripherin/Rds subunit lacked Rom-1 and purified Rom-1 subunit was free of peripherin/Rds as determined by Western blotting. The amount of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 in bovine ROS could not be directly determined from Western blots of ROS since rhodopsin is known to block the electrotransfer of peripherin/Rds and to a lesser extent Rom-1. As a result, the peripherin/Rds complex from nonreduced, Triton X-100-solubilized ROS was quantitatively bound to Per2B6-Sepharose column as described above such that no peripherin/Rds was detected in the unbound fraction. After the matrix was thoroughly washed, the bound peripherin/Rds complex was quantitatively eluted from the column with 2% SDS. The bound and unbound fractions, along with the peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 standards, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under reducing conditions. The amount of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 was determined from laser densitometry of the ECL signal from Western blots. Values interpolated from standard curves were reported as an average of 3 or more experiments and correlated with the protein content in ROS (34.Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To determine the composition of disulfide-linked species, nonreduced ROS were solubilized in an equal volume of denaturing buffer consisting of 1% SDS, 100 mmNEM and PMSF in PBS. The solution was then diluted 10-fold with PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 and PMSF and the peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 containing complexes were selectively adsorbed to either Per2B6-Sepharose or Rom1C6-Sepharose as described above. Bound protein was eluted with 2% SDS in PBS and analyzed under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For analysis of the subunits in glutaraldehyde cross-linked dimers, DTT-reduced ROS were solubilized in Triton X-100 and cross-linked with 0.01% glutaraldehyde as described above. The immunoaffinity-purified complexes were then treated with denaturing buffer and isolated on Per2B6-Sepharose as described above. Samples were denatured with an equal volume of SDS mixture (4% SDS, 0.02M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue in the absence (nonreducing) or presence (reducing) of 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μl were applied to an 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus and the blots were labeled with the Per2B6 or Rom1C6 monoclonal antibodies (5.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar) and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin peroxidase for detection by ECL. Previous studies have shown that a substantial portion of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 from ROS migrates as disulfide-linked dimers on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Connell G. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7.Bascom R.A.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To determine if the intermolecular disulfide bond responsible for these dimers can be reduced within the membrane environment, ROS were treated with 10 mm DTT for various times and the disappearance of peripherin/Rds dimer was monitored on Western blots of nonreducing SDS gels. As shown in Fig. 1, Aand B, peripherin/Rds-containing dimer was exponentially reduced to monomer by DTT with a half-time of 9.8 ± 0.7 min. A similar rate of reduction was observed for Triton X-100-solubilized peripherin/Rds and for membrane bound and solubilized Rom-1 (data not shown). In contrast, glutathione was ineffective as a reducing agent even in the presence of Triton X-100, presumably due to either lower reactivity or inaccessibility of this reagent to the intermolecular disulfide bond (Fig. 1 B). Cysteine, on the other hand, was able to reduce detergent-solubilized peripherin/Rds, but at a slower rate than that observed for DTT (data not shown). A two-dimensional separation technique was devised to assess the contribution of intermolecular disulfide bonds to the oligomeric structure of the peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complex from ROS membranes. In the first dimension, velocity sedimentation was used to resolve oligomeric forms of Triton X-100-solubilized peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complexes from nonreduced (−DTT) and reduced (+DTT) membranes. In the second dimension, fractions from the velocity sedimentation run were treated with NEM to block free sulfhydryl groups and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions for the detection of disulfide-linked dimers by Western blotting. Fig. 2, A and B (left panels), shows the two-dimensional analysis of immunoaffinity purified peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 complex from reduced (+DTT) ROS membranes. Both peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 co-sedimented as a single species (fractions 9–12) with a sedimentation coefficients 20,w of ∼ 5.1, a value that has been previously reported to correspond to a peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 tetramer (29.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31.Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further analysis by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions indicated that this species lacked disulfide-linked dimers. Peripherin/Rds containing proteins from nonreduced ROS, treated with NEM to prevent secondary sulfhydryl oxidation, showed a more complex behavior (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels). Three peripherin/Rds containing components and two Rom-1 containing components were resolved by velocity sedimentation. Componenta (fractions 9–12) sedimented at the same rate as the DTT reduced complex and like this complex consisted solely of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 monomers when analyzed on nonreducing SDS gels. Component b (fractions 5–8) sedimented at a faster rate (s20,w = 7.2) characteristic of a larger oligomer. This component contained both monomers and disulfide-linked dimers of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 proteins when analyzed on nonreducing SDS gels. Peripherin/Rds containing dimers appeared as a single band, whereas Rom-1 containing dimers were resolved into a doublet. The upper band of the Rom-1 doublet comigrated with the peripherin/Rds band and likely corresponds to disulfide-linked peripherin/Rds·Rom-1 heterodimer. The less intense lower band of the Rom-1 doublet lacked peripherin/Rds, and therefore, most likely corresponds to disulfide-linked Rom-1 homodimers. Componentc (fractions 1–3) sedimented with as 20,w of >11 characteristic of a higher-order oligomer. Interestingly, this component lacked Rom-1 and consisted exclusively of disulfide-linked peripherin/Rds homodimers. Similar results were obtained when detergent-solubilized ROS were subjected to velocity sedimentation without prior isolation of the peripherin·Rds complexes except that component c was spread more evenly throughout the lower fractions of the gradient indicative of oligomers of various sizes (data not shown). The relative amounts of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 in the three components resolved by velocity sedimentation were determined by Western blotting and laser densitometry. Analysis was performed on the fractions subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in which peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 migrated as monomers. Approximately, 35% of peripherin/Rds was present in the core complex (componenta), 25% in the intermediate oligomer (componentb), and 40% in the higher order oligomer (componentc). In the case of Rom-1, 56% of Rom-1 was present in component a and 44% in component b. These results indicate that peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 interact through noncovalent bonds to form core homomeric and heteromeric complexes, presumably tetramers. A significant portion of these complexes interact through intermolecular disulfide bonds to form larger oligomers, a large fraction of which is devoid of Rom-1. Previously, peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 separately expressed in COS-1 cells were shown to self-assemble into a multisubunit complex that sedimented as a tetramer under mildly reducing conditions (29.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31.Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have now used the two-dimensional separation technique to analyze for the disulfide-linked oligomerization of individually expressed peripherin/Rds and Rom-1. As shown in Fig. 3, A andB (left panels), both peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 from DTT-treated membranes sedimented as a single species as previously shown (30.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further analysis by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions indicated that these complexes lacked disulfide-linked dimers. The velocity sedimentation profile of peripherin/Rds from nonreduced (−DTT) COS-1 cell membranes showed larger peripherin/Rds oligomers in addition to the core complex (Fig. 3 A, right panel). The oligomers consisted exclusively of disulfide-linked peripherin/Rds dimers when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. In contrast, Rom-1 from nonreduced COS-1 cell membranes showed little tendency to form disulfide-linked oligomers, but instead sedimented primarily as the core complex lacking intermolecular disulfide bonds (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Cysteine at position 150 in the large intradiscal loop of peripherin/Rds has been reported to be responsible for disulfide-linked dimerization of peripherin/Rds (29.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of this cysteine in oligomerization, the sedimentation behavior and disulfide-linked dimerization of the C150S peripherin/Rds mutant was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the C150S mutant from reduced (+DTT) and nonreduced (−DTT) COS-1 cell membranes sedimented as a single core complex devoid of intermolecular disulfide bonds. These studies indicate that Cys-150 mediates disulfide-linked oligomerization of peripherin/Rds core complexes. Covalent cross-linking was used to further analyze subunit associations and disulfide-linked oligomerization of peripherin/Rds and Rom-1. In these studies, DTT-reduced and nonreduced ROS membranes were solubilized in Triton X-100, purified on a Per2B6-Sepharose matrix, and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde for analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The Western blot in Fig. 4 Ashows that a substantial portion of peripherin/Rds from reduced membranes was cross-linked to dimers. Only a faint band corresponding to a tetramer was detected when a relatively high glutaraldehyde concentration (0.01%) was used. In contrast, cross-linking of p"

We determined if Kv4.2 α-subunits were directly phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The intracellular domains of the amino and carboxyl termini of Kv4.2 were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein constructs; we observed that both of these fusion proteins were substrates for PKA in vitro. By using phosphopeptide mapping and amino acid sequencing, we identified PKA phosphorylation sites on the amino- and carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins corresponding to Thr38and Ser552, respectively, within the Kv4.2 sequence. Kinetic characterization of the PKA sites demonstrated phosphorylation kinetics comparable to Kemptide. To evaluate PKA site phosphorylationin situ, phospho-selective antisera for each of the sites were generated. By using COS-7 cells expressing an EGFP-Kv4.2 fusion protein, we observed that stimulation of the endogenous PKA cascade resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Thr38 and Ser552 within Kv4.2 in the intact cell.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 115-135Google Scholar). In both hippocampal pyramidal neurons and ventricular myocytes, a voltage-dependent, A-type K+ channel expressing a transient current is present in high density (2.Serodio P. Kentros C. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 1516-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3.Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ.

(5.Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently reported dense localization of voltage-dependent, A-type K+ channels to the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The A-type K+ current in the distal dendrites was found to limit action potential initiation and back propagation into the dendrites and thereby regulate the magnitude of the excitatory post-synaptic potential in response to synaptic activity (5.Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Likewise in ventricular myocytes, the transient current plays a role in regulating action potential amplitude and in myocardial contractile force (6.Cohen I. Datyner N. Gintant G. Kline R. Fozzard H.A. Jennings R.B. Haber E. Katz A.M. Morgan H.E. The Heart and Cardiovascular System. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1986: 637-670Google Scholar, 7.Barry D.M. Xu H. Schuessler R.B. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In summary, there is strong evidence that transient K+channels in both the hippocampus and myocardium significantly contribute to the regulation of membrane excitability in these regions. The identity of the K+ channel subunit(s) responsible for transient A-type currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and ventricular myocytes is not conclusively known; however, several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that this current is mediated, at least in part, by channels containing Kv4.2, the Shal-type, K+ channel subunit proteins. 1) Kv4.2, forms voltage-dependent, rapidly inactivating K+channels and is selectively localized and abundantly expressed on the soma and dendrites of dentate gyrus and CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons (3.Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Sheng M. Tsaur M.-L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 9.Serodio P. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). 2) Ultrastructural studies have demonstrated that Kv4.2 is localized to the subsynaptic compartment (10.Alonso G. Widmer H. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 3) In myocardium, Kv4.2 is more abundant in ventricular versus atrial myocytes and is more abundant than other subfamily α-subunits known to express a transient current (3.Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). 4) In some mammalian species it has been shown that the transient current occurs in a gradient across the ventricular wall with expression being highest in the epicardial layers (12.Furukawa T. Myerburg R. Furukawa N. Bassett A. Kimura S. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13.Liu D.-W. Gintant G. Antzelevitch C. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As well, it has been shown in some species that the expression of Kv4.2 also follows a gradient in the ventricular myocardium (11.Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the localization and biophysical properties of Kv4.2 are consistent with the idea that this channel subunit contributes to A-type currents in ventricular myocytes and in dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of ion channel function and membrane excitability (14.Levitan I. Kaczmareck L. The Neuron: Cell and Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1991Google Scholar). It is known that some of the voltage-dependent K+ channels are regulated by protein phosphorylation. Voltage-dependent K+ channels are thought to be homo- or heterotetramers of α-subunits with each subunit characterized by six membrane-spanning domains, a pore-forming region, and cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (15.Jan L. Jan Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16.Pongs O. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72 Suppl. 4: 69-88Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Chandy K. Gutman G. North R. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). The α-subunits are typically associated with β-, or ancillary, subunits; however, to date, the ancillary subunits that are associated with Kv4.2 α-subunits have not been identified (2.Serodio P. Kentros C. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 1516-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18.Chabala L.D. Bakry N. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The majority of cases reported so far have demonstrated kinase regulatory sites on the α-subunits of voltage-dependent K+ channels (19.Kaczmarek L. Behav. Neural Biol. 1992; 57: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recognized kinase regulatory sites lie in the cytoplasmic domains of these channels. PKA1 activation is a powerful regulator of hippocampal neuron excitability (20.Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1986; 372: 245-259Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the downstream molecular targets of PKA that directly influence neuronal excitability. Hoffman and Johnston (21.Hoffman D.A. Johnston D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3521-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the voltage-dependent activation of dendritic A-type channels is down-regulated by activation of PKA, strongly suggesting that these channels are a molecular target for PKA. Based on both the selective localization of Kv4.2 in hippocampal dendrites and the demonstration by Hoffman and Johnston (21.Hoffman D.A. Johnston D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3521-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that dendritic A-type currents are regulated by PKA activation, one appealing hypothesis is that PKA directly alters the properties of Kv4.2 by phosphorylation of the channel α-subunit. Although there are no direct lines of evidence for PKA regulation of transient currents in ventricular myocytes, it is known that ventricular myocardial contractility is influenced by neurotransmitter systems such as the β-adrenergic catecholaminergic system which result in downstream activation of the cAMP cascade (22.Williamson J.R. Schaffer S. Recent Adv. Stud. Card. Struct. Metab. 1976; 9: 205-223PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Geschwind H.J. Lhoste F. Scriven A.J. Dhainaut J.F. Sabatier C. Laurent D. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1984; 4: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that in myocytes, transient channels thought to be composed of Kv4 subfamily α-subunits are modulated by additional second messenger systems (24.Nakamura T.Y. Coetzee W.A. Vega-Saenz De Miera E. Artman M. Rudy B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1775-H1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings further support the idea that Kv4.2 may be a molecular target for second messenger cascades involved in regulation of myocardial excitability. The current study tests the hypothesis that the transient K+ channel, Kv4.2, is a downstream target for the PKA second messenger cascade. We determined that recombinant GST fusion protein constructs of the amino and carboxyl termini of Kv4.2 are substrates for PKA. The phosphorylation sites on the GST fusion proteins were identified with phosphopeptide mapping and automated amino acid sequencing of the recombinant proteins following phosphorylation by PKA in vitro. Kinetic analysis revealed that these sites are attractive PKA substrates withK m and V max values that are comparable to those of a well established PKA substrate, Kemptide. The sequencing data for the PKA phosphorylation sites on Kv4.2 were then used to generate phospho-site-selective antibodies, by using synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites as antigens. These antibodies were then used to quantitate changes in phosphorylation of Kv4.2 expressed in COS-7 cells. Activation of the PKA cascade in COS-7 cells expressing Kv4.2 results in an increase in immunoreactivity, indicating that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sites are phosphorylated within Kv4.2 in the intact cell. In the final series of experiments the antibodies were used to demonstrate modulation of PKA phosphorylation of Kv4.2 in hippocampal area CA1. The Kv4.2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal domain proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins using methods modified from Hakes and Dixon (25.Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the amino-terminal (amino acid residues 1–133) and carboxyl-terminal (residues 411–630) domain cDNAs were constructed using the GST fusion vector pGEX-KN (25.Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A single colony of BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells transformed with the amino- or carboxyl-terminal plasmid was grown in Luria broth (LB, 170 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract) containing 20 μg/ml carbenicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then used to seed a 500-ml culture. After growing to an optical density of 0.6–0.8 (A 600) the culture was centrifuged (Beckman model J2–21M, 1000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of LB with carbenicillin. The bacteria were induced by incubation at room temperature with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 4 h and were harvested by centrifugation. The methods for protein purification and solubilization were modified from those previously published (26.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar, 27.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended and incubated in Tris buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 15 min at 30 °C. Following solubilization with 1.5%N-laurylsarcosine, the lysate was incubated with 20 μg/ml DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 mmMgCl2. The lysate was then centrifuged (Sorvall RT 6000B, 1000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and adjusted to a 2% Triton X-100 concentration. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione affinity absorption. Glutathione-agarose beads were washed, resuspended in Tris buffer 1, and then incubated with the lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with Tris buffer 1 by repeated centrifugation (Sorvall, 100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). After the final wash, the bead preparation was resuspended in Tris buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The recombinant proteins were left on the beads for subsequent experiments. Kv4.2 amino- or carboxyl-terminal GST fusion proteins were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 70 ng of the catalytic subunit of PKA, Tris buffer 2, and ATP mix 1 (100 μm ATP, 100 mmMgCl2, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min with sample buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm DTT, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.04 mg/ml bromphenol blue). The GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphopeptides were identified by autoradiography. As a control parallel reactions were performed for GST with and without PKA and ATP mix 1. A time course of PKA phosphorylation of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal proteins was performed. PKA phosphorylation reactions were performed as described previously except for the following modifications: a preparative scale (reaction volume of 300–400 μl) was used, specific activity was increased (20 μCi of γ-32P/25-μl reaction volume and 50 μmATP), and the incubation period was increased to 90 min based on the time course of PKA phosphorylation of the fusion proteins. The phosphorylated amino- or carboxyl-terminal GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Following Coomassie Blue staining of the gels, the bands corresponding to the amino- or carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins were excised, and an in-gel digestion with trypsin or Lys-C was performed as described previously with minor modifications (28.Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Following extraction from the gel, the peptides were separated using reverse phase HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) with absorption monitoring at 214, 254, and 280 nm. Counts/min (cpm) in each HPLC fraction was measured as Cerenkov radiation. Phosphopeptides identified as HPLC fractions containing high radioactivity were applied to Sequelon arylamine membranes (Millipore Corp.) essentially as described by the manufacturer. After drying, the membrane was rinsed two times sequentially with 10 ml of methanol, then with water, and finally with 5 ml of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile in water. The membrane was air-dried, cut into pieces with a scalpel blade, and inserted in a BLOTT cartridge and sequenced in an Applied Biosystems model 477A Protein Sequencer with an in-line 120A PTH-Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using optimized cycles. Instead of butyl chloride, 90% methanol containing phosphoric acid (15 μl/100 ml) was used to extract the cleaved amino acids. After conversion, 50% of the sample was transferred to the HPLC for phenylthiohydantoin-derivative identification, and the other 50% was collected in the instrument fraction collector for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Peptides were synthesized in the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory (Baylor College of Medicine) which contained the Kv4.2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites. The synthetic peptides (NT-(32–44)) and (CT-(546–558)) had a total of 14 amino acid residues corresponding to Kv4.2 channel residues 32–44 on the amino terminus and residues 546–558 on the carboxyl terminus, respectively. The phosphorylation site was located in the middle (amino acid number 7) of the peptide, and a cysteine residue was located at the carboxyl terminus (amino acid number 14) of each peptide (Figs.7 A and 8 A).Figure 8Concentration curve for PKA phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 carboxyl-terminal domain. A, kinetic characterization of the carboxyl-terminal site was performed using a synthetic peptide (CT-(546–558)) containing the carboxyl-terminal PKA phosphorylation site. B, the concentration curve for PKA phosphorylation of CT-(546–558) at concentrations ranging from 5 to 400 μm is shown. Each point is the mean of two determinations assayed in duplicate. Inset, Lineweaver-Burk plot of these data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the kinase assays used for kinetic characterization of the PKA phosphorylation sites, the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained Tris buffer 2, 70 ng of the catalytic subunit of PKA, and the NT-(32–44) or CT-(546–558) synthetic peptides. All of the kinase assays were started by the addition of the ATP mix 2 (100 μm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and were incubated at 25 °C. The reactions were stopped by spotting duplicate 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture onto Whatman 81 phosphocellulose filter papers and washing in 75 mm H3PO4. After a last wash in 99% methanol, the papers were dried, immersed in Aquasol-2, and counted. For each experimental condition, counts obtained from a reaction without substrate peptide were subtracted. The assays used to determine K m andV max were linear with respect to time and linear with added kinase (PKA), and less than 10% of the peptide substrate was converted to product. To obtain the concentration curve for each of the peptides, peptide concentrations ranging from 5 to 400 μm were used. As a control parallel reactions were included using the PKA substrate Kemptide. The activated catalytic domain of protein kinase C (PKC), catalytic domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were assayed for phosphorylation of the NT-(32–44) or CT-(546–558) substrates. Known substrates for each of the kinases were used as positive controls as follows: PKC, NG-(28–43), a synthetic peptide analogue of a fragment of neurogranin (29.Chen S.-J. Klann E. Gower M.C. Powell C.M. Sessoms J.S. Sweatt J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); CaMKII, Autocamtide-2; and MAPK, myelin basic protein. The methods used for the kinase assays were as described above with the following modifications: the PKC reaction contained 0.1 μg of PKC; the CaMKII reaction contained 2 μg of CaMKII, reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA), and 2.4 mm calmodulin; and the MAPK reaction mixture had 0.5 μg of activated MAPK and reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm ATP). The synthetic peptides NT-(32–44) or CT-(546–558) containing the phosphorylated Thr38 and Ser552 PKA sites were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. The antisera were screened by Western blotting using the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ovalbumin-coupled synthetic peptides and GST fusion proteins. The antisera were affinity purified against the NT-(32–44) or CT-(546–558) synthetic peptides using Hi-trap columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified antisera were used to examine PKA recognition of the phosphorylation sites on the amino and carboxyl termini when Kv4.2 was expressed as an EGFP fusion protein in COS-7 cells. The FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent was used for COS-7 cells transfections with plasmid DNAs (0.1–2.0 μg/μl), using cytomegalovirus promoters expressing EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) (30.Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar), EGFP-Kv4.2 fusion protein, or Kv4.2 alone. The EGFP-Kv4.2 fusion protein was made by introduction of a synthetic NotI site in the C terminus of EGFP. The amino terminus of Kv4.2 was adapted by PCR to clone in-frame with EGFP at the NotI site just before the initiation Met codon. The EGFP-Kv4.2 expression construct resulted in considerably higher levels of Kv4.2 protein expression compared with the Kv4.2 non-fusion construct, for unknown reasons, and therefore was the construct of choice for our cellular phosphorylation studies. Transfected cells were grown on 35-mm plates to a 2 × 105 cell density. The cell cultures were then incubated for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.5, 137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4) containing either 50 μmforskolin and 75 μm RO126 in Me2SO or Me2SO alone (vehicle control). The cells were then harvested and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10% SDS with 100 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sample buffer was then added, and the samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel (10%) for Western blotting. Three antibodies were used for the Western blots as follows: the phospho-selective amino-terminal antibody, 2) the phospho-selective carboxyl-terminal antibody, and 3) the general carboxyl-terminal antibody (not phospho-selective). The third antibody was generated by injection of the carboxyl-terminal fusion protein construct of Kv4.2 and characterized in the laboratory of P. J. Pfaffinger. Immunoreactivity was measured using densitometry (NIH Image). Densitometry data were analyzed with a paired Student's ttest. In the final series of experiments the amino- and carboxyl-terminal phospho-selective antibodies were used to evaluate modulation of PKA phosphorylation of Kv4.2 in hippocampal area CA1. Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared using the methodology of Robersonet al. (31.Roberson E.D. English J.D. Adams J. Selcher J. Kondratick C. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the slices had been maintained for 45–60 min in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (32 °C), 50 μmforskolin and 75 μm RO126 in Me2SO or Me2SO alone (vehicle control) was applied for 10 min. The methodology of Roberson et al. (31.Roberson E.D. English J.D. Adams J. Selcher J. Kondratick C. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for microdissection, storage, and sonication of the hippocampal CA1 subfields. The CA1 sonicates were centrifuged (Beckman, 100,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended as described for the COS-7 cells except that 200 mm DTT was used in the 10% SDS solution and in the sample buffer. The CA1 membrane proteins were then used for Western blotting with the amino- and carboxyl-terminal phospho-selective antibodies. The entire sample from one CA1 subregion was loaded per lane. The GraphPad Prism software package was used for statistical analysis of the data. Error bars represent S.E. The catalytic subunit of PKA, Kemptide, myelin basic protein, and forskolin were obtained from Sigma. The catalytic subunit of PKC (rat brain) and Autocamtide-2 were obtained from Calbiochem. CaMKII (truncated, 1–325 amino acids) and calmodulin were obtained from New England Biolabs. Activated MAPK was obtained from Stratagene. Glutathione-agarose beads and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The EGFP construct was obtained from CLONTECH. The anti-Kv4.2 antibody was obtained from Alomone Labs. This antibody was made against a peptide corresponding to Kv4.2 residues 454–469. The NT-(32–44) or CT-(546–558) peptides were synthesized in the Protein Core Chemistry Laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine using an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Protein concentrations and amino acid compositions were determined by amino acid analysis. The NT-(32–44) or CT-(546–558) peptides were coupled to activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Albino New Zealand rabbits were injected with an initial inoculation of 100 μg of antigen in Titremax adjuvant followed by four 50-μg boosts according to the Cocalicao Biological Labs protocol. Test bleeds were performed after the first 2 boosts. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of Kv4.2 revealed a number of candidate PKA phosphorylation sites (Fig.1). We deemed the most likely possibilities to be two sites within the amino-terminal and seven within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains. These sites were of particular interest because previous studies have demonstrated Shaker-type K+ channel regulation by protein kinase phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions (32.Jonas E.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and also because these sites are in the putative intracellular domains accessible to protein kinases. We first tested the hypothesis that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Kv4.2 are PKA substrates. Recombinant protein constructs (GST fusion proteins) of the amino and carboxyl termini of Kv4.2 were phosphorylated with PKA in vitro. Reaction products were separated with SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal constructs were identified with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). Autoradiography revealed 32P labeling in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal recombinant proteins (Fig. 2) and confirmed that GST was not phosphorylated by PKA (not shown). Based on these findings, we conclude that both of the recombinant proteins corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Kv4.2 are substrates for PKA. Our next goal was to identify the PKA phosphorylation sites on the cytoplasmic domains of Kv4.2. The GST fusion proteins were utilized for these experiments because we could express large amounts of the proteins for use in phosphopeptide mapping and sequencing. First, the fusion proteins were incubated with PKA and 32P in vitro, separated with SDS-PAGE, and then identified by Coomassie Blue staining. Bands corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal constructs were excised, eluted, and proteolyzed. We performed phosphopeptide mapping and amino acid sequencing of the phosphorylated Kv4.2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins. A single PKA phosphorylation site was identified in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The phosphopeptide map for the amino-terminal construct demonstrated a single peak in radioactivity in HPLC fraction 48 (Fig. 3 B) corresponding to a single HPLC absorbance peak (Fig. 3 A). HPLC fraction 48 was sequenced using automated Edman degradation, and the amount of radioactivity released with each sequencing cycle was measured (Fig.4 B). This revealed a single phosphopeptide corresponding to Kv4.2 amino-terminal residues 36–51, with one phosphorylation site at Thr38 (Fig.4 A).Figure 4Identification of the PKA phosphorylation site on the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Kv4.2. A, the sequence of the phosphopeptide in HPLC fraction 48 that was determined by automated amino acid sequencing corresponded to amino acids 36–51 within the amino-terminal domain of Kv4.2.

https://openalex.org/W1967131476,"Point mutations are generally assumed to involve changes of single nucleotides. Nevertheless, the nature and known mechanisms of mutation do not exclude the possibility that several adjacent nucleotides may change simultaneously in a single mutational event. Two independent approaches are used here to estimate the frequency of simultaneous double-nucleotide substitutions. The first examines switches between TCN and AGY (where N is any nucleotide and Y is a pyrimidine) codons encoding absolutely conserved serine residues in a number of proteins from diverse organisms. The second reveals double-nucleotide substitutions in primate noncoding sequences. These two complementary approaches provide similar high estimates for the rate of doublet substitutions, on the order of 0.1 per site per billion years."

Whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) preferentially react with bases in DNA, free radicals also abstract hydrogen atoms from deoxyribose, resulting in the formation of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites and strand breaks. We recently reported high steady-state levels of AP sites in rat tissues and human liver DNA (Nakamura, J., and Swenberg, J. A. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 2522–2526). These AP sites were predominantly cleaved 5′ to the lesion. We hypothesized that these endogenous AP sites were derived from oxidative stress. In this investigation, AP sites induced by ROS were quantitated and characterized. A combination of H2O2 and FeSO4 induced significant numbers of AP sites in calf thymus DNA, which were predominantly cleaved 5′ to the AP sites (75% of total aldehydic AP sites). An increase in the number of 5′-AP sites was also detected in human cultured cells exposed to H2O2, and these 5′-AP sites were persistent during the post-exposure period. β-Elimination by DNA β-polymerase efficiently excised 5′-regular AP sites, but not 5′-AP sites, in DNA from cells exposed to H2O2.

ROS can react with cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to induce DNA adducts such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) (1.Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar,2.Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). It is believed that these oxidized bases are predominantly repaired by a base excision repair pathway (3.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). In this process, a bifunctional 8-OH-dG-DNA glycosylase with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanine-DNA glycosylase cleaves theN-glycosylic bond between 8-hydroxyguanine and deoxyribose and incises immediately 3′ to AP sites, leaving 3′-nicked AP sites (4.Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar,5.Rosenquist T.A. Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The 3′-AP sites generated by the DNA glycosylase are subsequently excised by class II AP endonuclease (3.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), resulting in a 3′-hydroxyl group and a 5′-phosphate group. Repair is completed by polymerase and ligase activity. Recently, it has been reported that mammalian cell extracts repair 8-OH-dG preferentially via single nucleotide replacement reactions (6.Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7.Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The contribution of nucleotide excision repair to the removal of 8-OH-dG was not significant in experiments using human cell extracts (6.Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7.Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These results indicate that base excision repair plays a central role in counteracting oxidized base lesions. In addition to base damage in DNA, ROS also induce lesions by hydrogen abstraction of the deoxyribose, frequently producing oxidized AP sites as well as DNA strand breaks (8.Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). AP sites are also generated spontaneously by chemical depurination of labile oxidized bases and enzymatically by DNA glycosylases as mentioned above. Hydrogen abstraction has been examined extensively for model deoxyribose and polynucleotides (9.Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1987: 238-249Google Scholar). Although <10% of the hydroxyl radicals attack sugar residues in single-stranded polynucleotides, it has been proposed that oxidized AP sites induced by ROS may be one of the major oxidative lesions in double-stranded DNA (3.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 9.Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1987: 238-249Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that all hydrogen atoms of deoxyribose and ribose are potential targets for direct attack by oxygen radicals. In B-form duplex DNA, however, hydrogen atoms at the C-4′ and C-5′ positions of deoxyribose are the most accessible to ROS (10.Pogozelski W.K. Tullius T.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1089-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). ROS-induced sugar lesions and strand cleavage in genomic DNA are difficult to examine, mainly due to the large variety of products as well as their instability even at mild temperatures and neutral pH (11.Lafleur M.V.M. Woldhuis J. Loman H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1981; 39: 113-118Google Scholar). Many oxidized sugars are very labile, as terminal sugar lesions tend to be modified spontaneously during experimental procedures. We recently developed a sensitive aldehyde reactive probe slot-blot (ASB) assay to detect aldehydic AP sites in DNA, which can quantitate <1 AP site/106 nucleotides (12.Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar). Using this assay, we detected 50,000–200,000 AP sites in mammalian cells under normal physiological conditions (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Large numbers of AP sites were detected in brain, heart, and colon DNAs, which appear to be continuously exposed to higher levels of oxidative stress. These endogenous AP sites were predominantly cleaved 5′ to the AP sites. Therefore, we hypothesized that oxidative stress directly induces 5′-nicked oxidized AP sites, which may contribute to a high steady-state level of AP sites in mammalian cells and tissues. To test this hypothesis, we have quantitated and characterized AP sites induced by ROS. We also have examined the repair efficiency of these AP sites in human cultured cells. Thymus was harvested from a newborn Holstein calf and quickly frozen on dry ice. After thawing, the calf thymus was homogenized in lysis buffer (Gentra Systems, Inc.) with 10 mm2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (TEMPO; Aldrich) on ice. DNA was then isolated by phenol/Sevag (chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, 24:1) extraction and purified as described (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Calf thymus DNA (Sigma) was treated with 10 mmmethoxyamine (MX) in 10 mm Tris-HCl/KOH (pH 7.4) and purified as described (12.Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar). Calf thymus DNA isolated in our laboratory or commercially obtained calf thymus DNA (Sigma) pretreated with MX was incubated with H2O2 and/or FeSO4 in 10 mm Tris-HCl/KOH (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 10 min with or without TEMPO. The AP site assay was performed immediately after the Fenton reaction. For measurement of oxidative base lesions, the Fenton reaction was quenched by addition of 15 mm TEMPO, and the DNA was recovered by precipitation with cold ethanol. After washing the DNA pellet with 70% ethanol, DNA was resuspended in distilled water containing 1 mm TEMPO. The AP site assay was performed following a procedure slightly modified from that reported by Nakamura and Swenberg (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of DNA in 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was incubated with 1 mm aldehyde reactive probe at 37 °C for 10 min. After precipitation using cold ethanol, DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA). The DNA concentration was measured by a UV spectrophotometer, and the DNA solution was then prepared at 0.5 or 1 μg/100 μl of TE buffer. Heat-denatured DNA was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Super, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nitrocellulose membrane was soaked with 5× SSC and then baked in a vacuum oven for 30 min. The membrane was preincubated with 10 ml of Tris-HCl containing bovine serum albumin for 15 min and then incubated in the same solution containing streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 45 min. After rinsing the nitrocellulose membrane, the enzymatic activity on the membrane was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. The nitrocellulose filter was then exposed to x-ray film, and the developed film was analyzed using an Ultrascan XL scanning densitometer. The AP site cleavage assay was performed as described (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The number of total AP sites was measured by the ASB assay as described above. Eight μg of DNA and 145 units ofEscherichia coli exonuclease III (Exo III) (New England Biolabs Inc.) were incubated in 135 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl/KOH (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 1 min and immediately analyzed by the ASB assay. Eight μg of DNA, 10 mmEDTA, and 100 mm putrescine were incubated in 135 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl/KOH at 37 °C for 30 min and immediately analyzed by the ASB assay. Eight μg of DNA and 145 units of exonuclease III in 110 μ1 of 10 mm Tris-HCl/KOH were incubated at 37 °C for 1 min, immediately followed by addition of 0.1 volume of 100 mm EDTA. The sample was incubated with 100 mm putrescine in the reaction buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, immediately followed by the ASB assay. Oxidative pyrimidine bases are repaired by E. coliendonuclease III (End III), leaving AP sites on the DNA backbone (3.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). End III was kindly provided by Dr. Y. W. Kow (Emory University). The End III-sensitive site assay was performed as described (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of 8-OH-dG was based on an HPLC/electrochemical detection approach that was modified from a method previously described by Richter et al. (14.Richter C. Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). DNA was hydrolyzed enzymatically to deoxyribonucleosides using deoxyribonuclease I, spleen phosphodiesterase, snake venom phosphodiesterase, and alkaline phosphatase. The digest was separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and 8-OH-dG was quantitated using an electrochemical array detector (ESA). Electrochemical oxidation was monitored at 200, 300, 375, 450, 525, 600, 700, and 800 mV. The concentration of 8-OH-dG was normalized to the amount of DNA analyzed, as determined by UV absorbance. HeLa S3 cells were obtained as suspension cells from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) without serum (4 × 105cells/ml). The cultured cells were exposed to H2O2 (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min, immediately followed by centrifugation. After washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cell pellets were frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. To test the repair efficiency of oxidative DNA lesions, cells washed in phosphate-buffered saline were further resuspended in 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and cultured at 37 °C for up to 6 h. DNA isolation from cultured cells was performed using the PureGene DNA extraction kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.). Briefly, cell pellets were thawed and lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm TEMPO. After protein precipitation with a protein precipitation solution, the DNA/RNA mixture in the supernatant was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. The DNA/RNA pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer with 10 mm TEMPO and incubated with RNases T1 (50 units/ml) and A (100 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by protein and DNA precipitation. The DNA pellet was resuspended in sterilized distilled water with 1 mm TEMPO. The DNA solution was stored at −80 °C for assays. The AP site repair assay was performed by a procedure slightly modified from the AP site cleavage assay. Eight μg of DNA pretreated with heat/acid buffer (12.Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar) and 90 units of Exo III were incubated in 45 μl of 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4) containing 50 mmNaCl and 8 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 1 min to introduce 5′-nicked regular AP sites. In this experiment, CaCl2 was used instead of MgCl2 to avoid further DNA degradation by the exonuclease activity of Exo III. The DNA solution was subsequently incubated with human β-pol (a gift from Dr. S. H. Wilson, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health) or putrescine at different concentrations in 67.5 μl of 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl and 5.4 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The aldehyde reactive probe reaction was performed in the mixture supplemented with 3.4 μl of 100 mm EDTA, 64.1 μl of 50 mm Hepes/KOH, and 15 μl of 10 mm aldehyde reactive probe at 37 °C for 10 min and immediately analyzed by the ASB assay. Eight μg of DNA pre-exposed to the Fenton reaction was incubated with human β-pol or putrescine at different concentrations as described above and analyzed by the AP site assay. The efficiency of AP site repair was calculated by the reduction of AP sites by β-pol divided by the reduction of AP sites by putrescine. One of the most significant oxygen radicals is the hydroxyl radical, which is generated by the reaction of reduced transition metals with H2O2 via the Fenton reaction (15.Henle E.S. Han Z. Tang N. Rai P. Luo Y. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 962-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To address whether oxygen radicals induced by the Fenton reaction directly generate AP sites in DNA, calf thymus DNA pretreated with MX was incubated with 10 μm FeSO4 with or without H2O2 at 37 °C for 10 min under neutral pH conditions. The number of AP sites in MX-pretreated calf thymus DNA increased following treatment with 10 μmFeSO4 and was further enhanced by H2O2 (Fig.1 A). TEMPO, a radical-trapping reagent containing a nitrone group (9.Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1987: 238-249Google Scholar), is known to reduce the number of 8-OH-dGs in mammalian tissues at 1 mm (16.Hofer T. Moller L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To investigate whether TEMPO inhibits AP site formation by the Fenton reaction, MX-pretreated calf thymus DNA was reacted with 10 μm H2O2 and FeSO4with or without TEMPO. TEMPO prevented AP site formation in a dose-dependent manner and completely protected DNA from AP site formation at concentrations of 10 mm (Fig.1 B). To test whether AP sites are major oxidative lesions induced by the Fenton reaction, we compared the number of AP sites, End III-sensitive sites, and 8-OH-dGs in calf thymus DNA following the Fenton reaction. End III cleaves theN-glycosylic bond between deoxyribose and most oxidized pyrimidines, leaving 3′-cleaved AP sites (3.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The number of End III-sensitive sites was calculated from the number of AP sites with End III treatment minus the number of AP sites with putrescine treatment. Since commercially available calf thymus DNA contains relatively large amounts of oxidative base lesions even without any treatment, we isolated DNA from fresh calf thymus with 10 mm TEMPO in this experiment. Whereas the steady-state level of AP sites was detected at 8 lesions/106 nucleotides in isolated calf thymus DNA, endogenous 8-OH-dG (detection limit: 1 lesion/107 dGs) was not detectable, and End III-sensitive sites (detection limit: 2 lesions/106 nucleotides) were around the detection limit. Using calf thymus DNA isolated in this laboratory, a combination of 10 μmH2O2 and 10 μm FeSO4generated End III-sensitive sites and 8-OH-dG at 96 and 424 lesions/106 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 1, Cand D). These results indicated that the Fenton reaction induced by 10 μm H2O2 and 10 μm FeSO4 produced predominantly 8-OH-dG, followed by pyrimidine base lesions and AP sites (the ratio of 8-OH-dGs, End III-sensitive sites, and AP sites was ∼9.7:2.2:1). In addition to AP sites, the formation of these oxidative base lesions by the Fenton reaction was almost completely protected by TEMPO at concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 mm (Fig. 1,C and D). In the subsequent experiments, we isolated DNA from cultured cells with lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm TEMPO to avoid artifactual formation of oxidative base lesions as well as AP sites. ROS can induce sugar lesions directly by hydrogen abstraction of deoxyribose, resulting in AP sites as well as DNA strand breaks. AP sites are also generated spontaneously by chemical depurination of labile oxidized bases and unmodified bases and enzymatically by cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond between the sugar and modified bases. We recently developed an AP site cleavage assay to examine the site of cleavage at AP sites (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the AP sites induced by ROS were 5′- or 3′-nicked or intact, the AP site cleavage assay was performed for MX-pretreated calf thymus DNA exposed to the Fenton reaction. MX-pretreated calf thymus DNA containing 5.9 ± 0.9 (mean ± S.D.) AP sites/106nucleotides was incubated with 10 μmH2O2 and 10 μm FeSO4for 10 min. The number of AP sites increased to 37 AP sites/106 nucleotides (Fig.2 A). In this assay, we used Exo III as the class II AP endonuclease to identify 3′-cleavage of AP sites and putrescine to detect 5′-nicks. Immediately after the Fenton reaction, DNA was incubated with Exo III and/or putrescine, followed by the ASB assay. A single treatment of Exo III reduced the number of AP sites to 34 AP sites/106 nucleotides. This reduction was comparable to the data we published earlier (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar) and may be due to the combination of enzymatic incision on the 5′-side by Exo III and nonspecific 3′-cleavage of AP sites during incubation with Exo III. In contrast, putrescine treatment resulted in significant reduction of the original number of AP sites. After incubation with Exo III followed by putrescine, the number of AP sites was reduced by 86% from the original number of AP sites in MX-pretreated calf thymus DNA exposed to the Fenton reaction. The summarized fractions of intact and cleaved AP sites and residual aldehydic lesions are shown in Fig. 2 B(left). A major finding was that the AP site cleavage fractions induced by the Fenton reactions were different from those induced by heat/acid depurination (Fig. 2 B,right) (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate AP site formation in cellular DNA by oxygen radicals, we exposed HeLa S3 cells to H2O2 at 3–20 mm without serum at 37 °C for 15 min. Toxicity of H2O2 to cells was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay. The viability of cells was >95% when the cultured cells were harvested. HeLa cells showed a slight increase in the number of AP sites following exposure to H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). The number of End III-sensitive sites and 8-OH-dGs was also increased by treatment with H2O2 (the ratio of induction of 8-OH-dGs, End III-sensitive sites, and AP sites at 10 mmH2O2 was ∼0.6:1.4:1) (Fig. 3B and Table I). If we assume that H2O2 exposure induces the Fenton reaction in cellular DNA, AP sites become among one of the major oxidative DNA lesions in cells. Furthermore, these data suggest that the repair of 8-OH-dG may be more efficient compared with the repair of AP sites and oxidized pyrimidine base lesions.Table INumber of 8-OH-dGs in HeLa cells exposed to 10 mmH2O2H2O2exposure8-OH-dGs/106 nucleotides (±SD)a8-OH-dG was analyzed from four individual samples/group.0 hbTime after exposure to H2O2.4 h6 h0 mm0.05 ± 0.06cThe numbers of 8-OH-dGs were not detectable for two samples.

Open table in a new tab To further investigate the repair efficiency of these oxidative DNA lesions, the cultured cells were post-incubated in fresh medium with 10% serum for up to 6 h after the exposure to 10 mm H2O2. 8-OH-dG was repaired ∼83% within 6 h, and oxidized pyrimidines were repaired ∼40% (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, we detected no reduction in the number of AP sites after the 6-h repair period. The data further confirmed that AP sites induced by H2O2 are more resistant to cellular excision repair pathways compared with oxidized bases. The AP sites in cells exposed to H2O2 were characterized using the AP site cleavage assay. The number of 5′-AP sites and residual aldehydic lesions increased 2–3 times compared with controls after exposure to 10 mm H2O2 (Fig.4). These lesions tended to accumulate during the repair period. In contrast, the combined fraction of 3′-nicked and intact AP sites did not increase in cells exposed to H2O2. To better understand the persistence of 5′-AP sites in cells after exposure to H2O2, we tested whether β-pol could excise 5′-AP sites introduced by oxidative stress. MX-pretreated calf thymus DNA exposed either to the Fenton reaction or to heat/acid buffer followed by the incision 5′ to AP sites by Exo III was incubated with β-pol or putrescine. The efficiency of AP site repair was calculated by the reduction of AP sites through β-elimination by β-pol divided by the reduction of AP sites through β-elimination by putrescine. β-pol efficiently excised 5′-regular AP sites at a concentration of 60 ng/67.2 μl (Fig.5). In contrast, 5′-AP sites directly introduced by ROS were less efficiently excised from the DNA backbone by β-pol. To address whether 5′-AP sites in cells exposed to H2O2 are repaired like 5′-regular AP sites or 5′-AP sites/ROS, the DNA from HeLa cells exposed to 20 mmH2O2 was incubated with β-pol at 60 ng/67.2 μl, followed by the ASB assay. These 5′-AP sites were also excised less efficiently by β-pol compared with 5′-regular AP sites. We also detected a β-pol-resistant AP site fraction after a combined treatment of Exo III and β-pol (data not shown).Figure 5AP site repair assay by β-pol. The efficiency of excision of 5′-nicked AP sites by the dRp lyase activity of β-pol was determined for 5′-regular AP sites and 5′-AP sites/ROS in calf thymus DNA and for 5′-AP sites in DNA from HeLa cells immediately after exposure to 20 mm H2O2. The efficiency of AP site repair was calculated by the reduction of AP sites by β-pol divided by the reduction of AP sites by putrescine. The mean values were from duplicate slots of three individual samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A large number of AP sites are produced continuously by spontaneous depurination in mammalian cells (12.Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar), leaving intact AP sites. Oxidative stress also induces labile ring-saturated pyrimidine adducts that result in intact AP sites by chemical depyrimidination. These intact AP sites are subsequently incised 5′ to AP sites by class II AP endonuclease. Most oxidative base lesions are also excised by bifunctional DNA glycosylases with AP lyase activity, which introduce 3′-AP sites. In addition, hydrogen abstraction directly induces both 5′- and 3′-nicked AP sites (8.Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 9.Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1987: 238-249Google Scholar, 10.Pogozelski W.K. Tullius T.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1089-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Therefore, a significant number of intact, 5′- and 3′-cleaved AP sites may be induced in cells under oxidative stress conditions. The present study demonstrated that oxidative stress predominantly induced 5′-cleaved AP sites in DNAin vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 5′-nicked AP sites directly induced by ROS were efficiently released from the DNA backbone through β-elimination by putrescine, but not by β-pol (Fig. 5). In contrast, 5′-cleaved regular AP sites induced by heat/acid treatment followed by Exo III were efficiently excised by either putrescine or β-pol. These results indicate that the 5′-AP sites induced in vivo and in vitro by ROS are repaired differently than 5′-regular AP sites. In B-form duplex DNA, ROS most likely induce sugar lesions directly by abstraction of hydrogen atoms at the C-4′ or C-5′ position of deoxyribose (9.Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1987: 238-249Google Scholar, 10.Pogozelski W.K. Tullius T.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1089-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 11.Lafleur M.V.M. Woldhuis J. Loman H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1981; 39: 113-118Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, hydrogen abstraction at C-4′ results in DNA cleavage to produce the 3′-phosphoglycolate terminus, the base propenal, and the 5′-monoester phosphate terminus. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions, hydroxyl radicals induce C-4′-hydroxylated abasic sites with an equilibrium between C-4′-oxidized aldehydic AP sites. Hydrogen abstraction at C-5′ has also been proposed to produce 5′-cleaved aldehydic AP sites under aerobic conditions (8.Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 11.Lafleur M.V.M. Woldhuis J. Loman H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1981; 39: 113-118Google Scholar). These AP sites with an aldehydic moiety should be a substrate for β-elimination and are detectable by the ASB assay. Therefore, we hypothesize that the 5′-AP sites induced by ROS represent oxidized AP sites such as 5′-cleaved C-4′- or C-5′-oxidized AP sites. Whereas putrescine excised 5′-regular AP sites at 100 mm, β-pol efficiently cleaved 3′ to the 5′-AP sites at 80 nm. These results are in good agreement with the differences in the efficiency of cleavage of intact and 5′-nicked AP sites by putrescine (17.Lindahl T. Anderson A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3618-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and β-pol (18.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A 49-base pair oligonucleotide duplex DNA (20 nm) with a single intact or 5′-incised AP site (10,000 lesions/106 nucleotides) was cleaved ∼50% by treatment with 200 and 5 nm β-pol, respectively, for 15 min at 37 °C (18.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, we utilized long genomic DNA containing a much lower frequency of AP sites (20 lesions/106nucleotides), which appears to be a more biologically relevant frequency based on the number of endogenous AP sites (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, β-pol excised the 5′-dRp (deoxyribose phosphate) moiety in long genomic DNA as efficiently as those in oligonucleotides at similar concentrations. These data suggest that β-pol efficiently recognizes and excises 5′-cleaved regular AP sites under physiologically relevant conditions. Aldehydic AP sites were relatively minor oxidative DNA lesions generated by the Fenton reaction in in vitro experiments, whereas these AP sites became one of the major oxidative lesions in genomic DNA from cells exposed to H2O2. Furthermore, 5′-cleaved AP sites were more persistent compared with oxidative base lesions in cultured cells after exposure to oxidative stress. As described above, putrescine, but not β-pol, efficiently excised 5′-AP sites induced by ROS. These data indicate that 5′-AP sites induced by oxidative stress are not repaired efficiently by cellular excision repair pathways. However, the results regarding the efficiency of repair by putrescine indicate that the lesions are potentially repairable through β-elimination by an amine moiety. It has been proposed that the amine residue Lys72 in β-pol forms a Schiff base intermediate with the AP site and cleaves 3′ to the AP site (19.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The difference in dRp lyase activity between putrescine and β-pol for 5′-AP sites induced by ROS suggests that the amine moiety of Lys72 in β-pol may not efficiently reach the aldehydic moiety of 5′-nicked oxidized AP sites. This inefficiency might be explained as follows: 1) β-pol inefficiently recognizes these 5′-aldehydic AP sites induced by ROS; or 2) after β-pol recognizes 5′-oxidized AP sites, Lys72 in β-pol does not reach the aldehydic moiety of these AP sites due to structural difference of oxidized AP sites. Although 5′-nicked C-4′-oxidized AP sites induced by bleomycin followed by human AP endonuclease are excised by β-pol (20.Xu Y.-j. Kim E.Y. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28837-28844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the excision efficiencies of β-pol for 5′-nicked C-4′- or C-5′-oxidized AP sites directly induced by oxidative stress are still unknown. We hypothesize that 5′-oxidized AP sites directly induced by ROS may be repaired by the Flap endonuclease-1-dependent long patch base excision pathway. In our previous study, we found large numbers of endogenous 5′-nicked AP sites in rat tissues and human liver (13.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cleavage fractions of AP sites induced by the Fenton reaction are similar to those of endogenous AP sites in rat and human tissues. Although it has been believed that AP sites are efficiently repaired, oxidized AP sites are not excised as efficiently as regular AP sites in cells. Therefore, we believe that endogenous AP sites arise primarily from oxidized AP sites rather than from regular AP sites. We suggest that the high steady-state level of AP sites might be due to an inefficient short patch base excision repair pathway by β-pol. It was originally demonstrated that β-pol required MgCl2for dRp lyase activity (21.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, Prasad et al. (18.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) proposed that β-elimination by β-pol is Mg2+-independent based on inhibition of dRp lyase activity by EDTA and restoration of dRp lyase function by supplementing with NaCl. Our results also showed that Ca2+, instead of Mg2+, quite efficiently excised dRp moieties from the DNA backbone. These data indicate that Mg2+ in not an essential cofactor for the dRp lyase activity of β-pol. The human enzymes counteracting most oxidative base lesions are bifunctional DNA glycosylases such as human 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanine-DNA glycosylase and human endonuclease III (22.Aspinwall R. Rothwell D.G. Roldan-Arjona T. Anselmino C. Ward C.J. Cheadle J.P. Sampson J. Lindahl T. Harris P.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), leaving 3′-AP sites after releasing modified bases. Subsequently, class II AP endonuclease removes the 3′-blocked termini by 3′-phosphoesterase activity to create a 3′-OH group for DNA repair synthesis (3.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Although ROS induce significant numbers of oxidized base adducts, there was no accumulation of the combined fraction of intact and 3′-nicked AP sites in cellular DNA after exposure to H2O2. These data suggest that class II AP endonuclease efficiently excises a large number of 3′-cleaved AP sites. In in vitro repair assays, 8-OH-dG and oxidized pyrimidines were repaired mainly by a short patch base excision repair pathway (6.Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,7.Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23.Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the DNA repair synthesis at 8-OH-dG was less efficient than that at regular AP sites (7.Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that the first three processes from base release to excision of 3′-AP sites may be rate-limiting steps. Our data suggest that 3′-phosphoesterase activity to repair 3′-AP sites is not rate-limiting in base excision repair. Based on these results, the excision of modified bases may be one of the rate-determining processes in the 8-OH-dG base excision repair pathway. Furthermore, in human cultured cells, oxidative stress induced AP endonuclease and rendered cells resistant to oxidative stress (26.Ramana C.V. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These results also raised the possibility that 3′-AP sites generated by bifunctional DNA glycosylases may induce AP endonuclease. In addition to 3′-AP sites, ROS also induced other 3′-phosphate lesions, including 3′-phosphoglycolate. These 3′-blocked termini might be one of the reasons for AP endonuclease induction in cells under oxidative stress conditions. Although the Fenton reaction directly induced a significant number of intact AP sites in the in vitro system, the number of intact AP sites was not increased in cells exposed to H2O2. Both regular AP sites and C-4′-oxidized AP sites without strand breaks directly induced by bleomycin are repaired by an interaction of AP endonuclease and β-polin vitro using oligonucleotides (20.Xu Y.-j. Kim E.Y. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28837-28844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27.Bennett R.A. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Based on these data and our experiments, the regular and oxidized aldehydic AP sites with no cleavage on either side induced by ROS appear to be efficiently repaired in cells through a base excision repair pathway. A high concentration of TEMPO almost completely protected the formation of AP sites, End III-sensitive sites, and 8-OH-dG induced by a high level of oxidative stress. Furthermore, DNA extracted from fresh calf thymus also showed very low amounts of 8-OH-dG (<1 lesion/107 nucleotides). In contrast, the range of steady-state levels of 8-OH-dG measured by HPLC/electrochemical detection has varied from 4 to 800 lesions/107 nucleotides in mammalian cells and tissues (28.Helbock H.L. Beckman K.B. Shigenaga M.K. Walter P.B. Woodall A.A. Yeo H.C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). There are many factors that artifactually induce oxidative DNA lesions during DNA extraction (24.Cadet J. Delatour T. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Pouget J.-P. Ravanat J.-L. Sauvarigo S. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The trapping of free radicals by TEMPO appears to be quite efficient for preventing artifactual DNA damage from oxidative stress. Therefore, the current DNA extraction method using a high concentration of TEMPO minimizes the artifactual induction of oxidative lesions during DNA extraction. In the present experiment, 10 mmH2O2 increased the number of 8-OH-dGs by a factor of >30 over the control. These data indicate that reduction of artifactual oxidative DNA lesions will also allow us to more accurately determine dose-response relationships as well as the repair kinetics of these lesions after oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to understand the biological consequences of 5′-AP sites persisting in cells under normal physiological conditions as well as after oxidative stress. Although H2O2 killed HeLa cells within 24 h at 20 mm, a limited number of cells survived after exposure to 10 mm H2O2 and started growing within 1–2 days (data not shown). These results suggest that 5′-oxidized AP sites are repairable by cellular DNA repair pathways. Recently, Jacksonet al. (25.Jackson A.L. Chen R. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12468-12473Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidative stress, but not UV radiation or methylating agent, induces frameshift mutations in microsatellite DNA. They proposed that a common lesion such as a strand break is more likely to contribute to genomic instability than the alteration of a specific nucleotide. It is possible that 5′-oxidized AP sites might be involved in the frameshift mutation in microsatellite DNA. To date, it has generally been believed that AP sites are repaired very efficiently in genomic DNA; however, the high steady-state level of 5′-nicked AP sites as well as persistent 5′-cleaved AP sites after oxidative stress suggest that some fraction of AP sites may not be efficiently repaired by the mammalian excision repair pathway.

Complex and diverse processes are implicated in angiogenesis, in that a variety of cells and biologically active substances are involved in the construction of new blood vessels. Numerous factors including growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),1 vascular endothelial cell growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, or epidermal growth factor have been shown to regulate neovascularization both positively and negatively. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is one of important regulators of blood pressure and blood flow by modifying the vascular tone. It promotes angiogenesis by stimulating proliferation and migration of the smooth muscle cells in vitro (6.Bell L. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 7-12PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Paquet J.L.

It also enhances neovascularization in in vivo angiogenesis models (10.Hu D.-E. Hiley C.R. Fan T.-P.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Fernandez L.A. Twickler J. Mead A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 105: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Le Noble F.A.C.

However, a pathway for local generation of Ang II has not been clarified in detail. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been characterized to be an unique enzyme to convert Ang I to Ang II under the physiological conditions. Furthermore, the ACE-dependent conversion has been believed to be predominant in the production of Ang II. Recently, an alternative pathway for generating Ang II, i.e. the chymase-dependent angiotensin II-generating system, has been identified (13.Reilly C.F. Tewksbury D.A. Schechter N.M. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8619-8622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease originally found as a mast cell protease (14.Lagunoff D. Benditt E.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1963; 103: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Active chymase is stored in the secretary granules of mast cells and is released upon the degranulation, suggesting that it may be involved in various inflammatory and immunological disorders. However, the specific substrates for chymase and its physiological and pathophysiological roles are not well known. Although Ang I has reported to serve as a favorite substrate for chymase, there is a marked species difference in the Ang II forming activity (15.Okunishi H. Oka Y. Shiota N. Kawamoto T. Song K. Miyazaki M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 62: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16.Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. Toda N. J.

In humans, dogs, monkeys, or hamsters, chymase produces Ang II from Ang I, whereas it cleaves Ang I into inactive fragments in rabbits, rats, or mice. Therefore the former experimental animals, in which endogenous conversion of Ang I to Ang II is anticipated, but not the latter should be used for elucidation of the biological functions of chymase in humans. Taken together these information, we focused on a role of chymase in angiogenesis by using the in vivo hamster model. Thus results from the present study raised the possibility that chymase could play a potent role in angiogenesis via a conversion of Ang I endogenously and a possible suppression of angiogenesis by the inhibitior of chymase. All chemicals were reagent grade. Angiotensin I, angiotensin II, chymostatin, lima bean trypsin inhibitor (LBTI), soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI),N-CBZ-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (ZPCK), and o-phthaldialdehyde were purchased from Sigma. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, Hemoglobin B-test®, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Dipyridyl was purchased from KANTO Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant human bFGF was purchased from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). TCV-116, an Ang II receptor antagonist, was a kind gift from Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Anti-hamster chymase antibody was raised against rabbit by immunizing IIGGTECKPHSRPYMAYLEIV, a fragment of hamster chymase (Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan). LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. pCXN2, an expression plasmid, was kindly provided by Dr. Junichi Miyazaki (University of Tokushima). Sephadex G-100 and Hitrap heparin column were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Messenger RNA capture kit was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ang II concentration was determined by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA). Circular sponge discs (5-mm-thick, 1.3 cm in diameter, and weighing 14.2 ± 0.1 mg) were prepared from a sheet of polyurethane foam using a wad pouch. The discs were soaked in 70% ethanol overnight and then sterilized with an autoclave. These sponge discs were implanted under aseptic conditions in the subcutaneous air pouch in the dorsum of each male Syrian hamster (6 weeks old) purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan), under light anesthesia with ether. At the end of the experimental period, the animal was sacrificed, and the granuloma tissues were excised immediately, together with the enclosed sponge implants. The obtained tissues were divided into two halves, one for measuring the hemoglobin contents and the other for measuring chymase activity. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (7 weeks old) purchased from SLC were also used in the same manner. We have previously shown that the hemoglobin contents in the sponge implants and the surrounding granuloma tissue correlated with the degree of angiogenesis (20.Majima M. Isono M. Ikeda Y. Hayashi I. Hatanaka K. Harada Y. Katsumata O. Yamashina S. Katori M. Yamamoto S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the hemoglobin contents of the implant samples according to the method of Majima et al. (20.Majima M. Isono M. Ikeda Y. Hayashi I. Hatanaka K. Harada Y. Katsumata O. Yamashina S. Katori M. Yamamoto S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as a parameter for angiogenesis. Briefly, the sample granuloma tissues were weighed and homogenized with a Polytrone homogenizer (Kinematica Inc., Cincinnati, OH) in distilled water (4 ml/g of wet weight). The hemoglobin concentration in the supernatant after centrifugation at 5,000 × g was determined by a hemoglobin assay kit (Hemoglobin B-test, Wako). Hamster chymase was purified from cheek pouches as described by Takai et al. (19.Takai S. Shiota N. Yamamoto D. Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, hamster cheek pouches were minced and homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended and extracted for 24 h at 4 °C in five volumes (w/v) of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 2 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (2.6 × 100 cm), which was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 2 m KCl. Active fractions with Ang II forming activity were collected and concentrated and then applied to a heparin affinity column with 5 ml of the gel volume (Hitrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0–100%) of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.8m KCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions containing chymase activity were collected and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.7 m NaCl. The dialysate was stored at −80 °C. Just prior to the experiments, the chymase fraction was diluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to reduce sodium concentration to the physiological range. The purified protein showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a silver staining The cDNA for human pro-chymase was cloned from premade cDNA library prepared from human adult normal heart (Invitrogen, CA) using PCR as described by Urata et al. (21.Urata H. Kinoshita A. Perez D.M. Misono K.S. Bumpus F.M. Graham R.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17173-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The entire PCR product was subcloned into pBS II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cloned cDNA was sequenced and confirmed to contain a single ATG codon at the 5′ end followed by an entire open reading frame by 741 base pairs encoding 247 amino acids. The cDNA fragment was excised from EcoRI site of the pBS II KS and ligated into EcoRI site of pCXN2 to construct the expression plasmid. Plasmid DNA was purified by using a Qiagen Plasmid Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) after transformation in Escherichia coli (DH5α). In vivotransfection of cDNA was carried out using lipofection method. Briefly, 80 μg of the human pro-chymase expression plasmid (pHCM) was mixed with 80 μl of LipofectAMINE and the mixture was left for 40 min at room temperature to form liposome complex. The liposome-cDNA mixture was injected into the subcutaneous tissue near the sponges implanted into the back of hamsters. Gene transfection was performed twice at days 1 and 5 of the experiment, and assessment of angiogenesis was performed on the 7th day after implantation. pCXN2vector alone was used for mock transfection in the same manner. Poly(A)+RNA was isolated from the sponge granulomas by using mRNA Capture Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). First-stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription reaction using Titan one-tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As PCR primers, 5′-aacttccaacgtccctc-3′ (sense) and 5′-gattgtggtcaaagtctc-3′ (antisense) for human prochymase cDNA, 5′-gggttcctcataacgccag-3′ (sense) and 5′-aattgcttgcctttatgactatattaattc-3′ (antisense) for hamster chymase cDNA, or 5′-ccaaggccaaccgcgagaagatgac-3′ (sense) and 5′-agggtacatggtggtgccgccagac-3′ (antisense) for hamster β-actin cDNA were used for the amplifications. The reaction was allowed to process for 20 cycles. Each cycle consists of 30 s at 94 °C for denature, 30 s at 55 °C for annealing, and 60 s 72 °C for extension, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were separated on 2% agarose gel. Human prochymase, hamster chymase, and hamster β-actin cDNAs were detected as products of 411, 589, and 580 base pairs, respectively. To measure chymase activity, each sample was homogenized with a Polytrone homogenizer in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After the extraction for 1 h with shaking followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 1 h, chymase activity in the supernatant was determined according to the method of Okunishi et al. (17.Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. Okamura T. Toda N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 1186-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the tissue extract were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 770 μm of Ang I in 48.5 mmborax-borate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 8 mm dipyridyl, 760 μm diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, and 5 mmEDTA as inhibitors of ACE and angiotensinases. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 15% cold trichloroacetic acid (which gives 9% of the final concentration), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The concentration of His-Leu, an enzymatic cleavage product, in the supernatant was determined from fluorescent intensity as follows. 10% of o-phthaldialdehyde was added to the supernatant in an alkaline condition (pH 12.0) followed by the addition of 6 n HCl (brought to pH 3) to stabilize. The fluorescence in the solution was measured at 340 nm of excitation and at 455 nm of emission. At day 7, a polyethylene cannula was inserted into a carotid artery of each hamster, and the hamsters were perfused with saline to remove blood in the granuloma tissues under anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (25 mg/kg intraperitoneal). The sponge granulomas were rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately after the excision. The frozen samples were minced into small pieces, followed by an overnight incubation in ice-cold ethanol to extract Ang II. After the incubation, samples were centrifugated, and the supernatant was evaporated to remove ethanol. The extracts were then treated with diethylether for 1 h with shaking, and the supernatant was evaporated. Finally, the pellets were dissolved with PBS, and the concentrations of Ang II were determined by using a high sensitivity enzyme immunoassay. For histological studies, the excised sample sponges were fixed in 10% (w/v) formalin solution at 4 °C and were embedded in paraffin wax. Thin sections (5 μm) were prepared and stained with the method of van Gieson (22.Pearse A.G.E. Histochemistry. 2. Churchill Livingston, London1985Google Scholar) or acidified toluidine blue. For immunohistochemistry, sample sponges were frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately after the excision. After treatment with ethanol and subsequent blocking, sections were incubated with rabbit anti-hamster chymase IgG. They were then washed three times with PBS, incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and colored by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. All drugs, with the exception of TCV-116, were administered daily into the sponges for 7 days. TCV-116 was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and was administered orally once a day. Chymostatin was solubilized with dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted with PBS (the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.05%). All data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the Student's t test. Ap value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Whether chymase exert to induce angiogenesis in vivo was examined by using the hamster sponge implant model. Angiogenesis was evaluated as contents of hemoglobin in the sponge granulomas. Direct administration of 14 μg/site/day of hamster chymase, which was purified from the cheek pouches, into the sponge implant elicited the angiogenesis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a significant increase of hemoglobin contents was observed in the sponges of chymase-injected group from day 2 to day 7 of the experiments, when compared with vehicle-injected controls. The increment in hemoglobin contents was accelerated from day 5 to day 7. To ascertain that this chymase-induced angiogenesis was mediated by generation of Ang II, the effect of angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, TCV-116, was tested. Oral administration of TCV-116 (5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days significantly inhibited the hemoglobin contents by approximately 50% (Fig.1 B). To confirm that chymase is angiogenic, the transiently expression plasmid for human pro-chymase cDNA was transfected twice into the sponges at days 1 and 5 by lipofection method. A significant level of angiogenesis was induced in the sponges at day 7 (Fig.2 A), which were transfected with the expression plasmid for pro-chymase cDNA, as compared with the sponges transfected with pCXN2 vector plasmid alone (Fig. 2 B). Apparent expression of human chymase mRNA in sponge granulomas transfected with pHCM was observed by RT-PCR. Primers used for PCR were specific for human chymase cDNA, not for hamsters (Fig. 2 C). No product was amplified in the sponges transfected with pCXN2 vector alone. The hemoglobin contents in the sponge granulomas were significantly higher in pHCM-transfected hamsters than those in hamsters transfected with pCXN2 or in vehicle-injected controls (Fig. 2 C). Progressive neovascularization was also assessed by microscopic histological evaluation. In the sponge granulomas expressing human chymase cDNA, the density of newly formed microvessels was much higher than in those transfected with pCXN2 (data not shown). To clarify the involvement of endogenous chymase in angiogenesis, bFGF, which is one of potent angiogenic factors, was used to induce angiogenesis in the sponge implants model. As shown in Fig.3 A, daily administrations of 0.3 μg/site of bFGF caused a marked increase in hemoglobin contents from day 2. The hemoglobin content at day 11 increased to 7.4 ± 0.90 mg/g of tissue. In control hamsters treated with saline, an increment of hemoglobin contents was slowly and gradually occurred. The stimulatory effect of bFGF on the angiogenesis was dose-dependent (Fig. 3 B). Expression of chymase mRNA was detectable in the sponge granuloma stimulated with bFGF but not that stimulated with saline (Fig.4). Functionally active chymase in sponge granuloma tissues when stimulated with bFGF (0.3 μg/site/day) was measured, and a correlation of the activity with the development of angiogenesis was examined. Chymase activity was estimated as measurable angiotensin converting activity, which is chymostatin-sensitive and captopril-insensitive, in the sponge granuloma tissue. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.001, by Fisher's Z-transformation) between chymase activities and hemoglobin contents in the granuloma tissues (Fig. 3 C). Whether intrinsic Ang II was produced in the sponge granulomas was examined. Extracts from granuloma tissues were subjected to enzyme immunoassay for Ang II. A tremendous increment of Ang II was measured in the granuloma stimulated with bFGF (Fig.5). This increase was significantly inhibited by the treatment with a chymase inhibitor, chymostatin. To investigate the involvement of chymase in bFGF-induced angiogenesis in hamsters, several chymase inhibitors were used. Chymostatin inhibited the bFGF-induced angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner when it was applied 1 h prior to the injection of bFGF into the sponges (Fig. 6). A significant inhibition was observed at a dose exceeding 1 nmol/site/day. The maximum inhibition was 69% at 10 nmol/site/day. The inhibitory effect of chymostatin at doses more than 10 nmol/site could not be examined because of insolubility of the compound. Administrations of other chymase inhibitors, LBTI, SBTI, and ZPCK (19.Takai S. Shiota N. Yamamoto D. Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23.Johnson L.A. Moon K.E. Eisenberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), also resulted in a significant reduction of hemoglobin contents in the sponge implants (Fig. 6 A). Administration of chymostatin alone without bFGF did not show any inhibitory or stimulatory effect (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that Ang II is produced in hamsters from Ang I by the alternative chymase-dependent pathway as well as the conventional ACE-dependent pathway, which is quite similar in humans (19.Takai S. Shiota N. Yamamoto D. Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we then investigated the contribution of endogenous Ang II in bFGF-induced angiogenesis using hamsters. Oral administration of TCV-116 suppressed the angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). The maximum inhibition (67%) occurred at 5 mg/kg/day, although further inhibition was not obtained even at higher doses. On the other hand, captopril, an inhibitor of ACE, also showed the suppression (Fig. 6 A). The inhibitory effect of captopril was less than that of chymostatin. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the combined use of chymostatin and TCV-116 at 10 nmol/site/day and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively (representing the dose at which each agent induced maximum inhibition when used alone), resulted in much more potent inhibition of the bFGF-induced angiogenesis. In rat, whereas captopril exhibited a significant inhibition, chymostatin did not (Fig. 6 C). To identify the presence and the localization of chymase in the implanted sponge granulomas of hamsters, immunohistochemical studies were carried out. As shown in Fig.7 A, the granuloma tissue, which consisted mainly of the fibrous matrix and numerous fibroblast-like cells, encapsulated the sponge implant, and the pores of the sponge were also infiltrated with the fibrous stroma. Macrophage-like cells were also observed in granulomas and within the stroma. Newly formed microvessels (indicated by arrows in Fig. 7 A) were often seen in the granulomas, especially at the periphery. Sections stained with toluidine blue showed the presence of mast cells mainly around newly formed microvessels (Fig.7 B). Almost all mast cells in the sections were positively stained with anti-hamster chymase antibody (Fig. 7 C). Ang II is known to stimulate the proliferation of various cells including vascular smooth muscle cells and myocytes in vitro (6.Bell L. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 7-12PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Paquet J.L. Baudouin-Legros M. Brunelle G. Meyer P. J. Hypertens. 1990; 8: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8.Lyall F. Morton J.J.

Recent studies have shown that exogenously administered Ang II also stimulates angiogenesis in vivo (10.Hu D.-E. Hiley C.R. Fan T.-P.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Fernandez L.A. Twickler J. Mead A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 105: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Le Noble F.A.C.

In the following experiments, to evaluate the angiogenic activity of Ang I, which is a biologically inactive precursor of Ang II, the direct effect of Ang I on the induction of angiogenesis was compared with that of Ang II in our model. Daily administrations of Ang II for 7 days increased the hemoglobin contents in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.8 A). The maximum response (7.9 ± 0.79 mg/g of wet tissue) was obtained at a dose of 2 μg/site/day, although the hemoglobin content slightly decreased at higher doses (5.8 ± 0.78 mg/g of wet tissue at 5 μg/site/day). Administration of Ang I into the sponges also could induce the angiogenesis. The dose dependence of the response was almost similar to that of Ang II. Furthermore the extent of the maximum response by Ang I (6.9 ± 1.1 mg/g of wet tissue), obtained at 2 μg/site/day, was almost the same as that observed in Ang II-induced angiogenesis (Fig.8 A). The time course of hemoglobin increment when stimulated with Ang I was quite similar to that when stimulated with Ang II. This considerable angiogenic activity of Ang I was significantly reduced by the treatment with chymase inhibitors, chymostatin, SBTI, LBTI, or ZPCK (Fig. 9). The maximal inhibition was more than 60% by daily injections of chymostatin at a dose of 1 nmol/day. Those inhibitors showed no effects on the angiogenesis induced by Ang II (data not shown). Although the treatment with captopril also showed the reduction of the angiogenesis induced by Ang I, the inhibition was only less than 50% at a dose of 100 nmol/day.Figure 9Inhibitions of Ang I-induced angiogenesis in hamsters. A, angiogenesis was evoked by the daily injections of Ang I (2 μg/site/day) for 7 days, and the effects of various inhibitors on the angiogenesis were evaluated. All inhibitors were solubilized with PBS (for captopril, SBTI, and LBTI) or PBS containing 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (for chymostatin and ZPCK) at various concentrations and were directly injected into the sponges 1 h prior to the injections of Ang I. The hemoglobin contents in the sponge granulomas in the vehicle-treated hamsters were defined as 100%, and the decrease in the hemoglobin contents in the inhibitor-treated hamsters was expressed as the percentage of inhibition. Data are the means ± S.E. of 8–10 experiments.B, effects of chymostatin (CS) on Ang I- or Ang II-induced angiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2092806373,"We have identified a mouse PDZ protein that interacts with the activin type IIA receptor (ActRIIA), which we named activin receptor-interacting protein 1 (ARIP1). By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated a cDNA clone of ARIP1 from a mouse brain cDNA library. We detected two forms of ARIP1, ARIP1-long and ARIP1-short, which may be produced by alternative splicing. ARIP1-long had one guanylate kinase domain in the NH2-terminal region, followed by two WW domains and five PDZ domains (PDZ1–5). ARIP1-short had a deletion in the NH2-terminal region and lacked the guanylate kinase domain. Both forms interacted with ActRIIA through PDZ5. The COOH-terminal residues of ActRIIA (ESSL) agree with a PDZ-binding consensus motif, and ARIP1 recognized the consensus sequence. ARIP1 interacts specifically with ActRIIA among the receptors for the transforming growth factor β family. Interestingly, ARIP1 also interacted with Smad3, which is an activin/transforming growth factor β intracellular signaling molecule. The mRNA of ARIP1 was more abundant in the brain than in other tissues. Overexpression of ARIP1 controls activin-induced and Smad3-induced transcription in activin-responsive cell lines. These findings suggest that ARIP1 has a significant role in assembling activin signaling molecules at specific subcellular sites and in regulating signal transduction in neuronal cells.

These findings suggest that ARIP1 has a significant role in assembling activin signaling molecules at specific subcellular sites and in regulating signal transduction in neuronal cells. transforming growth factor-β activin type IIA receptor activin receptor-interacting protein 1 Chinese hamster ovary cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase guanylate kinase N-methyl-d-aspartate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction Activin is a multifunctional growth and differentiation factor that belongs to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily. Activin has numerous biological activities: regulation of secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from pituitary cells (1.Vale W. Rivier J. Vaughan J. McClintock R. Corrigan A. Woo W. Karr D.

Ueno N. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 198: 330-335Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Activin has also been reported to act on neural cells. Activin is a survival factor for neural cells derived from rat brain (5.Schubert D. Kimura H. LaCorbiere M. Vaughan J. Karr D. Fischer W.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 868-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), regulates neuronal development in the avian iris and ciliary body (6.Link B.A. Nishi R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and regulates expression of neuropeptides by cultured sympathetic neurons (7.Fann M.J. Patterson P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Activin signals through two types of membrane-bound receptor complexes on the target cells (8.Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9.Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L.I. Mathews L.S. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Two types of activin receptor have been identified, type I and type II, both of which belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors. Interaction between the type I and type II receptors is necessary for activin-induced signal transduction. Activin binds directly to the type II receptor, which then recruits the type I receptor to the complex and phosphorylates it, resulting in the activation of the type I receptor and in the downstream propagation of the signal (11.Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). There are two subtypes of the type II activin receptor, types IIA (ActRIIA) and IIB (ActRIIB), which are encoded by individual genes. In addition, two splice variants of ActRIIA including ActRIIA-N (12.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 13.Shoji H. Nakamura T. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Sugino H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and five splice variants of ActRIIB have been reported (14.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 15.Ethier J.F. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ActRIIA-N is expressed specifically in neural tissues (13.Shoji H. Nakamura T. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Sugino H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although our understanding of activin/TGF-β signaling pathways has progressed during past few years (16.Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3983) Google Scholar), the significance of the various type II activin receptors is not known. Recent investigations have suggested that signal transduction via transmembrane receptors is regulated by PDZ domain-containing molecules that interact with the receptors. Many PDZ domain-containing proteins have a role in assembling receptors and signaling molecules in the cell membrane and in submembranous regions. To determine the specific functions of the activin type IIA receptors in activin signal transduction, we searched for cytoplasmic proteins that interact with these receptors. We identified a novel cytoplasmic protein, which we named activin receptor-interacting protein 1 (ARIP1), that is abundant in the brain. ARIP1 had multiple protein-protein interaction domains, including two WW domains and five PDZ domains, and it interacted with Smad3 as well as with ActRIIA and ActRIIA-N. Thus, ARIP1 is a scaffolding protein that unites activin receptors with an intracellular signaling molecule (Smad) and thereby regulates activin-mediated signaling in neuronal cells. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using a commercially available system (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2;CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 4 × 106 clones of a mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) were screened using a bait construct, pAS-ActRIIA-N, that contained the nucleotide sequences for the entire cytoplasmic region of mouse ActRIIA-N fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain. To obtain a full-length clone for ARIP1, a mouse brain cDNA library in the λZAPII vector (STRATAGENE) was screened using the insert of #YN3 as the probe. One clone encoding the full-length of the ARIP1-short sequence was identified. A cDNA encoding ARIP1-long was obtained by joining the ARIP1-short cDNA and the PCR-derived NH2-terminal sequence. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a sense primer synthesized according to the rat S-SCAM sequence (nucleotides 30–49, 5′-agagaaaggcaaagtctgcc-3′; Ref. 20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and an antisense primer based on the mouse ARIP1-short sequence (nucleotides 1117–1140, 5′-gtagctcccggaagtatctggtct-3′). The amplified products were cloned into pUC19, sequenced, and ligated to the ARIP1-short cDNA. DNA constructs for yeast two-hybrid screening were made using the plasmid pAS2–1 to express the fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and the plasmid pACT2 was used to express the fusion protein with the GAL4 activation domain. pAS-ActRIIA and pAS-ActRIIA-N were made by introducing nucleotides 554–1995 of mouse ActRIIA (12.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) or nucleotides 554–2019 of ActRIIA-N (13.Shoji H. Nakamura T. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Sugino H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) into pAS2–1. An insert fragment of pACT2-ARIP1-long was made by ligating a PCR-amplified fragment that contained the translational start methionine codon to a KpnI/EcoRV fragment (nucleotides 1071–4446) of the ARIP1-short cDNA. pACT2-ARIP1-short was made by introducing nucleotides 1187–4446 of pBS-ARIP1-short into pACT2. A series of deletion mutants was made by combining PCR-generated fragments and fragments prepared from pBS-ARIP1-short. pAS-ΔGuk-PDZ2 contained nucleotides 2830–4446, pAS-ΔGuk-PDZ4 contained nucleotides 3826–4446, pAS-ΔPDZ5 contained nucleotides 923–3825, pAS-ΔPDZ3–5 contained nucleotides 923–2814, and pAS-ΔPDZ1–5 contained nucleotides 923–1725. DNA constructs for the mammalian two-hybrid assay were made as follows using the plasmid pBIND to express the fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and using pACT to express the fusion protein with the VP16 activation domain. To make pBIND-ActRIIA and pBIND-ActRIIA-N, cDNA fragments encoding the entire cytoplasmic regions of pAS-ActRIIA and pAS-ActRIIA-N were subcloned into pBIND. Mutations in the COOH terminus of ActRIIA were generated by replacing the appropriate nucleotides with mutated oligonucleotides by PCR-based mutagenesis. To make other receptor constructs, the following sequences, which contain the entire cytoplasmic region of each receptor, were amplified by PCR and cloned into theBamHI/SalI site of pBIND: mouse ActRIIB, nucleotides 524–1654 (14.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar); human TGF-β type II receptor, nucleotides 568–1698 (21.Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar); and human bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor, nucleotides 679–1755 (22.Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To make pACT-ARIP1, a cDNA fragment composed of nucleotides 923–4446 of ARIP1, which was prepared by ligating a PCR-generated fragment to a fragment prepared from pBS-ARIP1-short, was subcloned into pACT. ARIP1-short was used throughout the experiment, whereas ARIP1-long was only used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 A. pACT-ARIP1 (WW), which lacked all of the PDZ domains, contained nucleotides 923–1758 of ARIP1. To make pBIND-Smad3, human Smad3 coding sequences were ligated to pBind. An expression construct of ARIP1 for transcriptional assay was made by subcloning nucleotides 923–4446 of ARIP1 into pcDNA1. FLAG-tagged Smad3 and Smad6 in pcDNA3 were generous gifts from Dr. K. Miyazono. Smad7 in pcDNA3 was obtained from Dr. P. ten Dijke. The 5′ junctional region between the insert and the vector of each construct was sequenced to ensure that the inserts were introduced properly. Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using a commercially available kit (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2; CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed using CheckMate Mammalian Two-Hybrid System (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, CHO cells were cotransfected with the plasmids of interest, a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-gal (CMV-β-gal) and a reporter plasmid, pG5luc, which drives the luciferase gene under the control of GAL4-responsive promoter (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity as described previously (8.Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The interaction of full-length ARIP1 and ActRIIA and that of full-length ARIP1 and Smad3 in mammalian cells were studied. COS7 cells were cotransfected with either pcDLSRα-ActRIIA (17.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CMV-FLAG-ARIP1, or with CMV-6Myc-ARIP1 and CMV-FLAG-Smad3, by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Two days after transfection, the cells were incubated in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was centrifuged, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated by adding anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2; Sigma) or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; Oncogene), and then the samples were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Then the membranes were incubated with an anti-ActRIIA or an anti-FLAG antibody (diluted 1:1000), followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. Labeled proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cotransfected COS-7 cells were affinity-labeled with 125I-activin A, 2 days after transfection. Radiolabeling of the ligand, affinity cross-linking, and preparation of cell lysates were performed as described previously (19.Hashimoto O. Nakamura T. Shoji H. Shimasaki S. Hayashi Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13835-13842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) or an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2; Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then the samples were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were washed three times with a lysis buffer. Then precipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared from various tissues of Balb/c strain mice. RNA (1 μg) from each sample was fractionated and blotted onto a nylon membrane. A mixture of three cDNA fragments of pBS-ARIP1-short (nucleotides 1–1391, 1772–3202, and 3356–4440) labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR was used as probes. Hybridization, washing, and detection were performed as described previously (23.Nishi N. Oya H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Miyanaka H. Wada F. Prostate. 1996; 28: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The p3TP-lux construct has been described previously (8.Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). p3TP-lux, CMV-β-gal, and either pcDNA1-ARIP1 or CMV-FLAG-Smad3 were introduced into human K562 cells by eletroporation. Mouse hippocampus-derived HT22 cells (obtained from Dr. D. Shubert, The Salk Institute) were transfected with p3TP-lux, CMV-β-gal, and combinations of CMV-FLAG-Smad3 and/or pcDNA1-ARIP1 by using TransFast liposome reagents (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stimulation by activin and measurement of luciferase activity were performed as described previously (8.Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For anti-ARIP1 antibodies, GST fusion proteins of N-terminal ARIP1 (nucleotides 923–1758) were purified and used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits. ARIP1-specific antisera were purified by passing through protein A-Sepharose and were used for immunohistochemistry. Rat hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 embryonic rats as described (24.Banker G.A. Cowan W.M. Brain Res. 1977; 126: 397-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation in ice-cold 100% methanol for 5 min. Cells were visualized by immunostaining using rabbit anti-ARIP1 antibody (1:200 dilution), or rabbit anti-ActRIIA antibody (1:200 dilution), or goat anti-Smad2/3 antibody (1:100 dilution, clone E-20 purchased from Santa Cruz). All cells were costained with mouse anti-synaptotagmin I monoclonal antibody (1;400 dilution, mAb1D/2 kindly provided by Dr. M. Takahashi at the Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Scieices) (25.Ono S. Baux G. Sekiguchi M. Fossier P. Morel N.F. Nihonmatsu I. Hirata K. Awaji T. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Then, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:400 dilution (Alexa 488 for staining ARIP1, ActRIIA, and Smad2/3 and Alexa 594 for staining synaptotagmin I). Fluorescent images of cells were captured by using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS-NT). In order to investigate intracellular proteins interacting with activin type IIA and/or IIA-N receptors (ActRIIAs), we used yeast two-hybrid system. By screening a library of mouse brain cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain using ActRIIA-N fused with GAL4 DNA-binding domain as a bait, we obtained about 60 positive clones, which we classified into five groups based on restriction fragment analysis. Clones with the longest inserts were selected from each group and were tested for interaction with ActRIIAs in mammalian cells. ActRIIA and candidate clones with the NH2-terminal Myc-epitope in an SRα expression vector were cotransfected in COS-7 cells and the proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. Only one clone (#YN3) was co-precipitated by ActRIIAs (data not shown). #YN3 contained a 1140-bp insert and encoded one PDZ domain (Fig.1 B). By screening another mouse brain cDNA library using the insert of #YN3 as the hybridization probe, we obtained a full-length cDNA clone of ARIP1-short (pBS-ARIP1-short, Fig. 1 A). The ARIP1-short cDNA encoded a protein of 1112 amino acids, which has two WW domains in the NH2-terminal region, followed by five PDZ domains. #YN3 encoded 228 amino acids, including the entire PDZ5 domain; however, the sequence of #YN3 did not match that of ARIP1 exactly in the COOH-terminal region. The NH2-terminal 213 amino acids of #YN3 were identical to amino acid residues 853–1065 of ARIP1-short, but #YN3 had 15 additional amino acids (AFHSFLHLCSAFSVF) that were not in the ARIP1-short sequence. During the course of this study, Hirao et al. (20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) reported the amino acid sequence of a rat homologue of ARIP1, which they named S-SCAM (synaptic scaffolding molecule). S-SCAM is 98.7% identical to the sequence of ARIP1-short when the NH2-terminal region is excluded from the analysis; S-SCAM has an additional 163 NH2-terminal amino acids compared with ARIP1-short. The additional 163 amino acids includes a guanylate kinase domain (Guk). We also detected a long form of ARIP1 in mouse brain by reverse transcription-PCR using a primer synthesized according to the rat S-SCAM sequence, which had the same NH2-terminal sequence as S-SCAM. However, all of the clones we obtained by screening two independent libraries, including two clones from a mouse brain library and 12 clones from a rat brain library, encoded ARIP1-short (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the short form is more abundant than the long form in mammalian brains. There is an in-frame stop codon 78 base pairs upstream from the boundary site between the long and short form sequences, and those 78 base pairs do not include a start codon. Therefore, we think that translation starts from the first methionine (Fig. 1 A), because this is the first methionine after the stop codon and transcription would then be of the longest reading frame. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the methionine at amino acid position 60 is the translation start site because the nucleotide sequence near Met-60 agrees well with Kozak's consensus sequences (26.Kozak M Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). ARIP1 interacted with both ActRIIA and ActRIIA-N (Fig. 2, A–C). Deletion from the NH2 terminus to PDZ4 of ARIP1 did not affect its interaction with ActRIIAs (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, the construct encoding only PDZ5 was able to interact with ARIP1, and deletion of PDZ5 from ARIP1 resulted in the complete loss of interaction with ActRIIA or ActRIIA-N. These results indicate that ARIP1 interacts with ActRIIA and ActRIIA-N through PDZ5. Previously characterized PDZ domains recognize a class I consensus PDZ-binding motif, XSX(V/I/L) (where X is any amino acid), at the COOH terminus of the target proteins (27.Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The four COOH-terminal amino acids of ActRIIAs are ESSL, which agrees with the consensus PDZ-binding sequence. In the present study, ARIP1 did not interact with mutated ActRIIA proteins that lacked either the COOH-terminal SSL or the COOH-terminal leucine (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the COOH-terminal amino acids of the receptors play a central role in the interaction of ARIP1 with ActRIIAs through PDZ5. ARIP1 did not interact significantly with ActRIIB, bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor, or the TGF-β type II receptor in the mammalian two-hybrid system (Fig. 2 C). In addition, ARIP1 did not interact with ActRIA and ActRIB in the yeast system (data not shown). These results indicate that ARIP1 interacts specifically with ActRIIA and ActRIIA-N among the serine/threonine kinase receptors for the TGF-β family and that this interaction can occur in both yeast cells and mammalian cells. When lysates of ActRIIA and FLAG-tagged ARIP1 cotransfected COS7 cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody, the immunoprecipitated protein was detected by an anti-ActRIIA antibody, which confirmed that ActRIIA and ARIP1 formed a protein complex in the transfected cells (Fig. 2 D). Because many PDZ domain-containing proteins have a role in assembling receptors and signaling molecules in the cell membrane and in the submembranous region, we next investigated the interaction of ARIP1 with an intracellular signaling molecule Smad in mammalian cells. Smads are classified into 3 groups, signal-specific Smads (Smad2 and Smad3 for activin and TGF-β and Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 for bone morphogenetic proteins), common-mediator Smad (Smad4), and inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and Smad7). Among them, Smad3 is shown to transiently associate with activin type IB and TGF-β type I receptor and to be phosphorylated by the type I receptors to propagate downstream signaling (29.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). We observed a specific interaction between Smad3 and ARIP1 in CHO cells transfected with a full-length Smad3 cDNA fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and ARIP1 fused to the VP16 activation domain in the mammalian two-hybrid system (Fig.3 A). Because Smad3 does not contain a consensus PDZ-binding sequence in its COOH-terminal region, it is likely that Smad3 associates with ARIP1 through a region other than PDZ domains. As expected, Smad3 interacted with an ARIP1 mutant that lacked all five PDZ domains but retained the WW domains (Fig.3 A). The direct interaction of the FLAG-Smad3 and Myc-ARIP1 in transfected COS-7 cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody, followed by blotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3 B). Smad2 also interacted with ARIP1 but not as strongly as did Smad3 (data not shown). To detect the association of ARIP1 and Smad3 in the activin receptor complex in the presence of ligand, affinity labeling with125I-activin A was performed. When COS-7 cells cotransfected with ActRIIA, ActRIB(K234R) (8.Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), 6Myc-ARIP1, and FLAG-Smad3 were incubated in the presence of 125I-activin A, the 125I-labeled receptor complex could be precipitated by either of the anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig.3 C). Therefore, ARIP1 is capable of forming a complex with ActRIIA, ActRIB, and Smad3 in the presence of ligand. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from several mouse tissues showed ARIP1 mRNA of approximately 7.5 and 6.5 kilobases. Both bands were distinct in the brain and faint in the heart and testis (Fig. 4). Thus, ARIP1 mRNA is more abundant in neuronal tissues than in other tissues. The two mRNA species seen in the Northern blot probably reflect differences in the 3′-noncoding regions, because two groups of cDNAs isolated by cloning had 3′-noncoding regions of different lengths. Human K562 erythroleukemia cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which are regulated by activin, were transfected with pcDNA1-ARIP1 together with a reporter plasmid p3TP-lux, and activin-induced luciferase activity was measured. Overexpression of ARIP1 by transfected K562 cells decreased the activin-induced transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). However, Smad7, which is a potent negative regulator of intracellular signal transduction by activin and TGF-β, inhibited the activin-induced transcriptional induction more potently than did ARIP1. Inhibition by ARIP1 was comparable with that of Smad6, which is also an inhibitory Smad for TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins. Because ARIP1 is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues and has been suggested to have a role in synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and other brain regions (20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), we have investigated the effects of ARIP1 in activin signaling in hippocampus-derived cell line, HT22, which expresses ARIP1 endogenously (30.Sagara Y. Schubert D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Activin induced a 3TP-lux transcriptional response in HT22 cells (Fig. 5 B). Although overexpression of ARIP1 barely affected the response to activin, it did significantly suppress Smad3-induced augmentation of the transcriptional response to activin (Fig. 5 B). Because ARIP1 is capable of binding Smad3 (Fig. 3), it seems likely that ARIP1 bound Smad3 in the HT22 cells and thus prevented Smad3 to exert transcriptional response in the nucleus. In order to investigate the cellular localization of ARIP1 protein, rabbit polyclonal antisera were prepared and were used for immunohistochemistry in cultured rat hippocampal primary neurons. As shown in Fig. 6, A–C,double-immunostaining of hippocampal cells by ARIP1 and synaptotagmin I antibodies showed that ARIP1 immunoreactivity is present primarily in neurons, especially in synaptic areas. Costained images were also obtained when cells were double-immunostained either by ActRIIA and synaptotagmin I antibodies (Fig. 6, D–F) or by Smad 2/3 and synaptotagmin I antibodies (Fig. 6, G–I), suggesting that ARIP1 colocalizes with ActRIIA and Smad3 in hippocampal neurons. We have isolated and characterized a mouse PDZ protein, which we named ARIP1, that interacts with ActRIIA and ActRIIA-N. This is the first report of a molecule that associates with type II activin receptors, although a WD-domain-containing protein (TRIP1) that interacted with the TGF-β type II receptor has been reported (31.Chen R.H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We detected two forms of ARIP1, ARIP1-long and ARIP1-short, which differed in their NH2-terminal sequences. Each form interacted with both ActRIIA and ActRIIA-N. Recently, the rat and human homologues of the mouse ARIP1 gene have been found. The rat protein, called S-SCAM, is a scaffolding synaptic molecule that interacts withN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The human homologue, called AIP1, associates with atrophin, which is responsible for the pathogenesis of CAG triplet disease, called dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (32.Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). cDNAs for S-SCAM and AIP1 encode proteins that correspond to ARIP1-long. In the present study, ARIP1-long was detected only by reverse transcription-PCR and all of the cDNA clones obtained by library screening, which covered the entire protein-coding region, encoded ARIP1-short. Therefore, ARIP1-short seems to be the major mRNA species in mammalian brain. The isoforms of ARIP1 are probably produced by alternative splicing, because their nucleotide sequences are dissimilar from the junction site to the 5′ end. The inconsistency observed in 3′ region of #YN3 and ARIP1-short appears to have been produced by alternative splicing as well, because their cDNA sequences are dissimilar from the junction site to the 3′ end. A mouse protein called MAGI-1 has a domain organization similar to that of ARIP1 (33.Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which suggests that the genes encoding these two proteins belong to the same gene family. Our analysis of the interactions between mutant ARIP1 proteins and ActRIIA showed that ARIP1 interacts with the COOH terminus of ActRIIAs mainly via the PDZ5 domain. The three COOH-terminal amino acids of ActRIIAs, which are consistent with the consensus PDZ-binding motif, were critical for this interaction (Fig. 2 B). The PDZ5 domain of ARIP1 seemed to prefer leucine to isoleucine in the COOH terminus of the target protein; we did not detect significant interaction between ARIP1 and ActRIIB, which has the COOH-terminal sequence ESSI. On the other hand, S-SCAM was originally cloned by its activity to bind to a postsynaptic protein, SAPAP (SAP90/postsynaptic density-95-associated proteins), through a Guk domain. In addition, S-SCAM interacts with the COOH termini of the 2A and 2C subunits of NMDA receptors (NR2A and NR2C) through PDZ5 (20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal sequences of NR2A and NR2C are ESDV and ESEV, respectively, which are consistent with the consensus PDZ-binding motif. Whether ActRIIA and the NMDA receptors associate with ARIP1 cooperatively or compete with each other remains to be determined. Interestingly, ARIP1 associated with Smad proteins. The WW domains of ARIP1 interacted with Smad3 specifically (Fig. 3 A). WW domains prefer to bind to a proline-rich sequence, called the PY motif (PPXY) (34.Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and Smad proteins have a PY motif in the linker region (29.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar), so it makes sense that ARIP1 and Smad3 interacted. Smad3 associates transiently with and is phosphorylated by activated ActRIB and by the TGF-β type I receptor, which triggers intracellular signaling. Because different domains of ARIP1 are responsible for its association with ActRIIA and with Smad3 (Fig. 3), a quaternary complex of ActRIIA, ActRIB, Smad3, and ARIP1 can form. Thus, the biological function of ARIP1 is likely to be the assembly of a macromolecular structure composed of two types of activin receptor and an intracellular signaling molecule for activin signal transduction in the cell membrane and in the submembranous region. The way of ARIP1 assembles membrane proteins is reminiscent of the Drosophila PDZ protein, InaD. InaD, which has multiple PDZ domains, acts as a scaffold for rhodopsin, a calcium channel, protein kinase C, and phospholipase C in phototransduction cascades (35.Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Recently, a protein that has an FYVE-domain, called SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation), was identified in a study of TGF-β signaling. SARA associates with TGF-β receptors and Smad and regulates TGF-β signaling (36.Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Because SARA and ARIP1 do not show any structural similarities, these proteins probably regulate receptor serine/threonine kinases in different ways. We have shown that ARIP1 mRNA is abundant in mouse brain, and we also detected low amounts of ARIP1 in kidney, lung, heart, and testis. Therefore, ARIP1 is predominantly expressed in brain compared with the other tissues. Overexpression of ARIP1 reduced activin-induced transcription in human K562 cells (Fig. 5 A) and suppressed Smad3-augmented transcription in a mouse hippocampus-derived HT 22 cells (Fig.5 B); thus, ARIP1 may regulate activin-induced signaling in neuronal cells. Whether ARIP1 inhibits signal transduction under physiological conditions remains to be determined; nevertheless, it is a fascinating idea that ARIP1 could be involved in the activation and/or deactivation of activin signaling in neuronal cells, like InaD in the phototransduction cascade (37.Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Lee J.K. Kelly I.M. Bahiraei F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12682-12687Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ARIP1 has multiple protein-protein interaction domains and can recruit Smad3 as well as binding to activin receptors; thus, ARIP1 may be the scaffold of the activin-signaling complex in the cell membrane and in the submembranous region and participate in a physiological regulation of signal transduction. S-SCAM, the rat homologue of ARIP1, binds the postsynaptic protein SAPAP; thus, it may have a role in synaptic transmission (20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The postsynaptic membrane has a dense thickening of submembranous cytoskeleton, called postsynaptic density, that is essential for the localization of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. SAPAP is thought to have a central role in the formation of postsynaptic density (38.Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). S-SCAM also interacts with the other postsynaptic density components, including NMDA receptor subunits and a neuronal cell adhesion molecule, neuroligin-1 (20.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The emergence of adapter and scaffolding proteins as critical functional elements of cellular signaling processes suggests that an important principle of signal transduction lies in the spatial organization of transmembrane receptors and ion channels. ARIP1 (S-SCAM) must be one of the molecules responsible for the macromolecular organization of signaling components in neuronal cells. Activins and their receptors were first characterized as essential regulatory molecules of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. However, recent investigations have shown that activins also have roles in nervous system organization. Expression of mRNA for the activin βA subunit increases in the hippocampus during long-term potentiation (39.Inokuchi K. Kato A. Hiraia K. Hishinuma F. Inoue M. Ozawa F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and following hippocampal lesion (40.Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hubner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in an NMDA-dependent manner. Furthermore, activin regulates neurotransmitter phenotype of sympathetic neurons (6.Link B.A. Nishi R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7.Fann M.J. Patterson P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that activin regulates neurotransmission by controlling neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron and/or by influencing the efficacy of postsynaptic transmission, leading to the formation of active synapses and the acquisition of learning and memory. Our characterization of ARIP1 as the scaffold of a complex of activin receptors and a Smad protein in neuronal cells not only presents a novel mode of regulation of receptor serine/threonine kinases but will also help to clarify the neuronal functions of activins and other members of the TGF-β family.

To determine the organization of the TM segments, pairs of cysteine residues were introduced into the predicted TM segments of a Cys-less P-gp, and the mutant protein was subjected to oxidative cross-linking. In SDS gels, the cross-linked product migrated with a slower mobility than the native protein. The cross-linked products were not detected in the presence of dithiothreitol. Cross-linking was observed in 12 of 125 mutants. The pattern of cross-linking suggested that TM6 is close to TMs 10, 11, and 12, while TM12 is close to TMs 4, 5, and 6. In some mutants the presence of drug substrate colchicine, verapamil, cyclosporin A, or vinblastine either enhanced or inhibited cross-linking. Cross-linking was inhibited in the presence of ATP plus vanadate. These results suggest that the TM segments critical for drug binding must be close to each other and exhibit different conformational changes in response to binding of drug substrate or vanadate trapping of nucleotide. Based on these results, we propose a model for the arrangement of the TM segments. Residues from several transmembrane (TM) segments of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) likely form the drug-binding site(s).

P-glycoprotein transmembrane polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp1; product of the human MDR1 gene) uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump a broad range of cytotoxic compounds out of the cell.

The location of P-gp in tissues, together with studies on P-gp “knock-out” mice suggest that P-gp likely protects the organism from toxic xenobiotics (3.Schinkel A.H. Semin.

The 1280 amino acids of P-gp are organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids that are joined by a linker region of 60 amino acids (7.Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The mechanism that allows P-gp to recognize such a broad range of compounds is unknown. Both halves of P-gp are required for substrate-stimulated ATPase activity (10.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for drug binding (11.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the TM domains alone could mediate drug binding (12.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A deletion mutant lacking both nucleotide-binding domains could still interact with drug substrates. The drug-binding site(s) in P-gp likely consists of residues from multiple TM segments (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of drug recognition by P-gp will require knowledge about the packing of the TM segments and their response to the presence of different substrates.In this study, the packing and flexibility of the TMs of P-gp were examined by disulfide cross-linking analysis. Pairs of cysteine residues were introduced into the predicted TM segments of a mutant Cys-less P-gp. The mutant proteins were assayed for disulfide cross-linking.DISCUSSIONThe results from this and previous studies (14.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggest that TMs 4, 5, and 6 in the NH2-terminal half are close to TMs 10, 11, and 12 in the COOH-terminal half of P-gp. Disulfide cross-linking can occur between residues in TM6 and TMs 10, 11, and 12 and between residues in TM12 and TMs 4, 5, and 6.Our results suggest that binding of substrate induces conformational changes in the TM segments. Colchicine, verapamil, cyclosporin A, and vinblastine had different effects on the cross-linking pattern. A transporter with restricted substrate specificity would be expected to show limited conformational changes upon substrate binding. The capacity of P-gp to accommodate such structurally different substrates could partly be due to relative flexibility and fluidity of TM domains. This is consistent with the finding that there is considerable variability in the ability of colchicine, verapamil, cyclosporin A, or vinblastine to stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or to induce conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding sites (22.Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fluid nature of the TM segments is suggested by the finding that only 4 of the 12 mutants could be cross-linked at 4 °C (Table II), while all were cross-linked at 37 °C.Vanadate plus ATP inhibited cross-linking of the mutants by locking-in the nucleotide-binding domain(s) of P-gp in a fixed conformation (Table III). The rigid nature of the locked-in conformation is then transmitted to the TM domains. This supports the notion that there is “cross-talk” between the nucleotide-binding domains and the TM domains and that ATPase activity is directly linked to drug-P-gp interaction.We have proposed a working model of the arrangement of the TM segments of P-gp (Fig. 2). An interesting feature about the model is that the TMs involved in cross-linking have been reported to be important for P-gp-drug interactions. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the TM segments and labeling with a thiol-reactive substrate, dibromobimane, provided direct evidence for interaction of substrate with residues in TMs 6, 11, and 12 (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Dibromobimane reacted with specific cysteine residues in TMs 6, 11, and 12 and inhibited the activity of P-gp. The presence of substrates such as colchicine, verapamil, or vinblastine inhibited labeling by dibromobimane. Many mutations in TMs 4, 5, and 6, and in TMs 10, 11, and 12, have been reported to alter the substrate specificity or activity of the transporter (23.Devine S.E. Ling V. Melera P.W. Proc. Natl.

The model in Fig. 2 also takes into consideration that no cross-linked products were detected between TMs 1 to 3 and TMs 7 to 9 when cysteine residues were introduced into the full-length Cys-less P-gp or into the Cys-less half-molecules (data not shown).In summary, the TM segments postulated to be involved in drug binding are quite close to each other on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The TM segments and nucleotide-binding domains appear to be conformationally flexible to be able to accommodate structurally different substrates.

The drug-binding site(s) in P-gp likely consists of residues from multiple TM segments (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of drug recognition by P-gp will require knowledge about the packing of the TM segments and their response to the presence of different substrates. In this study, the packing and flexibility of the TMs of P-gp were examined by disulfide cross-linking analysis. Pairs of cysteine residues were introduced into the predicted TM segments of a mutant Cys-less P-gp. The mutant proteins were assayed for disulfide cross-linking. DISCUSSIONThe results from this and previous studies (14.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggest that TMs 4, 5, and 6 in the NH2-terminal half are close to TMs 10, 11, and 12 in the COOH-terminal half of P-gp. Disulfide cross-linking can occur between residues in TM6 and TMs 10, 11, and 12 and between residues in TM12 and TMs 4, 5, and 6.Our results suggest that binding of substrate induces conformational changes in the TM segments. Colchicine, verapamil, cyclosporin A, and vinblastine had different effects on the cross-linking pattern. A transporter with restricted substrate specificity would be expected to show limited conformational changes upon substrate binding. The capacity of P-gp to accommodate such structurally different substrates could partly be due to relative flexibility and fluidity of TM domains. This is consistent with the finding that there is considerable variability in the ability of colchicine, verapamil, cyclosporin A, or vinblastine to stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or to induce conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding sites (22.Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fluid nature of the TM segments is suggested by the finding that only 4 of the 12 mutants could be cross-linked at 4 °C (Table II), while all were cross-linked at 37 °C.Vanadate plus ATP inhibited cross-linking of the mutants by locking-in the nucleotide-binding domain(s) of P-gp in a fixed conformation (Table III). The rigid nature of the locked-in conformation is then transmitted to the TM domains. This supports the notion that there is “cross-talk” between the nucleotide-binding domains and the TM domains and that ATPase activity is directly linked to drug-P-gp interaction.We have proposed a working model of the arrangement of the TM segments of P-gp (Fig. 2). An interesting feature about the model is that the TMs involved in cross-linking have been reported to be important for P-gp-drug interactions. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the TM segments and labeling with a thiol-reactive substrate, dibromobimane, provided direct evidence for interaction of substrate with residues in TMs 6, 11, and 12 (13.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

A vesicular stomatitis virus capsid-derived peptide ligand bearing a photoreactive azido group was specifically bound by and cross-linked to murine HSP glycoprotein (gp) 96. The peptide-binding site was mapped by specific proteolysis of the cross-links followed by analysis of the cross-linked peptides using a judicious combination of SDS-gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid sequencing. The minimal peptide-binding site was mapped to amino acid residues 624–630 in a highly conserved region of gp96. A model of the peptide binding pocket of gp96 was constructed based on the known crystallographic structure of major histocompatibility complex class I molecule bound to a similar peptide. The gp96-peptide model predicts that the peptide ligand is held in a groove formed by α-helices and lies on a surface consisting of antiparallel β-sheets. Interestingly, in this model, the peptide binding pocket abuts the dimerization domain of gp96, which may have implications for the extraordinary stability of peptide-gp96 complexes, and for the faithful relay of peptides to major histocompatibility complex class I molecule for antigen presentation.

Toward this goal, we have, for the first time, identified the peptide-binding site in gp96. His-tagged murine gp96 protein was purified as described before (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PepK was synthesized by and purchased from Alpha Diagnostic (San Antonio, TX) and derivatized with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA, Pierce, Rockford, IL) in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. To 30 nmol of PepK was added a 10-fold excess of NHS-ASA in buffer (150 μl: 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, pH 7.6). The reaction was quenched with Tris-HCl (0.1m, pH 6.8) for 15 min. The derivatized PepK was purified on a 3-ml Sephadex G-10 column and developed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7. The mass change anticipated by modification of peptide (+135 Da) was verified by mass spectrometry. The derivatized peptide (1.4 nmol) was kinased with protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl (12.5 mm HEPES/Na+, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, (pH 7) plus 100 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (300 μCi, NEN Life Science Products)) for 30 min at 30 °C. The kinase was heat-inactivated at 60 °C for 10 min and the peptide was rechromatographed on Sephadex. The specific radioactivity of the 32P-PepK was quantified by spotting on phosphocellulose paper discs (P81, Whatman, Clifton, NJ), washing five times in 1 m glacial acetic acid for 5 min each and twice with EtOH for 5 min, followed by drying and scintillation spectrometry. Typically, ASA-modified PepK was labeled to a specific activity of 20–40 μCi/μg. His-gp96 (240 μg/ml) was incubated with32P-labeled azidosalicylamide (ASA)-modified PepK at a 4:1 molar ratio in 300 μl of binding buffer (20 mmHEPES/Na+, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm Zwittergent 3–12 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 55–60 °C for 15 min and cooled for 15 min to room temperature. Samples (25 μl) in microtiter wells were irradiated with 320–360 nm UV for 10 min at room temperature in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Branford, CT). Preparative amounts of cross-links (∼2 mg) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the bands representing the cross-links were identified by autoradiography and excised as gel pieces, dried in vacuo, and rehydrated in the appropriate protease buffer containing a cleaving agent. Proteolysis was donein situ at 33–37 °C for 48 h with one addition of fresh cleaving agent. The ratio of cleaving agent to target was 5:1 for CNBr/mild, >100:1 for CNBr/harsh, 1:20 for enzymes except trypsin, and 3:1 for trypsin. In most cases following the digestion, samples were pooled, lyophilized, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel system was either standard acrylamide-SDS or Tricine-acrylamide-SDS. Radiolabeled proteolytic fragments were sized by comparison to prestained markers (Bio-Rad or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The apparent mass of PepK (2.6–3.6 kDa) was subtracted from the observed mass of the cross-links. The gp96 fragment mass (cross-link mass minus PepK mass) was matched with the predicted masses (±0.4 kDa) in a gp96 fragmentation mass bank generated by computer. Irradiated cross-linked complexes that had been digested with Endo Glu-C or CNBr/harsh for the purposes of sequence determination were dialyzed extensively against H2O using a 1000-Da cutoff dialysis membrane, lyophilized, and run on 15% polyacrylamide analytical gels. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 2 h at 250 mA at 4 °C using chilled transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was washed several times with water, dried, and exposed to x-ray film to identify the positions of the radiolabeled bands. Specific bands containing cross-links were excised with a razor blade. The peptides in the radiolabeled band were sequenced using automated Edman degradation method at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center. Mass spectra were acquired in a VoyagerTM workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The spectra were calibrated using egg white lysozyme as an internal standard, and known peptide/protein molecules as external standards, which were obtained from the instrument maker. The cross-links and control samples were extensively digested with trypsin, dialyzed thoroughly against H2O, and lyophilized. Control samples consisted of noncross-linked UV-irradiated gp96. The lyophilized samples were dissolved in a matrix solution, which consisted of a saturating amount of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (48.Gharahdaghi F. Kirchner M. Fernandez J. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The samples (1–2 μl) were then spotted on a sample holder plate and allowed to air dry. Molecular weight standards were similarly prepared. The mass spectra were acquired and the mass peaks were identified by matching their masses to gp96 trypsin fragments predicted using the computer program PROWL. gp96 sequence comparison against most entries in the protein data bank (Brookhaven National Laboratory) using BLAST and FESTA computer programs (36.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59917) Google Scholar) yielded poor pairwise alignment. However, comparison of the peptide-binding domain of MHC class I 2mha (37.Zhang W. Young A.C.M. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) yielded blockwise amino acid compositional similarity although there was no pairwise sequence similarity. Using 2mha crystal structure (residues 1–175) as a guide, a structural model of the gp96 peptide-binding site (residues 570–750) was built. In this model only gp96 residues 690–696 were excluded because they would correspond to a turn or a short ω loop. The physicochemical properties of the amino acids in the presumed gp96-binding pocket and those in the 2mha binding pocket were plotted (Fig. 6 A) using GCG's peptide structure program (38.Devereux J. Haeberlie P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar, 39.Wolf H. Modrow S. Jameson B.A. Hermann G. Fortsch B. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 187-191PubMed Google Scholar). The comparison of the electrostatic surface potentials of 2mha and the gp96 peptide binding pockets (Fig. 6,C and D) was generated using GRASP computer program (40.Nichols A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 282Crossref Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). In the peptide, only the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) nucleocapsid peptide core sequence RGYVYQGLKSG was modeled because the crystallographic coordinates for most of this sequence were available (37.Zhang W. Young A.C.M. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The modeled peptide has the N- to C-terminal orientation that is opposite to that of the peptide in 2mha because the cross-linking results show that the unique K9 in the peptide should be close (i.e. within cross-linkable distance) to the623KDKALKDK630 sequence in gp96. This would place the peptide orientation as shown in Fig. 6. The model (Fig. 6) was generated using Molecular Simulations INSIGHTII version 97 program on a Silicon Graphics workstation. In a previous study we showed that a VSV nucleocapsid-derived peptide (SLSDLRGYVYQGLKSGNVS) bound to gp96 under a variety of conditions (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Earlier, others (3.Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 37.Zhang W. Young A.C.M. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 42.Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) had shown that this VSV peptide sequence or subsequences thereof, were chaperoned by gp96 and were represented by MHC class I molecule for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-specific immune response. Therefore we chose the immunogenic core sequence of the VSV peptide for mapping the peptide-binding site in gp96. We designed a chimeric 20-amino acid peptide (PepK; Fig. 1 A) containing the VSV core sequence RGYVYQGLKSG followed by the sequence LRRASLGRS. The latter has a phosphorylation motif (RRXS), which permitted the introduction of a 32P radiolabel on the Ser at position 16 of PepK using protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The32P label allowed the gp96-PepK cross-links to be visualized by autoradiography following gel electrophoresis. This facilitated the specific identification and subsequent purification of cross-links for the mapping of the peptide-binding site in gp96 (see below). To achieve covalent photocross-linking to gp96, PepK was modified by the attachment of a photoreactive azido group to the unique Lys (Fig. 1 A) and the gp96-peptide complexes were exposed to near UV light. In a typical cross-linking experiment, PepK was first modified with the azido cross-linker (ASA), purified from the unincorporated cross-linker and then radiolabeled with 32P. The 32P-labeled ASA-modified PepK was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1 B). The purified PepK (Fig. 1 B) was then incubated with and cross-linked to gp96 to form SDS-resistant complexes (Fig. 1 C), in agreement with previous observations (16.Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Covalent cross-linking of PepK to gp96 could be achieved by shining either room light or near UV (320–360 nm) from a UV light source. Cross-linking with near UV gave better cross-link yields. The cross-linking resulted in a single sharp band in SDS-polyacrylamide gels suggesting a homogeneous specimen (gp96XL in Fig. 1 C). Control lanes indicated that there were no cross-links to gp96 in the absence of the azido modification on PepK either with or without UV. Using the UV induced cross-linking technique shown in Fig. 1 C, we prepared a large amount (∼2 mg of gp96) of cross-linked gp96 for the purpose of mapping the peptide-binding site. The gp96 cross-links were proteolyzed and the fragments were identified using a judicious combination of SDS-PAGE, peptide sequence determination using Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. For each proteolytic cleavage, a computer-generated peptide mass bank of gp96 was used to order the proteolytic fragments on the gp96 primary sequence. The numbering system of gp96 peptides and amino acid sequences given in this work corresponds to the murine gp96 primary sequence including the signal sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P08113; Refs. 41.Mazarella R.A. Greene M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 44.Srivastava P.K. Chen Y.T. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A self-consistent pattern of fragmentation emerged, yielding the location of the peptide-binding site. Cleavage of cross-links with formic acid (Fig.2 A), which normally cleaves Asp-Pro bonds and X-Pro (X is any other amino acid) under more severe conditions (43.Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), yielded two fragments by cleavage at Asp-Pro, 66.2 kDa (residues 236 to 802) and 50.5 kDa (369 to 802), and two more by cleavage at X-Pro, 41 kDa (residues 443 to 802) and 33.5 (residues 443 to 729) (Fig. 2 A). Mild digestion with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), which cleaves on the carboxyl side of Met, generated one prominent fragment of 33.5 kDa (lane 4, Fig. 2 B), which could be residues 337 to 622, 371 to 658, or 427 to 711. Cleavage with endoproteinase Asn-C, which cuts after Asn, yielded fragments of 41.1 and 22.8 kDa, which were unambiguously assigned to residues 338 to 688 and 492 to 688, respectively (Fig. 2 C). Harsh digestion with CNBr generated a 13.3-kDa fragment corresponding to residues 542 to 658, and a 3.9-kDa fragment that was assigned to residues 623 to 658 (Fig. 2 D). The 3.9-kDa fragment arose from the 13.3-kDa fragment by CNBr cleavage at the single internal Met (Fig. 2 D). The 4.5-kDa fragment extended from amino acids 623 to 662. This further narrowed the peptide-binding site to between residues 623 and 658. Digestion with endoproteinases Lys-C or Glu-C each resulted in cross-linked fragments containing the 623 to 658 region. However, precise assignment was difficult because of closely spaced potential cleavage sites. Therefore, NH2-terminal sequencing of a cross-link fragment was done. First, a cross-linked fragment containing a gp96 peptide of 11 kDa (Fig. 2, B, lane 3, and E,lane 2) that was generated by digestion with Endo Glu-C was selected for automated sequencing by Edman degradation. This fragment was selected because the probable NH2 terminus of this fragment (residue 610) was closest to the NH2-terminal amino acid (residue 623) in the putative binding site (CNBr/harsh, Fig.2 D). The determined partial sequence from the NH2 terminus of this 11-kDa Endo Glu-C fragment was 610-ATEKEFEPLLNW, which matched perfectly (12 of 12 matches) with the expected amino acid sequence based on the known DNA sequence of the mouse gp96 gene (41.Mazarella R.A. Greene M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Srivastava P.K. Chen Y.T. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A second cross-linked Endo Glu-C fragment was also partially sequenced by Edman degradation. It began with residue 615, FEPLLNWMKD—A (11 of 12 matches), and also fit the known gp96 sequence. The line (—) signifies that a Lys (Lys625) was missing from the eleventh sequencing cycle, presumably because it photoreacted with the azido group on PepK (see below). These results from automated peptide sequencing confirmed that the peptide-binding site must be located between residues 615 and 658. To further refine the peptide-binding site, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry of cross-links cut with trypsin. This robust protease is highly suitable for this purpose because of its high specificity and the large number of potential cleavage sites in gp96 (118 cleavage sites). In addition, trypsin cuts within PepK itself (5 cleavage sites), which could reveal the smallest contact region protected by gp96 in the cross-link. Two prominent mass peaks were present only in the cross-link spectrum (XL in Fig.3) but not in the control (NC, Fig. 3). The observed mass peak (∗, m/z = 3086 in Fig. 3) matched the sum of the mass of a cross-link between gp96 trypsin fragment DKALKDK (residue 624 to residue 630; mass 816 Da) and a trypsinized cross-linked PepK (mass 2272 Da after removal of the NH2-terminal Arg by trypsin). The expected mass of the conjugate (3086 Da) exactly matched the observed mass (3086 Da). No trypsin fragment of uncross-linked gp96 could have the observed mass, the closest being either 12 or 27 atomic mass units away. The mass determinations had an accuracy of 0.01% in the linear mass range of the analysis. Therefore we ruled out those fragments. Note that the sequence of the second cross-linked Endo Glu-C fragment (see above;615FEPLLNWMKDKA626) partially overlapped with that of the trypsin fragment 624DKALKDK630identified by mass spectrometry, thus confirming that the smallest known region in gp96 contacting the peptide was from residue 624 to 630.Figure 3Matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectra of trypsin digested cross-links. The mass spectra from cross-linked (XL) and non-cross-linked (NC) gp96 samples are shown. All major peaks were assigned to trypsin fragments from gp96. However, only a few peaks are marked to avoid overcrowding the spectrum.

The important fragments are ordered according to the positions of their NH2 and COOH termini. The peptide fragments nicely fall into an overlapping pattern in decreasing order of size. The smallest fragment comprising residues 624 to 630, which was generated by trypsin, defines the minimal peptide-binding site (P). There is only one peptide-binding site in gp96. Otherwise, parallel lineages of one or more large proteolytic fragment(s) giving rise to non-overlapping daughter fragments would have been observed. This was clearly not the case (Fig. 4). The gp96 protein has a signal sequence located at the NH2 terminus and an endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval signal (ER) at the COOH terminus. There is extensive homology with the cytosolic counterpart of gp96, HSP90 (41.Mazarella R.A. Greene M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Toward the NH2-terminal region there are two Walker boxes (A and B) which are suggestive of ATP-binding site(s). The dimerization domain is located in the COOH-terminal region (46.Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16760-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as is the peptide-binding site P (this work). As discussed below, the close juxtaposition of the peptide-binding site and the dimerization domain may have functional implications. In an attempt to identify the exact amino acid that potentially reacted with the azido group in the modified PepK (Fig. 1), we turned to automated sequencing by Edman degradation of a cross-linked peptide generated in a harsh digest with CNBr (CNBr/harsh; peptide 623–658; Fig. 4). This peptide should be ideal for the resolution of the cross-linking amino acid site by automated sequencing because its NH2 terminus contains the tryptic peptide identified in the mass spectrum (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, this cross-linked CNBr fragment (apparent combined mass ∼6.9 kDa, labeled 3.9 in Fig. 2 D) co-migrates on SDS gels with a noncross-linked CNBr fragment (7.1 kDa; residues 472 to 531). On an autoradiogram only the cross-linked fragment is seen because it carried the radiolabeled PepK (Fig. 2 D). Both the radiolabeled cross-linked fragment and the non-radiolabeled noncross-linked fragment were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, thus yielding a mixture of the two sequences upon sequencing using Edman degradation. As expected, sequencing revealed the cross-linked CNBr fragment 623KDKALKDK630, which overlaps with the tryptic fragment (624DKALKDK630) that was identified in the mass spectrum (see above). This result provides additional confirmation of the minimal peptide-binding site. However, the contaminating noncross-linked CNBr fragment had the sequence472IKKIADEK479. Note that both the cross-linked and noncross-linked fragments have Lys at positions 3 and 8. This introduced an unexpected complexity for the identification of the cross-linking site. The azido group in PepK undergoes photoreaction preferentially with the ε-amino group of lysines (45.Hermanson G. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, New York1996: 261Google Scholar). Ideally, during automated sequencing using Edman degradation, the cross-linked Lys should be represented in very low picomole yield relative to other Lys in the sequenced region. This is because the cross-linked Lys is not a standard amino acid. Normally, cross-linked amino acids should be missing with the appearance of a blank in the sequencing cycle at that particular position. However, the presence of Lys from the noncross-linked peptide would obscure any blank cycle originating from the cross-linked peptide. It was impossible to apportion the picomole yields of Lys at positions 3 and 8 in the amino acid sequences for the mixture of CNBr fragments. However, when the picomole yields of the position-unique lysines for cross-linked (Lys628, KDKALKDK) and uncross-linked (IKKIADEK) peptides were taken as references, the Lys at position 3 in the cross-linked peptide (Lys625, KDKALKDK) had an estimated 10-fold lower picomole yield than did Lys628 or Lys630. Putting together this result and the fact that the Endo Glu-C fragment that was sequenced earlier had Lys625missing from its sequence (see above), we tentatively conclude that Lys625 might have been the site of azido cross-linking. Although we believe that these results are compelling, we hasten to add that further analysis using other techniques may be necessary to confirm the cross-linked amino acid. From our point of view (see model in Fig. 6), the peptide binding pocket is a three-dimensional entity and may indeed consist of ∼200 amino acids within a domain. Therefore we believe that more definitive information regarding the exact cross-linked Lys in the sequenced contact region is not critical for our present understanding of the architecture of the peptide-binding site in gp96. Earlier, we showed by fluorescence that two peptides, each bound to monomer gp96 in a gp96 dimer or higher order complex, were held extremely close to each other (3.5 to 10 Å) in the complex (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This observation is further supported by the direct observation by mass spectrometry of a cross-linked PepK dimer from complexes (**, m/z = 4259 ± 2; Fig. 3,XL). The observed mass of cross-linked PepK dimer fit the predicted mass (4257 Da). No peptide of this mass was seen in the control (Fig. 3, NC). The PepK dimer was also observed in gels (Fig. 2 F, PD, lane 3) but only in the peptide-gp96 complexes (absent in lane 2). The covalent homodimerization of PepK independently confirmed the intermolecular distance (3.5 to 10 Å) that was ascertained by fluorescence (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) because the azido cross-linking group was on an 8.0-Å arm. In the PepK dimer cross-link (Fig. 3, XL), trypsin cleaved off Arg1, as it did in the monomer PepK-gp96 cross-link, and also removed Ser20. But the middle portion of the peptide is protected suggesting that the peptide-binding pocket is probably an open-ended partially solvent-exposed channel or a groove, which is in agreement with our fluorescence studies (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Combining our fluorescence (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cross-linking results, it appears that residues 624 to 630 in gp96 must interface with PepK in a proposed peptide binding pocket. The region around the peptide-binding site is highly conserved among gp96 paralogs (Fig.5) implicating these residues in the formation of the peptide binding pocket. The gp96 peptide-binding domain was modeled based on amino acid compositional homology with the crystal structure of the peptide binding pocket of MHC class I molecule (37.Zhang W. Young A.C.M. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Our model offers a framework for engineering by design new gp96 mutant proteins with altered peptide-binding properties that may result in better gp96-peptide vaccines, and it suggests that the dimerization domain may play a role in stable peptide binding. Comparison of hydrophobicity, flexibility, and surface probability plots and of the electrostatic surface potential distribution of peptide binding pockets of gp96 and MHC class I molecule revealed partial similarity (Fig. 6, A,C, and D). This is interesting because peptide ligand is thought to be relayed by gp96 to MHC class I molecule for immunogenicity (12.Nicchitta C.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our core peptide RGYVYQGLKSG and that of the octapeptide RGYVYQGL in the MHC class I molecule co-crystal structure are largely identical. The peptide lies in a pocket surrounded by amphipathic α-helices (Fig. 6 B). The floor of the pocket consists of antiparallel β-sheets as in the co-crystal of the MHC class I molecule with peptide. As per our cross-linking result, K9 (blue CPK) of the peptide is close to Lys625 (blue sticks, bottom of Fig. 6 B). The 8.0-Å linker attached to Lys9 of the peptide should permit cross-linking to Lys625. An open conformation of the pocket, which is suggested based on Trp fluorescence (33.Sastry S.S. Linderoth N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), may allow peptide binding in a clamp-like fashion. gp96 residues 697 to 741, which form a dimerization domain (46.Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16760-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (green sticks, Fig. 6 B), are close to the bound peptide. It is envisioned that gp96 dimerization may stabilize peptide binding such as to facilitate intercellular peptide transportation and faithful relay to MHC class I molecule (12.Nicchitta C.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Pramod K. Srivastava and Z.

https://openalex.org/W2100316115,"The sst2A receptor is expressed in the endocrine, gastrointestinal, and neuronal systems as well as in many hormone-sensitive tumors. This receptor is rapidly internalized and phosphorylated in growth hormone-R2 pituitary cells following somatostatin binding (Hipkin, R. W., Friedman, J., Clark, R. B., Eppler, C. M., and Schonbrunn, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13869–13876). The protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also stimulates sst2A phosphorylation. Here we examine the mechanisms and consequences of PMA and agonist-induced sst2A phosphorylation. Like somatostatin, both PMA and bombesin increased sst2A receptor phosphorylation within 2 min. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked PMA- and bombesin- stimulated sst2A phosphorylation, whereas stimulation by the somatostatin analog SMS 201–995 was unaffected. Agonist and PMA each stimulated phosphorylation in two receptor domains, the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail. Functionally, PMA dramatically increased the internalization of the sst2A receptor-ligand complex. This PMA stimulation was blocked by GF109203X, whereas basal internalization was unaffected. However, neither basal nor PMA-stimulated internalization was altered by pertussis toxin, whereas both were blocked by hypertonic sucrose. Therefore PKC activation and agonist binding stimulate sst2A phosphorylation by distinct mechanisms, and PKC potentiates internalization of the sst2A receptor via clathrin-coated pits. Thus, hormonal stimulation of PKC-coupled receptors may provide a mechanism for regulating the inhibitory actions of somatostatin in target tissue. The sst2A receptor is expressed in the endocrine, gastrointestinal, and neuronal systems as well as in many hormone-sensitive tumors. This receptor is rapidly internalized and phosphorylated in growth hormone-R2 pituitary cells following somatostatin binding (Hipkin, R. W., Friedman, J., Clark, R. B., Eppler, C. M., and Schonbrunn, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13869–13876). The protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also stimulates sst2A phosphorylation. Here we examine the mechanisms and consequences of PMA and agonist-induced sst2A phosphorylation. Like somatostatin, both PMA and bombesin increased sst2A receptor phosphorylation within 2 min. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked PMA- and bombesin- stimulated sst2A phosphorylation, whereas stimulation by the somatostatin analog SMS 201–995 was unaffected. Agonist and PMA each stimulated phosphorylation in two receptor domains, the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail. Functionally, PMA dramatically increased the internalization of the sst2A receptor-ligand complex. This PMA stimulation was blocked by GF109203X, whereas basal internalization was unaffected. However, neither basal nor PMA-stimulated internalization was altered by pertussis toxin, whereas both were blocked by hypertonic sucrose. Therefore PKC activation and agonist binding stimulate sst2A phosphorylation by distinct mechanisms, and PKC potentiates internalization of the sst2A receptor via clathrin-coated pits. Thus, hormonal stimulation of PKC-coupled receptors may provide a mechanism for regulating the inhibitory actions of somatostatin in target tissue.

Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar and 2.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Additionally, agonist-independent or heterologous desensitization may occur when hormonal activation of one receptor reduces cellular responsiveness through a different receptor system (3.Chuang T.T. Iacovelli L. Sallese M. De Blasi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 416-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Whereas homologous desensitization may be mediated by either G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs)1 or second messenger-dependent protein kinases, heterologous desensitization is thought to involve only the latter. GRKs preferentially phosphorylate the agonist-occupied receptor, increasing its affinity for cytoplasmic arrestins, which disrupt receptor G protein coupling and may also act as adaptors for receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits. In contrast, heterologous desensitization can involve phosphorylation of unoccupied as well as agonist-occupied receptors and may or may not be associated with increased receptor internalization. The somatostatin peptides (SRIF-14 and SRIF-28) regulate endocrine, exocrine, immune, and neuronal function through binding to a family of six G protein-coupled receptors (sst1, sst2A, sst2B, sst3, sst4, and sst5) (4.Schonbrunn A.

Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms involved in sst2A receptor regulation has important implications in understanding SRIF function. We previously showed that the sst2A receptor is rapidly desensitized, internalized, and phosphorylated following agonist stimulation in GH-R2 cells, a pituitary cell line transfected to express high levels of this receptor subtype (13.Hipkin R.W.

Moreover, incubation with the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also produced a dramatic increase in receptor phosphorylation (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B.

Further, SRIF has been shown to increase inositol phosphate levels in several tissues by activating endogenous SRIF receptors (16.Marin P. Delumeau J.C. Tence M. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Premont J.

Our observation that PMA treatment stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation within minutes led us to investigate the mechanism and functional impact of protein kinase C activation on sst2A receptors. In this report, we examined the involvement of protein kinase C in homologous and heterologous sst2A receptor phosphorylation, identified the regions of the receptor phosphorylated in response to agonist and PMA, and determined the effect of PKC activation on receptor internalization. Cell culture media and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and fetal bovine serum was from JRH Biosciences (Lexiexa, KS). The generation and specificity of the sst2A receptor antiserum (R2–88) has been described (18.Gu Y.Z. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Leupeptin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, bacitracin, PMA, N-chlorosuccinimide, cyanogen bromide, Nonidet P-40, and protein A were obtained from Sigma.N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was purchased from Calbiochem. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). Okadaic acid and GF109203X-HCl were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (200–400 mesh, chloride format), Bradford reagent, and reagents for electrophoresis and Western blotting were obtained from Bio-Rad. Phosphate-free DMEM and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). [3H]inositol (specific activity, 18.9 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of the best grade available and were purchased from common suppliers. The clonal GH4-R2.20 cell line, hereafter referred to as GH-R2 cells, was generated by transfecting GH4C1 pituitary tumor cells with the rat sst2A receptor and was maintained in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% newborn calf serum as described previously (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Experimental cultures were used 2–7 days after seeding, with a medium change 18–24 h prior to use. 32PO4-labeling experiments were carried out with cells plated in 100-mm dishes, whereas receptor binding experiments used cells plated in 35-mm wells. GH-R2 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105/35-mm plate and fed 2 days later with DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol in inositol-deficient DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with 1 ml HBSS buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose) and incubated with fresh HBSS containing 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were then treated with the indicated reagents for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were extracted with 5% of perchloric acid, and [3H]inositol phosphates were extracted and purified on Dowex anion exchange resin as described previously (19.Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 716-727PubMed Google Scholar). GH-R2 cell membranes were prepared as described previously (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cooled on ice, washed with, and scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 100 nm okadaic acid). Following centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml/dish homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.6) containing phosphatase inhibitors and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following homogenization and a two step centrifugation procedure, membranes were resuspended in cold gly-gly buffer (20 mm glycylglycine, 1 mmMgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.2), snap frozen, and stored at −70 °C until assay. Metabolic labeling of cells and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the sst2A receptor was carried out as described previously (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 3 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate and 1% newborn calf serum. Following treatment with various hormones or pharmacological agents, cells were cooled, washed, and scraped into cold HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml bacitracin, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 100 nm okadaic acid). Following centrifugation, cell pellets were solubilized with HEPES-buffered saline containing 4 mg/ml dodecyl-β-maltoside and the aforementioned inhibitors (lysis buffer) for 60 min at 4 °C. The detergent lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein content of the supernatants was assessed by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The sst2A receptor was then partially purified from equal amounts of soluble protein by lectin affinity chromatography using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and immunoprecipitated with receptor antibody at a final dilution of 1:200 (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were solubilized in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 6 m urea, pH 6.8) at 60 °C for 15 min and resolved on 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). Phosphorylated receptor, immunoprecipitated from32P-labeled GH-R2 cells, was located on dried SDS acrylamide gels by autoradiography. The dried gel piece containing the receptor was cut out and rehydrated for 10 min, and the receptor was eluted by incubating the chopped gel in 1 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 7.8; 0.1% SDS (w/v), 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v)) overnight at 30 °C with rocking. The eluted receptor was then precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid using 20 μg of boiled RNase1 as carrier as described previously (20.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For cleavage at methionine residues, the precipitated receptor was dissolved in 50 μl of 70% formic acid and incubated with 100 mg/ml cyanogen bromide (CNBr) for 2 h at room temperature (21.Delange R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 18: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The sample was then frozen on dry ice and lyophilized. For cleavage at tryptophan residues, the immunoprecipitate was incubated with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) using a modification of the method described by Lischwe and Ochs (22.Lischwe M.A. Ochs D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The precipitated receptor was dissolved in 20 μl of urea, glacial acetic acid, and water (1 g:1 ml:1 ml) and denatured by incubating at room temperature for 30 min. Following the addition of 20 μl of 50 mm NCS in urea, glacial acetic acid, and water, the sample was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Another 20 μl of 50 mm NCS in urea, glacial acetic acid, and water is then added, and the incubation is continued for an additional 30 min. Following the addition of 1 ml of cold elution buffer, peptides were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above. Phosphopeptides generated with CNBr or NCS were separated on a discontinuous Tricine-urea SDS-PAGE system described by Schagger and van Jagow (23.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) using a 16.5% acrylamide, 6 m urea resolving gel. Following electrophoresis, the phosphopeptides are electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) (19.Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 716-727PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the C-terminal receptor peptide was identified by immunoblotting (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with the R2–88 sst2A receptor antiserum (1:10,000) (18.Gu Y.Z. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The somatostatin analog [Tyr11]SRIF (Bachem, Torrance, CA) was radioiodinated using chloramine T and subsequently purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Internalization of the receptor-bound ligand was examined using two experimental approaches differing in the temperature of radioligand binding. In both paradigms, GH-R2 cells were washed with 37 °C binding buffer (F12 medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mg/ml lactalbumin hydrolysate) and incubated in the absence or presence of various pharmacological agents for the times indicated. In one paradigm, approximately 150,000 cpm of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF was added either without or with 100 nm unlabeled SRIF, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for various times. Alternatively, following incubation with the pharmacological agents, the cells were washed with cold binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in fresh buffer containing [125I-Tyr11]SRIF (≈150,000 cpm/ml) without or with 100 nm unlabeled SRIF, conditions in which equilibrium binding to cell surface receptors is achieved. Following the binding reaction, the cells were washed with cold buffer to remove unbound trace and then incubated for various times at 37 °C in the continued absence or presence of pharmacological agents to allow internalization of the receptor-bound ligand. Following internalization at 37 °C, cells were rinsed with cold binding buffer and then incubated for 5 min in cold acidic glycine-buffered saline (100 mm glycine, 50 mmNaCl, pH 3.0) to release a surface-bound ligand (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After collecting the acidic buffer, cells were dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH. The radioactivity in both the glycine buffer (representing surface-bound ligand) and the cell lysates (representing internalized ligand) was then measured in a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech gamma spectrometer at an efficiency of 75%. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of radioligand bound in the absence (total binding) and presence of 100 nm SRIF (nonspecific binding). Protein A (Sigma) was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Receptor phosphorylation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) (19.Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 716-727PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated results of a representative experiment are shown; all experiments were performed at least two times. Our previous studies showed that incubation of GH-R2 cells with the protein kinase C activator PMA markedly stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway was of physiological significance, we examined the effect of two hormones previously shown to activate phospholipase C in the parental line used to generate GH-R2 cells, namely GH4C1cells. Surprisingly, incubation with 100 nm TRH did not stimulate sst2A receptor phosphorylation in GH-R2 cells (data not shown). However, further investigation showed that TRH did not increase inositol phosphate formation in this cell line (TableI). Because bombesin did induce a modest increase in inositol phosphate accumulation (Table I), we next incubated 32PO4-labeled cultures with this peptide. Following detergent solubilization and partial purification by lectin chromatography, the sst2A receptor was immunoprecipitated with a specific receptor antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and phosphoimaging. As shown in Fig. 1, bombesin caused a time-dependent increase in sst2A receptor phosphorylation, which reached 1.8 ± 0.1 times the basal level after 5 min. Although this increase in phosphorylation was considerably less than that produced by a 5-min incubation with agonist or PMA (7.3 ± 0.9 and 5.7 ± 0.5 fold, respectively), the observation that bombesin rapidly stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation showed that cross-talk does occur between the bombesin and sst2A receptors.Table IEffect of hormones on inositol phosphate formation in GH-R2 cellsTreatmentConcentration[3H]Inositol phosphatecpmExperiment 1 Basal901 ± 39 TRH1 μm1111 ± 36 Bombesin100 nm2319 ± 88 SMS100 nm1513 ± 98Experiment 2 Basal1319 ± 78 TRH1 μm1571 ± 52 SMS100 nm2287 ± 289 NaF10 mm9684 ± 1331GH-R2 cells were preequilibrated with 1 μCi/ml[3H]inositol for 24 h and then incubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min. Cells were treated with the indicated hormones or agents for 45 min and then extracted with 5% perchloric acid. Total inositol phosphates were quantitated as described under “Experimental Methods.” Open table in a new tab GH-R2 cells were preequilibrated with 1 μCi/ml[3H]inositol for 24 h and then incubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min. Cells were treated with the indicated hormones or agents for 45 min and then extracted with 5% perchloric acid. Total inositol phosphates were quantitated as described under “Experimental Methods.” Because bombesin produced a rather modest increase in sst2A receptor phosphorylation, we further characterized the more robust PMA response. To this end, 32PO4-labeled GH-R2 cells were incubated with 200 nm PMA for various periods of time (Fig.2, left panel) or with different concentrations of PMA for 15 min (Fig. 2, right panel). PMA-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was half-maximal at about 5 min, maximal by 15 min, and maintained through 30 min of incubation (Fig. 2, left panel). Increased receptor phosphorylation was evident upon incubation with 5 nm PMA and was concentration-dependent (EC50 ≈ 50 nm) reaching a maximum at 100 nm PMA (Fig. 2,right panel). Thus, sst2A receptor phosphorylation depends on both the concentration and duration of PMA exposure. We used two different approaches to assess the role of PKC in agonist- and PMA-induced sst2A receptor phosphorylation. To determine whether the sst2A receptor was coupled to phospholipase C in GH-R2 cells, we measured the effect of the sst2 receptor selective analog, SMS 201–995 (SMS) on [3H] inositol phosphate accumulation. SMS produced a small, but reproducible increase in IP formation (Table I), suggesting that it could lead to PKC activation in GH-R2 cells. We next assessed the role of PKC in PMA and agonist-dependent sst2A receptor phosphorylation using the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X (24.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).32PO4-labeled GH-R2 cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of 4 μm GF109203X for 15 min prior to a 5-min incubation with no additions, 100 nm SMS, or 200 nm PMA. The data in Fig.3 show that GF109203X abolished PMA-induced sst2A receptor phosphorylation but had no effect on SMS stimulation. Bombesin-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was also blocked by GF109203X (data not shown). Thus PMA- and bombesin-stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation are mediated by activation of PKC, whereas agonist-stimulated phosphorylation is not. Despite the differences in mechanism, phosphorylation in response to PMA and SRIF may occur at common sites on the receptor. With the expectation that two agents, which produced receptor phosphorylation at identical sites, should not have an additive effect, we measured the increase in sst2A receptor phosphorylation produced by maximal concentrations of both SRIF and PMA. As shown in Fig.4, the increase in32PO4 incorporated into the sst2A receptor following incubation with both 100 nm SRIF and 200 nm PMA was close to the sum of the32PO4 incorporation produced by treatment with the two agents individually. This observation suggests that agonist- and PMA-stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation occur on at least partly distinct residues. We previously demonstrated that basal-, agonist-, and PMA-stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation occur primarily on serine and, to a small extent, on threonine residues (13.Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, to determine the functional consequences of sst2A receptor phosphorylation, the phosphorylation sites on the receptor must first be identified. We therefore used peptide mapping to characterize the intracellular regions of the sst2A receptor that were phosphorylated. Chemical cleavage of the receptor at methionine residues with CNBr is predicted to generate 11 peptides, four of which encompass intracellular regions containing serine and threonine residues (Fig.5 A). CNBr cleavage of the sst2A receptor immunoprecipitated from cells treated with 100 nm SRIF generated a single phosphorylated band between 8 and 9 kDa (Fig. 6, top panel). Based on the predicted molecular masses of the expected peptide products, this band could contain peptides from either the third intracellular loop (8924 Da) or the C-terminal tail of the receptor (8509 Da). We did not detect phosphopeptides at molecular masses predicted for either the C-terminal peptide from the first intracellular loop (2197 Da) or the peptide from the second intracellular loop (2980 Da). CNBr cleavage of a basally phosphorylated receptor or receptor phosphorylated in response to treatment with 200 nm PMA also produced a single phosphorylated band between 8 and 9 kDa (data not shown).Figure 6Peptide mapping of the phosphorylated sst2A receptor. 32PO4-labeled GH-R2 cells were incubated for 15 min with either 100 nm SRIF (top) or in the absence or presence of 100 nmSRIF or 200 nm PMA (bottom). Following detergent solubilization, lectin affinity chromatography, and immunoprecipitation, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Receptor was localized by autoradiography and then eluted from the gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Eluted protein was hydrolyzed with either 100 mg/ml CNBr or 50 mm NCS, and the resulting peptides were resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, phosphopeptides were detected by phosphoimaging (right). The C-terminal receptor peptide was subsequently identified by immunoblot analysis (left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly localize the C-terminal tail receptor peptide, we electrophoretically transferred the CNBr-generated cleavage products to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then immunoblotted with the R2–88 receptor antibody, which recognizes a region in the C terminus of the sst2A receptor (18.Gu Y.Z. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 6 (top panel), a single immunoreactive peptide was detected at the expected molecular weight. Further, the CNBr-generated immunoreactive receptor peptide co-migrated with the phosphorylated band. Thus, Western blot analysis of CNBr cleavage products confirmed that the C-terminal tail of the receptor was a potential site for sst2A receptor phosphorylation but could not distinguish phosphorylation within the C-terminal and the third intracellular receptor domains.

Ras-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 is augmented in response to Ca2+ influx and G protein βγ subunit (Gβγ) stimulation. Ras-GRF1 also acts as a GEF toward Rac, but not Rho and Cdc42, when activated by Gβγ-mediated signals. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 is critical for the induction of Rac-GEF activity as evidenced by inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Herein, we show that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates Ras-GRF1, thereby inducing Rac-GEF activity. Ras-GRF1 transiently expressed with v-Src was tyrosine-phosphorylated and showed significant GEF activity toward Rac, but not Rho and Cdc42, which was comparable with that induced by Gβγ. In contrast, Ras-GEF activity remained unchanged. The recombinant c-Src protein phosphorylated affinity-purified glutathione S-transferase-tagged Ras-GRF1in vitro and thereby elicited Rac-GEF activity. Taken together, tyrosine phosphorylation by Src is sufficient for the induction of Rac-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1, which may imply the involvement of Src downstream of Gβγ to regulate Ras-GRF1.

GEFs, when activated by upstream signals, stimulate GDP/GTP exchange reaction of a distinct set of GTP-binding proteins, leading to the accumulation of the active GTP-bound form within the cell. Activation of GEFs occurs by diverse mechanisms including phosphorylation, direct interaction with other proteins, and in some cases, subsequent translocation to the plasma membrane. The catalytic domain conserved among GEFs that target Ras is designated the CDC25 homology domain, which was originally identified as a region in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc25 protein essential for the function as an upstream regulator of Ras (1.Powers S.

Particularly, the role of mSos in the regulation of Ras downstream of a variety of receptors including tyrosine kinase-type, cytokine, and G protein-coupled receptors has been clarified in detail. Virtually all types of receptors trigger the activation of specific tyrosine kinases, which in turn phosphorylate the receptor subunit itself and/or downstream molecules. Subsequently, a diverse array of proteins become associated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor, thereby stimulating multiple signaling pathways. Recruitment of mSos complexed with the adaptor protein Grb2 to the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor at the plasma membrane is considered to be a crucial step for the onset of Ras activation (11.Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Ras-GRFs contain various motifs in addition to the C-terminally located CDC25 homology domain, including the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an IQ motif, a Dbl homology (DH) domain contiguous to the second PH domain (4.Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Zippel R. Lowy D.R. Zhang K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5.Martegani E. Vanoni M. Zippel R. Coccetti P. Brambilla R. Ferrari C. Sturani E.

A. 1992; 89: 7100-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1 is reported to regulate Ras activity in response to Ca2+ influx, for which binding of calmodulin to the IQ motif is crucial (12.Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+-responsive, Ras-independent as well as constitutive, Ras-dependent pathways downstream of Ras-GRF1 were shown to direct Raf and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activities (13.Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) also stimulate Ras-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 through serine phosphorylation (14.Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15.Mattingly R.R. Saini V. Macara I.G. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding of Gβγ to the N-terminal PH domain of Ras-GRF1 was demonstrated (16.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether the binding is critical for Gβγ induction of Ras-GEF activity. Recently, oligomerization of Ras-GRFs through their DH domain was reported (13.Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Oligomerization seems to be required for biological functions, because a mutation within the DH domain that abolishes oligomerization rendered Ras-GRFs incapable of inducing transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Ras-GRF1 is expressed exclusively in brain, suggesting an important role in brain-specific signaling. Disruption of Ras-GRF1, in fact, resulted in defects in brain functions such as memory consolidation (17.Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ras-GRF2 is expressed not only in brain but also in several other tissues such as lung and spleen, suggesting a role distinct from that of Ras-GRF1 (8.Fam N.P. Fan W. Wang Z. Zhang L. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ras-GRP is expressed in nervous and hematopoietic cells (9.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 10.Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Besides the catalytic CDC25 homology domain, a pair of EF-hands, where Ca2+ binds, and the diacylglycerol-binding C1 domain were identified in Ras-GRP. Whereas deletion of the C1 domain eliminated the transforming activity of Ras-GRP, the EF-hands seemed to be dispensable (9.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 10.Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Ras·GTP formation was enhanced by a diacylglycerol analog in the presence of Ras-GRP, suggesting an involvement of Ras-GRP in diacylglycerol-mediated activation of the Ras pathway (9.Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins consisting of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 regulates various physiological responses through actin cytoskeleton rearrangements (18.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 19.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Rho family proteins have been implicated as a molecular switch downstream of a wide variety of receptors. The activation of Rho family proteins in response to extracellular stimuli is thought to be directed by Rho family-specific GEFs. GEFs that act on Rho family proteins constitute the Dbl family, whose members possess DH and PH domains in tandem (20.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The DH domain is responsible for catalysis, whereas the PH domain is believed to be implicated in membrane targeting and regulatory functions. Some Dbl family members are specific for an individual Rho family protein, whereas others act on all three subgroups. Although more than 20 Dbl family members have been identified, mechanisms underlying extracellular signal-dependent regulation of Dbl family GEFs remain largely unknown. Interestingly, mSos and Ras-GRFs possess the DH/PH domains as well, implying a role as a GEF for Rho family proteins. Indeed, mSos exhibits Rac-GEF activity when stimulated downstream of the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, although Rac-GEF activity remains latent without upstream signals (21.Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Additionally, Ras-GRF1 functions as a Rac-GEF in response to signals mediated by Gβγ (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), while Ras-GRF2 shows constitutive and Ca2+-stimulated Rac-GEF activity (23.Fan W. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 has been implicated as a crucial step for the induction of Rac-GEF activity (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe that Src elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 in living cells and in a cell-free system, allowing Ras-GRF1 to act as a GEF for Rac. GEF activity toward other Rho family members, Rho and Cdc42, remained undetectable upon Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Ras-GEF activity was unaffected when phosphorylated by Src. Considering the observation that Gβγ induces Rac-specific GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, Src may be involved in G protein-coupled receptor stimulation of Ras-GRF1. The purified recombinant c-Src protein was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies including anti-Ras-GRF antibody (sc-226) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Rac1 antibody (R56220) (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (sc-7020) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (BAbCO), anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.), anti-mouse Ig antibody (55480) (Cappel), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were purchased from commercial suppliers. PP2 and human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB were purchased from Calbiochem and R & D Systems, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Transfection of 293 cells with expression plasmids was carried out as described previously (24.Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The rat Ras-GRF1 cDNA was a generous gift from Larry Feig (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) (6.Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding full-length Ras-GRF1 tagged with a c-Myc epitope at the N-terminal end was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 (25.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generating pCMV5-Myc-Ras-GRF1. pCMV5-Myc-Ras-GRF1(ΔN582) (which encodes c-Myc sequence and amino acids 583–1244 of Ras-GRF1) was generated in a similar way. pCMV5-FLAG-Ras-GRF1 was described previously (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). pCMV5-FLAG-Ras-GRF1(N625) was constructed by subcloning an EcoRI–EcoRI fragment (which encodes FLAG sequence and amino acids 1–625 of Ras-GRF1) into pCMV5. Expression plasmids for Gβ1 and Gγ2 (pCMV5-β1 and pCMV5-γ2, respectively) were previously described (26.Ito A. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding v-Src (kindly provided by Yasuo Fukami (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan)) was also subcloned into pCMV5. The expression plasmid for the wild-type PDGF receptor β was kindly provided by Lewis Williams (Chiron Corp.) (27.Satoh T. Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Kaziro Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3706-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, cDNAs encoding Ras-GRF1, Ras-GRF1(ΔN582), Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 were subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX-PAK-CRIB (an expression plasmid for the c-Myc-tagged Cdc42/Rac interacting binding (CRIB) domain (amino acids 67–150) of rat α p21-activated kinase (PAK) fused to GST) (28.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Kenji Tago. All polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced to confirm the primary structure of encoded proteins. TheE. coli strain BL21 was transformed with the expression plasmid for each GST fusion protein. Protein expression was induced for 4 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside at 30 °C. Harvested cells were suspended and sonicated in lysis buffer A (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.45 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)) and subjected to centrifugation at 23,000 ×g for 30 min. Supernatants were applied to a glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, which was subsequently washed with GST wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). GST fusion proteins were eluted with glutathione buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm glutathione), and dialyzed against dialysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT). After adding 1 mm DTT, samples were stored at −80 °C. Recombinant Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 were overexpressed inE. coli as a GST fusion protein and purified by a glutathione-Sepharose column. GST was subsequently removed by digestion with thrombin, and GTP-binding proteins were further purified as described (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The recombinant Ha-Ras protein was described elsewhere (29.Satoh T. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were dissolved in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate), and the supernatant of centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C was used as a cell lysate. The anti-FLAG antibody M2 (2 μg) or the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (2 μg) was mixed with a rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates were mixed gently with the antibody·protein A-Sepharose complex for 2 h at 4 °C, and precipitates were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Precipitated proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, followed by visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (NEN Life Science Products). GST-Ras-GRF1 and GST-Ras-GRF1(ΔN582) fusion proteins (1 μg) were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 2 units of the recombinant c-Src protein. Assays were carried out in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2) containing 10% (v/v) of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1,850 TBq/mol) or nonradiolabeled ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99, respectively. GDP/GTP exchange assays were performed essentially as described (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 293 cells transfected with various combinations of plasmids were serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.45 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl), dissolved in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Na4P2O7), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (2 μg) and a rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose were added to cell lysates, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer and twice with exchange buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) and subjected to GDP/GTP exchange assays. For [3H]GDP binding assays, immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with Rac1 (200 ng) or Ha-Ras (40 ng) at 30 °C in exchange buffer supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm[3H]GDP (1,265 TBq/mol). After incubation for specified periods, ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2) was added, and samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane, which was subjected to extensive washing with wash buffer. Radioactivity remaining on the filter was quantitated by the liquid scintillation counter. For [3H]GDP release assays, the small GTP-binding protein·[3H]GDP complex was prepared by incubation of each small GTP-binding protein in exchange buffer supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm[3H]GDP (1,265 TBq/mol) for 90 min at 30 °C. 5 mm MgCl2 was added to terminate GDP/GTP exchange reaction. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with the small GTP-binding protein·[3H]GDP complex at 30 °C in exchange buffer supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm GDP. After incubation for specified periods, radioactivity remaining in the complex was quantitated by filter binding assays as described above. Phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST-Ras-GRF1 was obtained by preincubation of GST-Ras-GRF1 with or without the recombinant c-Src protein in the presence of 10 μm nonradiolabeled ATP under conditions described above and subjected to GDP/GTP exchange assays. Affinity precipitation of Rac1 using GST-PAK-CRIB was performed essentially as described elsewhere (28.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). E. coli HB101 cells transformed with pGEX-PAK-CRIB were grown at 25 °C to early logarithmic phase. Expression of GST-PAK-CRIB was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 20 h at 25 °C. Harvested cells were suspended in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4) and disrupted by sonication. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were mixed with the lysate containing 10 μg of GST-PAK-CRIB for 30 min at 4 °C and washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mmMgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. 293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 2 mm Na3VO4), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-PAK-CRIB conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Subsequently, Sepharose beads were washed three times with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT and twice with the same buffer without Nonidet P-40. Precipitated Rac1 was detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against Rac1. As a first step to manifest a possible involvement of Src in the regulation of Ras-GRF1, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 was examined by the use of a transient expression system in 293 cells. FLAG epitope-tagged full-length Ras-GRF1 was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed with v-Src as shown in Fig.1 A. The level of Ras-GRF1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to v-Src as evaluated by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was considerably higher than that induced by Gβγ co-expression (data not shown). A similar construct consisting of the N-terminal 625 amino acids (N625), which contains all known regulatory motifs located within the N-terminal portion, was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in a v-Src-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the Myc epitope-tagged N-terminally truncated mutant ΔN582, which contains only the C-terminally located CDC25 homology domain, and full-length Ras-GRF1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated by v-Src as illustrated in Fig. 1 B. Overall, multiple tyrosine residues seemed to become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon co-expression of v-Src. To show Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 under more physiological conditions, we examined the effect of PDGF because it is well known that Src acts downstream of the PDGF receptor (30.Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 31.Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-type PDGF receptor was transiently expressed with FLAG-tagged Ras-GRF1 in 293 cells, which were subsequently stimulated with PDGF. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, PDGF stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1, which was sensitive to the Src-specific inhibitor PP2. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor remained unaffected upon PP2 treatment. Therefore, Src may be implicated as a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1. On the basis of our previous observations that Gβγ induce Rac-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, we next investigated the effect of Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation on Rac-GEF activity. Myc epitope-tagged full-length Ras-GRF1 was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids, followed by Rac-GEF assays carried out essentially as described previously (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Binding of GDP to recombinant Rac1 and release of GDP from the Rac1·GDP complex under various conditions are shown in Fig. 2, A andB, respectively. Expression levels of Ras-GRF1 in individual transfectants were virtually the same as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). As described previously, Ras-GRF1 recovered from Gβγ-co-expressing cells significantly enhances GDP binding to Rac1, whereas Ras-GRF1 exhibits virtually no Rac-GEF activity when immunoprecipitated from cells ectopically expressing Ras-GRF1 alone (Fig. 2 A). Ras-GRF1 from v-Src-co-expressing cells stimulated GDP binding to Rac1 like Gβγ-stimulated Ras-GRF1 (Fig.2 A). Consistent with this, the release rate of Rac1-bound GDP became enhanced following co-expression of v-Src as in the case of Gβγ (Fig. 2 B). Co-expression of Gβγ and v-Src did not result in additive increase in Rac-GEF activity (data not shown). To further investigate the activation of Rac1 within the cell, we employed a pull-down assay by the use of GST-PAK-CRIB as a probe (28.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, co-expression of Ras-GRF1 with v-Src resulted in synergistically enhanced formation of Rac·GTP. Fig. 3 shows the effect of Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation on GEF activity toward other Rho family members, RhoA and Cdc42. Relative amounts of GDP remaining complexed with respective GTP-binding proteins after incubation with v-Src-stimulated Ras-GRF1 for 60 min are shown. RhoA and Cdc42 were insensitive to Ras-GRF1 stimulated by co-expression of v-Src in contrast with Rac1. These results are analogous to previous observations that co-expression of Gβγ conferred GEF activity toward Rac1, but neither RhoA nor Cdc42, to Ras-GRF1 (22.Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effect of v-Src on GEF activity toward Ha-Ras was examined (Fig. 4). Myc epitope-tagged Ras-GRF1 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to GDP binding assays for Ha-Ras. Ras-GRF1 exhibited constitutive Ras-GEF activity, which was not promoted by co-expression of v-Src in contrast to Gβγ (14.Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15.Mattingly R.R. Saini V. Macara I.G. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Full-length Ras-GRF1 and its N-terminally deleted version ΔN582 were yielded inE. coli as GST fusion proteins, which were partially purified by using standard glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography. These recombinant Ras-GRF1 proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using the recombinant c-Src protein. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, both full-length and N-terminally deleted Ras-GRF1 were phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner. Incorporation of 32P into the GST protein was not detected under similar conditions (data not shown). Lower molecular weight proteins that were phosphorylated by the recombinant c-Src protein are degradation products. To further confirm tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro, reaction mixtures without radioactive ATP were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using"

Their exact functional roles in catalysis have not been clearly defined. Mutant enzymes with two or more of these residues converted to alanines were found to have >90% loss of activity in the relaxation assay with 6 mm Mg(II) present. Mg(II) concentrations (15–20 mm) inhibitory for the wild type enzyme are needed by these double mutants for maximal relaxation activity. The triple mutant D111A/D113A/E115A had no detectable relaxation activity. Mg(II) binding to wild type enzyme resulted in an altered conformation detectable by Glu-C proteolytic digestion. This conformational change was not observed for the triple mutant or for the double mutant D111A/D113A. Direct measurement of Mg(II) bound showed the loss of 1–2 Mg(II) ions for each enzyme molecule due to the mutations. These results demonstrate a functional role for these acidic residues in the binding of Mg(II) to induce the conformational change required for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by the enzyme. The acidic residues Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 of Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I are located near the active site Tyr-319 and are conserved in type IA topoisomerase sequences with counterparts in type IIA DNA topoisomerases.

These results demonstrate a functional role for these acidic residues in the binding of Mg(II) to induce the conformational change required for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by the enzyme. Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I is the best studied representative of the type IA DNA topoisomerases. This class of enzymes includes the bacterial and archeal DNA topoisomerase I and III, reverse gyrase, and yeast and mammalian topoisomerase III, with diverse roles in cellular functions (reviewed in Refs. 1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar and 2.Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mg(II) is required for the interconversion of DNA topological isomers catalyzed by these enzymes. Comparison of their polypeptide sequences showed that the conserved positions include the acidic residues Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A.

Gene. 1998; 210: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When the crystal structure of the 67-kDa N-terminal transesterification domain of the enzyme was published, it was noted (5.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that these three acidic residues in the active site are arranged similarly to the three acidic residues known to coordinate two divalent ions in Klenow fragment (6.Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) that are required for the nucleotidyl transfer activity (7.Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8.Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are found in domain I of the 67-kDa structure (5.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which is similar to the B′ domain of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase II structure (9.Berger J.M Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are corresponding acidic residues that are conserved in type IIA DNA topoisomerases (9.Berger J.M Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Severe loss of DNA relaxation and cleavage activities resulted when one of these acidic triad residues in S. cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase II, Asp-530, was mutated (10.Liu Q Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Another conserved glutamate at Glu-9 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and the aspartates motif DXD at Asp-111 and Asp-113 have been proposed to be conserved motifs in a catalytic domain named Toprim found in type IA and IIA topoisomerases, as well as a number of other nucleotidyl transferases and polynucleotide cleaving activities (11.Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, results of site-directed mutagenesis inE. coli DNA topoisomerase I showed that conversion of a single one of these three conserved acidic residues to alanine did not abolish the relaxation activity (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The exact role of Asp-530 in the catalytic mechanism of yeast topoisomerase II is also not entirely clear (10.Liu Q Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whether these three conserved acidic residues or the DXD motif participate in coordination of divalent ions by the enzyme-DNA complex during removal of negative supercoils remained to be established by biochemical analysis. It is possible that the loss of a single Mg(II) coordinating residue in the active site can be tolerated by the enzyme under reaction assay conditions with >2 mm Mg(II) present (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Double and triple mutants lacking two or more of these acidic residues have now been purified for analysis of their enzymatic activities. The results presented here showed that relaxation activity for double mutants involving Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 requires higher concentrations of Mg(II) for maximal activity, supporting the hypothesis that the carboxylates in these three conserved acidic residues are involved in coordinating at least one of the two Mg(II) required for relaxation activity (13.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (12621): 16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also developed a proteolytic digestion assay using Glu-C endoproteinase to detect the Mg(II)-induced conformational change inE. coli DNA topoisomerase I. The chemical reagents used were either ultrapure or ACS reagent grade. Solutions were prepared with water first deionized with the Barnstead Nanopure system and then passed over a Bio-Rad chelex 100 resin (100–200 mesh sodium form) to remove any contaminating metal ions. Plasmid DNA was purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used for construction of the mutants. The mutants were identified by DNA sequencing. Wild type topoisomerase I was expressed and purified as described (14.Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. DNA Topoisomerase Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 145-151Google Scholar). The double and triple mutants studied here were expressed in E. coli GP200 (gyrA(Nalr)gyrB225Δ(topAcysB)204) (15.Pruss G.J. Franco R.J. Chevalier S.G. Manes S.H. Drlica K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 276-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified with procedures similar to those used for the wild type enzyme. Wild type and mutant enzymes were assayed for relaxation activity in 20 μl with 0.5 μg of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, and the indicated concentration of MgCl2. Incubation was at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 50% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) bromphenol blue. After electrophoresis in a 0.7% agarose gel with TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA), the DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed over UV light. To measure the binding stoichiometry of Mg(II), 2.5 ml of wild type or mutant topoisomerase I (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 2 mmMgCl2 at room temperature (∼25 °C) for 1 h, and then dialyzed with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1m KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 24 h with three buffer changes. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay reagent. Magnesium concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma analysis at Quantitative Technologies Inc. (Whitehouse, NJ). Fluorescence measurements were performed with the Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer at room temperature. The spectral bandwidths were 5 and 10 nm, respectively for excitation (295 nm) and emission. Each data point reported was an average of three determinations. Enzyme was present at 1 μm in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl. All the measurements were corrected for the spectrum of the buffer solution used. To calculate the dissociation constant for Mg(II) binding, the data were analyzed as described previously (16.Bhattacharyya T. Bhattacharyya A. Roy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Wild type or mutant topoisomerase I was dialyzed into 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol with the indicated concentration of MgCl2present. Glu-C sequencing grade endoproteinase (from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) to 10 μg of topoisomerase. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for the indicated length of time and stopped by the addition of equal volume of 2× gel loading buffer for the Laemmli SDS gel (17.Laemmli UK Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in either a 15 or 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Comparison of intensities of the 14-kDa digestion product was carried out using the AlphaImager software. Mass spectroscopy was used to determine the exact molecular mass of the 14-kDa Glu-C digestion product. In-gel digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase and mass mapping were performed by Dr. V. A. Fried at the protein structure facility at New York Medical College. Mass spectroscopy was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Kompact III, Kratos). Expression of the alanine substitution mutants inE. coli GP200 was confirmed by SDS gel electrophoresis of the soluble lysates followed by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The enzymes were purified to >95% homogeneity (Fig.1) by the combination of phosphocellulose, hydroxyapatite, and single-stranded DNA agarose column chromatography. The purified double and triple mutants with the conserved acidic triad in the active site altered by alanine substitutions were diluted serially and assayed for relaxation activity in the presence of 6 mm Mg(II). The results (Fig. 2) showed that their relaxation activities were further diminished under this assay condition when compared with the activities reported for the single mutants (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). No activity was detected for the D111A/D113A double mutant and the D111A/D113A/E115A triple mutant. The D111A/E115A and D113A/E115A double mutants had <10% wild type activity. The mutant with alanine substitution at Glu-9 has been shown to have >90% loss of relaxation activity (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11.Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Double mutants with alanine substitutions at Glu-9 and one of the acidic triad had no detectable relaxation activity at 6 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 2). The effect of increasing Mg(II) concentration on the relaxation activity was compared between the wild type enzyme and the double and triple alanine substitution mutants. Maximal relaxation activity for the double mutants involving the acidic triad was observed at 15 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 3). With wild type enzyme, such high concentration of MgCl2 resulted in inhibition of relaxation activity. Previous studies showed that as little as 1.5–2.5 mm was sufficient for maximal activity for the wild type topoisomerase I (13.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (12621): 16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18.Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 24: 87-96Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Relaxation activity could not be restored for the D111A/D113A/E115A triple mutant even at 20 mm MgCl2, and only partial relaxation of the input DNA can be achieved with the D111A/D113A mutant. The increased Mg(II) concentration had much less of an effect on the relaxation activity of the double mutants involving alanine substitution at Glu-9 and one of the acidic triad residues (Fig. 3). There is a slight enhancement of the relaxation activity of the E9A/D111A and E9A/D113A mutants at 15 mm MgCl2. The E9A/E115A mutant remained inactive. To further compare the activity of the double mutants involving the acidic triad at the high Mg(II) concentration of 15 mm versus the wild type activity at 6 mm Mg(II), time course of the relaxation reaction was monitored. The results (Fig.4) showed that 30 min were required for the DNA incubated with the double mutants to approach maximal relaxation, whereas the wild type enzyme reaction was nearly complete at 10 min. We have previously shown that following incubation of the wild type topoisomerase I with 2 mmMgCl2, around 2 Mg(II) remains bound to each enzyme molecule after dialysis (13.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (12621): 16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar treatment of the acidic triad double and triple mutants followed by inductively coupled plasma analysis of the Mg(II) content (Table I) showed that their Mg(II) binding stoichiometries were reduced, in correlation with the relaxation activities observed. The D111A/D113A/E115A mutant, which did not show any activity under all conditions tested, had a Mg(II) binding stoichiometry barely above the background. The D111A/E115A and D113A/E115A mutants retained binding of around 1 Mg(II) per enzyme molecule, whereas the double mutant D111A/D113A, with the more severely reduced activity, had significantly lower Mg(II) binding stoichiometry.Table IMagnesium content of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I after incubation with 2 mm MgCl2 and dialysis treatmentEnzymeMagnesium contentatom/molecule enzymeWild type2.32 ± 0.03D111A/D113A0.22 ± 0.02D111A/E115A1.11 ± 0.01D113A/E115A1.08 ± 0.01D111A/D113A/E115A0.01 ± 0.01Incubation and dialysis conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average of two determined values were shown here. Open table in a new tab Incubation and dialysis conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average of two determined values were shown here. We have previously shown that Mg(II) binding result in a conformational change in topoisomerase I detectable by decreased tryptophan fluorescence (13.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (12621): 16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fluorescence data (Fig.5 A) as described previously (16.Bhattacharyya T. Bhattacharyya A. Roy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) yielded a dissociation constant of around 0.3 mm for the binding of 2 Mg(II). Titration of similar concentrations of MgCl2 resulted in much lower change in tryptophan fluorescence emission for the double mutants (Fig. 5). Maximal change in fluorescence was achieved with the wild type enzyme at around 2 mm Mg(II), with no further significant drop in fluorescence at up to 20 mm Mg(II). However, a second decrease in fluorescence could be observed for the double mutants D111A/E115A and D113A/E115A between 10–15 mm Mg(II), suggesting the binding of a second Mg(II) at the the higher Mg(II) concentrations. Titration of Mg(II) did not result in significant change in fluorescence emission for the triple mutant even at 20 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 5 B), in agreement with abolishment of Mg(II) binding and relaxation activity for this mutant. Besides monitoring the change in tryptophan fluorescence, we have also developed a proteolytic assay using Glu-C digestion to detect the conformational change in topoisomerase I upon binding of Mg(II). As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of as little as 0.5 mm Mg(II) topoisomerase I resulted in accumulation of a 14-kDa proteolytic fragment not seen in the time course of digestion in the absence of Mg(II). The yield of this 14-kDa product was further enhanced when Mg(II) concentration was increased to 2 mm. The 14-kDa product was not seen when the D111A/D113A and D111A/D113A/E115A mutants were digested with Glu-C in the presence of 2 mm Mg(II) (Fig. 7). For the D111A/E115A and D113A/E115A mutants, the level of the 14-kDa product formed was about 3-fold lower than that from the wild type enzyme. The exact weight of the 14-kDa Glu-C digestion product was determined by mass spectroscopy to be 14,498. This is almost identical to the mass predicted for the Glu-C digestion product from residue 736 to 862 (14,509.5).

When the sequences of these two classes of enzymes are compared, acidic residues corresponding to Glu-9, Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I are found to be conserved (3.Zhu C.-X.

Labigne A. Cameron B. Drlica K. Gene. 1998; 210: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A role for Glu-9 in the breaking and rejoining of DNA strand has been proposed (3.Zhu C.-X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, conversion of one of the acidic triad Asp-111, Asp-113, or Glu-115 to alanine only resulted in partial loss of enzyme activity, with the mutation of Asp-111 having the least effect (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results described here with the double mutants provided support for the hypothesis that Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 bind a divalent ion during catalysis (5.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown a positive relationship between the relaxation activity of E. colitopoisomerase I and the concentration of Mg(II) from 0 to 10 mm, with near saturation of the metal requirement achieved at 2.5 mm (18.Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 24: 87-96Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With double alanine substitutions at the acidic triad, the Mg(II) concentrations required for maximal relaxation activity are significantly higher, to a point that is inhibitory for the wild type enzyme activity. In the presence of DNA phosphates at the active site, the loss of a single Mg(II) coordination sites may well be easily tolerated by the enzyme, whereas the effect of the loss of two Mg(II) coordination sites would be much more severe for the binding affinity of Mg(II) at the position required for relaxation activity. The results shown here suggest that the double mutations D111A/E115A or D113A/E115A primarily affect the binding of the second Mg(II) required for relaxation activity (13.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (12621): 16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the wild type enzyme, the acidic triad may bind a third Mg(II) at 15–20 mm Mg(II) that could lead to inhibition of relaxation activity. Double mutants involving Glu-9 and one of the acidic triads have no detectable relaxation activity at 6 mm Mg(II). Increased Mg(II) concentration had only a slight effect on the relaxation activity. This supports the interpretation that even though lower Mg(II) binding affinity may contribute to the decreased activity seen for the double mutants involving Glu-9, the major reason for activity deficiency is likely to be due to the effect of the Glu-9 mutation related to DNA cleavage/religation (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Glu-C digestion patterns of all of the mutants examined here are quite similar in the absence of Mg(II). Therefore, the alanine substitutions did not lead to a severe change of enzyme folding that may account for the loss of activity. Addition of Mg(II) did not lead to the appearance of a 14-kDa fragment in the Glu-C digestion of the D111A/D113A and D111A/D113A/E115A mutants This supports the role of the acidic triads in binding to Mg(II) and resulting in a conformational change in the enzyme. The effect of double alanine substitutions at Asp-111 and Asp-113 was more severe in both the relaxation assay and the Glu-C digestion assay than the double alanine substitutions at one of these residues and Glu-115. In contrast, the effect of the single alanine substitution on relaxation activity was more severe at Glu-115 than at Asp-111 and Asp-113 (3.Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This indicates that Asp-111 and Asp-113 may have overlapping roles in Mg(II) binding, but elimination of both functional groups would greatly diminish Mg(II) binding. Mutation at Glu-115 may also influence another aspect of enzyme function, aside from binding of Mg(II) and the resulting conformational change. The 14-kDa Glu-C digestion product that is preferentially formed in the presence of Mg(II) corresponds to a cleavage site after Glu-735. The region from amino acid 598 to the C terminus of the protein contains the three Zn(II) binding tetracysteine motifs (19.Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and another 14-kDa fragment that can be formed by tryptic cleavage of topoisomerase I at Arg-744 (20.Beran-Steed R.K. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 14-kDa tryptic fragment has single-strand DNA binding activity on its own (20.Beran-Steed R.K. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21.Zhu C.-X. Samuel M. Pound A. Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Intern. 1995; 35: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar), but the affinity is greatly enhanced when it is linked to the Zn(II) binding motifs (22.Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Zn(II) motifs needed for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA are thus part of a high affinity DNA binding domain. We denote this region from amino acid 598 to the C terminus as the ZD domain. The 67-kDa transesterification domain terminating at amino acid 597 can cleave DNA but has no relaxation activity (23.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We postulate that in the absence of Mg(II), the Glu-C cleavage site at 735 is not accessible because of protein-protein interactions between the 67-kDa transesterification domain and the Zn(II) binding motifs. The last of the 12 Zn(II) coordinating cysteines can be found at position 736. In the presence of Mg(II), protein conformational change involving separation of the transesterification domain and ZD domain takes place to expose the Glu-C cleavage site at Glu-735, forming the observed 14-kDa product from residue 736–862 that is resistant to further Glu-C digestion. Biochemical analysis of the role of the ZD domain in the relaxation reaction 1A. Ahumada and Y.-C. Tse-Dinh, manuscript in preparation. is consistent with this interpretation. The results presented here established a functional role for the acidic triad conserved in type IA and type IIA topoisomerases. The DXD motif residues Asp-111 and Asp-113 are clearly involved in binding of Mg(II) and the resulting enzyme conformational change. Besides additional structural information on the enzyme, identification of other amino acid residues needed for this Mg(II)-induced conformational change would be helpful for elucidation of the dynamic action of the topoisomerase activity.

One of the most relevant receptors described for breast cancer progression is p185 HER2, the transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is encoded by the c-erbB2 proto-oncogene (13.Coussens L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.-C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H. Libermann F.A. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Levinson A. Ullrich A.

McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar). A direct association between tumor aggressiveness and p185 HER2 overexpression has been reported (15.Rilke F. Colnaghi M.I. Cascinelli N. Andreola S. Baldini M.T. Bufalino R. Della Porta G. Ménard S. Pierotti M.A. Testori A. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Like proto-TrkA, p185 HER2 induces an intracellular signaling pathway that leads to stimulation of breast cancer cell growth through activation of the MAPK pathway (16.Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 17.Janes P.W. Daly R.J. DeFazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we analyzed the expression of the high affinity NGF receptor in breast carcinoma cell lines and in human breast carcinoma specimens to determine the molecules involved in NGF-induced signaling, in particular those that cooperate with other tyrosine kinase receptors at the cell surface, such as p185 HER2, in signal transduction.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that NGF-induced activation of breast carcinoma cells growth requires co-operation between the proto-TrkA receptor and p185 HER2 in assembling the signal transduction machinery. In keeping with a previous study (3.Descamps S. Lebourhis X. Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16659-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we detected proto-trkA mRNA expression in all four breast cancer cell lines and 86% of surgical specimens from primary breast carcinomas, raising the possibility that NGF plays a role in breast cancer progression. The absence of detectable gp140 trk in a cell line showing proto-trkA transcript (MDAMB361) is probably due to a rapid degradation of the receptor or a mechanism that inhibits mRNA translation in these breast carcinoma cells. However, preliminary analysis of protein expression so far carried out in 3 of 14 breast carcinoma specimens revealed the presence of gp140 trk in all of the tested cases, indicating the presence in vivoof the membrane receptor. Consistent with the role of NGF in breast carcinoma progression and according with the data reported by Descampset al. (3.Descamps S. Lebourhis X. Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16659-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) is our finding that NGF is mitogenic for human breast cancer cell lines through MAPK activation. However, NGF stimulated growth in only two out of three breast carcinoma cell lines expressing similar levels of proto-TrkA. In one of these cell lines (SKBr3), which express p185 HER2, a membrane tyrosine kinase receptor of a different family (28.King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29.Tagliabue E. Ardini E. Pellegrini R. Campiglio M. Bufalino R. Jeschke M. Groner B. Colnaghi M.I. Ménard S. Br. J.

Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), NGF treatment activated both proto-TrkA and p185 HER2 receptor phosphorylation, stimulating also the intrinsic kinase activity of c-erbB2-encoded receptor. It is possible that NGF binding to its receptor induces receptor clustering at the plasma membrane and consequent activation of p185 HER2 overexpressed by these tumor cells. Indeed, p185 HER2 coprecipitated with gp140 trk, indicating that these molecules are structurally associated on the cell membrane with the possibility of trans-activation. The large amount of p185 HER2 already associated with gp140 trk in cells not treated with NGF, which does not increase upon NGF treatment, suggests a basal co-activation between the two receptors. Such a conclusion is further proved by detection of gp140 trk in p185 HER2 immunoprecipitate. The low detectability of gp140 trk associated with p185 HER2 is probably due to the low level of gp140 trk in comparison with the overexpressed p185 HER2. The disappearance of coprecipitated gp140 trk upon NGF treatment is consistent with the processes of internalization of the NGF receptor after interaction with its own growth factor. The cooperation between the two receptors also explains why K252a, an inhibitor of TrkA tyrosine kinase activity, does not significantly inhibit NGF-induced cell activation, measured as MAPK activation. In fact, the signaling pathways of proto-TrkA and of p185 HER2 are both mediated through MAPK. The lack of K252a inhibition of MAPK and p185 HER2 activation indicates that gp140 trk kinase activity is not required for NGF-mediated p185 HER2 activation. On the contrary, inhibition of MAPK activation by anti-proto-TrkA mAb, which was also found to impair NGF-induced p185 HER2 phosphorylation (data not shown), indicates that proto-TrkA provides the initial signal, since NGF must bind to the extracellular domain of gp140 trk to trigger p185 HER2 activation. This evidence suggests that the two receptors, even if belonging to different families, work together by dimerizing. Consistent with this conclusion are the results of the kinase assay that indicates NGF stimulates the kinase activity of p185 HER2 also upon cell treatment with K252a. However, the possibility remains that interaction between the two receptors occurs through other still unknown molecules. The lack of co-precipitation of gp140 trk with EGF receptor seems to exclude the possibility that NGF, upon interaction with TrkA, induces an aspecific receptor clustering at the plasma membrane and consequently, the heterodimerization and activation of p185 HER2 with receptors of the HER family. The recruitment of p185 HER2, which is highly overexpressed in some breast cancer cells, leads to amplification of the NGF-induced signal. Apparently, only after this amplification does the signal become relevant for tumor cell proliferation and detectable through analysis of MAPK activation.Together, our results show that overexpression of the p185 HER2 receptor is required in generating NGF-induced biological signals relevant for the growth of cells expressing low levels of TrkA, such as breast cancer cells. The observation that down-modulation of p185 HER2 overexpression impairs NGF-induced signaling is consistent with this conclusion.Cross-talk between receptors of the same family has been widely documented (31.Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 32.Barbacid M. Curr. Opin.

However, our data indicate an interaction between receptors of different families, leading to amplification of a growth factor-mediated response. It remains unknown whether this cross-talk represents a physiological interaction or instead occurs only in cells that pathologically overexpress a receptor.The simultaneous expression of p185 HER2 and the NGF receptor, detected in 4 of 12 proto-TrkA-positive breast carcinoma specimens, might confer a proliferative advantage to breast carcinoma cells in the presence of NGF in tissue surrounding the tumor. Although little is known about NGF expression in human breast tissues, our data indicate that this growth factor, produced by targets of sympathetic innervation and found in circulating blood (34.Bonini S.

One of the most relevant receptors described for breast cancer progression is p185 HER2, the transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is encoded by the c-erbB2 proto-oncogene (13.Coussens L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.-C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H. Libermann F.A. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Levinson A. Ullrich A. Science. 1985; 230: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar) and overexpressed in 30% of human primary breast carcinomas (14.Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar). A direct association between tumor aggressiveness and p185 HER2 overexpression has been reported (15.Rilke F. Colnaghi M.I. Cascinelli N. Andreola S. Baldini M.T. Bufalino R. Della Porta G. Ménard S. Pierotti M.A. Testori A. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Like proto-TrkA, p185 HER2 induces an intracellular signaling pathway that leads to stimulation of breast cancer cell growth through activation of the MAPK pathway (16.Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 17.Janes P.W. Daly R.J. DeFazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the expression of the high affinity NGF receptor in breast carcinoma cell lines and in human breast carcinoma specimens to determine the molecules involved in NGF-induced signaling, in particular those that cooperate with other tyrosine kinase receptors at the cell surface, such as p185 HER2, in signal transduction. DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that NGF-induced activation of breast carcinoma cells growth requires co-operation between the proto-TrkA receptor and p185 HER2 in assembling the signal transduction machinery. In keeping with a previous study (3.Descamps S. Lebourhis X. Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16659-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we detected proto-trkA mRNA expression in all four breast cancer cell lines and 86% of surgical specimens from primary breast carcinomas, raising the possibility that NGF plays a role in breast cancer progression. The absence of detectable gp140 trk in a cell line showing proto-trkA transcript (MDAMB361) is probably due to a rapid degradation of the receptor or a mechanism that inhibits mRNA translation in these breast carcinoma cells. However, preliminary analysis of protein expression so far carried out in 3 of 14 breast carcinoma specimens revealed the presence of gp140 trk in all of the tested cases, indicating the presence in vivoof the membrane receptor. Consistent with the role of NGF in breast carcinoma progression and according with the data reported by Descampset al. (3.Descamps S. Lebourhis X. Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16659-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) is our finding that NGF is mitogenic for human breast cancer cell lines through MAPK activation. However, NGF stimulated growth in only two out of three breast carcinoma cell lines expressing similar levels of proto-TrkA. In one of these cell lines (SKBr3), which express p185 HER2, a membrane tyrosine kinase receptor of a different family (28.King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29.Tagliabue E. Ardini E. Pellegrini R. Campiglio M. Bufalino R. Jeschke M. Groner B. Colnaghi M.I. Ménard S. Br. J.

Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), NGF treatment activated both proto-TrkA and p185 HER2 receptor phosphorylation, stimulating also the intrinsic kinase activity of c-erbB2-encoded receptor. It is possible that NGF binding to its receptor induces receptor clustering at the plasma membrane and consequent activation of p185 HER2 overexpressed by these tumor cells. Indeed, p185 HER2 coprecipitated with gp140 trk, indicating that these molecules are structurally associated on the cell membrane with the possibility of trans-activation. The large amount of p185 HER2 already associated with gp140 trk in cells not treated with NGF, which does not increase upon NGF treatment, suggests a basal co-activation between the two receptors. Such a conclusion is further proved by detection of gp140 trk in p185 HER2 immunoprecipitate. The low detectability of gp140 trk associated with p185 HER2 is probably due to the low level of gp140 trk in comparison with the overexpressed p185 HER2. The disappearance of coprecipitated gp140 trk upon NGF treatment is consistent with the processes of internalization of the NGF receptor after interaction with its own growth factor. The cooperation between the two receptors also explains why K252a, an inhibitor of TrkA tyrosine kinase activity, does not significantly inhibit NGF-induced cell activation, measured as MAPK activation. In fact, the signaling pathways of proto-TrkA and of p185 HER2 are both mediated through MAPK. The lack of K252a inhibition of MAPK and p185 HER2 activation indicates that gp140 trk kinase activity is not required for NGF-mediated p185 HER2 activation. On the contrary, inhibition of MAPK activation by anti-proto-TrkA mAb, which was also found to impair NGF-induced p185 HER2 phosphorylation (data not shown), indicates that proto-TrkA provides the initial signal, since NGF must bind to the extracellular domain of gp140 trk to trigger p185 HER2 activation. This evidence suggests that the two receptors, even if belonging to different families, work together by dimerizing. Consistent with this conclusion are the results of the kinase assay that indicates NGF stimulates the kinase activity of p185 HER2 also upon cell treatment with K252a. However, the possibility remains that interaction between the two receptors occurs through other still unknown molecules. The lack of co-precipitation of gp140 trk with EGF receptor seems to exclude the possibility that NGF, upon interaction with TrkA, induces an aspecific receptor clustering at the plasma membrane and consequently, the heterodimerization and activation of p185 HER2 with receptors of the HER family. The recruitment of p185 HER2, which is highly overexpressed in some breast cancer cells, leads to amplification of the NGF-induced signal. Apparently, only after this amplification does the signal become relevant for tumor cell proliferation and detectable through analysis of MAPK activation.Together, our results show that overexpression of the p185 HER2 receptor is required in generating NGF-induced biological signals relevant for the growth of cells expressing low levels of TrkA, such as breast cancer cells. The observation that down-modulation of p185 HER2 overexpression impairs NGF-induced signaling is consistent with this conclusion.Cross-talk between receptors of the same family has been widely documented (31.Alroy I.

However, our data indicate an interaction between receptors of different families, leading to amplification of a growth factor-mediated response. It remains unknown whether this cross-talk represents a physiological interaction or instead occurs only in cells that pathologically overexpress a receptor.The simultaneous expression of p185 HER2 and the NGF receptor, detected in 4 of 12 proto-TrkA-positive breast carcinoma specimens, might confer a proliferative advantage to breast carcinoma cells in the presence of NGF in tissue surrounding the tumor. Although little is known about NGF expression in human breast tissues, our data indicate that this growth factor, produced by targets of sympathetic innervation and found in circulating blood (34.Bonini S.

It was earlier purified to homogeneity from human placenta. We determined the amino acid sequences of several internal peptides and with their aid found an expressed sequence tag clone with the complete cDNA for a murine enzyme of 23.9 kDa. The DNA was cloned into appropriate plasmids and introduced into Escherichia coli and ecdyson-inducible 293 and V79 cells. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity from transformed E. coli and was found to be identical with the native enzyme. After induction with ponasterone, the transfected mammalian cells showed a gradual increase of enzyme activity. A human expressed sequence tag clone contained a large part of the cDNA of the human enzyme but lacked the 5′-end corresponding to 51 amino acids of the murine enzyme. Several polymerase chain reaction-based approaches to find this sequence met with no success. A mouse/human hybrid cDNA that had substituted the missing human 5′-end with the corresponding mouse sequence coded for a fully active enzyme. 5′(3′)-Deoxyribonucleotidase is a ubiquitous enzyme in mammalian cells whose physiological function is not known.

Smith I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and in mouse fibroblasts (2.Magnusson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast to many other enzymes involved in the synthesis of DNA precursors or DNA (3.Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), the enzyme did not show any major variations during the cell cycle (2.Magnusson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Partially purified preparations of the enzyme were studied by Fritzson (summarized in Ref. 4.Fritzson P. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1977; 16: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Besides being a 5′-nucleotidase, the enzyme also dephosphorylated the 2′(3′)-phosphates of both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides and was stimulated “allosterically” by purine deoxyribonucleosides. In 1990 Höglund and Reichard (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained the human enzyme in homogenous form after a 15,000-fold purification from placenta. The protein had an apparent molecular weight of 45,000 and a subunit mass of 22 kDa. Its catalytic properties were similar to those described earlier for partially purified preparations of the rat enzyme, showing 15–30-fold higher relativeV max/K m ratios for 5′-deoxyribonucleotides than 5′-ribonucleotides with the following preferences for various bases: Hyp > Ura > Gua > Thy > Ade > Cyt. The pure enzyme also hydrolyzed 2′(3′)-nucleotides, establishing that a single protein is responsible for the earlier described activity against both 5′- and 2′(3′)-nucleotides. In the latter case there was no preference for deoxyribose over ribose, and theV max/K m ratios were actually slightly higher than for 5′-deoxyribonucleotides. Unlike other 5′-nucleotidases the enzyme was neither allosterically activated nor inhibited by ATP. The enzyme has been given several different names 1Fritzson has employed the following names in different publications: 5′(3′)-nucleotidase, deoxyinosine-activated nucleotidase, deoxyriboside-activated nucleotidase, and deoxynucleotidase. The name 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase used here stresses the preference of the enzyme for deoxyribonucleotides as well as the ability to dephosphorylate both 5′- and 3′-nucleotides. ; here it is called 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase, abbreviated dNT.2 dNTs are present in most mammalian cells. Lymphoid cells were reported to show a particularly high activity (6.Tjernshaugen H. Fritzson P. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Pure dNT clearly differs in catalytic properties and protein nature from two other ubiquitous 5′-nucleotidases that have attained more attention over the years. One of them is a membrane-bound ectonucleotidase (7.Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 8.Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which in minor amounts has also been found in the cytoplasm (9.Piec G. Le Hir M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The other enzyme is a purely cytosolic nucleotidase, named high K m-nucleotidase (10.Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 105B: 13-19Google Scholar, 11.Spychala J. Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18759-18765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a preference for hydroxypurine nucleotides. The cDNAs of both these enzyme have been cloned (12.Misumi Y. Ogata S. Ohkubo K. Hirose S. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13.Oka J. Matsumoto A. Hokosawa Y Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Valentine W.N. Brockway R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) described the presence in erythrocytes of two “isozymes” of cytoplasmic 5′-nucleotidase. A deficiency in one form was disease-related. The two forms were subsequently separated chromatographically and named (17.Hirono A. Fujii H. Natori H. Kurokawa I. Miwa S. Br. J. Hematol. 1987; 65: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) P5N-I and P5N-II. P5N-I was the anemia-related enzyme, and P5N-II was suggested to be a dNT. Our interest in the dNT stems from earlier work concerning the regulation of intracellular dNTP pools by substrate cycles (3.Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 18.Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ferraro P. Borella S. Bonvini P. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16677-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that such cycles, relying on the interplay between a deoxynucleoside kinase and a nucleotidase, participate in the regulation of dNTP pools. The nature of the nucleotidase(s) participating in such cycles is unknown, whereas kinases were identified from isotope flow experiments with genetically manipulated cultured cells (19.Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4218-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20.Bianchi V. Ferraro P. Borella S. Bonvini P. Reichard P. J. Biol.

We intend to carry out similar experiments with nucleotidases. To this purpose we now describe the cloning of the cDNA for the murine dNT as well as initial experiments resulting in the transformation of Escherichia coli and cultured cells with the cloned cDNA. [3H]dUMP for routine assays of dNT and [3H]thymidine for phosphotransferase assays were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The latter contained a small amount of a radioactive impurity that interfered with the assay and was removed by reversed phase HPLC. Nonlabeled nucleotides were from Sigma. Zeocin was from Invitrogen, and G418 was from Calbiochem. E. coli DH5α was used for routine transformations and plasmid preparations according to standard procedures (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS from sequences subcloned in pET20b (Novagen). The bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani liquid medium with the appropriate antibiotics and plated on Luria-Bertani 1% agarose. Plasmids used in this work are described in Table I.

Absence of mycoplasma contamination was periodically ascertained by the Gen-Probe Mycoplasma T. C. Rapid Detection System (GEN-PROBE Inc., San Diego, CA). The protein was purified from human placenta as described earlier (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, crude extracts were precipitated between 35 and 55% ammonium sulfate saturation, followed by chromatography on DE52 (Whatman), on Phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and finally on MonoQ HR5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After each step the fractions with high dNT activity were combined and concentrated in Centricon-10 (Amicon) tubes before the next step. The final material gave a major Coomassie-stained band at 27 kDa together with several minor bands after electrophoresis on a denaturing SDS gel. The major band was excised and treated in situ (23.Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Wittman-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing.

We made a BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base to identify human and murine sequences homologous to the dNT peptides. Several human and murine EST clones were homologous to all the seven peptides. The clones deposited by the I.M.A.G.E. consortium (24.Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) were obtained from Research Genetics and double-strand resequenced in an Automatic Laser Fluorescent sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Gene Jokey program was used for sequence alignment and analysis. The complete murine cDNA and a 5′-truncated cDNA starting at the second ATG at nucleotides 37–39 were subcloned in pET20b giving plasmids p1M-dNT and p2M-dNT. The cDNA was amplified from EST clone AA261077 by PCR with forward primer 1M (5′-CATACATATGGCGGTGAAGCGGCC-3′) located to the first ATG of the cDNA and reverse primer 4M (5′-CTGAGGATCCTGGGAGGAGCCGGAAAG-3′) located to nucleotides 677–697 in the 3′-untranslated region. The primers introduced a 5′ NdeI and a 3′ BamHI restriction site, respectively. The 5′-truncated cDNA was amplified by a similar procedure using forward primer 2M (5′-CATACATATGGACGGCGTGCTAGCTGA-3′) located to the second ATG. The two amplified products were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), cut with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into the bacterial expression vector pET20b. A hybrid murine/human cDNA sequence was prepared and cloned as aNdeI-BamHI fragment in pET20b (plasmid pHyb-mh). The 5′-end of the hybrid sequence was obtained from mouse EST cloneAA261077 amplified with primer 1M and reverse primer CR17 (5′-CCAGGTCGGGCCGCAGGGCGCGGTA-3′). The human sequence was obtained from EST clone AA122046 whose 5′-end corresponds to nucleotide 154 of the mouse sequence. This clone contains a noncoding 80-bp insertion after 189 bp. A first PCR was run with forward primer CR16 (5′-TACCGCGCCCTGCGGCCCGACCTGG-3′) and reverse primer CR18 (5′-CGGTGGATCCTGTGGCCTGCCCTTCC-3′), and the product was spliced to the mouse 5′-end with primers 1M and CR18. This first hybrid product was used as the template for a second series of PCRs that had the aim of deleting the 80-bp insertion. In this case the first two PCRs were run with primers 1M and CR19 (5′-CCAGCGGTACTTCTCACCCACACAGTG-3′) and primers CR20 (5′-AGAAGTACCGCTGGGTGGAGC-3′) and CR18, respectively, and the two products were spliced together with primers 1M and CR18. For expression of the cloned dNT, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) plysS. After growth of the culture at 37 °C, overexpression of the proteins was induced for 3 h with 0.4 mm IPTG. To construct the ecdyson-inducible mammalian expression vector pdNT-m1, the murine dNT coding sequence was amplified by PCR from EST cloneAA261077 with forward primer 6M (5′-CATCAAGCTTTGCGGAGACACCG-3′) located at nucleotides −22 to −10 and reverse primer 4M. The amplification product was ligated as a BamHI-HindIII fragment into plasmid pIND (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation into cells of clone 293-2-100 (23.Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Wittman-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer, Berlin1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar) and clone V79-20-11. These clones constitutively produce an intracellular ecdyson receptor that can be activated by the synthetic ecdyson analog ponasterone A (Invitrogen). Clone V79-20-11 was obtained from V79 cells transfected with plasmid pVgRXR (Invitrogen) and selected in the presence of 350 μg/ml zeocin. Inducible clones of 293 and V79 cells overexpressing the murine dNT were isolated by selection with 600 and 800 μg/ml G418, respectively, and tested with 4 μm ponasterone A. To test the time dependence of dNT induction, parallel cultures of an inducible clone from each cell line (293-dNT14 and V79-dNT15) were plated at 0.15 and 0.07 × 106 cells/5-cm dish, respectively. After 6 h, 4 μm ponasterone A was added to the medium. At 48 h half of the cultures were shifted to inducer-free medium and grown for 2 more days. 48 h after the start of induction dNT activity was measured in the crude cellular extracts (14.Rampazzo C. Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Johansson M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at 24-h intervals. Plasmid pdNT-GFP was obtained by subcloning the dNT coding sequence amplified by PCR with forward primer 6M and reverse primer 11M (5′-CGTAGGATCCCACAGGCTGGCTCGC-3′) as aBamHI-HindIII fragment into plasmid pIND-GFP (15.Gazziola C. Moras M. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Verin R. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This inducible construct codes for a fusion polypeptide of 52 kDa where the dNT is fused via a 7-amino acid linker to the N terminus of the GFP. This plasmid was used in transient transfection experiments to examine the subcellular localization of dNT. A human multiple-tissue blot (CLONTECH) containing mRNA from heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas was probed according to standard procedures with a [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA obtained from EST clone AA404645. After induction with IPTG, a 2-liter culture was centrifuged, and the bacterial pellet (5.5 g) was suspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing, 3 ml of 10% streptomycin sulfate and 0.5 ml of 50 mmphenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride were added, and the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The clear supernatant solution was purified by the first three steps (ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DE52 and Phenyl-Sepharose) of the described procedure, resulting in a 40-fold purification of the enzyme. This preparation was used to determine the substrate specificity and other catalytic properties of the recombinant enzyme. In the routine radiochemical method (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) [3H]dUMP (500 cpm/nmol) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 0.02 ml with 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmTris-maleate, pH 6.0, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was terminated by addition of l ml of ice-cold 50 mm acetic acid, and the mixture was passed through a 2-ml column of AG1-X2 to retain unreacted nucleotides. The column was washed with 2 ml of 50 mm acetic acid. The flow-through and wash fractions were combined, and their total radioactivity was determined and used to calculate the amount of deoxyuridine formed by dephosphorylation of dUMP. Dephosphorylation of nucleotides other than dUMP was measured with a sensitive colorimetric assay from the formation of inorganic phosphate. In the experiments determining substrate specificity 5 mmof the various nucleotides were incubated in 0.05 ml for 30 min as described for the radiochemical assay. The reaction was terminated by addition of 18 volume of 1.2 mH2SO4, and after centrifugation, inorganic phosphate was determined (25.Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis J.G. Evangelopoulos D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This method was also used for the determination of kinetic parameters. In this case the time of incubation ranged from 5 to 15 min to assure linearity of the reaction. In all experiments less than 20% of the nucleotide was dephosphorylated. The different constants were obtained from regression analyses of Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots. The colorimetric assay was used also to measure stimulation of UMP-3′ and dUMP-5′ dephosphorylation by 1 and 4 mm concentrations of various nucleosides (dIno, dGuo, dThd, dUrd, Ino, Guo and 2′, 3′-dideoxyinosine). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of product formed during 1 min. Specific activity is units/mg of protein, determined colorimetrically (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard. We looked for the transfer of the phosphate group from 2 mm dUMP-5′ or UMP-3′ as donor to highly radioactive 10 mm [3H]thymidine (5000 cpm/nmol) as acceptor. Incubations were as described for the radiochemical assay with 1.5 or 15 milliunits of enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml, and samples were removed for assay after 5, 10, and 20 min. The reaction was terminated by immersion of the samples in a boiling water bath and centrifugation. The samples were injected into a Partisil SAX (Whatman) HPLC column and eluted with 20 mmammonium phosphate, pH 3.7. Samples (1 ml) were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. This method separated all radioactive thymidine cleanly from 5′- and 3′-dTMP. Compared with controls, no radioactivity was found in the nucleotide region. Our strategy was to obtain sequences of random internal peptides of the dNT to be able to identify corresponding DNA sequences in the GenBankTM data base. The 1700-fold purified preparation of the enzyme was reduced, carboxymethylated, and electrophoresed on a denaturing 12% SDS gel. The following seven internal peptides were identified (23.Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Wittman-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer, Berlin1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar) from a prominent 27-kDa band: ALRPDLADK, VASVYE, TSPLLK, YHHSVGEK, XRWVEQHLG, XVERIILTRPK, and TVVLGDLLIDDK. A search of the GenBankTM data base revealed several murine cDNAs matching the peptide sequences obtained from the purified human dNT. The clone with accession number AA261077 matched all the seven peptides and appeared to contain the complete coding sequence for the nucleotidase (Fig. 1). Two potential initiation codons separated by 33 nucleotides were present. The deduced amino acid sequence starting at the first ATG codon and ending at a TGA stop codon at nucleotides 601–603 corresponds to a 200-amino acid-long polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 23,892 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.0. The cDNA sequence contains 28 bp upstream the first ATG and 167 bp downstream the stop codon, with a polyadenylation signal at positions 765–770 followed by a poly(A) tail. EST clone AA261077 was sequenced completely and used to construct the different expression vectors for the experiments. A BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base revealed a number of human sequences coding for some or all the identified dNT peptides, but in this case the situation was more complex than with the mouse cDNA. All the human cDNAs lacked the 181 bp present at the 5′-end of the mouse cDNA, and some contained intervening stretches of nucleotides that produced frameshifts. The amino acid sequence deduced from the incomplete human cDNA was 83% identical to the deduced mouse sequence (Fig. 1). To determine the size and expression pattern of the human dNT mRNA, we performed a multiple tissue Northern blot analysis. The blot revealed two major mRNAs of 1.5 and 1 kilobase in all the human tissues tested. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas. On the basis of these results we tried several different PCR-based approaches to identify the missing 5′-end of the human cDNA. Without success we used commercial cDNA libraries from pancreas and brain and mRNAs from skeletal muscle and placenta. Specific amplification products were always truncated at about the same 5′ position present in the EST clones available in the data base. Starting from each of the two potential initiation codons present in the murine cDNA (Fig. 1), we prepared two separate constructs in the bacterial expression vector pET20b. Plasmid p1M-dNT started at the first potential initiation codon, and p2M-dNT started at the second one. The two corresponding proteins were overexpressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)plysS. After induction with IPTG, the SDS-lysed bacteria containing p2M-dNT, but not those containing p1M-dNT, gave a strong band at 25 kDa on denaturing gels, in a position expected from the truncated dNT (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Extracts of bacteria prepared with Tris-maleate buffer did not show this band (data not shown), suggesting that a major part of the truncated enzyme was present in inclusion bodies. Enzyme analyses of buffer extracts from IPTG-induced bacteria harboring p1M-dNT showed a high dNT activity (specific activity, 4–7 units/mg protein), whereas extracts from bacteria harboring p2M-dNT showed no increase over the activity found in noninduced controls (specific activity, <0.01 unit/mg). The pure enzyme was reported to have a specific activity of 170 (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that dNT represented approximately 3% of the soluble protein in p1M-dNT extracts. Our results also show that the first ATG is the correct initiation codon for the enzyme as the truncated protein, starting at the second initiation codon, lacked enzyme activity. After purification, the recombinant protein had a specific activity of 300–400 units/mg of protein and gave a single band at 27 kDa after electrophoresis on denaturing gels (Fig. 2, lane 5). The pure human dNT from placenta (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a partially purified enzyme from rat liver (1.Fritzson P. Smith I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27.Fritzson P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) both had the following catalytic properties that distinguish them from other nucleotidases: (i) an acid pH optimum between 6.0 and 6.5; (ii) a preference for 5′-deoxyribonucleotides over 5′-ribonucleotides; (iii) the ability to dephosphorylate certain 2′- and 3′-ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides; and (iv) stimulation of this dephosphorylation by some deoxyribonucleosides. We tested the recombinant enzyme for these properties. Table II shows the substrate specificity of the recombinant dNT tested at a high concentration (5 mm) of 5′-, 3′- and 2′-ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. For comparison published values for the rat and human enzymes obtained under identical conditions of incubation are also given. With one exception, the relative rates of dephosphorylation found with our enzyme agree well with the published values. The exception is dCMP, which gives a higher activity with the recombinant enzyme. We found similar values with two separate preparations of dCMP. Solutions of dCMP showed the correct UV spectrum, excluding the possibility that contamination with dUMP was responsible for our results.Table IISubstrate specificity of 5′ (3′)-deoxyribonucleotidaseSubstrateRecombinant mouse dNTNative rat dNTNative human dNTdUMP-5′100100100dTMP-5′659255dGMP-5′458181dCMP-5′15.70.90.7dAMP-5′9.516.712.8UMP-5′16.39.28.9IMP-5′10.81221.5GMP-5′4.39.24.5AMP-5′1.30.90.4CMP-5′01.80dTMP-3′5873UMP-3′3545UMP-2′11.429.6GMP-2′0.80.9CMP-3′0.33.7The recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of 370 units/mg with dUMP-5′ (100).

In a series of experiments we determined the influence of substrate concentration of the various 5′-deoxyribonucleotides and UMP-3′. TableIII gives K m andV max values obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots.K m values were in the mm range. The substrate efficiency (V max/K m) for the various deoxyribonucleotides was highest for dUMP and dTMP, followed by dGMP, dAMP, and finally dCMP. Also UMP-3′ was an excellent substrate. The data are in good agreement with published K m values for the rat liver enzyme (1.Fritzson P. Smith I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The dephosphorylation of UMP-3′ was stimulated 2-fold by deoxyinosine or deoxyguanosine but not by the correspondent ribonucleosides. Also thymidine, but not deoxyuridine, gave a small effect (1.7-fold at 4 mm). In contrast, the dephosphorylation of the 5′-deoxyribonucleotide dUMP was not stimulated by any of the tested nucleosides. These results are in good agreement with the earlier data obtained with the native enzymes (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Fritzson P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Finally the pH activity profile for the recombinant enzyme showed a relatively sharp acid pH optimum between 5.5 and 6.0 for dUMP. With UMP-3′, the curve was broader and slightly displaced toward neutrality (data not shown). Some 5′-nucleotidases catalyze not only the dephosphorylation of nucleotides but also a transfer of the phosphate group from one nucleotide donor to a second nucleoside acceptor. The high K mnucleotidases belong to this category (10.Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 105B: 13-19Google Scholar), and also the two 5′-nucleotidases from erythrocytes (P5N-I and P5N-II) were reported to have phosphotransferase activity (28.Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Pure dNT isolated from placenta was reported to be devoid of phosphotransferase activity (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now tested the recombinant enzyme for the ability to transfer the phosphate group from dUMP-5′ or UMP-3′ to labeled thymidine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In these experiments we also measured simultaneously the dephosphorylation of the presumptive phosphate donors. The sensitivity of the method was such that we would easily have detected an amount of isotope transfer corresponding to 0.5% of the nucleotidase activity. This was not the case, and we conclude that the recombinant dNT lacks phosphotransferase activity. A mouse/human hybrid cDNA starting with the 5′-end of the murine cDNA (nucleotides 1–153) fused to the human cDNA coding for the entire amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 1 (plasmid pHyb-mh) was transformed into E. coli. Production of the corresponding hybrid murine/human dNT was induced with IPTG. Extracts of the bacteria had a dNT specific activity of 3 units/mg of protein, similar to that of extracts from bacteria transformed with the murine cDNA. The ecdyson-inducible mammalian expression system (29.No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) was used to create stably transfected cell lines in which the dNT level could be modulated by a synthetic ecdyson analog such as ponasterone A. Seven human 293 and five hamster V79 clones were isolated whose dNT activity was increased 2–7-fold after 24 h of induction with 4 μm ponasterone A. One clone from each cell line (293-dNT14 and V79-dNT15) was chosen for the following experiment. To study the time course of induction, cultures of each clone were treated with 4 μm ponasterone for up to 96 h. Cell growth and the level of dNT activity in the crude cellular extracts (Fig. 3, A and B) were measured at 24-h intervals. In both cell lines dNT activity increased with time and eventually reached a plateau. In the human 293 cells enzyme activity increased rapidly and showed a final 10–15-fold increase, whereas in hamster V79 cells the increase was slower and after 96 h was less than 3-fold. Cell growth was unaffected in both cell lines (data not shown). After 48 h induction half of the cultures were shifted to medium without ponasterone and grown for 2 more days. During this period dNT activity declined (Fig. 3,A and B). The higher level of induction in 293-dNT14 cells made possible a closer analysis of the decrease in enzyme activity (Fig. 3 C). After removal of ponasterone the total amount of enzyme in the culture remained constant, suggesting that dNT induction was rapidly reversible but that, once formed, the enzyme remained in the culture. The decrease in dNT specific activity in Fig. 3 A after removal of the inducer then depended on the appearance of cells in the culture that no longer overproduced the enzyme. During the chase period cell number increased 4-fold, and dNT specific activity decreased from 125 to 25. To investigate whether the dNT protein contains any subcellular localization signal, we used a cell line (293-2-100) that expresses the ecdyson receptor and transfected the cells with a plasmid (pdNT-GFP) in which the dNT coding sequence is fused in frame 5′ to the sequence for GFP. The transfected cells fluoresced both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, similar to control cells transfected with a plasmid (pIND-GFP) that codes for the GFP only. This suggests that the dNT polypeptide is not targeted to any specific organelle. From the sequences of seven internal peptides of human dNT we could identify a mouse EST clone containing the complete coding sequence of the mouse dNT. After identification of the correct starting ATG codon, we transferred the DNA to appropriate plasmids and used those to transform E. coli and to transfect mammalian cells. In both cases the cells overproduced dNT activity after induction. The recombinant enzyme obtained by purification fromE. coli had properties similar to those published for dNT purified from human (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or rat cells (4.Fritzson P. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1977; 16: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Also the molecular mass of 23.9 kDa calculated from the deduced amino acid composition is in good agreement with the polypeptide mass of 22 kDa reported for the pure placenta enzyme. Altogether, the evidence is compelling that the recombinant murine enzyme is indeed identical to native dNT. We were not able to clone the complete cDNA for the human dNT by the same approach. All available human EST clones had no 5′-ATG starting codon and apparently lacked approximately 180 bp at the 5′-end present in the murine sequence. Various PCR-based approaches to obtain the 5′-end were unsuccessful, suggesting that the native mRNA contains some particularly unfavorable secondary structure that interfered with first strand in vitro synthesis even by reverse transcriptases working at high temperatures. A hybrid murine/human dNT in which the missing amino acids of the human enzyme were substituted by the corresponding 5′-end of the murine enzyme showed good activity in the routine nucleotidase assay. Together with the high degree of identity between the two polypeptides (Fig. 1), this strongly suggests that the known part of the human cDNA codes for the correct human dNT sequence. Our results strengthen the conclusion (17.Hirono A. Fujii H. Natori H. Kurokawa I. Miwa S. Br. J. Hematol. 1987; 65: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that P5N-II, one of the two forms (P5N-I and P5N-II) of cytoplasmic nucleotidases in human erythrocytes, is a dNT. Both forms were recently purified to apparent homogeneity (28.Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Surprisingly the relatedness between P5N-II and the human placenta enzyme (5.Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not mentioned. It was claimed that both forms had phosphotransferase activity, whereas our recombinant enzyme, as well as the human placenta dNT, was not a phosphotransferase. Further work is required to clarify this discrepancy. The lack of phosphotransferase activity suggests that the stimulation of nucleotidase activity by some deoxynucleosides observed with the recombinant and native dNT does not depend on transfer of phosphate from UMP to the activator nucleoside. The underlying mechanism may be uncovered once the tridimensional structure of the dNT is solved. The availability of cloned mammalian cell lines that can be induced to give a graded increase of the intracellular concentration of dNT adds an important tool to future experiments concerning the nature of the nucleotidase participating in substrate cycles. Earlier work has provided such cell lines for the high K mnucleotidase (14.Rampazzo C. Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Johansson M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15.Gazziola C. Moras M. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Verin R. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as for the ectonucleotidase (8.Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 30.Resta R. Hooker S.W. Laurent A.B. Shuck J.K. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Koretzky G.A. Thompson L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1046-1053PubMed Google Scholar). There is now a complete set of cell lines overproducing members of each of the three major groups of 5′-nucleotidases, and it should be possible to carry out the required physiological isotope flow experiments to establish the relative importance of the three groups for the regulation of DNA precursors. In addition to their function in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, dNTs are also of interest in connection with the use of nucleoside analogs in the therapy of viral and neoplastic diseases. These drugs must be phosphorylated to nucleotides before they exert their clinical effectvia inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. dNT may counteract the attainment of an efficient concentration of the nucleotide, and the affinity of the phosphorylated analog for dNT may be one parameter to be considered in the choice of suitable analogs. An example of such a situation was recently found 3J. Balzarini, S. Aquaro, T. Knispel, C. Rampazzo, V. Bianchi, C.-F. Perno, E. De Clercq, and C. Meier, manuscript in preparation. for two nucleoside analogs used to treat HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2024197595,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (type III) (eNOS) was reported to form an inhibitory complex with the bradykinin receptor B2 (B2R) from which the enzyme is released in an active form upon receptor activation (Ju, H., Venema, V. J., Marrero, M. B., and Venema, R. C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 24025–24029). Using a synthetic peptide derived from the known inhibitory sequence of the B2R (residues 310–329) we studied the interaction of the receptor with purified eNOS and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (type I) (nNOS). The peptide inhibited formation of l-citrulline by eNOS and nNOS with IC50values of 10.6 ± 0.4 μm and 7.1 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. Inhibition was not due to an interference of the peptide with l-arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin binding. The NADPH oxidase activity of nNOS measured in the absence of l-arginine was inhibited by the peptide with an IC50 of 3.7 ± 0.6 μm, but the cytochrome c reductase activity of the enzyme was much less susceptible to inhibition (IC50 >0.1 mm). Steady-state absorbance spectra of nNOS recorded during uncoupled NADPH oxidation showed that the heme remained oxidized in the presence of the synthetic peptide consisting of amino acids 310–329 of the B2R, whereas the reduced oxyferrous heme complex was accumulated in its absence. These data suggest that binding of the B2R 310–329 peptide blocks flavin to heme electron transfer. Co-immunoprecipitation of B2R and nNOS from human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with human nNOS suggests that the B2R may functionally interact with nNOS in vivo. This interaction of nNOS with the B2R may recruit the enzyme to allow for the effective coupling of bradykinin signaling to the nitric oxide pathway. Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (type III) (eNOS) was reported to form an inhibitory complex with the bradykinin receptor B2 (B2R) from which the enzyme is released in an active form upon receptor activation (Ju, H., Venema, V. J., Marrero, M. B., and Venema, R. C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 24025–24029).

Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar and 2.Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar): nNOS (type I), eNOS (type III), and inducible NOS (type II). nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed and Ca2+-dependent, whereas inducible NOS is cytokine-inducible and Ca2+-independent. All three isozymes are homodimers, with each subunit consisting of two domains, an amino-terminal oxygenase domain containing a heme group and binding sites for the substrate l-arginine and the cofactor BH4 and a carboxyl-terminal reductase domain with binding sites for NADPH and the flavins FAD and FMN. The two domains are joined by a binding region for CaM that has a dual function, activating electron transfer both from NADPH to the flavins and from the reductase to the oxygenase domain (3.Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although inducible NOS binds CaM in nominally Ca2+-free solutions (<30 nm), free Ca2+ in the micromolar range is essential for CaM binding to the constitutive isozymes, so that a rise in intracellular free Ca2+ is a key signal for ligand-induced activation of nNOS and eNOS (for review see Ref. 1.Mayer B. Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells, fluid shear stress triggers an alternative, apparently Ca2+-independent pathway of eNOS activation (for review see Refs. 4.Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Busse R. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar and 5.Busse R. Fleming I. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that shear stress leads to activation of protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B) (6.Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), which catalyzes phosphorylation of a specific serine residue of eNOS (S1179 in the human isoform) resulting in Ca2+-independent activation of the enzyme (7.Fulton D.

The Ca2+-dependent activation of eNOS in response to ligands such as bradykinin also appears to involve a fairly complex signaling cascade (for review see Ref. 9.Sase K. Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Post-translational amino-terminal fatty acylation targets eNOS to caveolae in the plasma membranes of vascular endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes through a direct inhibitory interaction of the enzyme with caveolin-1 and -3, respectively (10.Feron O.

Ligand-induced rises of intracellular Ca2+ appear to promote a reversible Ca2+/CaM-mediated dissociation of the inhibitory eNOS-caveolin complex resulting in transient eNOS activation (13.Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The ligand-induced dissociation of eNOS from caveolin might explain the translocation of the enzyme from the plasma membrane to cytosolic stuctures in response to stimulation of endothelial cells with bradykinin (14.Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15.Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, a recent report demonstrated that eNOS forms an inhibitory complex with the B2R from which the active enzyme is released in a Ca2+-dependent manner upon receptor activation (17.Ju H. Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24025-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), presumably because of tyrosine phosphorylation of the eNOS interacting region of the B2R (18.Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. He H. Liang H. Caldwell R.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In vitro binding assays with glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins corresponding to various domains of the B2R and functional studies with synthetic peptides identified the inhibitory eNOS binding site of the receptor as amino acid residues 310–329, in intracellular domain 4 (17.Ju H. Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24025-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although eNOS dissociation from the receptor was Ca2+-dependent, the inhibitory B2R peptides had no effect on Ca2+/CaM binding (17.Ju H. Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24025-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), excluding a reciprocal regulation of the enzyme by B2R/CaM as described for the caveolin cycle (19.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). More recently, similar interactions of eNOS have been described with intracellular domain 4 of other G-protein-coupled receptors, such as the angiotensin II AT1 and endothelin-1 ETBreceptors but not with the ATP P2Y2 receptor (18.Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. He H. Liang H. Caldwell R.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the reversible inhibitory interaction of eNOS with G-protein-coupled receptors appears to be a widespread signaling mechanism linking receptor activation to endothelial NO formation. The present study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of NOS inhibition by B2R binding. For this purpose, we studied how a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the B2R interaction site affects the enzymatic activities and structural properties of purified eNOS and nNOS. It is shown that enzyme inhibition is most likely a consequence of peptide binding in close proximity to the prosthetic heme group, resulting in impaired reductive activation of molecular oxygen. The B2R peptides inhibited eNOS and nNOS with similar potency, indicating that both isoforms might interact with the receptor in cells. This hypothesis was corroborated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing human nNOS. Rat nNOS was purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (20.Harteneck C. Klatt P. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem.

BH4 was obtained from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland. 3′-(6R)-5,6,7,8-[3H]Tetrahydro-l-biopterin (14 Ci/mmol) was synthesized enzymatically from [8,5′-3H]GTP as described previously (22.Werner E.R. Schmid M. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Wachter H. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human nNOS and eNOS cDNA clones were generous gifts from Dr. John Parkinson (Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). NADPH was purchased from Pharma Waldhof GmbH (Düsseldorf, Germany). Monoclonal anti-B2R antibody (Clone 20, mouse) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyclonal anti-nNOS antibodies were raised in rabbits against purified recombinant rat nNOS. Synthetic peptides were obtained from the Medical College of Georgia Biochemistry Core Facility and were >95% pure as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (17.Ju H. Venema V.J.

The EasySelect Pichia expression kit was from Invitrogen, purchased through Bio-Trade (Vienna, Austria). Other materials for molecular biology were from New England Biolabs, Life Technologies, Inc., and Qiagen. Myoglobin (product number M1882), carbonic anhydrase (product number C4831), and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Recombinant human eNOS was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris as described elsewhere in detail. 2Leber, A., Hemmens, B., Klösch, B.,Goessler, W., Raber, G., Mayer, B., and Schmidt, K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 37658–37664. Briefly, human wild type eNOS cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pPICZA (EasySelect Pichia expression kit, Invitrogen). The final DNA construct was linearized withPmeI, and the DNA was transformed into the yeastP. pastoris KM71. An overnight culture (30 °C) was inoculated from a single colony in 10 ml of buffered minimal glycerol medium, buffered minimal glycerol medium containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6), 13.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, 40 mg/ll-histidine, 1% glycerol (v/v). The next day this culture was used to inoculate 750 ml of buffered minimal glycerol medium (1:200), and the culture was grown overnight at 30 °C to an A600 of 4–6. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 150 ml of buffered minimal methanol medium, containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6), 13.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 400 μg/liter biotin, 40 mg/literl-histidine, 5% methanol (v/v)) in the presence of 4 mg/liter hemin chloride and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C to induce protein expression. Yeast cells were then harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm CHAPS, and homogenized by vigorous vortexing with glass beads (0.5 mm). Following removal of the glass beads, the homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min to yield a supernatant used for protein purification by affinity chromatography as described previously for bovine eNOS (23.List B.M. Klösch B. Völker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The final elution performed was with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mmNaCl and 4 mm EGTA. The enzyme was stored at −70 °C in the presence of 1 mm CHAPS. Protein was determined with the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard protein (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). A HEK 293 cell line stably expressing human nNOS was established according to a protocol that will be described elsewhere in detail. 3P. Andrew and B. Mayer, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), which contains the neomycin resistance cassette and the cDNA for human nNOS, was used. Plasmid DNA was prepared for transfection by linearization with PvuI, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. HEK 293 cells were transfected at 40% confluence with 5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA using SuperFect (Qiagen) or Tfx-50 (Promega). The cells were replated 48 h after transfection at 0.5–1 × 106 cells per plate in 100 mm plates in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. After 10–12 days, isolated colonies of resistant cells were tested for activity, and the HEK/nNOS line was maintained in 250 μg/ml G418. NOS activity was determined as formation ofl-[2,3,4,5-3H]citrulline froml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (25.Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of 50 mmtriethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (∼80,000 counts/min), 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml CaM, 0.2 mm NADPH, 10 μm BH4, 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 0.2 mm CHAPS. CaM-dependent NADPH:oxygen and NADPH:cytochromec oxidoreductase activities of nNOS and eNOS were determined spectrophotometrically in the absence of l-arginine as described previously (26.Mayer B.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral identity of the nNOS steady state during NADPH oxidation was investigated by rapid-scan spectroscopy with a Bio-Sequential SX-17MV Stopped-Flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Samples were illuminated with an ozone-free 150-Watt xenon lamp and detected with a photodiode array, equipped with a 200–730-nm grating. Final conditions were as follows: 1.0 μm nNOS, 15 μm NADPH, 7.5 μm (125 μg/ml) CaM, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm CHAPS, 2.4 mm2-mercaptoethanol, ± 0.3 mm B2R 310–329, at 25 °C. All reagents were premixed in one syringe except for potassium Pi, which was present in both syringes, and CaM, which was used to start the reaction and was added to the second syringe only. To obtain difference spectra, the pre-mixing spectra, representing the average of the spectra recorded separately for the contents of the two syringes, were subtracted from the spectra recorded subsequent to the addition of CaM. Radioligand binding studies using [3H]BH4 as high affinity ligand were performed as described previously with minor modifications (28.Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J.

For saturation binding, nNOS (0.5 μg) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of a 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with 10 nm [3H]BH4(∼14 nCi) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled BH4(0–10 μm) in the absence and presence of 30 μm B2R 310–329 peptide, followed by rapid vacuum filtration with the MultiScreen assay system from Millipore and determination of the radioactivity retained on the filters by liquid scintillation counting. Data were corrected for nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled BH4. 10 confluent 100-mm Petri dishes of HEK 293 cells overexpressing nNOS were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,300 revolutions/min. The pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 1 ml of chilled Tris buffer (20 mm) (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. Anti-nNOS antiserum (400 μl) or anti-B2R antibody (50 μl) were then added to the lysate (400 and 100 μl for precipitation with anti-nNOS and anti-B2R antibodies, respectively) and rocked for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of Tris buffer-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose (400 and 50 μl for precipitation with anti-nNOS and anti-B2R antibodies, respectively) and rocking for another 3.5 h at 4 °C. Precipitates and supernatants were separated by centrifugation. The pellets were washed twice with chilled buffer (50 mmTris/HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), suspended in 60 μl of Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (30.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting for 90 min at 240 mA, followed by immunodetection with anti-B2R (1:3,000 dilution) or anti-nNOS (1:5,000 dilution) antibodies, using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, respectively, and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All affinity constants (EC50, IC50, Km , andKD) as well as B max andV max values were obtained by non-linear regression analyses of individual experiments followed by the calculation of arithmetic mean values. Unless otherwise indicated, data are given as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the B2R-eNOS interaction site (B2R 310–329) (17.Ju H. Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24025-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) inhibited the catalytic activity of purified recombinant eNOS and nNOS in the arginine to citrulline conversion assay with IC50 values of 10.6 ± 0.4 and 7.1 ± 0.6 μm, respectively (Fig.1). Similar results were obtained with a slightly longer peptide corresponding to the same region of the receptor (B2R 310–334), whereas two peptides derived from other sequences of the B2R (330–341 and 348–364) had no effects (data not shown). The effects of the synthetic peptide on enzyme kinetic parameters of eNOS and nNOS are summarized in Table 1. Although the maximal activities of both isozymes were significantly reduced by the B2R 310–329 peptide (10 μm), there was no significant effect on theKm values for l-arginine, indicating that the peptide did not compete with substrate binding.Table IEnzyme kinetic parameters determined in the absence and presence of B2R 310–329 peptide (10 μm)eNOSnNOSControlB2R 310–329 (10 μm)ControlB2R 310–329 (10 μm)K m(μm)5.0 ± 0.36.6 ± 1.19.9 ± 0.38.1 ± 0.7V max(μmol × min−1 × mg−1)0.19 ± 0.0040.13 ± 0.0080.70 ± 0.0920.37 ± 0.077eNOS and nNOS were assayed for l-citrulline formation in the presence of increasing concentrations of l-arginine (1–100 μm) under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab eNOS and nNOS were assayed for l-citrulline formation in the presence of increasing concentrations of l-arginine (1–100 μm) under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1. K m and V max values were obtained by non-linear regression analysis of individual data sets, followed by the calculation of arithmetic means (n = 3). In a previous study we observed that the potency of an inhibitory peptide decreased dramatically with increasing NOS concentrations, rendering it impossible to study the mechanism of enzyme inhibition using biochemical methods requiring protein concentrations >50 nm (31.Mayer B. Pitters E. Pfeiffer S. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, this effect was much less pronounced with B2R 310–329. As shown in Fig.2 A, the inhibitory effect of the peptide (∼75% inhibition at 30 μm) was not affected when the concentration of eNOS was increased from 15 to 225 nm, although a significantly higher potency of the peptide was apparent at the lowest NOS concentration tested (7.5 nm). Similarly, inhibition of nNOS was not very sensitive to protein concentration. The enzyme inhibition produced by 30 μm B2R 310–329 decreased from about 80% to 60% with nNOS concentrations increasing from 6.3 to 190 nm (Fig.2 B) It appeared conceivable that inhibition of NOS was due to an interference of the peptide with the shuttle of electrons from NADPH to the heme. This electron transport chain, which is catalyzed by the flavins FAD and FMN upon binding of Ca2+/CaM, can be assayed as CaM-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity of both nNOS (3.Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Böhme E. Mayer B. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). At concentrations producing almost maximal NOS inhibition (50–100 μm), the B2R peptide had no effect on the reductase activities of either eNOS or nNOS. Although a significant inhibition of cytochrome creduction was observed at higher peptide concentrations (data not shown), these results suggested that the inhibition ofl-citrulline formation cannot be explained by an interference of the peptide with electron transport or CaM binding. Based on these observations, it appeared likely that the B2R 310–329 peptide interfered with NADPH oxidation and/or heme reduction. The NADPH oxidase activity of NOS, which becomes apparent when nNOS or eNOS are activated with Ca2+/CaM in the absence ofl-arginine or BH4, results in reduction of O2 to superoxide/H2O2 at the cost of NADPH.

As shown in Fig. 3, nNOS exhibited an NADPH oxidase activity of 1.51 ± 0.004 μmol × min−1 × mg−1, which was inhibited by the B2R peptide with an IC50 of 3.7 ± 0.6 μm. Similarly, the NADPH oxidase activity of human eNOS (200 ± 40 nmol × μmol × min−1 × mg−1) was inhibited to 28.9 ± 5.31% of controls in the presence of 0.1 mm of the peptide. Together with the lack of effect on electron transfer, inhibition of uncoupled NADPH oxidation suggested that the B2R peptide blocked reduction of the heme or prevented subsequent binding and reductive activation of O2 (37.Abu-Soud H.M.

To address this issue, we studied the effect of the B2R 310–329 peptide on the NOS steady-state absorbance spectrum during uncoupled NADPH oxidation by rapid-scan spectroscopy. Mixing 1 μm nNOS and 15 μmNADPH with 7.5 μm CaM in the presence of CaCl2 caused rapid bleaching of the NADPH absorbance at 340 nm, corresponding to an oxidation rate of 1.35 μm NADPH s−1. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of 0.3 mm B2R 310–329, the oxidation rate was slowed down (by about 70%) to 0.40 μm NADPH s−1. The absolute spectra were dominated by the absorbances of NADPH and the peptide and thus did not conclusively reveal the identity of the nNOS steady state, although a shoulder at ∼418 nm was apparent in the absence but not in the presence of the peptide (not shown). Indeed, a pronounced increase of the absorbance at 424 nm, presumably due to accumulation of the oxyferrous complex absorbing at 417 nm (38.Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), was apparent in the difference spectra that were obtained by subtracting the pre-mixing spectra from the steady-state spectra recorded immediately (0.1 s) after the addition of CaM (Fig. 4). In the presence of 0.3 mm B2R peptide, accumulation of the oxyferrous complex was largely inhibited without appearance of other absorbing species. In both cases, the steady-state spectra remained unchanged until the NADPH was completely oxidized, followed by re-oxidation of the flavins (not shown). Pterin analogs (39.Klatt P. Schmidt K.

In this study, we make the novel observation that PGM is also involved in the regulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. When a strain lacking the major isoform of PGM (pgm2Δ) was grown on media containing galactose as sole carbon source, its rate of Ca2+ uptake was 5-fold higher than an isogenic wild-type strain. This increased rate of Ca2+ uptake resulted in a 9-fold increase in the steady-state total cellular Ca2+ level. The fraction of cellular Ca2+ located in the exchangeable pool in thepgm2Δ strain was found to be as large as the exchangeable fraction observed in wild-type cells, suggesting that the depletion of Golgi Ca2+ stores is not responsible for the increased rate of Ca2+ uptake. We also found that growth of thepgm2Δ strain on galactose media is inhibited by 10 μm cyclosporin A, suggesting that activation of the calmodulin/calcineurin signaling pathway is required to activate the Ca2+ transporters that sequester the increased cytosolic Ca2+ load caused by this high rate of Ca2+uptake. We propose that these Ca2+-related alterations are attributable to a reduced metabolic flux between Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P due to a limitation of PGM enzymatic activity in thepgm2Δ strain. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that this “metabolic bottleneck” resulted in an 8-fold increase in the Glc-1-P level compared with the wild-type strain, while the Glc-6-P and ATP levels were normal.

Like other eukaryotes, yeast maintain a low resting free Ca2+ concentration in their cytosol in the range of 50–200 nm (2.Iida H. Yagawa Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Considering that the total cellular Ca2+ content is in the millimolar range, more than 99% of the total cell-associated Ca2+ is either bound to proteins within the cytosol or compartmentalized within intracellular organelles. This remarkably tight control of free cytosolic Ca2+ is a universal phenomenon among living organisms that apparently relates to the low solubility of Ca2+complexes of many phosphorylated metabolites (6.Williams R.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 269: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This tight control of free cytosolic Ca2+ is also an essential feature of Ca2+ signaling, where Ca2+-sensing proteins like calmodulin utilize a transient increase in the steady-state cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to activate various signal transduction pathways (7.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar).The great majority of cellular Ca2+ is stored within intracellular organelles in S. cerevisiae (8.Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The vacuole is believed to contain the largest (∼90%) reservoir of Ca2+, where it is thought to reside primarily in a complex with polyphosphate (9.Eilam Y. Lavi H. Grossowicz N. J. Gen.

In contrast, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and the Golgi apparatus hold Ca2+ in a more readily mobilized form, which, together with cytosolic Ca2+, is often referred to as the exchangeable Ca2+ pool (11.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ can be transported into the Golgi apparatus by the Ca2+-ATPase Pmr1p (12.Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol.

Consistent with its capacity to store Ca2+, a recent study demonstrated that the Golgi apparatus can play a significant role in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis under conditions where vacuolar Ca2+ storage is compromised (4.Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+can also be sequestered into the vacuole through the action of the Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1p and the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ exchanger Vcx1p/Hum1p (17.Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell.

Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Of these two transporters, Vcx1p has been shown to play a predominant role in pumping cytosolic Ca2+ into the vacuole and restoring basal cytosolic Ca2+ conditions following an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (5.Miseta A.

The expression and function of each of these Ca2+ transporters is regulated by calcineurin, a highly conserved protein phosphatase that is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin (4.Miseta A. Fu L.

While mitochondria have been shown to play an important role in Ca2+ signaling in mammalian cells, there is currently little or no evidence that mitochondria play any role in Ca2+ sequestration inS. cerevisiae (21.Pinton P.

Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).A number of stimuli can trigger a transient increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in yeast. These stimuli include various nutrients, mating pheromones, or a hypotonic shock (3.Nakajima-Shimada J. Iida H. Tsuji F.I. Anraku Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23.Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P.H. J. Biol.

While glucose is frequently considered to be primarily a carbon and energy source in yeast, it can also activate several signaling pathways in yeast, including the RAS-cAMP pathway, phosphatidylinositol turnover, Ca2+ influx and efflux, and the glucose repression/de-repression pathway (24.Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 3-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these distinct pathways are regulated by glucose, a glucose derivative, a glycosylated protein, or by some other mechanism. Eilam and co-workers (25.Eilam Y. Othman M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26.Eilam Y. Othman M. Halachmi D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2537-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that glucose-stimulated Ca2+ uptake is not controlled by changes in either the ATP level or by a cAMP-dependent pathway. Interestingly, Glc-6-P has been shown to stimulate the ATP-dependent transport of Ca2+ into mammalian microsomes (27.Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Romani A. Comporti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3466-3473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Chen P.Y. Csutora P. Veyna-Burke N.A. Marchase R.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that glucose metabolites may directly influence Ca2+ transport mechanisms in higher eukaryotes.The biochemical pathways required to utilize glucose as a carbon and energy source are highly conserved from bacteria to humans. A key enzyme involved in this process is phosphoglucomutase (PGM; EC2.7.5.1), which catalyzes the interconversion of Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P. PGM acts at a key metabolic trafficking point that controls the synthesis and degradation of carbohydrates. The direction of metabolic flow through PGM depends on the available carbon source. Both the degradation of glycogen and the metabolism of galactose as carbon source require PGM activity to convert Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P. The Glc-6-P produced can then be utilized in glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate shunt. Conversely, PGM mediates the conversion of Glc-6-P to Glc-1-P for sugar nucleotide (and ultimately, cell wall and glycogen) synthesis in cells grown on glucose or non-fermentable carbon sources. S. cerevisiae contains genes encoding two isoforms of PGM. Expression of the PGM2 gene, encoding the major isoform of PGM, is greatly increased in galactose-containing media. In contrast, thePGM1 gene expresses the minor isoform of PGM in a relatively low, constitutive manner (29.Fu L. Bounelis P. Dey N. Browne B.L. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Oh D. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3373-3377Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Yeast strains that lack both isoforms of PGM are unable to grow when galactose is the sole carbon and energy source (31.Boles E. Liebetrau W. Hofmann M. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, strains lacking both isoforms of PGM can survive when grown on glucose, apparently because the conversion of Glc-6-P to Glc-1-P can be supported to a small extent by related enzymes such as phosphomannomutase andN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate mutase (31.Boles E. Liebetrau W. Hofmann M. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32.Hofmann M. Boles E. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In the current study, we found that a mutant strain lacking the major isoform of PGM (pgm2Δ) has a much higher rate of Ca2+ uptake than an isogenic wild-type strain when grown on galactose media. This increased rate of Ca2+ uptake results in a 9-fold increase in total cellular Ca2+, but does not reduce the fraction of Ca2+ located in the exchangeable pool. Consistent with this observation, we could not detect any defect in ER and Golgi functions that have previously been shown to result from an inability to sequester Ca2+ into these compartments in a pmr1Δ strain (12.Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13.Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.I. Moir D.T.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this Ca2+ hyper-accumulation phenotype is observed only when the pgm2Δ strain is grown in media containing galactose as the sole carbon source, and correlates with the accumulation of Glc-1-P under these growth conditions. These results suggest that Glc-1-P (or a derivative) may regulate Ca2+uptake from the environment.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study indicate that the loss of the major isoform of PGM causes large alterations in cellular Ca2+homeostasis and signaling in galactose-grown cells. Under these conditions, the pgm2Δ strain exhibited a much higher rate of Ca2+ uptake and more total cellular Ca2+than the WT strain. The pgm2Δ strain was unable to grow on YPGal plates supplemented with CsA, suggesting that the activation of Ca2+ transporters by the calcineurin pathway may be required to adequately sequester the large quantity of Ca2+that enters the cytosol of these cells. Such an increased capacity to rapidly remove cytosolic Ca2+ could also explain why thepgm2Δ strain is unable to properly mediate the transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that accompanies the addition of glucose to glucose-starved cells as described in previous studies (3.Nakajima-Shimada J. Iida H. Tsuji F.I. Anraku Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,26.Eilam Y. Othman M. Halachmi D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2537-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, we did not observe any of these Ca2+-related alterations when the pgm2Δ strain was grown in either glucose or lactate media. The pgm2Δstrain thus exhibits a carbon source-dependent defect in both cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling. Since the normal enzymatic function of PGM is to inter-convert Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P, the loss of the majority of cellular PGM activity could be predicted to limit the conversion of Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P in cells grown on galactose, resulting in a “metabolic bottleneck.” Consistent with this prediction, we found that the pgm2Δ strain accumulates a large amount of Glc-1-P when grown on galactose media. The simplest interpretation of these results is that the intracellular level of Glc-1-P (or a related glucose metabolite) stimulates the accumulation of Ca2+ in the pgm2Δ strain under these conditions. Interestingly, we found that the total cellular Ca2+ level in the pmr1Δ strain was 2.5-fold higher when grown in YPD medium than in YPGal, providing further evidence that glucose metabolites may play a more general role in controlling cellular Ca2+ levels than was previously appreciated.The PMR1 gene encodes a Ca2+-ATPase involved in the transport of Ca2+ into the Golgi apparatus. Several of the Ca2+-related defects of the pgm2Δ strain grown in galactose-containing media are similar to those observed with the pmr1Δ strain, including elevated Ca2+uptake and accumulation (12.Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13.Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.I. Moir D.T.

Durr and co-workers (33.Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) proposed that Pmr1p also mediates the uptake of Ca2+ into the ER, since the pmr1Δ strain also exhibits a defect in retrograde protein transport out of the ER. In certain mammalian cell types, the depletion of Ca2+ stores within the ER has been proposed to induce the synthesis of a diffusible molecule termed calcium influx factor (CIF). This molecule is thought to stimulate the uptake of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane to amplify and prolong the propagation of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal. Interestingly, the yeast pmr1Δ strain is missing the Ca2+-ATPase responsible for transporting Ca2+into the ER and the Golgi apparatus, and it also exhibits an increased rate of Ca2+ uptake and accumulation. This phenotype would be predicted if the depletion of Ca2+ from the compartments of the secretory pathway resulted in the production of a CIF-like molecule. Consistent with this reasoning, a recent study found that this strain produces a high level of a CIF-like activity (49.Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that CIF is a soluble molecule with a molecular mass of ≤700 Da (49.Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E.

Although the structure of CIF has not been determined, it was suggested to contain hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons and a phosphate moiety (51.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 52.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass and structural characteristics are consistent with the features expected if CIF were related to (or derived from) a sugar phosphate or sugar nucleotide (53.Kim H.Y. Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9706-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that Glc-1-P may be a metabolic precursor in the CIF biosynthetic pathway.While the increased rate of Ca2+ uptake and total cellular Ca2+ levels in the pgm2Δ strain could be attributable to a store depletion mechanism that involves a CIF-like signaling molecule, other aspects of the phenotype of thepgm2Δ strain are inconsistent with such a model. First, our data indicate that the pgm2Δ strain, unlike thepmr1Δ strain, contains a fraction of total cellular Ca2+ in the exchangeable pool that is at least as large (if not larger) than the exchangeable pool in the WT strain. This suggests that the level of Ca2+ contained in the ER and the Golgi apparatus is not significantly reduced. Consistent with this, we did not observe any evidence of reduced Ca2+ levels within the ER or Golgi apparatus of the pgm2Δ strain in functional assays that measured retrograde transport of CpY* from the ER, or invertase glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that the elevated rate of Ca2+ uptake in thepgm2Δ strain is not coupled to a defect in filling the Ca2+ stores within the ER and/or the Golgi apparatus. Instead, it appears that the pmr1Δ and pgm2Δmutations induce the uptake of Ca2+ in mechanistically distinct ways. Since the pgm2Δ strain accumulates a high level of Glc-1-P, we hypothesize that Glc-1-P accumulation may be coupled to elevated Ca2+ uptake by some mechanism. It is possible that the accumulation of Glc-1-P may bypass the need to deplete ER or Golgi Ca2+ stores prior to increased Ca2+ uptake. This could occur if an increased concentration of Glc-1-P stimulates the synthesis of CIF in the absence of store depletion, or if Glc-1-P directly stimulates the rate of Ca2+ accumulation into one or more intracellular compartments (such as the ER, Golgi apparatus, or vacuole). This latter possibility would not be unprecedented, since it has been shown that Glc-6-P can stimulate ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake into isolated mammalian microsomes (27.Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Romani A. Comporti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3466-3473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Chen P.Y. Csutora P. Veyna-Burke N.A. Marchase R.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The existence of a Glc-6-P transporter in mammalian ER membranes is well established. While Glc-6-P transporter activity in the ER is coupled to Glc-6-P phosphatase activity in the ER lumen of gluconeogenic tissues such as liver, the much broader tissue distribution of the Glc-6-P transporter suggests that it may also participate in another general cellular process such as Ca2+ homeostasis (54.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has been shown that neutrophils and monocytes from patients with Glc-6-P transporter deficiency are unable to efficiently sequester Ca2+ (55.Kilpatrick L. Garty B.Z. Lundquist K.F. Hunter K. Stanley C.A. Baker L. Douglas S.D. Korchak H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As would be predicted from our model that Glc-1-P can also function in this way, it was recently found that Glc-1-P can also stimulate the ATP-dependent uptake of Ca2+ into isolated cardiac microsomes. 2R. Marchase, unpublished results. To better understand how Pgm2p and Pmr1p each influence cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, we constructed apgm2Δ/pmr1Δ strain. To our surprise, thepgm2Δ/pmr1Δ double mutant was unable to grow on YPGal medium, even when an alternate carbon source (lactate) was present. This suggests that the metabolism of galactose in thepgm2Δ/pmr1Δ double mutant may cause such a severe imbalance in ion homeostasis that cell growth is inhibited. This finding again suggests that the pmr1Δ andpgm2Δ mutations may increase Ca2+ uptake in distinct ways, since the phenotypic consequences of combining these two mutations were more severe than the phenotype of strains carrying either mutation alone. Although our results indicate that the free Ca2+ level within the ER and the Golgi apparatus is normal in the pgm2Δ strain, we cannot exclude the possibility that the elevated Ca2+ uptake associated with thepgm2Δ mutation is caused by the inability to fill another intracellular compartment (or subcompartment) with Ca2+. If this were the case, the combination of the pgm2Δ andpmr1Δ mutations could further compromise the ability to adequately fill the effected compartments when grown in standard YPGal medium (which contains only 0.3 mm Ca2+). Our finding that the addition of 100 mm CaCl2 can restore the growth of the pgm2Δ/pmr1Δ strain on this growth medium is consistent with such a model. Clearly, further studies are required to determine the mechanism that couples glucose metabolism to Ca2+ homeostasis. The elucidation of this process may provide important new insights into the control of Ca2+homeostasis in yeast. Ultimately, it may also lead to a better understanding of human diseases such as diabetes that are also caused by defects in glucose metabolism. Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares many features of Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling pathways with mammals (1.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other eukaryotes, yeast maintain a low resting free Ca2+ concentration in their cytosol in the range of 50–200 nm (2.Iida H. Yagawa Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13391-13399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Nakajima-Shimada J. Iida H. Tsuji F.I. Anraku Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Considering that the total cellular Ca2+ content is in the millimolar range, more than 99% of the total cell-associated Ca2+ is either bound to proteins within the cytosol or compartmentalized within intracellular organelles. This remarkably tight control of free cytosolic Ca2+ is a universal phenomenon among living organisms that apparently relates to the low solubility of Ca2+complexes of many phosphorylated metabolites (6.Williams R.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 269: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This tight control of free cytosolic Ca2+ is also an essential feature of Ca2+ signaling, where Ca2+-sensing proteins like calmodulin utilize a transient increase in the steady-state cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to activate various signal transduction pathways (7.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The great majority of cellular Ca2+ is stored within intracellular organelles in S. cerevisiae (8.Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The vacuole is believed to contain the largest (∼90%) reservoir of Ca2+, where it is thought to reside primarily in a complex with polyphosphate (9.Eilam Y. Lavi H. Grossowicz N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 623-629Google Scholar, 10.Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and the Golgi apparatus hold Ca2+ in a more readily mobilized form, which, together with cytosolic Ca2+, is often referred to as the exchangeable Ca2+ pool (11.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ can be transported into the Golgi apparatus by the Ca2+-ATPase Pmr1p (12.Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol.

Consistent with its capacity to store Ca2+, a recent study demonstrated that the Golgi apparatus can play a significant role in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis under conditions where vacuolar Ca2+ storage is compromised (4.Miseta A.

Cytosolic Ca2+can also be sequestered into the vacuole through the action of the Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1p and the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ exchanger Vcx1p/Hum1p (17.Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell.

The mutants Gly233 → Glu, Gly233 → Val, Pro312 → Ala, Leu319 → Arg, and Lys684 → Arg differed conspicuously with respect to the behavior of the dephosphoenzyme, although they were previously shown to display a common block of the transformation of the phosphoenzyme from an ADP-sensitive to an ADP-insensitive form. The maximum rate of the ATP binding/phosphoryl transfer reaction was reduced 3.6-fold in mutant Gly233 → Glu and more than 50-fold in mutant Lys684 → Arg, relative to wild type. In mutant Leu319 → Arg, the rate of the Ca2+-binding transition was reduced as much as 10–30-fold depending on the presence of ATP. In mutants Gly233 → Glu, Gly233 → Val, and Pro312 → Ala, the rate of the Ca2+-binding transition was increased at least 2–3-fold at acid pH but not significantly at neutral pH, suggesting a destabilization of the protonated form. The rate of Ca2+dissociation was reduced 12-fold in mutant Pro312 → Ala and 3.5-fold in Leu319 → Arg, and increased at least 4-fold in a mutant in which the putative Ca2+ liganding residue Glu309 was replaced by aspartate. The data support a model in which Pro312 and Leu319 are closely associated with the cation binding pocket, Gly233 is part of a long-range signal transmission pathway between the ion-binding sites and the catalytic site, and Lys684 is an essential catalytic residue that may function in the same way as its counterpart in the soluble hydrolases belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily.

Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2.Mintz E. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys.

The coupling between energy utilization and ion movement depends on long-range functional linkages between cytoplasmic and transmembrane protein domains. ATP hydrolysis occurs through formation of an aspartyl-phosphorylated intermediate at Asp351 located in the large cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). The transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to Asp351requires the binding of two calcium ions at sites formed by residues located predominantly in the transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6 (3.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 4.Andersen J.P. Biosci.

Before phosphorylation, Ca2+ has access to these sites from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, but following the phosphorylation Ca2+ can only be released on the luminal side, in connection with or following the conversion of the phosphoenzyme from an ADP-sensitive form (“E 1-P”) to an ADP-insensitive form (“E 2-P”). Subsequently, the aspartyl phosphate bond is hydrolyzed with liberation of Pi, and the dephosphoenzyme returns to a state that readily binds Ca2+from the cytoplasmic side. The latter events are presumably accompanied by countertransport of protons (see reaction cycle in Fig. 1), and the dissociation of the translocated protons and binding of Ca2+ at the cytoplasmically facing sites of the dephosphoenzyme take place as a series of consecutive reaction steps involving enzyme conformational changes, which may collectively be denoted “the E2 to E1 transition” or “the Ca2+-binding transition” (1.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6.Forge V.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10613-10620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As an approach toward a detailed characterization of the transport-associated conformational changes we have used site-directed mutagenesis analysis to map several critical residues. Beginning with the Gly233 (8.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pro312 (9.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), about 20 residues have now been shown to be crucial to theE 1-P to E 2-P transformation of the phosphoenzyme (for reviews, see Refs. 4.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5.Vilsen B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1995; 154 Suppl. 624: 1-146Google Scholar, and10.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This step is the slowest in the cycle and can be studied at 0 °C using a manual mixing technique (8.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The residues critical to the E 1-P to E 2-P conversion are located in various regions of the protein, including the large cytoplasmic loop that makes up the catalytic site, the fourth stalk segment that links the catalytic site to transmembrane segment M4, the β-strand domain that interconnects the transmembrane segments M2 and M3, and, to a lesser extent, the transmembrane segments. Much less is known about the positions of residues that participate in the conformational changes of the dephosphoenzyme. These conformational changes can be analyzed by fast kinetic studies of phosphorylation. In classic rapid quench experiments with the Ca2+-ATPase isolated from rabbit muscle, the time course of the Ca2+-binding transition of the dephosphoenzyme was monitored by following the phosphorylation upon addition of Ca2+ and [γ-32P]ATP to enzyme initially present in the Ca2+-deprived form (11.Rauch B. Chak D.V. Hasselbach W. FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12.Sumida M. Wang T. Mandel F. Froehlich J.P. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 6140-6147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the time course of Ca2+ dissociation from the dephosphoenzyme has been examined in the muscle enzyme by following the loss of phosphorylation activity upon removal of Ca2+ from the medium, taking advantage of the dependence of the phosphoryl transfer reaction on the occupancy of the Ca2+ sites (11.Rauch B. Chak D.V. Hasselbach W. FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12.Sumida M. Wang T. Mandel F. Froehlich J.P. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

In the present work, we have for the first time been able to study phosphorylation of expressed mutant Ca2+-ATPases on a millisecond time scale. The aim was to determine the consequences of selected mutations for the kinetics of the conformational changes associated with the ATP binding/phosphoryl transfer reactions and the binding and dissociation of Ca2+ at the cytoplasmically facing sites. One of the questions we have asked is to what extents these conformational changes of the dephosphoenzyme are affected by mutations previously shown to block the E 1-P toE 2-P transformation of the phosphoenzyme. Thus, we have selected a series of mutants with a very prominent block of theE 1-P to E 2-P transition: Gly233 → Glu, Gly233 → Val, Pro312 → Ala, Leu319 → Arg, and Lys684 → Arg (Fig. 1, cf. Refs. 5.Vilsen B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1995; 154 Suppl. 624: 1-146Google Scholar, 8.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18839-18845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation kinetics of the Lys684 → Arg mutant is particularly interesting because Lys684 is highly conserved within the whole haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of hydrolases, to which the Ca2+-ATPase and other P-type ATPases recently were assigned (20.Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role of the lysine side chain in catalysis. In addition, we have included in some of the present studies mutant Glu309 → Asp, in which the ability to form a stable Ca2+-occluded form in the presence of the β,γ-bidentate chromium(III) complex of ATP was previously found to be lost even though the Ca2+-activated phosphorylation by ATP is retained (21.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These mutants display a surprising variability with respect to the characteristics of the reaction steps associated with the dephosphoenzyme. The previously described mutant cDNAs (8.Andersen J.P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), derived from the cDNA encoding the rabbit fast-twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform), were transfected into COS-1 cells by the calcium phosphate procedure (22.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) and microsomal membranes were harvested by differential centrifugation as before (8.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of expressed enzyme was quantified by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using as standard expressed wild type for which the concentration was determined by measurement of the capacity for phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate in the presence of 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (23.Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was usually supplemented with a determination of the capacity for phosphorylation from ATP (“active site concentration”). The expression levels varied between 200 and 400 pmol of Ca2+-ATPase/mg of total microsomal protein. This is several hundredfold higher than the level of endogenous Ca2+-ATPase in the COS-1 cells and the contribution of the endogenous enzyme to the phosphorylation signals is, thus, negligible. All fast kinetic experiments were performed using a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France). The complete experimental setup also included a control unit/power supply (MPS-5) and a PC equipped with an RS-232 serial interface. The apparatus is designed to work with reaction volumes in the microliter range and can perform both single and double mixing experiments using three or four reaction syringes, respectively. In addition, a fifth waste syringe allows a design of the instrument that makes no use of valves to divert the mixture to be wasted or collected. All five syringe plungers are driven by independent microprocessor-controlled stepping motors. The reaction flow-line is constructed to drastically reduce dead volumes and contains 3 Berger ball mixers (24.Berger-R L. Balko B. Chapman H.F. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1968; 29: 493-498Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) connected by interchangeable reaction loops. The apparatus is enclosed in a water jacket to allow temperature regulation of reactant chambers and the reaction flow-line. Two modes of operation were used for single mixing experiments, with only 2 mixers and one reaction loop in use. In the continuous mode, the flow rate and reaction loop volume were varied (0.2 to 4 μl/ms and 7 to 200 μl, respectively) to obtain reaction times between 10 and 800 ms. In the interrupted mode, the flow through the reaction loop (200 μl) was stopped for serial intervals to obtain reaction times between 100 ms and 10 s. In double mixing experiments, all 3 mixers and both reaction loops were in use. The volume of the first reaction loop was varied (7 to 200 μl), and both the continuous and the interrupted mode were used to vary the reaction times of the first reaction in the double mixing procedure between 19 ms and 10 s. To ensure a constant reaction time for the second reaction in the double mixing procedure, the flow rate remained unchanged as did the volume of the second reaction loop. The quench-flow module was used to study the time course of phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP of the expressed wild-type and mutant Ca2+-ATPases according to the protocols described below. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. To monitor the phosphorylation of enzyme initially present in the Ca2+-saturated form, microsomes suspended in 40 mm MOPS/Tris buffer, pH 7.0 (or 40 mm MES/Tris buffer, pH 6.0), 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmCaCl2 were mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (2, 4, 10, or 20 μm) followed by acid quenching at the indicated time interval by further mixing with an equal volume of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mmH3PO4. To monitor the phosphorylation of enzyme initially present in the Ca2+-deprived form, microsomes suspended in 40 mm MOPS/Tris buffer, pH 7.0 (or 40 mm MES/Tris buffer, pH 6.0), 80 mm KCl, and 2 mm EGTA were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0 (or 40 mm MES/Tris buffer, pH 6.0), 80 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP, followed by acid quenching at the indicated time interval as described above. To monitor the Ca2+-binding transition in the absence of ATP, a double-mixing procedure originally described by Guillain et al. (15.Guillain F. Champeil P. Lacapere J.-J. Gingold M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6140-6147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Microsomes suspended in 40 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, and 2 mm EGTA were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2.2 mmCaCl2. At the indicated time interval, the double volume of 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP was added, followed by acid quenching 34 ms later. To study the dissociation of Ca2+from the enzyme (disappearance of reactivity toward ATP), microsomes suspended in 40 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μl of CaCl2 were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP, followed by acid quenching at the indicated time interval. In all four protocols, the acid-precipitated microsomal protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.0 as described previously (8.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by “imaging” using a Packard CycloneTM Storage Phosphor System. Background phosphorylation levels, determined by reversing the order of addition of [γ-32P]ATP and quench solution or by substituting 2 mm EGTA for CaCl2, was subtracted from all data points. The amount of expressed Ca2+-ATPase protein used per experimental point was 0.05–0.2 pmol. Because of the small reaction volumes, the amount of radioactivity used per experimental point could be restricted to less than 5 × 104 Bq. The phosphorylation time courses were fitted to a monoexponential time function corresponding to first-order kinetics, using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.), and when good fits could be obtained, the extracted rate constants were used to characterize the data. In many cases this procedure was feasible, and for the sake of simplicity we refrained from using more complex descriptions with several parameters. In cases where there was an obvious deviation from monophasic kinetics, the data were fitted by computer simulation of the simplified reaction cycle in Scheme FS1 using a kinetic simulation software, SimZyme, developed in this laboratory. SimZyme is based on the principles described in Ref. 25.Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1995Crossref Google Scholar. For any choice of reaction cycle and rate constants, the program solves the relevant differential equations, using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical method, and provides a graphical representation of the time dependence of the concentrations of the reaction intermediates which can be compared with experimental data points. A detailed description of a program with similar characteristics has previously been published (26.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Initial rates per ATPase molecule in units of s−1were obtained from the slopes of the fitted curves at time 0 after normalizing the curves to the enzyme concentration. The first step in our fast kinetic characterization of the mutants was to study the phosphorylation of enzyme pre-equilibrated with Ca2+(“Ca2E1” in Fig.1 or “Ca2E” in Scheme FS1). Microsomes containing expressed wild type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase were preincubated in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+ to saturate the Ca2+-transport sites, and the time course of phosphorylation was monitored following addition of 5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2). Under these conditions an initial overshoot was observed for the wild type, corresponding to a phosphorylation level 5–10% higher than the steady-state level. The initial overshoot and the phosphorylation rate of the expressed wild-type Ca2+-ATPase are in good agreement with the behavior under comparable conditions of Ca2+-ATPase purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (14.Scofano H.M. Vieyra A. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Froehlich J.P. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2013-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data for the wild type, including the overshoot, could be reproduced satisfactorily by computer simulation of the simplified reaction cycle in Scheme FS1, using the SimZyme program described under “Experimental Procedures,” and there was not much latitude in the choice of the rate coefficients. As shown by the line, the following rate coefficients gave a good fit: k A = 35 s−1, k B = 5 s−1, andk C = 25 s−1. The reverse reactions can be neglected due to the absence of added ADP and the 1000-fold lower Ca2+ affinity of the phosphoenzyme relative to the dephosphoenzyme (1.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2.Mintz E. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 52-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The overshoot was lacking in the mutants, as expected on the basis of the previously observed block of dephosphorylation. The rate of dephosphorylation is reduced 20–100-fold or more, relative to the wild type in the mutants Gly233 → Glu, Gly233 → Val, Pro312 → Ala, Leu319 → Arg, and Lys684 → Arg, as a consequence of the block of theE 1-P to E 2-P conversion (8.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18839-18845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mutant Glu309 → Asp, the dephosphorylation rate is also very low, due to a block of the hydrolysis of the E 2-P intermediate (21.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For each mutant, the appearance of phosphoenzyme following addition of ATP to the Ca2+-saturated enzyme could be fitted to a monoexponential function, as shown by the lines in Fig. 2 for mutants Gly233 → Glu, Gly233 → Val, Pro312 → Ala, Leu319 → Arg, and Lys684 → Arg. The rate coefficient determined in this way corresponds to that termed k A for the wild type, since k B (the rate coefficient corresponding to dephosphorylation) is insignificant for the mutants. The apparent monophasic time course may suggest that under the present conditions a single rate-limiting step exists in the reaction path consisting of ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer to the Ca2+-saturated enzyme. However, it is impossible to completely rule out the existence of a small lag phase indicative of two or more consecutive slow reactions (17.Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the mutants Gly233 → Val, Pro312 → Ala, and Leu319 → Arg, the fits of the data to monoexponential functions gave rate coefficients of 40 s−1, 38 s−1, and 34 s−1, respectively, i.e. indistinguishable from the valuek A = 35 s−1 determined for the wild type. A lower rate coefficient of 25 s−1 was found for the Gly233 → Glu mutant. The significance of this difference was attested by its consistency over a range of ATP concentrations (not shown, but see, Fig. 3). As further seen in Fig. 2, the Lys684 → Arg mutant phosphorylated with a rate coefficient of only 1.2 s−1,i.e. an almost 30-fold reduction compared with the wild type. This feature of the Lys684 → Arg mutant indicates that Lys684 plays an important role in ATP binding and/or catalysis. The Glu309 → Asp mutant was found to phosphorylate with a rate coefficient about 8-fold lower than that of the wild type (4.3 s−1, data not shown), in good agreement with previous studies at 0 °C (21.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To further analyze the mechanism behind the reduction of the rate constant for phosphorylation in the mutants Gly233 → Glu and Lys684 → Arg, we investigated the ATP concentration dependence. At each ATP concentration tested, the phosphorylation rates of the Gly233 → Glu and Lys684 → Arg mutants were lower than that of the wild type. Fig. 3 shows double reciprocal plots of the initial phosphorylation rate versus ATP concentration (1, 2, 5, and 10 μm). The initial rates are in units of s−1, because the absolute rates have been divided by the enzyme concentration to obtain the rate per ATPase molecule (“molecular rate”). For the wild type as well as the mutants, the data could be fitted satisfactorily by a straight line in accordance with the results obtained with the purified muscle enzyme (26.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The extrapolated maximum rate of 225 s−1 corresponding to infinite ATP concentration and the K m value of 13 μm determined for the wild type are fairly consistent with the literature on the purified muscle enzyme (17.Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27.Froehlich J.P. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2013-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mutant Lys684 → Arg, the maximum rate was reduced more than 50-fold relative to wild type, suggesting that Lys684is highly important for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. For Gly233 → Glu, the maximum rate was reduced 3.6-fold. TheK m value was found to be 7 μm for each mutant and, thus, smaller than that of the wild type. It should be noticed that because K m is a function of several rate constants, including those that determine the maximum rate, the reduction of K m does not imply that the affinity for ATP is increased in the mutants. Having determined the rate of phosphorylation of Ca2+-saturated enzyme, we turned to the partial reaction steps associated with Ca2+ binding. The two calcium ions required for phosphorylation bind consecutively and at least one relatively slow conformational change seems to be involved (1.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2.Mintz E. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 52-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6.Forge V. Mintz E.

Our previous studies with primary rat hepatocyte cultures demonstrated that TA1 RNA levels were responsive to media amino acid concentrations, suggesting adaptive regulation. High level TA1 expression associated with transformed cells also suggested a role in tumor progression. The present study examined the relationship of TA1/CD98 expression, adaptive response, and associated amino acid transport to neoplastic transformation using a panel of well characterized rat hepatic cell lines. We found 1) increased expression of TA1 in response to amino acid depletion, specific for arginine but not glutamine; 2) loss of TA1 response to arginine in γ-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive transformed and tumorigenic cells; 3) no appreciable response of 4F2/CD98 heavy chain to arginine levels; and 4) correlation of system L amino acid transport activity in response to arginine with changes in TA1/LAT-1 mRNA but not total immunoreacting protein. Our results suggest this CD98 light chain may act as an environmental sensor, responding to amino acid availability and that its regulation is complex. We hypothesize that altered TA1 expression is an early event in hepatocarcinogenesis giving neoplastic cells a growth or survival advantage, particularly under conditions of limited amino acid availability.

TA1/LAT-1 is not only expressed in rat hepatomas but also in a variety of human cancers including human colon and breast carcinoma (20.Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzica M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas TA1 expression is not seen in normal adult rat liver, it can be induced transiently in liver and with the same kinetics as c-mycafter acute carbon tetrachloride injury, suggesting a role in normal injury response in this organ (21.Shultz V.D. Degli Esposti S. Panzica M.S. Abraham A. Finch P. Thompson N.L. Pathobiology. 1997; 65: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In primary hepatocyte cultures, we also observed that changes in amino acid concentrations resulted in altered levels of TA1 expression, suggesting adaptive regulation (22.Shultz V.D. Campbell W. Karr S. Hixson D.C. Thompson N.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 154: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We are interested in examining the regulation and role of TA1/E16 and CD98-related molecules in hepatocarcinogenesis. We have utilized a panel of rat hepatic WB cell lines that differ in their transformed and tumorigenic properties. We have assessed how basal TA1/CD98lc and 4F2/CD98hc expression in response to an environmental factor, arginine availability, are associated with transformation and tumorigenicity in this system. We have found regulation at the level of TA1/CD98lc. The possible physiological significance of this regulation is discussed. 4F2/CD98hc RNA levels remained fairly constant regardless of arginine availability, transformation, or tumorigenicity. TA1/CD98lc RNA levels, but not the total pool of immunologically reactive protein, were found to be modulated by arginine availability in nontransformed and GGT-negative transformed WB cells. TA1/CD98lc RNA levels were constitutively high in GGT-positive transformed cells and hepatomas, and TA1/CD98lc protein levels were elevated relative to nontransformed cells. System L amino acid transport was significantly higher in GGT-positive transformed, tumorigenic cells than nontransformed cells and responded to availability of arginine, a nonsystem L substrate. A brief description of all cell lines used in this study including data on transformation and tumorigenicity is presented in Table I. The normal diploid hepatic epithelial line WB-F344 (WB) was isolated from an adult male Fischer 344 rat (23.Tsao M.-S. Grisham J.W. Nelson K.G. Smith J.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1984; 154: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The derivative cell lines were produced by 11 brief repeated exposures of WB-F344 cells to 5 μg/ml ofN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and from this heterogeneous, tumorigenic cell population, 18 clonal subpopulations were isolated based on their expression of the oncofetal marker enzyme GGT (24.Tsao M.-S. Grisham J.W. Nelson K.G. Smith J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 118: 306-315PubMed Google Scholar). Cloned cell lines were determined to be either GGT-negative (i.e. GN6) or GGT-positive (i.e.GP6). Cell lines were also re-established from subcutaneous tumors derived from GGT-positive (i.e. GP6TB, GP7TB) and GGT-negative cells (i.e. GN6TF). 1683 cells are rat transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma cells derived from primary carcinomas induced by a choline-deficient, ethionine diet (25.Hixson D.C. McEntire K.D. Obrink B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3742-3749PubMed Google Scholar).Table ICharacteristics of cell lines used in this studyCharacteristicWBGN6GN6TFGP6GP6TBGP7TB1683Transformed−++++++GGT−−−+++?In vivosource−−+−+++Tumorigenicity (subQ)−+++++++Tumorigenicity (liver)−−−−++++WB-derived++++++−Description of cell lines used in this study as: 1) either positive or negative for transformation (defined as treatment with carcinogen and ability to form a tumor in a subcutaneous site); 2) GGT expression; 3) derivation from an in vivo tumor source; 4) high, low, or negative for tumorigenicity at a subcutaneous site or in the liver; and 5) positive or negative for derivation from WB parental rat cell line.

WB, GN6, GN6TF, and GP7TB cell lines were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS, whereas GP6 and GP6TB were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium /Ham's F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS and supplemented with insulin, transferrin, selenous acid, bovine serum albumin, and linoleic acid at 1 ml/100 ml medium (Becton Dickinson). 1683 cells were routinely cultured in Waymouth's medium containing 10% FBS. To better simulate the normal hepatic milieu, a custom formulation of Chee's essential medium (CEM) demonstrated to maintain long term differentiated hepatic cell function in vitro was kindly provided by Dr. Hugo Jauregui (Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital) and prepared as described previously (26.Waxman D.J. Morrissey J. Naik S. Jauregui H. Biochemistry. 1990; 271: 113-119Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Arginine and glutamine were not present in this custom formulation and were added from stock solutions. It was not feasable to selectively delete other amino acids with this medium because custom batches missing other amino acids were only available in 100-liter batches. For experiments in which gene expression was assayed as a function of arginine availability, cells were seeded into T-75 flasks with CEM containing 5% FBS dialyzed or undialyzed with arginine or without arginine. All experiments with all the cell lines were repeated with dialyzed serum to remove serum as a source of arginine with similar results to nondialyzed serum. Medium was changed every day. Viability was at least 90% in all cases. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method (27.Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) for normal adult rat liver and a modification of that method for cultured cell lines (Totally RNA Kit™; Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was isolated from cultured cells after subculture in CEM at the appropriate time points. Aliquots (12 μg) of total RNA were size fractionated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels as described previously (20.Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzica M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were equilibrated in 1 m ammonium acetate, and RNA was transferred to Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were baked for 2 h at 80 °C and hybridized at 65 °C according to Church and Gilbert (28.Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). Rat TA1 p900, a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 816–1536 of the full-length rat LAT-1, inserted into Bluescript SK vector was labeled with [32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products; 3000 Ci/mmol) by random primed labeling (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for use as a probe. Blots wrapped in plastic wrap were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Blots were stripped and rehybridized to an 1800-bpEcoRI fragment of human 4F2hc (provided by Dr. Martin Hemler) (29.Quackenbush E. Clabby M. Gottesdiener K.M. Barbosa J. Jones N.H. Strominger J.L. Speck S. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6526-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Blots were also stripped and hybridized to an 800-bp fragment of the 5′ end of LAT-1 derived through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the 1600-bp coding region of LAT-1 using rat placenta as an RNA source followed by polymerase chain reaction of the 5′ end of LAT-1. A 1.25-kbp PstI fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used in combination with ethidium bromide staining to evaluate RNA loading variations (30.Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Densitometry using the Quantity One™ IBM software package was used to quantify differences in RNA levels with normalization to 18 S ribosomal RNA. The transport of radiolabeled amino acids by cell monolayers was performed using a modification of the cluster tray method developed by Gazzola et al. (31.Gazzola G.C. Dall'Asta V. Franchi-Gazzola R. White M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and described by Kilberg (32.Kilberg M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 564-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All 3H-labeled amino acids were purchased from NEN Life Science Products, and unlabeled amino acids were purchased from Sigma. Cells were seeded in 24-well trays such that the cells would be near confluent for the transport assay. Before the transport assays, cells were rinsed with warm Na+-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (cholKRP), in which the sodium containing salts were iso-osmotically replaced with choline, to remove extracellular Na+ and amino acids. Cells were incubated in warm cholKRP for 10 min to deplete intracellular amino acids. The uptake of radiolabeled amino acids (5 μCi of3H-amino acid/ml) at 100 μmol/liter in either 200 μl of cholKRP or NaKRP was measured for 30 s at 37 °C. Preliminary experiments indicated that uptake of each 3H-labeled amino acid was linearly dependent on incubation time up to at least 3 min; therefore, uptake was measured for 30 s (data not shown). In inhibition experiments, excess cold amino acid was added to the uptake buffer at 10 mm final concentration. Uptake was terminated by washing the cells rapidly four times with 1 ml/well of ice-cold cholKRP. After the trays were allowed to dry, the cells were incubated for 1 h with 0.2 ml/well of 0.2% (w/v) SDS plus 0.2 nNaOH to release intracellular radioactivity. A 0.1-ml aliquot from each well was neutralized with 0.1 ml of 0.2 n HCl and quantified in a Beckman LS 6000SC liquid scintillation counter. The remaining 0.1 ml was analyzed for protein content using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Transport velocities were calculated from radioactive counts, specific activities of uptake mixes, and protein absorbance values and expressed as pmol amino acid transported per milligram of protein per minute (averages ± S.E. of at least three separate determinations). Data comparing two experimental results were analyzed statistically by Student's t test using the InStat Macintosh statistics program. Each experiment was repeated at least twice to show qualitatively the same results. Detergent extracts were prepared from WB, GP6, and GP7TB cells cultured under the same conditions as for RNA preparation and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (20.Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzica M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies prepared to synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 211–221 of TA1/E16 (482–492 of LAT-1) deduced sequence were used together with chemiluminescence detection as described previously (20.Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzica M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar). Two rabbits (K and G) were immunized with the identical preparation of keyhole limpet hemocyamin-conjugated peptide. A recombinant fusion protein of TA1 with six histidines produced in baculovirus and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as previously reported (4.Mannion B.A. Kolesnikova T.V. Lin S.H. Wang S. Thompson N.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33127-33129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) served as positive control. As a negative control, blots were reacted with nonimmune rabbit serum at the same dilution. In previous studies with primary hepatocyte cultures, we found that TA1 mRNA levels could be either induced or suppressed depending on the culture medium and its amino acid concentrations (22.Shultz V.D. Campbell W. Karr S. Hixson D.C. Thompson N.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 154: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We extended these studies to examine whether the same response to amino acid availability was found in a normal rat liver epithelial cell line, WB, and whether deprivation of arginine and/or glutamine, the two amino acids manipulable in our culture system, could increase TA1 expression in these cells. WB is a diploid cell line isolated from the liver of an adult male Fischer-344 rat and has been used extensively as both an in vitro and anin vivo model system for the liver (23.Tsao M.-S. Grisham J.W. Nelson K.G. Smith J.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1984; 154: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 33.Coleman W.B. McCullough K.D. Esch G.L. Faris R.A. Hixson D.C. Smith G.J. Grisham J.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 353-359PubMed Google Scholar). WB cells were cultured in CEM, CEM without arginine, CEM without glutamine, or CEM without arginine or glutamine for 48, 72, and 96 h. Using densitometry and normalizing to GAPDH, steady state levels of TA1 RNA were 8–10-fold higher in WB cells cultured in the absence of arginine than in the presence of arginine (Fig.1). Thus, the availability of arginine was found to modulate TA1 expression, whereas glutamine availability had no effect. The apparent increase in TA1 observed after WB cells are cultured for 48 h without glutamine was found to be negligible after standardization to ethidium staining and GAPDH hybridization. In stark contrast to TA1, 4F2 mRNA levels did not vary in response to arginine availability. Similarly, glutamine availability did not affect 4F2 expression. Other amino acids were not examined because of constraints of medium composition. Since arginine availability was found to modulate TA1 mRNA levels in these nontransformed nontumorigenic cells, we used arginine availability subsequently as a tool to examine the regulation of TA1 and 4F2 in a panel of rat hepatic cell lines differing in stages of transformation and tumorigenicity. To determine the time course of the observed response, we examined TA1 and 4F2 steady state message levels at additional time points in WB cells cultured with and without arginine. WB cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, trypsinized and then seeded and cultured in CEM with or without arginine for 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. The results are presented in Fig.2. TA1 steady state mRNA levels were responsive to arginine availability in WB cells within four hours after culture in CEM without arginine. After densitometric normalization to GAPDH steady state mRNA levels, TA1 mRNA levels were approximately ten-fold greater in cells cultured without arginine for four hours versus with arginine. Normalized 4F2 mRNA levels at this time point were approximately 2.5 fold higher in WB cells cultured without arginine versus with arginine. For subsequent experiments, we chose to examine differences between response of normal and transformed, tumorigenic cell lines at time points from 24 to 72 h, since cell attachment and spreading of this integrin-associated molecule may confound data interpretation. Loss of response to positive/negative signals is one of the major events marking the transition from a normal to a malignant cell. We examined TA1 and 4F2 response to arginine availability in chemically transformed GGT-negative (GN6) and GGT-positive (GP6) WB cells, and tumor derived WB cell lines which were both GGT-negative (GN6TF) and GGT-positive (GP6TB, GP7TB) to determine if TA1 and/or 4F2 response would correlate with transformation, GGT status, or tumorigenicity. Normally, GGT is expressed in fetal rat hepatocytes, adult bile duct cells, and kidney, but during hepatocarcinogenesis it becomes up-regulated as an early event in neoplastic conversion. Hanigan has elegantly demonstrated that GGT-negative and GGT-positive mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1–6) cells grow similarly in cysteine-rich medium (>100 μm cysteine), but at physiological concentrations of cysteine (<100 μmcysteine), GGT expression confers a selective growth advantage on GGT-positive mouse hepatoma cells (34.Hanigan M.H. Carcinogen. 1995; 16: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in CEM with or without arginine for 24, 48, and 72 h prior to RNA extraction. Northern analysis was performed and the results are shown in Figs.3 and 4. Although 4F2 expression remained fairly constant in all cells, conditions, and time points, TA1 expression varied considerably. In the GGT-negative WB lines, TA1 RNA levels increased 8 to 10 fold in the absence of arginine for 72 h. In contrast, expression increased only about 2 to 4 fold in GGT-positive transformed cells largely because of higher basal level expression in the presence of arginine. Similar results were also obtained at the earlier time points, although the fold differences were lower.Figure 4Expression of CD98lc/TA1 and CD98hc/4F2 in cultured GP6, GP6TB, and GP7TB cells in response to arginine availability. Shown is total RNA from GP6, GP6TB, and GP7TB cells cultured in CEM with or without arginine for 24, 48, and 72 h (Note: RNA for GP6 cells at 24 h was not available). Northern blot hybridization of total RNA (12 μg) was analyzed by sequential hybridization to probes for TA1 (top panel), 4F2hc (middle panel), and GAPDH (bottom panel). Ethidium bromide staining was used as a loading control between lanes. Approximate transcript sizes are indicated to the right. Neither TA1 nor 4F2 RNA levels varied significantly in any cell line (more than 2–3-fold) under these culture conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the transformation status of these cell lines, in all cases TA1 RNA was expressed at a high level in cells cultured without arginine. Interestingly, although basal 4F2 expression was about 2-fold greater in transformed cells, it remained fairly constant for each cell type whether or not arginine was present in the medium. At early time points after culture in CEM, GGT-negative transformed cells express high levels of TA1 regardless of arginine availability, similar to GGT-positive cells at all time points. After 72 h of culture in the presence of arginine, reduced TA1 levels were observed in GGT-negative transformed cells similar to those seen in nontransformed WB cells cultured in CEM with arginine. These results imply the loss of regulation of TA1 at different stages of progression in these rat hepatic lines. We also examined the response of TA1 and 4F2 in another rat hepatoma cell line separate from the WB tumor-derived cell lines. In contrast to WB lines that were transformed by carcinogen treatmentin vitro, 1683 cells are rat transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma cells derived from primary carcinomas induced by feeding rats a choline-deficient, ethionine diet (25.Hixson D.C. McEntire K.D. Obrink B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3742-3749PubMed Google Scholar). 1683 cells were cultured in CEM with or without arginine for 24, 48, and 72 h. Neither TA1 nor 4F2 expression significantly changed whether or not arginine was included in the medium (Fig. 5). Steady state levels of both messages were high all the time, with only slight increases of TA1 expression (2–3-fold) at 72 h after arginine deprivation. These cells constitutively express high levels of TA1/CD98lc and"
https://openalex.org/W2085787046,"Abstract The formation of triple helical DNA has been evoked in several cellular processes including transcription, replication, and recombination. Using conventional and affinity chromatography, we purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiaewhole-cell extract a 35-kDa protein that avidly and specifically bound a purine motif triplex (with a K d of 61 pm) but not a pyrimidine motif triplex or duplex DNA. Peptide microsequencing identified this protein as the product of theSTM1 gene. Confirmation that Stm1p is a purine motif triplex-binding protein was obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using either bacterially expressed, recombinant Stm1p or whole-cell extracts from stm1Δ yeast. Stm1p has previously been identified as G4p2, a G-quartet nucleic acid-binding protein. This suggests that some proteins actually recognize features shared by G4 DNA and purine motif triplexes, e.g. Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonded guanines. Genetically, the STM1 gene has been identified as a multicopy suppressor of mutations in several genes involved in mitosis (e.g. TOM1,MPT5, and POP2). A possible role for multiplex DNA and its binding proteins in mitosis is discussed."

Since this high affinity complex likely involves a van der Waals surface area of ∼1200 Å2 and 25–35 residues on the receptor surface, analysis of side chains should delineate major interactions and the orientation of bound α-neurotoxin. Three distinct regions on the γ subunit, defined by Trp55, Leu119, Asp174, and Glu176, contribute to α-toxin affinity. Of six charge reversal mutations on the three loops of Naja mossambica mossambica α-toxin, Lys27 → Glu, Arg33 → Glu, and Arg36 → Glu in loop II reduce binding energy substantially, while mutations in loops I and III have little effect. Paired residues were analyzed by thermodynamic mutant cycles to delineate electrostatic linkages between the six α-toxin charge reversal mutations and three key residues on the γ subunit. Large coupling energies were found between Arg33 at the tip of loop II and γLeu119 (−5.7 kcal/mol) and between Lys27 and γGlu176 (−5.9 kcal/mol). γTrp55 couples strongly to both Arg33 and Lys27, whereas γAsp174 couples minimally to charged α-toxin residues. Arg36, despite strong energetic contributions, does not partner with any γ subunit residues, perhaps indicating its proximity to the α subunit. By analyzing cationic, neutral and anionic residues in the mutant cycles, interactions at γ176 and γ119 can be distinguished from those at γ55. α-Neurotoxins bind with high affinity to α-γ and α-δ subunit interfaces of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

The amino-terminal 210 amino acids principally form the extracellular domain that harbors the agonist binding sites. Agonists and competitive antagonists occupy binding sites formed at two of the five subunit interfaces, αγ (or ε) and αδ. Simultaneous occupation of both interfaces by agonist is required for channel opening, whereas occupation of a single site by antagonist is sufficient to antagonize an agonist response (5.Neubig R.R.

Four segments on the opposing γ and δ subunits also contribute to agonist binding; these include Lys34, Trp55–Gln59, Ser111–Leu119, Phe172–Glu176 on the δ subunit and corresponding residues on the δ subunit.Chang and Lee (8.Chang C.C.

Changeux and colleagues (9.Changeux J.-P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) subsequently employed this toxin to provide the first characterization of a pharmacological receptor. Since then, the α-neurotoxins have played a pivotal role in localization, identification, and purification of nicotinic receptors. Although over 100 short (60–62 amino acids) and long (66–74 amino acids) α-neurotoxins have been isolated, sequenced, and characterized, little is known about the basis of their high affinity and their exquisite sensitivity for certain subtypes of nicotinic receptors. The α-neurotoxins share a common basic structure consisting of three large polypeptide loops emerging from a smaller globular core (10.Endo T. Tamiya N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 403-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of a structurally homologous toxin, fasciculin, bound to its target acetylcholinesterase, reveal a high degree of complementarity between the surfaces and an interfacial contact zone extending over 1200 Å and encompassing nearly 30% of the α-toxin surface (11.Bourne P.

Furthermore, substitution of ε subunit residues at homologous positions in the γ subunit demonstrated a strong linkage between Lys27 on the second loop of NmmI α-toxin and Glu176 on the γ subunit of the receptor (13.Osaka H. Malany S. Kanter J.R. Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9581-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have extended this study to examine γ subunit contributions to NmmI binding and find Trp55, Leu119, and Asp174 on the γ subunit to also reside at the binding interface. Mutant cycle analysis, through reversal of charges on the three α-toxin loops, reveals strong coupling between the tip and one face of the second loop of the NmmI toxin and γLeu119, γGlu176, and γTrp55 of the nAChR. By establishing paired interactions and dissecting their electrostatic contributions, we have positioned the toxin with respect to the subunit interface, and assigned some of the binding forces that mediate the strong α-toxin-receptor interaction.

Ther. 1963; 144: 241-257PubMed Google Scholar) observed that α-bungarotoxin, a member of the α-neurotoxin family, irreversibly blocked the responses to acetylcholine in muscle. Changeux and colleagues (9.Changeux J.-P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) subsequently employed this toxin to provide the first characterization of a pharmacological receptor. Since then, the α-neurotoxins have played a pivotal role in localization, identification, and purification of nicotinic receptors. Although over 100 short (60–62 amino acids) and long (66–74 amino acids) α-neurotoxins have been isolated, sequenced, and characterized, little is known about the basis of their high affinity and their exquisite sensitivity for certain subtypes of nicotinic receptors. The α-neurotoxins share a common basic structure consisting of three large polypeptide loops emerging from a smaller globular core (10.Endo T. Tamiya N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 403-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of a structurally homologous toxin, fasciculin, bound to its target acetylcholinesterase, reveal a high degree of complementarity between the surfaces and an interfacial contact zone extending over 1200 Å and encompassing nearly 30% of the α-toxin surface (11.Bourne P. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar,12.Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Revelli R.B. Silman J. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In previous investigations of α-neurotoxin-nAChR interactions, we found that the binding site formed at the αε interface shows unique resistance to binding Naja mossambica mossambica I (NmmI) toxin due to the presence of Thr176 and Ala177in the ε subunit. Furthermore, substitution of ε subunit residues at homologous positions in the γ subunit demonstrated a strong linkage between Lys27 on the second loop of NmmI α-toxin and Glu176 on the γ subunit of the receptor (13.Osaka H. Malany S. Kanter J.R. Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9581-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have extended this study to examine γ subunit contributions to NmmI binding and find Trp55, Leu119, and Asp174 on the γ subunit to also reside at the binding interface. Mutant cycle analysis, through reversal of charges on the three α-toxin loops, reveals strong coupling between the tip and one face of the second loop of the NmmI toxin and γLeu119, γGlu176, and γTrp55 of the nAChR. By establishing paired interactions and dissecting their electrostatic contributions, we have positioned the toxin with respect to the subunit interface, and assigned some of the binding forces that mediate the strong α-toxin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2041140317,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins plays a crucial role in cell signaling by recruiting Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling molecules. Recently, we have isolated a transmembrane protein designated PZR that specifically binds tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which has two SH2 domains (Zhao, Z. J., and Zhao, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 29367–29372). PZR belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its intracellular segment contains four putative sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. By site-specific mutagenesis, we found that the tyrosine 241 and 263 embedded in the consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs VIYAQL and VVYADI, respectively, accounted for the entire tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR. The interaction between PZR and SHP-2 requires involvement of both tyrosyl residues of the former and both SH2 domains of the latter, since its was disrupted by mutating a single tyrosyl residue or an SH2 domain. Overexpression of catalytically inactive but not active forms of SHP-2 bearing intact SH2 domains in cells caused hyperphosphorylation of PZR. In vitro, tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR was efficiently dephosphorylated by the full-length form of SHP-2 but not by its SH2 domain-truncated form. Together, the data indicate that PZR serves not only as a specific anchor protein of SHP-2 on the plasma membrane but also as a physiological substrate of the enzyme. The coexisting binding and dephosphorylation of PZR by SHP-2 may function to terminate signal transduction initiated by PZR and SHP-2 and to set a threshold for the signal transduction to be initiated.

Src homology 2 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs glutathioneS-transferase N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (1.Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins occurs after stimulation of cells with extracellular stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (2.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4628) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane proteins serve as anchors for SH21domain-containing molecules that can either potentiate or inhibit signal transduction (3.Pawson T Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). Since the SH2 domains bind specifically with tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs, tyrosine kinase signaling pathways gain specificity from the intrinsic binding preferences of SH2 domains for short sequences that flank phosphotyrosine. Recently, we have purified and subsequently cloned a tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane protein that we designated PZR (4.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PZR is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its extracellular segment has significant sequence homology to myelin P0, while its intracellular portion has two tyrosine phosphorylation sites resembling immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). With a (V/I)XYXX(L/V) consensus sequence, the ITIM was initially defined in FCγRIIB (5.Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V.

ITIMs are believed to play an inhibitory role in cell signaling by recruiting terminating enzymes including protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and inositol phosphatase SHIP (13.Unkeless J.C.

Like SIRP/SHPS-1, PZR is widely expressed. However, it specifically interacts with SHP-2 but not with SHP-1 (4.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is a widely distributed intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing SH2 domains (18.Stein-Gerlach M. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Int. J. Biochem.

It shares high homology withDrosophila corkscrew, which plays a positive role in the transduction of the torso signal (19.Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that SHP-2 plays a similar positive role in mammalian cell signaling. Microinjection of anti-SHP-2 antibodies or glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein encoding the SH2 domains of SHP-2 blocks insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis (20.Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T.

Although SHP-2 plays a crucial role in intracellular signaling elicited by various growth factors and hormones, the mechanism by which this occurs and the direct targets of SHP-2 are not well understand. In the present study, we have characterized the interaction of SHP-2 with PZR by expressing various mutant forms of the proteins in cells. Our results demonstrate that tyrosine 241 and 263 embedded in the ITIMs of PZR account for the entire tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and that both tyrosine residues are required for binding of SHP-2 through its SH2 domains. Furthermore, PZR serves not only as a specific anchor protein of SHP-2, but it is also a physiological substrate of SHP-2. The physiological meaning of the interaction will be discussed. Jurkat and 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Polyclonal anti-SHP-2 serum 1263 and anti-PZR serum 105 were raised in rabbits against the SH2 domain-truncated form of SHP-2 and a GST fusion protein of the intracellular domain of PZR, respectively, as described (4.Zhao Z.J.

Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 and anti-SHP-2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Pervanadate was made by mixing 0.1 m sodium vanadate and 0.1 m H2O2 and incubating at room temperature for 20 min before adding to cells (33.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

The SH2 domains of SHP-2, designated 2SH2, N-SH2, and C-SH2, were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified from Escherichia coli by using glutathione-Sepharose beads. These proteins corresponded to amino acid residues 3–223, 3–109, and 97–223 of the SHP-2 molecule, respectively Figs.1 and 2list the cDNA constructs of PZR and SHP-2 used in this study, respectively. The PZR constructs were made with the pCDNA3 vector, and the SHP-2 constructs were built with the pRC/CMV vector, an earlier version of the pCDNA3 vector. Both expression vectors contain the cytomegalovirus promoter for high expression in mammalian cells and the neomycin resistance gene (neo) for selection with G418 sulfate. Construction of PZR, SHP-2, and catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant SHP-2 (C-S) have been previously described (4.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23.Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

Mutations of Tyr to Phe in PZR and of Arg to Lys and Cys to Ser in SHP-2 were carried out by polymerase chain reaction, and the mutageneses were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ΔSHP-2 represents an SH2 domain-truncated form of SHP-2 and corresponds to amino acid residues 200–593, while 2SH2, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain-truncated protein, contains amino acid residues 1–210. Both were made by truncation of cDNA at convenient restriction sites and religating with appropriate linkers with an initiation codon or termination codon as required. Myr-ΔSHP-2, which has a myristoylation tag for membrane targeting, was made by adding a consensus myristoylation sequence corresponding to the 15 N-terminal amino acid residues (MGSNKSKPKDASQRR) of human c-Src (34.Tanaka A.

Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to ∼2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin. Cells (1 × 107) were collected by centrifugation, washed with plain medium without serum, and then resuspended in 300 μl of the same plain medium. The cDNA plasmid (20 μg) in 100 μl of water was added to the cells. The electroporation was performed under 950 microfarads, 250 V, and 72 ohms with 4-mm cuvettes by using the ECM 600 electroporation system (BTX Inc.). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were transferred to 5 ml of complete medium and continued in culture for 72 h before further treatment. Transfection of 293 cells was carried out according to a calcium phosphate co-precipitation protocol (36.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were grown to confluency in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin and then were split 1:8 and cultured overnight to ∼25% confluency with 4 ml of medium in 6-cm plates. This was followed by the addition of calcium-DNA precipitates made by mixing 10 μg of total DNAs and 0.25m CaCl2 in BES-buffered saline containing 25 mm BES-NaOH, pH 7.3, 0.14 m NaCl, Na2HPO4. After a 24-h incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then cultured in fresh medium for another 24 h before harvesting. Transfected Jurkat and 293 cells were left untreated or treated with 0.1 mm pervanadate for 30 min. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 μmmicrocystin, 1.0 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were incubated overnight with the anti-PZR and anti-SHP-2 antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with an IP washing buffer containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4. For Western blot analyses, samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and were detected by using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One plate (150 mm) of 293 cells overexpressing PZR, PZR(F241), or PZR(F263) was treated with 0.1 mm pervanadate for 30 min, and cells were extracted as described above. The cell extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PZR serum as described above. After washing three times with the aforementioned immunoprecipitation washing buffer, beads were washed with protein-tyrosine phosphatase assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1.0 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were suspended in 0.8 ml of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase assay buffer. Aliquots of 40 μl of the suspension were used for dephosphorylation reactions that were started by the addition of 0.6 μg of purified full-length recombinant SHP-2 or its SH2 domain-truncated form, ΔSHP-2 (32.Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for up to 1 h before termination with SDS gel sample buffer. Dephosphorylation of PZR was analyzed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Our previous studies have shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR specifically recruits SHP-2 (4.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among the four tyrosyl residues in the intracellular portion of the protein, Tyr241 and Tyr263 embedded in the ITIMs are most likely phosphorylated and responsible for the binding of SHP-2. To verify this, we constructed three Tyr-to-Phe mutant forms of PZR, namely PZR(F241), PZR(F263), and PZR(F241,263), as shown in Fig.1. These mutant constructs together with the pCDNA3 vector and the native PZR construct were used to transfect Jurkat cells by electroporation, and the transfected cells were stimulated with pervanadate. The cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PZR and anti-SHP-2 antibodies. This was followed by Western blot analyses with anti-phosphotyrosine as shown in Fig.3 A. In comparison with the marked tyrosine phosphorylation of the native form of PZR, mutation of either Tyr241 or Tyr263 caused a significant decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas mutation of both tyrosine residues to phenylalanine resulted in a total loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. Western blot analyses with anti-PZR antibody revealed essentially equal expressions of PZR and its mutant in Jurkat cells. These data thus indicate that Tyr241 and Tyr263are responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR. Furthermore, as shown by the tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-2 co-immunoprecipitated with PZR, binding of SHP-2 with PZR was abolished by mutation of a single site (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that simultaneous phosphorylation of both sites is required for recruitment of SHP-2 to PZR. Immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP-2 further verified the results as shown in Fig. 3 B. Both anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PZR blots revealed strong binding of SHP-2 with the native form of PZR and minimal binding with the mutant forms of PZR. Note that the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of about 95 kDa that co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-2 in vector control cells was absent in cells overexpressing the native form of PZR. This is probably due to a competition of PZR with the protein for binding to SHP-2, presumably through a similar interaction mechanism. We further transfected 293 cells with the PZR constructs to confirm the data obtained with Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 3 C, mutation of either Tyr241 or Tyr263 markedly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR, while mutation of both residues totally diminished the phosphorylation. In all cases, the mutation caused a total loss of association of PZR with SHP-2. It should be noted that the exogenously introduced PZR constructs were overexpressed 20–40-fold, and thus the endogenous PZR in the cells did not have a major interfering effect on the results. The binding SHP-2 with PZR is presumably mediated by the interaction between SH2 domains of SHP-2 and the ITIMs of PZR. To confirm this, we performed site-specific mutagenesis of the SH2 domain of SHP-2. The crystal structure of SH2 domains revealed that residues ArgA2 and ArgB5 have a crucial role in binding by chelating the phosphotyrosine phosphate (3.Pawson T Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). The latter is within the conserved FLVRES sequence and corresponds to Arg32 and Arg138 of the N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2, respectively. The Arg-to-Lys mutant forms of SHP-2 and SH2 domain-truncated SHP-2 are shown by the schematic diagram in Fig. 2. These constructs, including SHP-2, SHP-2(R32-K), SHP-2(R138-K), and the SH2 domain-truncated form, ΔSHP-2, were used to transfect 293 cells. To increase the level of PZR, cells were co-transfected with the native form of PZR as described above. Overexpression of PZR is necessary to overcome the effects of endogenous SHP-2 that is more abundant than endogenous PZR in 293 cells. The reason for using 293 cells instead of Jurkat cells as described above is that we had difficulty expressing a high level of SHP-2 in Jurkat cells. The transfected 293 cells were treated with 0.1 mm pervanadate to induce tyrosine phosphorylation, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 antibodies. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-PZR is shown in Fig.4. Compared with the native form of SHP-2, mutation of either arginyl residue caused marked decrease in binding of PZR with SHP-2. Moreover, some of the binding seen can be attributable to co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous SHP-2 as found in cells transfected with the SH2 domain-truncated ΔSHP-2. This study indicates that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2 are responsible for binding with PZR and that both are required. To further verify the results, we performed in vitro GST fusion protein “pull-down” experiments. GST fusion proteins, 2SH2, N-SH2, and C-SH2, corresponding to the tandem SH2 domains, N-terminal SH2 domain, and C-terminal SH2 domain, respectively, were immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. Aliquots of beads containing ∼1 μg of each protein were incubated with cell extracts obtained from pervanadate-treated 293 cells, which were transfected with PZR, PZR(F241), or PZR(263). After overnight incubation at 4 °C followed by washing with the aforementioned IP washing buffer, PZR bound to the fusion protein-carrying beads was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PZR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, only the tandem SH2 domain fusion protein was able to pull down native PZR, and neither N-SH2 nor C-SH2 domain showed any significant binding to PZR. Furthermore, the interaction of the tandem SH2 domains with PZR was disrupted by mutation of either Tyr241 or Tyr263 of PZR. This provides further evidence that both ITIMs of PZR and both SH2 domains of SHP-2 are required to mediate the interaction of the two molecules. Our previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant but not the native form of SHP-2 caused hyperphosphorylation of PZR, suggesting that PZR is a putative substrate of SHP-2 (23.Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which the catalytically inactive SHP-2 prevents dephosphorylation of PZR is by binding the phosphotyrosyl motif through the catalytic domain directly. However, our study described above suggests that interaction between PZR and SHP-2 is mediated by interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIMs of PZR and SH2 domains of SHP-2, implying that PZR primarily serves as an anchor for SHP-2. Binding of SH2 domains to the ITIMs of PZR would also prevent the latter from dephosphorylation by SHP-2 or other protein-tyrosine phosphatases. To clarify this, we transfected 293 cells with a variety of catalytically inactive forms of SHP-2 as illustrated in Fig. 2. This was followed by analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins in nonstimulated cells. The expression of various forms of SHP-2 was determined by Western blotting with anti-SHP-2 serum, while tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell extracts and anti-PZR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5). As expected, overexpression of SHP-2(C-S), which has intact SH2 domains, caused strong phosphorylation of PZR, which was also associated with SHP-2(C-S). When either one of the SH2 domains was mutated, phosphorylation of PZR had a marked decrease but was still visible. However, essentially no association of the mutant SHP-2 with PZR was found. When both SH2 domains were removed, no phosphorylation of PZR was observed, even when the truncated Cys-to-Ser mutant was targeted to the plasma membrane by attaching a myristoylation tag. This indicates that the catalytic domain alone is not sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR. This may be attributable to a low affinity of the SH2 domain-truncated Cys-to-Ser mutation to the ITIMs of PZR. These results also suggest that the SH2 domain of SHP-2 is responsible for preventing dephosphorylation of PZR. This is further supported by the fact that expression of two SH2 domains of SHP-2 alone in 293 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR (Fig. 5, last lane in each panel). Nonetheless, the fact that overexpression of the native form of SHP-2 does not enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR (see Ref. 23.Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggests that native SHP-2 is able to dephosphorylate PZR. In this regard, pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and its association with SHP-2 can also be attributed to inactivation of SHP-2. It should also be pointed out that although protecting dephosphorylation of PZR by the SH2 domains of SHP-2 has a major role in causing basal tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR, activation of certain protein-tyrosine kinases cannot be ruled out. In fact, the latter might be responsible for the lower level phosphorylation of PZR induced by the Arg-to-Lys mutants of SHP-2 that showed no binding with PZR. To further reveal the tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR accompanying expression of catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2, we co-expressed SHP-2(C-S) with PZR and its Tyr-to-Phe mutant forms in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, in light of equal expression levels of PZR, PZR(F241), PZR(F263), and PZR(F241,263), only native PZR was tyrosine-phosphorylated and was associated with SHP-2. The marginal phosphorylation observed with the PZR mutants may be attributable to the endogenous PZR in 293 cells. These results further verified the data obtained from pervanadate treatment of cells as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The fact that PZR(F241) and PZR(F263) did not show significant phosphorylation as observed in pervanadate-treated cells might be due to a lower level of tyrosine kinase activation. To further verify the specific dephosphorylation of PZR by SHP-2, we performed in vitrodephosphorylation of PZR. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR was immunopurified from pervanadate-treated 293 cells and incubated with full-length SHP-2 and its SH2 domain-truncated form, ΔSHP-2. Previous studies have shown that truncation of the SH2 domains causes up to 50-fold activation of the enzyme (32.Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the samples used in this particular study, the specific activities toward 10 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate analyzed at pH 5.0 were 1,800 and 33,000 units/ml for the full-length SHP-2 and the truncated enzyme, respectively. However, when equal protein amounts of the enzymes were used to treat tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR, full-length SHP-2 caused rapid dephosphorylation, while the truncated enzyme had essentially no effect. These data indicate that binding of SHP-2 to PZR through its SH2 domains greatly enhanced activity to PZR, while the SH2 domain-truncated ΔSHP-2, despite its high activity toward low molecular weight artificial substratepara-nitrophenylphosphate, does not have sufficient affinity to bind and thereby to dephosphorylate PZR. This possibility is further supported by the fact that the Tyr-to-Phe mutants of PZR that do not bind SHP-2 could not be efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-2 (Fig.7, lower panels). The high affinity of the full-length SHP-2 to PZR is presumably conferred by the high affinity, specific SH2 domain-ITIMs interaction. The dephosphorylation probably occurs through conformational changes (which may be slow) within a PZR-SHP-2 complex that render the catalytic domain of SHP-2 capable of attacking the phosphotyrosyl residues of PZR. Nonetheless, one cannot rule out the possibility of an intercomplex reaction in which one PZR-complexed SHP-2 molecule attacks a different PZR molecule in another complex, although the efficiency might be lower in comparison with the intracomplex reaction. It should be noted that dephosphorylation of PZR by SHP-2 was not complete. This might be due to the loss of binding of PZR to SHP-2 after dephosphorylation of one of its tyrosine residues. In addition, a competition from pervanadate-inactivated SHP-2 that was co-immunoprecipitated with tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR may also cause the incomplete dephosphorylation. In any case, a higher concentration of SHP-2 (up to 5 μg/ml) helped to push the dephosphorylation to near completion (data not shown). Together, the data suggest that PZR is a substrate as well as an anchoring protein of SHP-2 and that efficient dephosphorylation requires binding of SHP-2 to PZR through the interaction between ITIMs and SH2 domains. By specifically mutating tyrosyl residues of PZR and the SH2 domain of SHP-2, the present study demonstrated that Tyr241and Tyr263 embedded in ITIMs are responsible for phosphorylation of PZR and that both are required for binding with SHP-2 through its SH2 domains, implying that PZR serves as an anchor protein of SHP-2 on the plasma membrane. SH2 domain proteins transmit intracellular signals initiated by activated tyrosine kinase-linked receptors. Three-dimensional structures suggest mechanisms by which tandem SH2 domains might confer higher specificity than individual SH2 domains (37.Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 38.Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with phosphopeptides revealed that tandem SH2 domains bind bisphosphotyrosyl peptides 20–50-fold more strongly than individual SH2 domains (39.Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It was thus hypothesized that high biological specificity is conferred by the simultaneous interaction of two SH2 domains in a signaling enzyme with diphosphorylated motifs in activated receptors or their substrates. By showing that efficient co-immunoprecipitation of PZR with SHP-2 requires interaction of the tandem SH2 domains of SH2 and both ITIMs of PZR, our study thus provides evidence at the cellular level. SHP-2 has been shown to bind to a number of growth factor receptors (17.Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 183: 182-188Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18.Stein-Gerlach M. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, in many cases, the interactions seem to be medicated by a single SH2 domain, and only a small fraction of SHP-2 and receptors were found associated. The physiological meaning of this binding might be different. Many signaling molecules with tandem SH2 domains interact with bisphosphotyrosyl motifs. These motifs include immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and the aforementioned ITIMs. Studies have shown that the space between the phosphotyrosine residues of the motifs is crucial for binding. In ITAMs, the tyrosyl residues are usually separated by 9–11 amino acid residues (13.Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 suggests that such a space would be optimal to bind its correspondent ITAMs (40.Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For ITIMs, it appears that more amino acid residues are required to fill the space. The ITIMs in PZR are separated by 21 amino acids, whereas those in KIR are separated by 29, those in LAIR-1 are separated by 29, those in PIR-B are separated by 29, those in PECAM are separated by 22, those in CD22 are separated by 33 and 19, and those in SHPS-1/SIRP are separated by 23 and 25. This long stretch can be explained by the fact that the correspondent tandem SH2 domains (e.g. SHP-2) in the intact enzyme are oriented differently, spaced widely and perpendicular to one another, so that they require the bisphosphotyrosyl ITAMs sequences to change direction to bind both sites (37.Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 38.Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). It should be noted that while the ITIMs found in other proteins have one or more proline residues separating the tandem ITIMs, the 21 amino acid residues between the two ITIMs of PZR have two consecutive glycyl residues instead, which might also facilitate a turn. In addition, this stretch contains 4 seryl residues, each surrounded by charged amino acid residues (3 His, 2 Lys, 2 Asp, and 1 Glu) and may provide phosphorylation sites, thereby regulating interaction of tandem SH2 domains and the ITIMs. Above all, the presence of unique spacing amino acid residues between the two ITIM tyrosyl residues of PZR is a distinct feature of the molecule. By showing that catalytically inactive but not active forms of SHP-2 caused hyperphosphorylation of PZR in vivo and that PZR can be efficiently dephosphorylated by full-length but not SH2 domain-truncated SHP-2 in vitro, our study also suggests that PZR is a physiological substrate of SHP-2. Overexpression of catalytically inactive mutants of SHP-2 causes hyperphosphorylation of PZR through occupation of phosphorylation sites by the SH2 domain. However, overexpression of the native enzyme did not have such an effect (23.Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggests that the SH2 domain of SHP-2 is able to prevent dephosphorylation of PZR by other enzymes but not by itself. Therefore, tyrosine 247 and 263 serve as binding site for SH2 domains of SHP-2 but can also be dephosphorylated by its catalytic domain. Binding of SHP-2 to tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR brings SHP-2 to the plasma membrane and causes its activation. Activated SHP-2 in turn dephosphorylates certain proteins in the vicinity and thereby initiates signal transduction. On the other hand, SHP-2 can also dephosphorylate PZR and thereby terminate the signal transduction initiated by phosphorylation of PZR. Furthermore, the binding and dephosphorylation process that form a futile cycle driven by hydrolysis of ATP enables phosphorylation of PZR and the activity of SHP-2 to stay at relatively high basal levels and thus set a threshold for signal transduction to be initiated. The ITIMs were defined as inhibitory motifs because they were initially found in inhibitory immunoreceptors like FcγRIIB and KIR and they mediate the inhibitory effects of these proteins on signal transduction (13.Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14.Vely F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daeron M. Vivier E. Eur.

Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since phosphorylation of the tyrosyl residue in the ITIMs triggers binding and activation of SH2 domain-containing phosphatases like the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and the inositol phosphatase SHIP (13.Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14.Vely F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daeron M. Vivier E. Eur.

Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the inhibitory function of ITIMs is thought to be executed by these phosphatases. It should noted, however, that that not all dephosphorylation means down-regulation of signal transduction. On the contrary, in many cases, dephosphorylation results in initiation of signal transduction (1.Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). For example, SHP-2 has been largely considered as a positive signal transducer (17.Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 183: 182-188Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18.Stein-Gerlach M. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In fact, the positive role of SHPS-1 in growth factor-induced MAP kinase activation is believed to be mediated by SHP-2 (41.Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukunaga K. Noguchi T. Fujioka Y. Okazaki I. Tsuda M. Yamao T. Ochi F. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9234-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After all, since the ITIMs are found in more and more diverse signaling molecules, their functions may also be diversified. PZR is unique in the way that it interacts specifically with SHP-2 but not with SHP-1 (4.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while most other ITIM-containing proteins, including KIR, PECAM, PIR-B, SIRP/SHPS-1, and gp49, bind both SHP-1 and SHP-2 (42.Olcese L.

In smooth muscle, activation of cGKI lowers cytosolic Ca2+concentrations (19.Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1146-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hyperpolarizes the plasma membrane (20.Itoh Y. Uzuki H. Uriyama H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1978; 207: 1022-1031PubMed Google Scholar), effects that are compatible with the smooth muscle relaxing activity of the enzyme. Several targets for cGKI have been implicated in mediating these effects (for review see Ref. 21.Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar; Ref.12). It is assumed that at least part of the inhibitory responses mediated by cGKI depends on the phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor (22.Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-9707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on the stimulation of the large conductance KCa channel (BK) (23.Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,24.Zhou X.B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19760-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the relaxation of smooth muscle by NO/cGMP is also associated with an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of small proteins like heat shock related proteins that appear to be regulatory components of the actin based cytoskeleton or that seem to interact with intermediate filaments (25.Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A further substrate of cGKI involved in actin filament assembling and cell motility is the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein associated with focal adhesions and areas of dynamic membrane activity (26.Markert T. Krenn V. Leebmann J. Walter U. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins may be involved in relaxation and contractions of vascular smooth muscle by regulating cytoskeletal organization and cell shape. In contrast to vascular smooth muscle, little is known about potential targets of cGKI in the gastrointestinal tract, although the relaxing effect of cGKI on this type of smooth muscle is well described (5.Huber A. Trudrung P. Storr M. Franck H. Schusdziarra V. Ruth P. Allescher H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G629-G637PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C171-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the downstream effectors of cGKI in enteric neurons remains to be established. To identify targets for cGKI, we used the yeast two-hybrid system with cGKIβ as a bait and a rat cDNA library from intestinal smooth muscle including the myenteric plexus for the interactor hunt. By applying this method we identified cysteine-rich protein 2 (CRP2) as a specific substrate. CRP2 is phosphorylated by and co-localized with cGKI. The function of CRP2 is not resolved yet, but related cysteine-rich proteins have been shown to be involved in cytoskeletal organization (28.Louis H.A. Pino J.D. Schmeichel K.L. Pomiès P.

The yeast strain EGY 48 (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3, lexAopx6 Leu2) and the yeast expression plasmids pEG202, pJG4–5, and pSH18-34 were kindly provided to our lab by R. Brent (31.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Yeast media, glucose, galactose, raffinose, and drop-out media lacking the appropriate amino acids were obtained from Difco (Hamburg, Germany) and CLONTECH (Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. The recombinant enzymes cGKIα, cGKIβ (32.Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Kamm S. Klatt P. Dostmann W.R.G. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10522-10528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and cGKII (33.Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were purified from SF9 cells. cAMP kinase was purified from bovine heart. A polyclonal antibody specific for cGKIβ (AB-cGKIβ) (15.Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was used for Western blot analysis at a dilution of 1:500. A polyclonal antibody specific for cGKI (AB-cGKI-common) was raised against recombinant cGKIα in rabbits and purified on a cGKIβ affinity column. AB-cGKI-common recognizes cGKIα and cGKIβ with identical affinity as evaluated with pure cGKI isozymes. CRP2 was detected with the polyclonal antibody AB-CRP2 raised in rabbits against recombinant CRP2 expressed in bacteria. Sensitivity and specificity of AB-CRP2 was analyzed with CRP2 expressed in bacteria and COS cells. A commercially available, murine monoclonal antibody was used to detect the FLAG epitop of the FLAG/CRP2 fusion protein (Sigma). LM/MP was isolated as described previously (5.Huber A. Trudrung P. Storr M. Franck H. Schusdziarra V. Ruth P. Allescher H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G629-G637PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from LM/MP according to the manufacturer's protocol supplied with the RNA isolation kit from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from total RNA by affinity chromatography using oligo(dT)-cellulose of the poly(A)+ mRNA isolation kit from Stratagene. The cDNA library of LM/MP was constructed using the SuperScriptTM Choice System (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 μg of mRNA and 80 ng of random hexamer primer were used for reverse transcription. For insertion of the synthesized cDNA into the two-hybrid expression plasmid pJG4–5 (34.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapters 13.1, 13.2, and 20, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), a XhoI site was included into the random hexamer primer, and EcoRI adapters were ligated to the cDNA. The cDNA was fused to the “acid loop” DNA activation domain of pJG4–5, yielding pJG4–5/cDNA. Recombinant plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli Sure® (Stratagene) cells. 1.2 × 106 independent clones carrying pJG4–5/cDNA plasmids were propagated. 5 μg of the pJG4–5/cDNA plasmids were used for transformation of EGY48 yeast cells. Growth and maintenance of the yeast cells has been performed as described (34.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapters 13.1, 13.2, and 20, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The cDNA of cGKIβ as a bait was inserted into the expression plasmid pEG202 (34.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapters 13.1, 13.2, and 20, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar) in frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA, yielding pEG202-LexA/cGKIβ. The expression of the hybrid protein was checked by immunoblot analysis with AB-cGKIβ. pEG202-LexA/cGKIβ and the reporter plasmid pSH18-34 (34.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapters 13.1, 13.2, and 20, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar) were transformed by lithium acetate (35.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) in EGY48. pJG4–5/cDNA was introduced into EGY48 in a second round of transformation. Interaction of cGKIβ with a protein encoded by the cDNA library results in activation of the reporter genes. Positive clones were identified by their blue color on Xgal plates and their ability to grow on Leu− plates in the presence of galactose. 8.5 × 105 independent yeast transformants were recovered on glucose/Ura− His− Trp− plates after 3 days at 30 °C and harvested as described (31.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 34.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapters 13.1, 13.2, and 20, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). After determination of the replating efficiency about 2 × 107 galactose viable cells were screened on selection plates. cDNA of positive yeast colonies was isolated by polymerase chain reaction, classified by restriction mapping and sequenced. Specificity was validated by transforming the cDNA of positive clones together with pSH18-34 and pEG202-LexA/cGKIβ or an unrelated bait into EGY48. CRP2 was expressed as fusion protein to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) using pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the protease-deficient E. coli strain BL21. Expression and purification of the GST fusion protein was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Removal of GST from CRP2 was achieved by digestion with PreScission Protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purity of CRP2 was analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. CRP2 expressed in bacteria was phosphorylatedin vitro by incubation at 30 °C with cGKIα, cGKIβ, cGKII, and cAK (20–100 nm) in a final volume of 20 μl 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.9, containing 1 mm MgAc, 400 μm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 10 μm dithiothreitol. Phosphotransferase activity of cGKs was stimulated with 10 μm cGMP. The reaction was started by addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol ATP) and stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1.25% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF membranes. Incorporated radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography and phosphoimage analysis (BAS-1500, Fuji, Software TINA 2.0, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and calculated by counting the photoluminescence of 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP spotted onto the PVDF membrane. CRP2 with an amino-terminal FLAG-epitop (MDYKDDDEK) was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands), yielding pcDNA3-FLAG/CRP2. COS-7 cells were transfected by DEAE-Dextran with either pMT3-cGKIβ (32.Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Kamm S. Klatt P. Dostmann W.R.G. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10522-10528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), pcDNA3-FLAG/CRP2, or both. Expression of cGKIβ, CRP2 was analyzed by AB-cGKIβ, AB-CRP2, and the FLAG-specific antibody. In vivo phosphorylation of CRP2 was performed 48 h after transfection of 5 × 105 COS-7 cells in a cell culture dish (10-cm diameter). Prior to incubation with [33P]ortho-PO43− (1 mCi/dish) (ICN, Eschwege, Germany) for 3 h at 37 °C, COS-7 cells were washed three times and incubated for 30 min with phosphate free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At the end of the labeling period, the cells were treated with 100 nm okadaic acid (RBI, Köln, Germany) and either 100 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP (Biolog Life Science, Bremen, Germany) or control buffer for 10 min. After three washes with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested and lysed with 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C. Samples were treated at 96 °C for 5 min and thereafter with 40 units of DNase for 15 min at room temperature. Prior to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the lysates were diluted 4-fold with RIPA correction buffer (12.5 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 1.25% Nonidet P-40, 1.25% sodium desoxycholat, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm benzamidine, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nm okadaic acid). Protein concentration of individual samples was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For immunoprecipitation of CRP2, 200 μg of soluble cell extract were incubated either with AB-CRP2 or with preimmune serum (4 °C, 2 h), followed by protein A-Sepharose (4 °C, 2 h) that had been preabsorbed and pre-equilibrated with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in RIPA buffer (10 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium desoxycholat, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm benzamidine, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nm okadaic acid). Samples were gently agitated during the incubation. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer. Subsequently, adsorbed proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto PVDF membranes. Phosphorylated proteins were identified by autoradiography, and CRP2 was detected by staining the membrane with the FLAG antibody. Immunoblots were visualized by incubation with an anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The putative phosphorylation site Ser-104 for cGKI was mutated to alanine by polymerase chain reaction, yielding pcDNA3-CRP2/S104A. Mutated CRP2 was sequenced to confirm the mutation. Phosphorylation of the mutant was analyzed in vivo as described above. COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG/CRP2 were fixed in Zamboni's solution 48 h after transfection. Rats were perfusion fixed with Zamboni's solution, and segments of the duodenum were immersed (4 h) in the same fixative. After cryoprotection in 20% phosphate-buffered sucrose, 12-μm-thick cryostat sections were mounted on poly-l-lysine coated slides and air dried (1 h). Following a 5-min rinse in TBS (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4), cover glasses with transfected cells as well as the duodenal sections were incubated (1 h) in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.5% Triton X-100. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Antibodies employed were diluted in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunological detection of CRP2 was performed by incubating with AB-CRP2 (1:1000) overnight. Binding of AB-CRP2 was visualized with a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400) tagged with indocarbocyanin (Cy3, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Transfected cells and sections were rinsed in TBS and coverslipped in TBS:glycerol 1:1, pH 8.6. Co-localization of CRP2 with cGKI was investigated by a sequential double immunostaining protocol. Initial experiments showed that AB-cGKI-common and AB-cGKIβ revealed identical immunological reactions in intestinal sections of the rat. However, because of its higher sensitivity, AB-cGKI-common was preferred over AB-cGKIβ for double staining experiments. AB-cGKI-common was conjugated with digoxigenin using a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To prevent unspecific binding of the digoxigenized AB-cGKI-common, an additional blocking step (1 h) was introduced using 10% normal rabbit serum in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 prior to overnight application of the antibody (1:750). After rinsing with TBS (4 × 5 min), a fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:100) was applied for 1 h. The incubation was terminated by several rinses in TBS and coverslipping in TBS-glycerol. Controls included omission of the primary antibody or its replacement by normal rabbit serum or antibodies preabsorbed with the respective antigen. To further characterize CRP2 immunostaining, sections were co-incubated in separate trials with AB-CRP2 and a monoclonal mouse anti-vimentin antibody (Dako) that specifically stains glia cells in myenteric ganglia (36.Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2206-2218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the vimentin-specific antibody and AB-CRP2 was revealed using goat anti-mouse IgG antibody tagged with Cy3 (Dianova) and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with carbocyanin (Cy2) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:200), respectively. Sections were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1000 attached to a Nikon Diaphot 300). Fluorochromes were excited with 488 and 568 nm lines, respectively, by a Krypton-Argon laser. Single optical sections were taken with a 20× objective lens (numerical aperture, 0.75) and various zoom factors. When controls and “full” incubations were compared, special care was taken to keep the pinhole and gain of the photomultiplier constant. Two channel scans were coded green and red, and merged images were documented using the software package Corel Photo Paint. To identify proteins of enteric neurons and intestinal smooth muscle cells interacting with cGKIβ, a two-hybrid screen was performed using cGKIβ as a bait and a cDNA library of the longitudinal muscle with attached myenteric plexus of the rat small intestine. Prior to the screen several control experiments were carried out demonstrating the nuclear localization of the LexA-cGKIβ hybrid bait, its binding to the lexA-operator of the lacZ and Leu reporter genes, and lack of activation of the reporters by the bait itself. The expression of the hybrid bait LexA-cGKIβ was analyzed by immunoblotting with a cGKIβ-specific antibody (15.Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) showing a 100-kDa protein that comprises the 75-kDa cGKIβ and the 24-kDa LexA (data not shown). The interactor hunt with cGKIβ as bait yielded the complete coding region of CRP2 as interactor of cGKIβ (Fig.1). The rat intestinal CRP2 consists of 208 amino acids with a corresponding molecular mass of 23 kDa. The protein consists of two LIM (LIN-11, IsC-1,Mec-3) domains each containing two paired zinc fingers with a two-amino acid linker. Each LIM domain of CRP2 is followed by a glycine-rich domain and a putative nuclear localization signal (FGPKG). An identical protein has previously been cloned from rat brain (37.Okano I. Yamamoto T. Kaji A. Kimura T. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rat CRP2 is distantly related to other cysteine-rich proteins that are grouped into the family consisting of CRP1 (29.McLaughlin C.R. Tao Q. Abood M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5477-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), CRP2/SmLIM (38.Jain M.K. Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.M. Endege W.O. Sibinga N.E.S. Yet S.F. Kashiki S. Lee W.S. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10194-10199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), CRP3/MLP (39.Arber S. Halder G. Caroni P. Cell. 1994; 79: 221-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and that formed by CRIP, which is characterized by a unique LIM domain (40.Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2516-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Rat intestinal CRP2 shares several structural features with other CRPs, i.e. the LIM domain(s) followed by the glycine-rich repeat and the nuclear localization signal. The specificity of the interaction observed in yeast cells was further evaluated by studying the potential role of CRP2 as a substrate for cGKIβ. Initial phosphorylation experiments have been performed with CRP2, which was expressed as GST fusion protein in bacteria and subsequently purified on glutathione-Sepharose. The GST tag was removed by site-specific cleavage with PreScission protease. Coomassie staining of the purified protein fraction demonstrated the purity of recombinant CRP2 (Fig. 2). The phosphorylation of CRP2 by cGKIβ was time-dependent and stimulated by the addition of cGMP. cGKIβ and cGKIα specifically phosphorylated recombinant CRP2 to a similar extent. In contrast, phosphorylation by cGKII in the presence of cGMP was about 7-fold less effective and comparable with the phosphorylation of CRP2 by cGKIα and cGKIβ in the absence of cGMP. No phosphorylation was observed with the catalytic subunit of cAMP kinase. The kinetic constants of the phosphorylation reaction were 5.8 ± 0.9 μm and 83.7 ± 9.5 nmol phosphate × min−1 × mg−1 cGKIβ (n = 4) forK m and V max, respectively (Fig. 3). A similar K mvalue has been reported for a peptide derived from the IP3 receptor channel that is phosphorylated by cGKIin vitro (22.Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-9707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V max value for CRP2 is 20-fold higher than that for a protein of similar molecular size, i.e. the 21-kDa protein Rap1B (41.Miura Y. Kaibuchi K. Itoh T. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Takai Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is anin vitro substrate for cGKI. These results demonstrate that CRP2 is specifically phosphorylated by cGK type I isozymes and may function as an in vivo substrate for cGKI. In fact, CRP2 contains a putative site for cGK-dependent phosphorylation (RKTS) in between the two LIM domains. In contrast to CRP2, such a consensus sequence for cGMP or cAMP kinases is not present in the other CRPs (Fig. 1).Figure 3Michaelis-Menten kinetic and Lineweaver-Burk plot for the phosphorylation of recombinant CRP2 by cGKI β. CRP2 at different concentrations was phosphorylated by 40 nm cGKIβ in the presence of 10 μm cGMP at 30 °C for 3 min. Each point represents the mean of four independent determinations ± S.E.K m and V max values were calculated by the software packet Origin 3.54 (Microcal Origin).

The ethanol-induced increase in MII formation was amplified by the addition of neutral osmolytes. This enhancement was linear with osmolality. At 360 milliosmolal, the osmolality of human plasma, 50 mm ethanol was 2.7 times more potent than at 0 osmolality, demonstrating the importance of water activity in in vitro experiments dealing with ethanol potency. Ethanol disordered acyl chain packing, and increasing osmolality enhanced this acyl chain disordering. Prior osmotic stress data showed a release of 35 ± 2 water molecules upon MII formation. Ethanol increases this number to 49 water molecules, suggesting that ethanol replaces 15 additional water molecules upon MII formation. Amplification of ethanol effects on MII formation and acyl chain packing by osmolytes suggests that ethanol increases the equilibrium concentration of MII both by disordering acyl chain packing and by disrupting rhodopsin-water hydrogen bonds, demonstrating a direct effect of ethanol on rhodopsin. At physiologically relevant levels of osmolality and ethanol, about 90% of ethanol's effect is due to disordered acyl chain packing.

Woodbury J.W. D'Arrigo J.S. Anesthesiology. 1973; 38: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2.Klemm W.R. Alcohol. 1998; 15: 249-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the hydrogen bonding capability of both water and ethanol, it is postulated that they compete for hydrogen bonding sites on the surface of lipids and proteins. Thus, this action of ethanol is equally applicable to mechanisms of ethanol action involving both lipid-mediated and direct protein interactions. The general importance of changes in hydration in enzyme activity is widely acknowledged (3.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 4.Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), but there is little detailed knowledge regarding how replacement of water by ethanol in specific protein-water hydrogen bonds might alter protein conformational equilibria or function. In addition, the physical properties of the surrounding phospholipid bilayer are known to modulate membrane function. Ethanol-induced changes in phospholipid hydrogen bonding have been observed to change acyl chain packing in pure lipid bilayers (5.Chiou J-S. Ma S-M. Kamaya H. Ueda I. Science. 1990; 248: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6.Chiou J-S. Krishna P.R. Kamaya H. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, the function of integral membrane receptors could be especially susceptible to the disruption of hydrogen-bonded water by ethanol. Thorough examination of the interplay between ethanol and hydration in modulating membrane receptor function requires the ability to separately analyze the effects of ethanol on both protein structure and bilayer physical properties and to be able to correlate the observed changes. Previously, we examined the effects of ethanol (8.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12752-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and a series of n-alkanols (9.Mitchell D.C. Lawrence J.T.R. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19033-19036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) on both the MI1-MII conformational equilibrium and acyl chain packing in the surrounding bilayer. In the present work, the effects of ethanol on the MI-MII equilibrium and acyl chain packing are reexamined as a function of osmotic stress. The osmotic stress protocol (10.Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) is an established method for determining changes in the number of bound water molecules associated with a specific enzymatic process. This experimental strategy is based on the fact that the effect of a neutral osmolyte on the water activity of aqueous compartments in equilibrium with a protein depends on the degree to which it is excluded from the protein-associated water. Osmolyte inaccessibility is determined by the protein topology and the size of the osmolyte (11.Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6756-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The result is that by reducing the activity of water, the presence of an osmotically active osmolyte inhibits protein conformational changes in which there is a net uptake of water and favors processes in which a protein releases water to the bulk aqueous medium. Osmolytes, which are so small that they are not excluded from any clefts or pockets on the protein surface, will not be osmotically active (12.Rand R.P. Fuller N.L. Butko P. Francis G. Nicholls P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5925-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, we employed this technique to show that the MI to MII transition of photoactivated rhodopsin is dependent upon water activity, with the MII conformation binding 35 ± 2 fewer water molecules than MI (13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin resides in the retinal ROS disc membrane, where it represents about 95% of the integral membrane protein. About half of its mass is within the lipid bilayer, while the other half makes up the hydrophilic loops, connecting the α-helices. The detailed structural information obtained recently for both the loops (14.Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9649-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the transmembrane helices (15.Schertler G.F.X. Hargrave P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) makes rhodopsin the most well characterized member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Within a few milliseconds of light absorption, a metastable equilibrium is established between MII, the conformation which binds and activates transducin (17.Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C. Beach J.M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6761-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and its inactive precursor, MI (18.Mathews R. Hubbard R. Brown P. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The MI-to-MII conformational change is the principal conformation change of photolyzed rhodopsin, and many details of this structural change have been determined (19.Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lee A. Biomembranes. 2A. JAI Press, Greeenwich, CT1996: 1-32Google Scholar), including changes in the hydrogen bonding of internal water molecules (20.Rath P. Delange F. DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21.Maeda A. Ohkita Y.J. Sasaki J. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12033-12038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous studies have determined the sensitivity of MII formation with respect to both bilayer composition and phospholipid bilayer acyl chain packing (22.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24.Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The available structural information for rhodopsin coupled with its central role in visual transduction and its relationship to neurotransmitter receptors make rhodopsin an ideal receptor on which to study the interplay between hydration and ethanol. Ethanol and osmotic stress have opposite effects on acyl chain packing. The ability of ethanol to disorder phospholipid acyl chain packing has been measured in a large number of natural and artificial membranes by several techniques (8.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12752-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchell D.C. Lawrence J.T.R. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19033-19036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25.Miller K.W. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1985; 270: 1-61Google Scholar). In contrast, osmotic stress, or lowered water activity, leads to increased phospholipid acyl chain packing with a concomitant reduction in bilayer free volume (13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26.Lehtonen J.Y.A. Kinnunen K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1981-1990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A complicating factor in most ethanol experiments, which obscures their relevance toin vivo effects, is that they are generally performed on dilute aqueous suspensions of membranes or artificial vesicles. In such experiments, the potential for in vivo osmotic conditions to alter water activity and thereby change the effect of ethanol on membranes is left in question. In this study, we examined the combined effects of ethanol and osmotic stress on both the activating conformational change of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin (i.e. the formation of MII) and on acyl chain packing of the ROS disc membrane. Intact ROS disks were prepared from frozen bovine retinas as described previously (27.Smith H.G. Litman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stachyose was purchased from Sigma, and DPH was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Samples for all studies (8 μm rhodopsin for all absorbance measurements, 1.2 μm rhodopsin for fluorescence measurements) were prepared in a low ionic strength buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 μmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.5) with the required osmolyte. Osmolyte-containing samples were then put through 10 freeze-thaw cycles to ensure that the osmolyte had equilibrated across the membrane and then were extruded through a 0.2-μm pore filter 10 times to reduce scattered light. All procedures were carried out under argon in a glove box to minimize oxidation of the polyunsaturated acyl chains of the ROS disc membrane. The osmolality of all solutions was determined with a Wescor Vapro 5520 vapor pressure osmometer. Absorbance spectra of MI-MII equilibrium mixtures ∼3 s following a flash that bleached 15–20% of the rhodopsin were acquired with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (0.2-s measurements yielded <0.3% bleach by measuring beam) (28.Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Individual MI and MII bands were resolved by using nonlinear least squares to fit the sum of two asymmetric Gaussian absorbance bands to difference spectra that had been corrected for the presence of unbleached rhodopsin (28.Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant for the MI to MII conversion is defined byK eq = [MII]/[MI]. In determining the effect of neutral osmolytes, the ethanol-free osmolyte solution served as the control; thus, when examining effects of the osmolytes on the ethanol-induced MII formation, the solution osmolality does not include the contribution due to ethanol. The change in free energy, Δ(ΔG), for the MI-MII equilibrium due to the presence of ethanol was calculated according to the following. Δ(ΔG)=ΔGethanol−ΔGethanol­free controlEquation 1 The effect of osmotic stress on the MI-MII equilibrium was analyzed using established thermodynamic relationships (10.Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The change in the number of water molecules in osmolyte-inaccessible regions, ΔN w, is given by the slope of line relating ln(K eq) and the osmolyte concentration as follows. ln(K eq)=−ΔNw×[osmolal]55.6Equation 2 Fluorescence lifetime and differential polarization measurements were performed with an ISS K2 multifrequency cross-correlation phase fluorometer with excitation provided by an Innova 307 Argon ion laser (Coherent). Lifetime and differential polarization data were acquired using 15 modulation frequencies, logarithmically spaced from 5 to 250 MHz. Scattered excitation light was removed from the emission beam by a 390-nm high pass filter. All lifetime measurements were made with the emission polarizer at 54.7° relative to the vertically polarized excitation beam and with 1,4-bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl)benzene in absolute ethanol in the reference cuvette. For each differential polarization measurement, the instrumental polarization factors were measured and found to be between 1 and 1.05, and the appropriate correction factor was applied. At each frequency, data were accumulated until the S.D. values of the phase and modulation ratio were below 0.2° and 0.004, respectively, and these values were used as the S.D. for the measured phases and modulation ratios in all subsequent analysis. Both total intensity decay and differential polarization measurements were repeated a minimum of three times. Measured polarization-dependent differential phases and modulation ratios for each sample were combined with the measured total intensity decay to yield the anisotropy decay,r(t). All anisotropy decay data were analyzed using the Brownian rotational diffusion model as described previously (29.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The results of the Brownian rotational diffusion model-based analysis were interpreted in terms of an angular distribution function,f(θ), which is symmetric about θ = π/2 (29.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The extent to which the equilibrium orientational freedom of DPH is restricted by the phospholipid acyl chains was quantified using the parameter f v (30.Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which is defined as follows. fv=1/(2f (θ) max)Equation 3 All measurements were performed at 20 °C, and all data analysis were performed with NONLIN (31.Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar), with all subroutines specifying the fitting functions written by the authors. Confidence intervals corresponding to 1 S.D. were obtained by NONLIN for both fitting variables and derived parameters. The bilayer correction to account for the effect of altered phospholipid acyl chain packing on Δ(ΔG) was calculated using the known relationship between Δ(ΔG) and f vinduced by varying independently both ethanol concentration and osmotic pressure. These relationships allowed the determination of (∂ΔG/∂f vEtOH) and (∂ΔG/∂f vOs), respectively. Specifically, the measured changes inf v due to the presence of osmolytes were subtracted from the observed changes in f v due to the presence of both osmolyte and ethanol to obtain the value of Δf vEtOH. This allowed the inclusion of the enhanced effect of ethanol induced by the presence of the osmolyte. Δ(ΔG)bilayer was calculated according to Equation 4. Δ(ΔG) bilayer=ΔfvOs(∂ΔG/∂fvOs)+ΔfvEtOH(∂ΔG/∂fvEtOH)Equation 4 Previous studies showed that both neutral osmolytes (13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and ethanol (8.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12752-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchell D.C. Lawrence J.T.R. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19033-19036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) shift the MI-MII equilibrium toward MII. In order to compare the combined effect of ethanol and osmolytes on the MI-MII equilibrium, the observed shifts in K eqwere converted to differences in the change in free energy in the presence and absence of ethanol, Δ(ΔG) (Equation 1). In the absence of osmolyte, increasing the ethanol concentration made Δ(ΔG) more negative (i.e. ethanol shifted the MI-MII equilibrium toward MII), as shown by the control curve for 0 sucrose in Fig. 1. The effect of ethanol was amplified by the presence of neutral osmolyte, as shown by the curves for sucrose and stachyose (Fig. 1). Increasing osmolyte concentration reduces water activity. The effect of decreasing water activity on the efficacy of ethanol is demonstrated by plotting Δ(ΔG) due to ethanol as a function of increasing osmolality for four different ethanol concentrations, Fig.2. The effect of 50, 100, 300, and 500 mm ethanol on the MI-MII equilibrium increased approximately linearly with increasing osmolality. Solution osmolality was varied with sucrose, except for where shown by the open symbols, which correspond to stachyose solutions. An earlier investigation of the effects of osmotic stress showed that the influence of sucrose and stachyose on the MI-MII equilibrium is equivalent at the same osmolal concentration (13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The clear trend of decreasing Δ(ΔG) with increasing osmolality for both sucrose and stachyose (Fig. 2) demonstrates that at a given ethanol concentration, reduced water activity enhances the ability of ethanol to promote the formation of the MII conformation.Figure 2Osmolality enhances the effect of ethanol on Δ(ΔG) for the MI to MII transition.

The DPH fluorescence lifetime was well characterized by a decay scheme consisting of a Lorentzian distribution plus two discrete components, which produced values of χ2 between 0.9 and 2.5. The lifetimes of the two discrete components ranged from 2.2 to 1.4 ns and from 0.27 to 0.22 ns, respectively, and together they accounted for 10–15% of the decay under all conditions. The high concentration of rhodopsin in the ROS disc membrane (1 rhodopsin per 75 phospholipids) results in substantial quenching of the DPH fluorescence due to energy transfer to the retinal chromophore. This quenching of DPH fluorescence by retinal is the probable source of the two short lifetime components. In the absence of ethanol, the center of the Lorentzian distribution ranged from 9.1 to 9.5 ns under all osmolyte conditions, and the maximum change was seen in 500 mm ethanol where this value was reduced by about 0.3 ns for all osmolyte conditions. The effect of ethanol on the decay of fluorescence anisotropy,r(t), was also increased by the addition of osmolyte. The Brownian rotational diffusion model characterizesr(t) in terms of the equilibrium orientational distribution of the probe, f(θ), and the rotational diffusion coefficient, D⊥ (29.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For a free-tumbling probe like DPH, f(θ) is especially informative regarding acyl chain packing, because f(θ) consists of the set of angular orientations that DPH is allowed to adopt within the confines of the ensemble packing of the phospholipid acyl chains. The shape of the orientation probability distribution, f(θ) sinθ, provides information about relative acyl chain packing density at different depths in the bilayer, and the extent of overlap off(θ) sinθ with a random orientational distribution indicates the degree of overall ordering of DPH by the acyl chains. Individually, neutral osmolytes and ethanol had large and opposite effects on f(θ) sinθ, as shown by comparing the curve for 0 osmolyte, 0 ethanol with those for 0 osmolyte, 500 mmethanol, and 1440 mOsm sucrose, 0 ethanol in Fig.3 A. Osmolytes narrowed the unimodal distribution centered about the membrane normal, while ethanol broadened the distribution, and this broadening was enhanced by the presence of osmolyte, as shown by the curve for 1440 mOsm, 500 mm ethanol. However, the disordering effect of ethanol was not strong enough to fully reverse the ordering effect of the osmolyte. An example of the manner in which reduced water activity enhanced the ethanol-induced changes in f(θ) sinθ is shown by the difference curves in Fig. 3 B, which demonstrate the net effect on f(θ) sinθ of 100 mm ethanol for four different solute osmolalities. The curves in Fig. 3 Bwere obtained by subtracting f(θ) sinθ obtained with the specified solute osmolality in the absence of ethanol from the distribution obtained in the presence of 100 mm ethanol at the corresponding solute osmolality. Areas below thezero line in Fig. 3 B correspond to angular orientations from which the DPH is excluded in the presence of ethanol, and areas above the zero linedenote angular orientations that are preferentially allowed by the bilayer in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol enhanced DPH orientations greater than ∼20° from the membrane normal, and an increase in the concentration of added osmolyte amplified this effect. As the osmolyte concentration was increased, 100 mm ethanol progressively broadened the probability distribution centered about the membrane normal. A convenient, quantitative means of comparing different orientational probability distributions is the parameter f v(Equation 3), which is proportional to the overlap of f(θ) sinθ for a given sample and f(θ) sinθ of a random distribution (29.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and thus is a measure of ensemble acyl chain order. A higher value of f v indicates an orientational distribution that is more like a random distribution. The separate effects of ethanol and the reduced water activity caused by increased osmolality on f v are antagonistic, with ethanol causing an increase in f v (8.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12752-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchell D.C. Lawrence J.T.R. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19033-19036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), while in the absence of ethanol, reduced water activity lowers f v(13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the net result of these two factors acting simultaneously is that the effect of ethanol is amplified by reduced water activity, as shown in Fig. 4. At 330 mOsm, the effect of 50 and 100 mm ethanol is increased by about a factor of 2.5, relative to dilute buffer conditions. Previous investigations demonstrated a direct correlation between the MI-MII equilibrium constant and f v, when both parameters are altered by changes in temperature or bilayer cholesterol content (22.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24.Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine the relationship between ethanol-induced changes in acyl chain packing and in the MI-MII equilibrium, values of Δ(ΔG) and Δf v due to ethanol were plotted against each other for each solute osmolality (Fig. 5). As the concentration of ethanol increases at each osmolality, the Δ(ΔG) values become more negative and the Δf v values become larger. For 0 mOsm, the correlation is linear; however, as the osmolality increases, this relationship becomes increasingly nonlinear. This nonlinearity suggests that Δ(ΔG) is being influenced by some factor in addition to the ethanol-induced changes in bilayer acyl chain order, reflected in the increase in f v. One of the important issues in in vitro studies of the mechanism(s) of ethanol's action on biological systems is the biologically relevant range of concentrations of ethanol (32.Deitrich R.A. Harris R.A. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present data can be used to address this issue by considering the osmolality-induced increase in ethanol potency observed when measurements made in the presence of a neutral osmolyte, at the osmolality of human plasma, are compared with the results obtained for ethanol at 0 osmolality. For example, Fig. 1 shows that 250 mm ethanol in 400 mm stachyose produces a Δ(ΔG) of −300 cal/mol, while in the absence of osmolyte 500 mm ethanol is required to produce this value of Δ(ΔG). The relationship between osmolality and the ethanol dose that is required for an equivalent effect at 0 osmolality is very linear for all of the osmolyte-containing solutions. Therefore, all of the data can be used to determine the effects of 50 and 100 mm ethanol on the MI to MII conformation change at the osmolality of human plasma, 360 mOsm. At this osmolality, 50 mm ethanol would be equivalent to 134 ± 20 mm at 0 osmolality, and 100 mm would be equivalent to 291 ± 12 mm. Thus, at the osmolality of human plasma, the potency of ethanol in the 50–100 mmrange is increased by a factor of 2.7–2.9. Using this potency factor, the substantial changes observed at 0 osmolality with 50 and 100 mm ethanol would be observed at about 18 and 36 mm ethanol, respectively, at the osmolality of plasma. The sensitivity of rhodopsin to changes in membrane composition and phospholipid acyl chain packing is well documented. Hence, it is reasonable to question whether the osmolyte enhancement of the effect of ethanol on MII formation arises through some direct interaction of ethanol on rhodopsin or via a lipid-mediated process induced by increased binding of ethanol to the bilayer. Earlier studies demonstrate that factors that increase K eq(e.g. higher temperature (22.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24.Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increased phospholipid acyl chain unsaturation (23.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24.Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decreased bilayer cholesterol (22.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) also increase f v, and changes in K eq and f v are linearly related. Ethanol-induced changes in Δ(ΔG) and Δf v are also linearly related in the absence of osmolyte, as shown in Fig. 5 A. Fig. 4 shows that osmotic stress increases the ability of ethanol to loosen acyl chain packing, as shown by the greater percentage increases in f vwith increasing osmolality for all ethanol concentrations. If all of the ethanol-induced increase in MII formation is due to ethanol-induced changes in acyl chain packing, then the correlation lines in Fig.5 A would be coincident, and increasing osmolality would simply shift each group of points to higher values of Δf v and more negative values of Δ(ΔG). However, marked nonlinearity and deviations from the 0 osmolyte Δ(ΔG) versusΔf v correlation line are observed. A possible interpretation of the nonlinearity seen in Fig.5 A is that it reflects an osmotic stress-dependent component to the enhancement of MII formation by ethanol, which acts in addition to the effect of ethanol on acyl chain packing. This interpretation is consistent with the idea that the basic mechanism whereby ethanol reduces acyl chain packing order in the core of the bilayer is unaltered by osmotic stress. This basic mechanism involves hydrogen bonding to the phospholipid carbonyl oxygen, resulting in increased average phospholipid head group spacing, which induces acyl chain disorder (33.Barry, J. A., and Gawrisch, K. (1994) Biochemistry 8082–8088Google Scholar). The increased ability of ethanol to disorder acyl chain packing with reduced water activity (Figs. 4 and 5 A) is probably due to its enhanced competition with water for this hydrogen bonding site at reduced water activity. The data in Fig. 5 A acquired in the absence of osmotic stress, the 0 osmolyte data, represent the correlation between ethanol-induced changes in the MI-MII equilibrium and ethanol-induced changes in acyl chain packing. It is similar to the linear correlation between these two parameters when both are altered by variation in temperature or bilayer cholesterol content (22.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9143-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23.Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24.Litman B.J. Mitchell D.C. Lipids. 1996; 31 (suppl.): 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 0 osmolyte, Δ(ΔG) versus Δf vcorrelation line can be interpreted as representing the susceptibility of the MI-MII equilibrium to changes in acyl chain packing due to ethanol. This allows the Δ(ΔG) versusΔf v correlation to be used to identify the fraction of the magnified effects of ethanol onK eq, which are due to changes in acyl chain packing. The slope of the 0 osmolyte, Δ(ΔG)versus Δf v correlation line indicates that an ethanol-induced increment in f v of 0.01 will decrease ΔG by 510 cal/mol. By using this relationship, we can examine to what extent the ethanol-induced decreases in ΔG under osmotic stress are attributable to changes in acyl chain packing and thus mediated by the membrane. The extra Δ(ΔG) component under various osmotic conditions corresponds to the deviation of those points on the Δ(ΔG) axis from the 0 osmolyte correlation line in Fig.5 A. The corrected Δ(ΔG) values are shown in Fig. 5 B. The results of this analysis show that under all osmotic conditions and ethanol concentrations examined, the effect of ethanol on ΔG is greater than what would be expected from the ethanol-induced increases in f v, as summarized in Fig. 6. The bars in Fig. 6represent the fraction of ethanol's effect on the MI-MII equilibrium that exceeds the membrane-mediated effect of ethanol. We would assign this component of Δ(ΔG) to a direct effect of ethanol on rhodopsin. Near physiological osmolality, at 330 mOsm, the effect of 50 mm ethanol on the MI-MII equilibrium is ∼90% due to changes in acyl chain packing and ∼10% due to a direct effect of ethanol on rhodopsin (Fig. 6). At all concentrations of ethanol, the fractional contribution of the direct effect of ethanol on rhodopsin increases with osmotic stress. This suggests that osmotic stress enhances the ability of ethanol to act directly on rhodopsin in a way that favors MII formation. It is also observed that at each osmolality the nonbilayer contribution generally decreases with increasing ethanol concentration. One of the proposed mechanisms for the effect of ethanol on receptors is a change in hydrogen-bonded water (1.Eyring H. Woodbury J.W. D'Arrigo J.S. Anesthesiology. 1973; 38: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2.Klemm W.R. Alcohol. 1998; 15: 249-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the absence of ethanol, at 20 °C, an examination of the MI to MII conversion as a function of osmotic stress showed that MII formation results in the net release of 20 ± 1 water molecules. This number increased to 35 water molecules when corrected for bilayer effects (13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If ethanol perturbs the hydrogen bonding of water to either MI or MII, it should alter the number of water molecules released upon MII formation. The effect of ethanol on ΔN w, the change in the number of water molecules in osmolyte-inaccessible regions, was assessed by analyzing ln(K eq) as a function of osmolality for each concentration of ethanol according to Equation 2 (10.Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The positive, linear correlations in Fig. 7 demonstrate that ethanol has not altered the basic relationship between increased osmolality and increased MII formation that was observed in the absence of ethanol. The values of ΔN w derived from the data in Fig. 7 are 25 ± 3 for 50 mm ethanol, 30 ± 3 mm for 100 mm ethanol, 31 ± 3 for 300 mm ethanol, and 33 ± 4 for 500 mmethanol. In our earlier studies (13.Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7617-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), adjusting Δ(ΔG) for bilayer contributions yielded a corrected number of water molecules released upon MII formation. Since both ethanol and osmotic pressure are known to have opposing effects on bilayer acyl chain packing, adjusting Δ(ΔG) for the effect of these agents on the bilayer will again yield corrected numbers of released water molecules. This correction was carried out using Equation 4, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and results in a net bilayer correction that makes Δ(ΔG) more negative for all osmolalities and ethanol concentrations. This demonstrates that the acyl chain ordering due to increased osmolality outweighs the disordering effect of ethanol, resulting in a net inhibitory contribution of the bilayer to MII formation. Plotting the corrected values of ln(K eq) versus osmolality yields about 49 molecules released upon MII formation for all ethanol concentrations studied. Here, we see that the apparent variation in numbers of released water molecules as a function of ethanol concentration is a reflection of the mixed effect of osmotic pressure and ethanol on bilayer acyl packing and not an inherent property of the system. The increase in ΔN w with added ethanol suggests that ethanol can influence a second population of loosely bound water molecules in MII. Ethanol may replace all or part of this second population of waters in the rhodopsin hydration sphere. This represents a direct effect of ethanol on MII formation, independent of its effect on the phospholipid bilayer. The direct effect of ethanol does not appear to be present in the absence of osmolyte. The formation of MII is accompanied by an increase in hydrogen bonding of one or two internal water molecules (20.Rath P. Delange F. DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); thus, it is unlikely that the pockets that release water molecules during the MI to MII transition are in the protein interior. The cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin undergoes significant structural rearrangement between MI and MII, and this is the most likely region to undergo a net loss of water during this transition. The ability of ethanol to increase the number of released water molecules suggests that there are about 15 additional water molecules, which are hydrogen-bonded to the protein in the MI conformation but which may be susceptible to replacement by ethanol in the MII conformation. A conclusion of the present study is that ethanol contributes to an increased loss of water molecules for the MII conformation relative to the MI conformation. Examination of the combined effects of ethanol and osmotic stress on both the MI-MII conformational equilibrium and phospholipid acyl chain packing makes it possible to distinguish between direct effects of ethanol on the receptor and those mediated by the membrane. Increased osmolality enhanced the ethanol-induced broadening of the DPH orientational probability distribution (Fig. 3) and the ethanol-induced increase of the parameter f v (Fig. 4). These observations strongly suggest that a portion of ethanol's enhancement of MII formation is due to increased acyl chain disorder. Prior knowledge of how membrane physical properties are related to MII formation shows that the changes in acyl chain packing are unable to account for all of enhancement of MII by ethanol under conditions of osmotic stress, as shown in Fig. 6. Ethanol increases the number of water molecules released during the MI to MII transition, suggesting that ethanol disrupts protein-water hydrogen bonds during the formation of MII. Thus, by simultaneously measuring changes both in the physical properties of the membrane bilayer and protein function, it was possible to distinguish direct effects of ethanol on the protein and effects of ethanol that are mediated by the membrane. It should be noted that at physiologically relevant ethanol concentrations and osmolalities comparable with human plasma, there is about a 2.8-fold enhancement of the effect of ethanol on MII formation. In addition, about 90% of this enhancement is derived from the effect of ethanol on acyl chain packing in the lipid bilayer. This type of analysis should provide further insight into the effects of drugs and other perturbations on receptors like rhodopsin, which have their agonist/antagonist binding site in a region of the protein, which is within the membrane."

By and large, the currently available intramolecular cross-bridging reagents are targeted to the reactive functional groups within the central cavity of Hb in domains that interact with allosteric effectors. In fact, some of the cross-linkers have been designed to mimic the interactions of the allosteric effectors. Their design strategy has focused on the complementarity between the stereochemistry of the tagging ends of the proposed bi- or tri-functional reagents and the reactive functional groups within the central cavity (1.Walder R.Y.

In view of their location within the central cavity in the modified Hbs, these cross-links offer steric hindrance for interactions with the allosteric effectors compared with unmodified HbA. An alternate plausible approach to introduce intramolecular cross-bridging into Hb is to place the cross-bridges outside the central cavity, thereby avoiding perturbation of the domains of Hb that interact with allosteric effectors. A number of side chain functional groups (sulfhydryl, amino, and carboxyl groups) of the surface residues of Hb exhibit unusual chemical reactivity toward group-specific reagents (maleimides, aliphatic aldehydes, and carbodiimide-mediated activation of the side chain carboxyl groups in the presence ofN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, respectively). The site-specific, monofunctional chemical modification approaches developed previously during the structure-function correlation studies of Hb could be adapted with the inclusion of a suitable flexible “spacer group” to develop a new class of outside the central cavity intramolecular cross-linking bifunctional reagents. Accordingly, we have been exploring the design and synthesis of new bifunctional reagents for the intramolecular cross-bridging of Hb outside its central cavity, taking advantage of the unusual chemical reactivity of one or more functional groups located on its surface. We have chosen polyethylene glycol (PEG)1 as the flexible “spacer arm” for this new class of bifunctional reagents. The availability of PEG in well defined molecular sizes will readily permit changing the length of the cross-linker without extensively changing the chemistry for the synthesis of the bifunctional reagent. For our initial evaluation of such an approach, the sulfhydryl group of Cys-93(β) was selected as the target site, because of its unusually high reactivity in the oxy state toward maleimides, and PEG2000 was selected as the spacer group. The maleimide moiety was anchored at either end of the PEG2000 spacer through a phenyl bridge. The structure of the new bifunctional reagent is shown in Fig. 1. In its fully extended form the PEG2000 spacer arm can span a distance of about 115 Å. Molecular modeling of bis(succinimidophenyl)-PEG2000 HbA, the product expected to be generated by the reaction of this reagent with HbA, demonstrated that the flexibility of the spacer arm is more than adequate for the PEG chain to wrap around the Hb molecule after one end of the reagent has reacted with the Cys-93(β) of one αβ dimer to facilitate reaction of the other end of the reagent with the Cys-93(β) of the other αβ dimer, thus achieving intramolecular cross-bridging of HbA outside its central cavity. The success of this new cross-bridging approach and the chemical characterization of this new class of intramolecularly cross-bridged species of HbA as well as its functional and crystallographic analyses are presented here. Human HbA was purified from the erythrocyte lysate, as described earlier (11.Acharya A.S. Sussman L.G. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2296-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of bis(maleidophenyl)-PEG2000 essentially involves the condensation ofp-maleidophenyl isocyanate (12.Annunziato M.E. Patel U.S. Ranade M. Palumbo P.S. Bioconjugate Chem. 1993; 4: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with PEG2000. Typically, 100 g of PEG2000 was azeotropically dried with toluene (1.5 liters) and cooled to room temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen. To this dried PEG solution was added 23 g ofp-maleidophenyl isocyanate (obtained from BioAffinity Systems, Inc., Roscoe, IL), and the solution was reheated to 30–40 °C with stirring for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered and concentrated under vacuum to about 300 ml. Five volumes of anhydrous ethyl ether was added with continuous stirring to the concentrated toluene solution. The resulting yellow precipitate was filtered at the pump, redissolved in 500 ml of anhydrous chloroform, filtered, reprecipitated with five volumes of ethyl ether, and dried to yield 100 g of light yellow solid. Infrared spectra (KBr disc) revealed the carbonyl contributed from the maleimido moiety at 1710 cm−1, which was absent in the spectra of PEG2000. This compound was designated Bis-Mal-PEG2000 (Fig.1). Hemoglobin (0.5 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was reacted with Bis-Mal-PEG2000 at the temperatures and durations indicated in the text at a protein:cross-linker molar ratio of 1:2. The reaction product was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and subjected to purification on a CM-cellulose column. The globin chains of the various hemoglobin preparations were analyzed by RPHPLC by methods previously described (13.Rao M.J. Schneider K. Chait B.C. Chao T.L. Keller H.L. Anderson S.M. Manjula B.N. Kumar R.A. Acharya A.S. Artif. Cells Blood Substit. Immobil. Biotechnol. 1994; 22: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The formation of oligomeric forms of Hb was evaluated by size exclusion chromatographic analysis of the cross-linked Hb on Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.4. The formation of intramolecularly cross-linked species was also monitored by size exclusion chromatographic analysis of the cross-linked Hb on the same Superose 12 column but using 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.4, containing 0.9 mMgCl2 as the eluant. Tryptic peptide mapping of the globin samples and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the peptides were carried out as described (13.Rao M.J. Schneider K. Chait B.C. Chao T.L. Keller H.L. Anderson S.M. Manjula B.N. Kumar R.A. Acharya A.S. Artif. Cells Blood Substit. Immobil. Biotechnol. 1994; 22: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The -SH content of unmodified and cross-linked Hb was estimated by reaction with 4,4-dithiopyridine (14.Ampulski R.S. Ayers V.E. Morell S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out as described previously (15.O'Donnel J.K. Birch P. Parsons C.T. White S.P. Okabe J.F. Martin M.J. Adams C. Sundarapandiyan K. Manjula B.N. Acharya A.S. Logan J.S. Kumar R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27692-27699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen equilibrium curves for the cross-linked Hb were determined using a Hem-O-Scan (Aminco). Before crystallization, Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was first stripped of organic and inorganic ions by passing it through a Dintzis column (16.Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that was modified by adding a 1-mm layer of chelating resin (iminodiacetic acid, Sigma No. C-7901) to the top of the column. Stripped Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was then concentrated to ∼100 mg/ml and was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until being used for crystallization. Crystals of the deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA were grown at room temperature according to a batch method with the addition of a seeding step as described previously by Kavanaugh et al. (17.Kavanaugh J.S. Weydert J.A. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4358-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specifically, the crystallization conditions were 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.0, 100 mm potassium chloride, 3 mmsodium dithionite, and 10∼12% PEG 6000. Crystals grew in about 4 weeks to a size of 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm × 0.6 mm and were isomorphous with those of deoxy-HbA (18.Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4111-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (space group P21212 with a = 97.4 Å,b = 99.3 Å, and c = 66.1 Å). Diffraction data were collected on a single crystal using a Rigaku AFC6 four-circle diffractometer fitted with a San Diego Multiwire Systems area detector. A total of 244,427 measurements were made of 34,179 unique reflections. All diffraction data were scaled and merged according to the procedure of Howard et al. (19.Howard A.J. Nielson C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This data set for deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA is 97.5% complete at 2.16 Å and 88.1% complete for the highest resolution shell (2.33 Å–2.16 Å). The R symm value of this data set is 7.3% on intensity. A difference electron density map calculated with (F deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA −F deoxy-HbA) amplitudes and phases derived from the refined structure of deoxy-HbA contained three significant features: positive difference density extending from the ends of the Cys-93(β1) and Cys-93(β2) side chains, negative difference density at the positions of Asp-94(β1) and Asp-94(β2) side chains, and negative difference density at the positions of His-146(β1) and His-146(β2) side chains. Based on this information, a starting model for deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was constructed from the refined crystal structure of deoxy-HbA by 1) converting Cys-93(β1) and Cys-93(β2) into alanine residues, 2) converting Asp-94(β1) and Asp-94(β2) into alanine residues, and 3) deleting the last four residues (residues 143–146) of each β subunit. Initial refinement of this model consisted of rigid body refinement with X-PLOR (20.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar) followed by stereochemical-restrained least-square refinement with PROLSQ (21.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Next, (2F obs − F calc) and (F obs − F calc) electron density maps were used with the TOM/FRODO software (22.Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) to position the side chains at residues 93(β) and 94(β) and add residues His-143, Lys-144, and Tyr-145 to the β1 and β2 COOH termini. The COOH-terminal residues of both β subunits were built in as alanines because of the complete absence of electron density for the imidazole group of His-146(β). Although the chemical modifications of Cys-93(β1) and Cys-93(β2) are confirmed (see “Results”), the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-linker was not built into the atomic model due to its weak electron density. Final refinement of the atomic model was carried out with PROLSQ. The R andR free values of the refined crystal structure of deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA are 17.2 and 23.2%, respectively. This atomic model has good stereochemistry; the root mean square deviation from ideal bond lengths is 0.008 Å, and the root mean square deviation from ideal bond angles is 1.2°. HbA, 0.5 mm in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 at room temperature for 2 h, and the products of the reaction were analyzed by RPHPLC and size exclusion chromatography. A comparison of the RPHPLC map of the globin chains of Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA with that of unreacted HbA revealed that the β-chains of the protein have been quantitatively derivatized (Fig. 2). The modified β-globin eluted at a new position, slightly later than the α-globin. The quantitative modification of the β-chains of HbA on incubation with Bis-Mal-PEG2000, even with only a 2-fold molar excess of the maleimide moiety over the sulfhydryl groups, reflects the high reactivity of the maleimide group of the bifunctional reagent with the -SH groups of the protein. Kinetic studies of this reaction have indicated that the reaction is essentially complete in less than 1 h. Our studies have also indicated that this reaction can be carried out at 4 °C; generally, a longer reaction period was employed at the lower temperature. Analysis of the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 reacted HbA by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column in 50 mm BisTris-Ac, pH 7.4, revealed that >95% of the protein elutes as a 64,000-dalton species (tetrameric), and only a trace amount is present as the octameric species (Fig. 3 A). Since the β-chains in the Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA have been quantitatively derivatized (Fig. 2), the gel filtration data suggested that either each β-chain of the tetramer carries 1 mol of covalently bound polyethylene glycol (i.e. HbA monofunctionally modified by the bifunctional reagent), or the two β-chains of the tetramer are intramolecularly cross-linked. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA was analyzed by SEC on the Superose 12 column in the presence of 0.9 mMgCl2 (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions, control HbA and monofunctionally modified HbA will dissociate into αβ dimers (apparent molecular size of 32,000 daltons), whereas HbA intramolecularly cross-bridged between the like chains will remain a tetramer (64,000 daltons) (23.Macleod R.M. Hill R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4875-4879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 3 B, in the presence of 0.9 m MgCl2 nearly all of the Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA eluted at the 64,000-dalton position, whereas the control HbA was completely dissociated into αβ dimers. Thus, the results of SEC under dissociating and nondissociating conditions together with the results of the RPHPLC analysis of the globin chains suggested stabilization of the hemoglobin tetramer by intramolecular cross-linking of its two β-chains by Bis-Mal-PEG2000. Hence, the modified β-chain in the RPHPLC map of Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA (Fig. 2) represents cross-bridged β-chains. The complete absence of the dimeric species in the Bis-Mal-PEG2000-modified HbA, as seen by the SEC analysis under dissociating conditions, indicated that the intra-molecular cross-linking of HbA by Bis-Mal-PEG2000 is essentially quantitative, a result that is consistent with the results of RPHPLC. Further confirmation of the intra-molecular cross-bridging of β-chains in Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA was obtained by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4). Unreacted HbA contained a band at 16,000 daltons corresponding to the α- and the β-chains (Fig. 4, lane B). On the other hand, Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA contained a band at 16,000 daltons and an additional band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 32,000 daltons (Fig. 4, lanes C). The SDS-PAGE pattern of ββ-sebacyl HbA and αα-fumaryl HbA, two central cavity cross-bridged Hbs, are also shown in Fig. 4 (lanes D andE) for comparison. Like the Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA, these central cavity-cross-bridged HbA species do not dissociate into αβ dimers in the presence of 0.9 m MgCl2and contain a 32,000 dalton species. The specificity of the maleimides to the sulfhydryl groups of proteins suggests that the cross-bridging of HbA by Bis-Mal-PEG2000 is through its cysteine residues. This was further confirmed by the observation that HbA preincubated with N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl reagent, did not form any intramolecularly cross-bridged species on reaction with Bis-Mal-PEG2000 (data not shown). The Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA was subjected to purification on a CM-cellulose column (Fig. 5). Consistent with the RPHPLC analysis, the Bis-Mal-PEG2000-reacted HbA did not contain any unreacted HbA. All of the modified HbA eluted slightly ahead of HbA as a single symmetrical peak, demonstrating homogeneity of the reaction product. The protein was pooled as indicated in the figure, concentrated, and designated as Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA. The isoelectric point of the purified Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was nearly the same as the parent-unmodified HbA (Fig. 5, inset A), demonstrating that the intramolecular cross-linking has very little influence on the overall ionization behavior of the protein. SEC analysis of the purified Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA in the presence of MgCl2 reconfirmed the stabilization of its tetrameric structure against dissociation by intramolecular cross-linking (Fig. 5, inset B). Estimation of the sulfhydryl groups revealed the presence of two reactive -SH groups in oxy-HbA and its total absence in oxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA (data not shown). Tryptic peptide map of the cross-linked β-globin revealed the presence of a new peptide that eluted around 80 min (Fig.6). Amino acid sequence analysis of this new peptide confirmed it to be the β-chain region corresponding to residues 83–104 (data not shown), except for the fact that no amino acid could be detected in the eleventh cycle. This position corresponds to that of Cys-93(β), suggesting that this residue is modified in the new peptide. Thus, it is clear that Bis-Mal-PEG2000 has covalently bridged the two Cys-93(β) residues of HbA, thereby stabilizing its tetrameric structure against dissociation. A comparison of the oxygen binding properties of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA and control HbA, measured in 50 mm BisTris acetate, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, is shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the intramolecular cross-bridging has induced only a negligible left shifting of the O2 affinity of HbA. Furthermore, analysis of the Hill plot (Fig. 7, inset) revealed that the cooperativity of the cross-linked protein remains essentially the same as the control HbA. In addition to 50 mm BisTris acetate, pH 7.4, the O2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was also determined in three other buffers, namely 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, and 50 mm BisTris, 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4. As can be seen in TableI, the increase in O2affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA relative to control HbA was only marginal in the BisTris acetate buffer, whereas it was somewhat higher in the other three buffers. As can be seen from Table I, the O2 affinity of HbA is significantly lower (higher P50) in the HEPES, phosphate, and BisTris-Tris acetate buffers relative to the BisTris acetate buffer, whereas that of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA remained essentially the same in all the four buffers. Thus, the relatively higher left-shifting of the O2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA in the former buffers is a reflection of the propensity of these buffers to reduce the O2 affinity of unmodified HbA but not that of the cross-linked HbA. These results suggest that the cross-bridging has lowered the sensitivity of HbA to the buffer ions.Table IO2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA in various buffersBufferP50Log P50Bis-Mal- PEG2000 HbA Log P50 HbAHbABis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA50 mmBisTris-Ac, pH 7.44.33.60.8950 mmBisTris-Ac, 50 mm Tris-Ac, pH 7.46.03.80.7450 mm HEPES, pH 7.46.43.90.7250 mm Potassium phosphate, pH 7.46.93.50.65O2 affinity measurements were carried out at 37 °C using a Hem-O-Scan, at a protein concentration of 0.75 mm. Open table in a new tab O2 affinity measurements were carried out at 37 °C using a Hem-O-Scan, at a protein concentration of 0.75 mm. The influence of intramolecular cross-bridging on the O2 affinity of HbA was also measured as a function of pH in the range of pH 6.0 to 8.0 in 50 mm BisTris, 50 mm Tris acetate as well as in 100 mm phosphate buffer (Fig.8). At all the pHs investigated, both HbA and Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA exhibited a lower oxygen affinity in phosphate buffer compared with that in BisTris-Tris acetate buffer. However, at all the pHs examined, the lowering of O2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000-HbA by phosphate was significantly smaller than that observed with HbA. The Bohr effect of HbA is around 0.43 in both the BisTris-Tris acetate and the phosphate buffers. The Bohr effect in both the buffers is considerably lowered on Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-linking of HbA. The Bohr effect is 0.17 in the BisTris-Tris acetate buffer and is 0.13 in the phosphate buffer. Thus, the cross-bridging has drastically reduced the propensity of the protein to transition into a low O2affinity structure as the pH is lowered from the neutral pH. A structural consequence of lowering the pH is protonation of the ionizable functional groups of Hb with pK a around neutral pH. This protonation can modulate the electrostatic interactions of the protein and is translated as a lowered O2 affinity of the heme site. The Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-bridging has reduced the protonation effect on the O2affinity of the HbA. This could be a consequence of a change in the pK a of a residue or sensitivity of the cross-bridged protein to the protonation effect. The propensity of allosteric effectors to reduce the O2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was determined in 50 mm BisTris-Ac buffer, pH 7.4 (TableII). Like HbA, Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was also sensitive to the presence of DPG and IHP. However, the response of the cross-linked HbA to these effectors was diminished relative to HbA. Similarly, the oxygen affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA was also responsive to the presence of chloride but to a lesser degree relative to HbA (Table II).Table IIModulation of the O2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA by allosteric effectorsEffectorsP50Log P50Bis-Mal- PEG2000 HbA Log P50 HbAHbABis-Mal-PEG2000 HbANone4.33.60.89DPG (1:5)18.610.50.80IHP50.025.00.821 mNaCl14.87.40.74IHP + 1 mNaCl16.07.50.73O2 affinity measurements were carried out in 50 mmBisTris-Ac, pH 7.4, at 37 °C in a Hem-O-Scan and at a protein concentration of 0.75 mm. Open table in a new tab O2 affinity measurements were carried out in 50 mmBisTris-Ac, pH 7.4, at 37 °C in a Hem-O-Scan and at a protein concentration of 0.75 mm. Consistent with the solution studies described above, electron density images of the regions surrounding Cys-93(β) (Figs. 9,A and B) clearly show that this residue is chemically modified. Although the ends of the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-link can be seen (Fig. 9 B), there is very little significant electron density for the remainder of the molecule. Since the sulfhydryl groups of Cys-93(β)s are located near the protein surface, it was expected that the intramolecular cross-linker would be fully exposed to solvent. The lack of electron density supports this conjecture and indicates that the middle part of the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-link is highly disordered. Moreover, the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-link appears to be long and flexible enough to allow the binding of DPG (see above) despite the fact that the cross-linker must extend over (or in the vicinity of) the DPG binding site to bridge the two Cys-93(β)s. Our x-ray diffraction analysis also reveals that the salt bridge present in the deoxy-HbA structure between the side chains of Asp-94(β) and His-146(β) is disrupted in deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA. Specifically, the covalent linking of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 to Cys-93(β) results in the complete disappearance of the electron density associated with the side chains of Asp-94(β) and His-146(β) (Figs.9, A and B), indicating that both side chains are displaced as a consequence of the chemical modification. The displacement of these side chains is clearly due to steric collision between the cross-linker and the side chain atoms of Asp-94(β) and His-146(β). Relative to deoxy-HbA, the main chain atoms of the β COOH-terminal dipeptides (residues Tyr-145(β) and His-146(β)) of deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA move by ∼0.5 Å. Furthermore, an approximately 2-fold increase in the average main chain atomic temperature factors of these regions with respect to deoxy-HbA is also observed. Thus, the backbone atoms of the β COOH-terminal dipeptides have higher mobility in deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA relative to HbA. These influences are likely due to the combined effects of the presence of cross-linker and the loss of the intra-subunit salt bridge between Asp-94(β) and His-146(β). Consistent with the crystal structure of des-His-146(β) deoxyhemoglobin (24.Bettati S. Kwiatkowsko L.D. Kavanaugh J.S. Mozzarelli A. Arnone A. Rossi G.L. Noble R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33077-33084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in which the salt bridge between Asp-94(β) and His-146(β) is also absent, no significant increase in the mobility is detected for the phenol group of Tyr-145(β) despite a small repositioning of this side chain. With the exception of the tertiary structure changes described above, the overall tertiary and quaternary structures of deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA are almost identical to the T conformation of deoxy-HbA. In particular, the intersubunit salt bridge between the His-146(β) carboxyl group and Lys-40(α) side chain is still present in deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA, and the phenol group of Tyr-145(β) remains in its binding pocket between Cys-93(β), Pro-100(β), and the backbone carbonyl of Val-98(β). It is well known that crystals of deoxy-HbA disorder when they are exposed to air (25.Haurowitz F.Z. Physiol. Chem. 1938; 254: 268-274Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26.Anderson L. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a phenomenon associated with the large ligand-induced structural transition in HbA. However, it has been observed that the deoxy crystals of some high affinity mutant hemoglobins that have greatly reduced cooperativity continue to diffract x-rays after they are exposed to air (27.Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Am. Crystallographic Assoc. Annual Meeting, St. Louis, MO, July 19–25. 1997; 24 (abstr.): 93-94Google Scholar). Our studies also indicated that, like the deoxy-HbA crystals, the crystals of deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA disorder upon exposing to air, thus supporting the conclusion that the cooperativity and the ligand-induced allosteric transition are not affected by the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-linking. The data presented in this study reveal that Bis-Mal-PEG2000 introduces intra-tetrameric cross-linking between the two β-chains of HbA and, thus, stabilizes the protein against dissociation into dimers. This intra-tetrameric cross-linking reaction is extremely facile, quantitative even with only a 2-fold molar excess of the reagent, and goes to completion within 2 h at room temperature. Chemical characterization has confirmed that the cross-bridging is at the two Cys-93(β) residues. Thus, Bis-Mal-PEG2000 stabilizes the tetrameric structure of HbA by site-specific intramolecular cross-bridging outside its central cavity. Some of the advantages of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 intramolecular cross-bridging reaction are: 1) oxy conformation specificity of the reaction, 2) mild reaction conditions of short duration, and 3) nearly quantitative cross-linking. Furthermore, the reaction is highly site-specific, since it is targeted to the -SH groups of the protein. The site specificity is further enhanced by the fact that there are only three -SH groups per αβ dimer, of which only the β93 -SH group is highly reactive in the oxy conformation. Thus, there is only one reactive site per αβ dimer. In addition, despite its large size, the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 reagent itself is of defined size. The high specificity of the reagent combined with its defined size facilitates the generation of a homogeneous product. The modification of HbA at Cys-93(β) with Bis-Mal-PEG2000 had only a limited influence on its O2 affinity at neutral pH, and the modified protein retained a cooperativity comparable with native HbA. However, the modified protein exhibited a reduced sensitivity of its O2 affinity to buffer ions and allosteric effectors and a reduced Bohr effect. Crystallographic analysis revealed that, with the exception of the loss of the salt bridge between His-146β and Asp-94β, the overall tertiary as well as the quaternary structures of deoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA are almost identical to the T-conformation of deoxy-HbA, an observation that is consistent with the high cooperativity of the modified protein. In a recent study, Gottfriedet al. (28.Gottfried D.S. Juszczak L.J. Fataliev N.A. Acharya A.S. Hirsch R.E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1571-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) observe that carbonmonoxy-Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA shows a significant increase in the binding for a fluorescent analog of DPG, suggesting that the ββ cleft of this cross-bridged HbA is either more open or more flexible relative to that in carbonmonoxy-HbA. Thus, although generated under oxy conformation conditions, the Bis-Mal-PEG2000 cross-bridging of HbA has induced deoxy-like features into the protein. The slightly higher O2 affinity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA and the reduced sensitivity of the O2affinity to the various effectors, despite the more deoxy-like features of its ββ cleft in the oxy conformation, suggest that in the absence of the -SH groups of Cys-93(β), the deoxy-like structure of the DPG pocket is not coupled to the heme pocket. Luisi and Nagai (29.Luisi B.F. Nagai K. Nature. 1986; 320: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) report the crystallographic structure of Hb-Nympheas, a Cys-93(β) → Ser mutant of HbA. At neutral pH, Hb-Nympheas (Cys-93β → Ser) has an O2 affinity in 50 mm BisTris, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm HCl, slightly increased over reconstituted HbA, with a cooperativity comparable with the latter (30.Nagai K. Perutz M.F. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7252-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA described in the present study appears to be similar to Hb-Nympheas with respect to O2 affinity and cooperativity. However, Hb-Nympheas and Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA differ in their response to DPG. Hb-Nympheas exhibits a normal DPG response, whereas Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA exhibits a reduced DPG response. These results suggest that the -SH group of Cys-93(β) of HbA and the -OH group of Ser-93(β) of Hb-Nympheas probably play a nearly similar structural role in facilitating the coupling of the interaction of DPG at the ββ cleft, i.e.the deoxy-like features of the ββ cleft, to the heme site. In contrast, the structural consequences of converting the -SH group into an S-succinimidyl derivative in Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA are quite distinct. Crystallographic analysis of deoxy-Hb-Nympheas has indicated that Asp-94(β) has moved closer to Ser-93(β) and forms a hydrogen bond with the -OH group of Ser-93(β), which is in equilibrium with the normal salt bridge between Asp-94(β) and His-146(β). In contrast, this salt bridge between Asp-94(β) and His-146(β) has disappeared in the crystal structure of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA. This result suggests that the translation of the electrostatic interactions at the ββ cleft as lowered O2 affinity of the heme requires the integrity of the salt bridge between Asp-94(β) and His-146(β). Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA is quite distinct from the other intramolecularly cross-bridged Hbs reported to date and represents a new class of intramolecularly cross-bridged Hb. It is the first β93β93 intramolecularly cross-bridged species reported to date. The previously described bisdibromosalicyl derivatives of aliphatic carboxylic acids and the bispyridoxal phosphates stabilize the tetrameric structure of HbA by cross-linking the amino groups within its central cavity (1.Walder R.Y.

In contrast, Bis-Mal-PEG2000 stabilized the tetrameric structure of Hb by cross-bridging two reactive surface residues on the β-chains that are outside the central cavity of the molecule. Accordingly, we refer to this ββ-cross-bridged species as “outside the central cavity” intramolecularly cross-bridged Hb to distinguish it from the central cavity cross-bridged Hbs. In the central cavity cross-bridged Hbs, the spacer arm is short and is occupying the central cavity. On the other hand, the long flexible spacer arm of the cross-bridge in Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA projects into the solvent and does not occupy the central cavity. Thus, despite intramolecular ββ-cross-linking, the central cavity of Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA is open for interaction with the allosteric effectors. Bis-Mal-PEG2000 HbA differs, therefore, from the previously described ββ-cross-linked Hbs, namely ββ-fumaryl, ββ-sebacyl, and ββ-bispyridoxal tetraphosphate HbAs, having cross-bridges within the ββ-cleft of the central cavity that almost completely block the action of allosteric effectors like DPG. Thus, the “outside the central cavity”-cross-bridging approach described in the present study could be of potential value for the generation of new Hb-based therapeutics."

In a human interleukin-3-dependent cell line transfected with the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor c-mpl(F-36P-mpl), either treatment with TPO or the overexpression of activated ras (Ha-RasG12V) induced megakaryocytic maturation with polyploid formation.

Megakaryocytopoiesis is performed through a series of complex processes that involve proliferation of committed precursor cells and subsequent differentiation of their progeny leading to cytoplasmic maturation and platelet fragmentation. During the late phase of megakaryocytopoiesis, megakaryocytes are known to undergo endomitosis (also called endoreplication), which is characterized by DNA replication without concomitant cell division. In hematopoietic cells, endomitosis is a phenomenon unique to megakaryocytic lineage cells, while it is also observed in other cell types, including cells of liver, urinary bladder epithelium, trophoblast and salivary gland (12.Brodsky W.Y.

Although a number of investigators have investigated the mechanisms of megakaryocytic endomitosis, the results of these studies were contradictory: some studies demonstrated that endomitosis was accompanied by low cdc2 activities due to the down-regulation of CDC25C phosphatase or the decreased expression of cyclin B1 (14.Zhang Y.

Thus, the precise mechanism underlying megakaryocytic endomitosis remains largely unknown. Thrombopoietin (TPO) was cloned as a ligand for the c-mplproto-oncogene. It is a member of hematopoietin receptor superfamily with high sequence similarity to the receptors for erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The c-Mpl is expressed in hematopoietic tissues, particularly in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets, while its ligand TPO is primarily produced in the liver, kidney, and smooth muscle, with lesser amounts present in the spleen and bone marrow (for a review, see Ref. 18.Kaushansky K.

Furthermore, the c-mpl- or TPO-deficient mice generated by gene targeting were reported to reveal a striking decrease in the number of platelets and megakaryocytic progenitor cells (24.Gurney A.L. Carver-Moore K. Sauvage F.J. Moore M.W. Science. 1994; 265: 1445-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 25.de Sauvage F.J. Carver-Moore K. Luoh S.M. Ryan A. Dowd M. Eaton D.L. Moore M.W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the TPO/c-Mpl system is a physiologic regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. The binding of TPO to c-Mpl activates a variety of signaling molecules such as the Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAK), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and Ras, and recent studies have provided some insight into functional domains of c-Mpl and TPO-activated signaling molecules associated with cell growth and differentiation (26.Gurney A.L.

By using a c-mpl-transfected, interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent human erythroleukemia cell line, F-36P-mpl, that can differentiate at a high rate into mature megakaryocytes in response to TPO, we have previously shown that prolonged Ras activation was crucial for TPO-induced megakaryocytic differentiation (30.Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Wakao H. Hattori S. Hashimoto K. Sugahara H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, megakaryocytic differentiation of F-36P-mpl cells could be induced by the prolonged (greater than 24 h) expression of activated Ras (Ha-RasG12V). These results suggested that TPO-activated Ras signaling might be involved in the regulation of megakaryocytic endomitosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of TPO- or activated Ras-mediated endocytosis remain to be determined. In this study, we have investigated the effects of TPO and Ha-RasG12V on the expression and function of cell cycle regulating molecules, and have found that TPO- and Ha-RasG12V-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of F-36P-mpl cells was accompanied with the sustained expression of D-type cyclins and decreased cdc2 kinase activity. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that overexpression of each D-type cyclin along with a dominant negative (dn) form of cdc2 was sufficient for inducing megakaryocytic differentiation of F-36P-mplcells. Thus, we provide evidence that increased cyclin D expression together with decreased cdc2 activity may contribute to megakaryocytic endomitosis.

These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Nakarai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Flow, North Ryde, Australia) in the presence of 10 ng/ml rhIL-3 at 37 °C. Human cyclin D1 cDNA was generously provided by Dr. A. Arnold (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Human cyclin D2 and D3 cDNAs were supplied by Dr. G. Peters (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). A dn form of cdc2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Ed Harlow (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). These cDNAs were subcloned into NotI site of pRSVICAT (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene by usingNotI linkers. Other cDNAs were kindly provided from the investigators as follows: human p21 waf1 from Dr. A. Noda (Meiji Institute of Health Science, Odawara, Japan); human p27 kip1, cyclin A, cyclin B, cdk2, and cdk4 from Dr. H.

Kataoka (Institute of Medical Science Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan); murine p18 ink4c from Dr. C. Sherr (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), respectively. To express a target cDNA, we used a LacSwitchTMII inducible expression system (Stratagene). In short, F-36P-mpl cells, that are already transfected with an expression vector of Lac repressor (Lac-R), pCMV-LacI, were further transfected with pOPRSVI each containing cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and dn-cdc2. After culture with G418 (Sigma) at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. G418-resistant cells were cloned and induction levels of the target protein were examined before and after treatment with 0.5 mm IPTG by Western blot analyses. The expression vector pOPRSVI contains the RSV promoter linked to the Escherichia coli lactose operon, and expression of a target cDNA is suppressed by the Lac-R through the lactose operon. When IPTG was added to culture medium, Lac-R was released from lactose operon and transcription of the target cDNA was initiated. The surface expression of GP IIb-IIIa was examined with AP2 monoclonal antibody by the indirect immunofluorescent method on FACSort (Beckon Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) (33.Matsumura I. Kanakura Y. Kato T.

The DNA content of cultured cells was quantitated by staining with propidium iodide and analyzed on FACSort as described previously (5.Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y.

Tsujimura T. Nishiura T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 703-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of cell lysates, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed according to the methods described previously (5.Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultured cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. The whole cell lysates (15 μg/each lane) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking the residual binding sites on the filter, immunoblotting was performed with an appropriate antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Immune complex kinase assay was performed as described previously (5.Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, cdc2, cdk4, or cdk6 was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of total cellular lysates obtained from the cultured cells. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) into 20 μl of the kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm NaVO4, 0.4 mm sodium fluoride, and 40 μm nonradioactive ATP) and performed at 30 °C for 20 min (within a linear incorporation kinetics) by using an appropriate substrate. Cdk4 and cdk6 activities were evaluated with 2 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-Rb as a substrate, and cdc2 activities were with 5 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). After addition of protein loading buffer, samples were boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm the amount of immunoprecipitates, then destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In a previous study, we have reported that megakaryocytic differentiation of F-36P-mpl cells was induced by 5-day culture with rhTPO, and that of F-36P-H-rasG12V cells by 5-day treatment with IPTG causing induced expression of activated Ras (Ha-RasG12V) (30.Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Wakao H. Hattori S. Hashimoto K. Sugahara H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have initially examined changes in morphology of F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12V cells during the rhTPO- and IPTG (Ha-RasG12V)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1, both F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12V cells were exclusively composed of undifferentiated megakaryoblastic cells before culture with rhTPO and IPTG. No significant changes in morphology were observed in both cultures until 24 h. However, considerable proportions of F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12Vcells revealed morphological changes indicative of megakaryocytic maturation after the culture with rhTPO and IPTG at 72 h (about 15% of the cultured cells in both cultures) and at 96 h (about 40% of the cultured cells in both cultures), respectively. Furthermore, these changes were more apparent in cytospin preparations after 120 h culture with rhTPO and IPTG, in both of which about 60% of the cultured cells underwent megakaryocytic differentiation. It was of interest to note that most of megakaryocytes developed after induction of Ha-RasG12V by IPTG possessed one giant nucleus, but not multilobular nuclei that were observed after the culture with rhTPO. In agreement with the morphological data, DNA content analysis revealed that both rhTPO and IPTG treatment led to polyploid formation of F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12V cells at 120-h after the initiation of the cultures, respectively: at 120 h, rhTPO, 2N 40.5%, 4N 37.0%, 8N 15.3%, 16N 7.2%; Ha-RasG12V, 2N 35.0%, 4N 31.2%, 8N 14.0%, 16N 13.4%, 32N 6.4% (TableI).Table IPolyploid formation of F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-ras G12V cells after a 120-h culture with rhTPO and IPTGCell2N4N8N16N32N%F-36P-mpl40.537.015.37.20F-36P-H-rasG12V35.031.214.013.46.4 Open table in a new tab In an effort to clarify the mechanism of the rhTPO- and Ha-RasG12V-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, changes in expression of cell cycle regulating molecules including cyclins, Cdks, and Cdks inhibitors were examined by Northern blot analysis. F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12V cells were deprived of rhIL-3 for 48 h, and then cultured in the absence of rhIL-3 with rhTPO and IPTG for 5 days, respectively. Expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 mRNA was found to be induced by rhTPO as early as 4 h in F-36P-mpl cells; cyclin D1 expression retained at relatively high levels until 120 h, while cyclin D2 expression decreased at 24 h (Fig. 2). Also, expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 in F-36P-H-rasG12V cells was induced by Ha-RasG12V and sustained at high levels until 120 h. In both culture conditions, cyclin D3 expression was gradually up-regulated for up to 120 h. Expression of cyclin A and cyclin B was transiently induced by rhTPO, reached a peak at 24 h, and then decreased after 48 h. Similarly, expression of cyclin A and cyclin B decreased to an undetectable level after 72 h in F-36P-H-rasG12V cells. Expression of p21 waf1 mRNA was not detected during the culture with rhTPO, while its induction was observed at the late phase of Ha-RasG12V-induced differentiation. By contrast, expression of p16 ink4a or p15 ink4b mRNA was not observed throughout the cultures. In addition, expression of p27 kip1, p18 ink4c, cdk2, cdk4, and p34 cdc2 did not change significantly in both cultures during the test period (Fig. 2). Consistent with the data on Northern blot analyses, Western blot analyses demonstrated that expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 proteins was induced by rhTPO or Ha-RasG12V with kinetics similar to those observed in the Northern blot (Fig.3 A). Also, expression of cyclin A and cyclin B was found to be reduced after 72 h in both cultures (Fig. 3 A). Since cyclin A and cyclin B have been reported to complex with cdc2 and to regulate its activity (for a review, see Ref. 35.King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), we examined changes in cdc2 activity with an immune complex kinase assay by using histone H1 as a substrate. After 48 h starvation of rhIL-3, F36P-mpl cells and F36P-H-rasG12V cells were cultured in the absence of rhIL-3 with rhTPO and IPTG for the time indicated, respectively, and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. During the culture with rhTPO, cdc2 activity was found to transiently increase at 24 h, and to decline thereafter (Fig. 3 B). Also, cdc2 activity was gradually down-regulated by Ha-RasG12V (Fig.3 B).Figure 3A, changes in expression of cyclins during rhTPO- and Ha-RasG12V-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12Vcells were cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 2, and cell lysates were isolated at the time indicated. For immunoblotting with each antibody, the equal amount of the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE individually, blotted, and probed with the indicated antibody.

After 48 h of IL-3-deprivation, F-36P-mpl and F-36P-H-rasG12V cells were cultured with rhTPO and IPTG for the time indicated, respectively. As shown in Fig.4 A, Western blot analysis on the whole cell lysates demonstrated that expression levels of cdk4 and cdk6 proteins did not show an apparent change during the test period in both cultures. Next, cdk4 and cdk6 were immunoprecipitated from total cellular lysates, and subjected to an immune complex kinase assay by using glutathione S-transferase-Rb as a substrate. Although a transient increase in cdk4 and cdk6 activities was induced by TPO and Ha-RasG12V at 24–48 h (in a proliferative process), their activities were found to decrease slightly during the endomitotic process from 72 to 120 h, despite the up-regulation of cyclin D expression in both cultures (Fig. 4 B). However, their activities were still retained at easily detectable levels in both cultures. As rhTPO- and Ha-RasG12V-induced megakaryocytic differentiation was accompanied by the sustained expression of D-type cyclins and decreased cdc2 activity, we prepared stable clones of F-36P-mpl cells that could inducibly express cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, or dn-cdc2, and then examined them for the direct effects of these molecules on megakaryocytic differentiation. The cells of each clone were factor and serum starved for 24 h, and then cultured with IPTG in serum- and rhIL-3-deprived conditions. In these clones, addition of 0.5 mm IPTG to the culture medium led to induction of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, or dn-cdc2 as early as 4 h, and their expression was retained for up to 24 h as indicated by Western blot analysis on the whole cell lysates (Fig.5 A). These clones were cultured in the presence or absence of rhIL-3 (10 ng/ml) with or without IPTG (0.5 mm) for 5 days. In the absence of IL-3, the induced overexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3 by IPTG treatment resulted in a significantly increased proportion of apoptotic cells, as noted by the increased subdiploid fractions (cyclin D1, 48.2 versus 14.1%; cyclin D2, 37.3 versus15.2%; cyclin D3, 44.5 versus 23.6%) (Fig. 5 B, Table I). In contrast, when rhIL-3 was added to the culture medium, overexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3 resulted in the increased fractions of S or G2/M phase cells, but did not induce apoptosis: % of the cells in S or G2/M phase with and without IPTG were as follows: cyclin D1, 68.2 versus48.2%; cyclin D2, 53.6 versus 43.5%; cyclin D3, 56.7versus 42.3% (Fig. 5 B, TableII). Overexpression of dn-cdc2 did not significantly affect cell growth in the absence of rhIL-3, whereas the apoptotic fraction was slightly reduced from 25 to 11% by IPTG treatment. In contrast, when dn-cdc2 was inducibly expressed in the presence of rhIL-3, only a small proportion of the cells (about 2%) was found to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation by morphological analysis (data not shown). This result was consistent with that of DNA content analysis which revealed an appearance of a small 8N fraction (Fig. 5 B). However, none of these molecules alone was able to efficiently induce megakaryocytic differentiation. Therefore, we next examined the combinational effects of these molecules on megakaryocytic differentiation. Three clones that could inducibly express dn-cdc2 in combination with cyclin D1, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3 were established and subjected to flow cytometric and morphological analyses. As shown in Fig. 6 A, polyploid formation was observed after 5-day culture with IPTG in the presence of rhIL-3 in all of these clones. Because surface phenotyptic maturation and nuclear maturation (polyploidization) were shown to be executed independently, we examined whether surface maturation was observed in these polyploid megakaryocytes that developed after induction of D-type cyclin and dn-cdc2. As shown in Fig. 6 B, surface expression levels of GP IIb-IIIa were up-regulated after 5-day culture with IPTG in these clones. In accord with the results of flow cytometric analysis, cytospin preparations after IPTG treatment for 5 days revealed the changes in morphology indicative of megakaryocytic maturation in all of the clones (Fig. 7). However, most of the megakaryocytes that developed after the induction of dn-cdc2 in combination with cyclin D1, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3 showed one giant nucleus similar to that seen as in the case of Ha-RasG12V. Similar megakaryocytic maturation was observed after the treatment with IPTG even in the absence of rhIL-3 (data not shown). These result suggested that the sustained expression of each D-type cyclin together with the decreased activity of cdc2 was sufficient for inducing megakaryocytic differentiation.Table IIEffects of overexpression of D-type cyclin on the growth or survival of F-36P cells in the presence or absence of rhIL-3Type of cyclin DIL-3 (−); apoptotic cell (%)IL-3 (+); cells in S or G2/M phase (%)IPTG (−)IPTG (+)IPTG (−)IPTG (+)Cyclin D114.148.248.268.2Cyclin D215.237.343.553.6Cyclin D323.644.542.356.7 Open table in a new tab Figure 6Effects of combinational overexpression of D-type cyclin and dn-cdc2 on megakaryocytic differentiation.

By using dn-STATs, dn-Ras, and activated forms of STAT5 and Ras (Ha-RasG12V), we have previously shown that prolonged Ras activation is required for TPO-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of F-36P-mplcells (30.Matsumura I.

It was also reported that an active form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase could induce megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells and CMK megakaryoblastic leukemia cells, both of which gave rise to mature megakaryocytes in response to phorbol esters (36.Whalen A.N.

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of cell cycle regulating molecules located downstream of Ras signaling, and demonstrated the importance of both cyclin Ds and cdc2 in megakaryocytic endomitosis. Although it was postulated that endomitosis was due to skipping of mitosis after each round of DNA replication, recent studies suggested that, during TPO-induced polyploidization, human or murine megakaryocytes may enter mitosis and progress through normal prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, and up to anaphase A, but not to anaphase B, telophase, or cytokinesis (17.Vitrat N.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 695-703PubMed Google Scholar) showed that cdc2 kinase activity was severely decreased due to down-regulation of cdc25C phosphatase during phorbol ester-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of HEL and Meg-01 cells. Zhang et al. (14.Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,15.Zhang Y. Wang Z. Liu D.X. Pagano M. Ravid K. J. Biol.

However, a recent study reported that cyclin B1 and cdc2 activities could be detected in human endomitotic polyploid megakaryocytes (17.Vitrat N. Cohen-Solal K. Pique C. Le Couedic J.P. Norol F. Larsen A.K. Katz A. Vainchenker W. Debili N. Blood. 1998; 91: 3711-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that cdc2 kinase activity was down-regulated due to the decreased expression of cyclin A and cyclin B during the course of both TPO- and Ha-RasG12V-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, and that dn-cdc2 in combination with a D-type cyclin was capable of inducing polyploid formation in F-36P-mpl cells. These results suggested that endomitosis may be performed efficiently under the condition where cdc2 kinase activity was down-regulated. Because of requirement of DNA synthesis in endomitosis, D-type cyclins that are critically important for cell cycle (G1/S) progression (for a review, see Ref. 1.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar) have been supposed to participate in polyploid formation of megakaryocytes. Wang et al. (40.Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that, when antisense oligonucleotides designed to suppress cyclin D3 expression was added to a primary culture of murine bone marrow cells, development of megakaryocytes was significantly suppressed, while cyclin D1 or cyclin D2 antisense oligonucleotides had little effect. In addition, Zimmet et al. (41.Zimmet J.M. Ladd D. Jackson C.W. Stenberg P.E. Ravid K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7248-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that cyclin D3 was expressed at significant levels in polyploid megakaryocytes and was up-regulated following thein vivo exposure to TPO (40.Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they demonstrated that bone marrow megakaryocytes obtained from transgenic mice, in which cyclin D3 was overexpressed exclusively in the megakaryocytic lineage, showed a significant increase in endomitosis (41.Zimmet J.M. Ladd D. Jackson C.W. Stenberg P.E. Ravid K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7248-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggested that cyclin D3 may be a key regulator of DNA replication in endomitosis. By using a refined model of megakaryocytic differentiation, we found that either TPO stimulation or Ha-RasG12V expression could up-regulate the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 in addition to cyclin D3, and that, when cdc2 activity was suppressed, each of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 expression was able to induce megakaryocytic differentiation with a similar efficiency. These findings raised the possibility that functional roles of D-type cyclins may be redundant, and that each D-type cyclin could participate in megakaryocytic endomitosis. However, the up-regulated expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 was observed earlier than that of cyclin D3, and was detectable at mRNA and protein levels prior to the development of polyploid megakaryocytes. It is therefore possible that cyclin D1 or cyclin D2 may be involved in TPO-induced proliferation rather than megakaryocytic differentiation, whereas cyclin D3 may participate in megakaryocytic endomitosis. This possibility is partially supported by our recent finding that cytokines such as TPO appear to regulate cell growth through transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 by STAT5 and Ras signaling (42.Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Additional works such as those on cyclin D3 targeted mice are required to elucidate the direct role of cyclin D3 in megakaryocytic endomitosis. Despite the accompanied expression of D-type cyclins, we did not detect distinct elevation of cdk4 and cdk6 activities during TPO- or Ha-RasG12V-induced endomitosis, whereas easily detectable levels of their activities are observed. Therefore, it was speculated that intense cyclin D-dependent kinase activities might not be required for DNA replication during megakaryocytic endomitosis as compared with their necessity in proliferative conditions. In a previous study, Kikuchi et al. (6.Kikuchi J. Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Terui Y. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Kitagawa M. Komatsu N. Miura Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 3980-3990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that surface phenotyptic maturation and polyploidization were performed independently. However, in this study, surface expression levels of GP IIb-IIIa were up-regulated in the megakaryocytes that developed after induction of dn-cdc2 and D-type cyclin, suggesting that nuclear maturation may be spontaneously accompanied by phenotyptic maturation. In addition to megakaryocytic differentiation, macrophage differentiation evoked by cell cycle regulatory molecules such as p21 and p19 was reported to be accompanied by surface phenotyptic maturation (7.Adachi M. Roussel M.F. Havenith K. Sherr C.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 126-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Lie M. Lee M. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). These results including ours suggested artificially induced nuclear maturation could be linked with surface phenotyptic maturation. As in the case of Ha-RasG12V, most of differentiated megakaryocytes that developed in response to dn-cdc2 and D-type cyclin possessed only one giant nucleus but not multinucleated nuclei that were observed in F-36P-mpl cells after culture with TPO. These results suggested the presence of an additional mechanism(s) that regulates the maturation of polyploid megakaryocytes. Further studies on this TPO/F36-P-mpl system would undoubtedly provide greater insights into molecular controls of megakaryocytopoiesis. We thank Drs. T. Satoh, A. Arnold, G. Peters, Ed Harlow, A.

In humans, deficiencies in MCCase result in the lethal condition methylcrotonylglyciuria (7.Sweetman L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, NY1989: 791-819Google Scholar). Biotin enzymes have three structurally conserved functional domains: the biotin carboxylase domain, which catalyzes the carboxylation of biotin; the biotin carboxyl carrier domain, which carries the biotin prosthetic group; and the carboxyltransferase domain, which catalyzes the transfer of a carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to the organic substrate specific for each biotin enzyme (1.Moss J. Lane M.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 321-442PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyltransferase domain of MCCase catalyzes the transfer of a carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to methylcrotonoyl-CoA. Presumably because of differences in substrate specificities, carboxyltransferase domains are less conserved among biotin enzymes than are the biotin carboxylase or the biotin carboxyl carrier domains. MCCase is composed of two nonidentical subunits: a larger, biotin-containing subunit of approximately 85 kDa (MCC-A), and a smaller, non-biotin-containing subunit of approximately 60 kDa (MCC-B) (1.Moss J.

The amino acid sequence of MCC-A has been deduced from the corresponding cDNA clones, and this subunit contains the biotin carboxylase and biotin carboxyl carrier domains (11.Song J. Wurtele E.S.

Despite the metabolic importance of MCCase, the sequence and genetic regulation of the MCC-B subunit had not been characterized from any organism. We report here the primary structure of the MCC-B subunit fromArabidopsis, deduced from the isolated cDNA and gene, and that the MCC-A and MCC-B mRNAs accumulate in coordinate spatial and temporal patterns. The following materials were obtained from theArabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University): the Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag cDNA clone 145L1T7; an Arabidopsis (ecotype Landsberg erecta) genomic library in the vector λFIX (14.Voytas D.F. Konieczny A. Cummings M.P. Ausubel F.M. Genetics. 1990; 126 (712): 713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and a size-selected cDNA library (2–3-kb inserts) prepared from poly(A) RNA isolated from 3-day-old Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) seedling hypocotyls in the vector λZAPII (15.Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). An Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) cDNA library prepared from poly(A) RNA isolated from developing siliques in vector λgt10 was a gift from Dr. David W. Meinke (Oklahoma State University). Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia) were grown under the conditions described previously (16.Ke J. Choi J.K. Smith M. Horner H.T. Nikolau B.J. Wurtele E.S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To obtain organs from 3-day old seedlings, sterile Arabidopsisseeds were imbibed in Petri plates on sterile, moist filter paper, and seedlings were harvested 3 days later. All other organs were harvested from plants grown in soil. The first three leaves from 17 day-old plants were harvested as mature leaves. In order to stage the development of siliques, the third and subsequent flowers were tagged with colored threads at the time of flowering. The resulting siliques were harvested individually at known intervals (1–15 days) after flowering (DAF). Organs harvested for the purpose of RNA isolation were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Organs isolated for in situ hybridization were immediately fixed as described previously (16.Ke J. Choi J.K. Smith M. Horner H.T. Nikolau B.J. Wurtele E.S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis genomic DNA was isolated by the method of Scott and Playford (17.Scott K.D. Playford J. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DNA was analyzed and manipulated with modifying enzymes by standard techniques (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Genomic and cDNA bacteriophage libraries were screened by standard plaque hybridization protocols (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The authenticity of putativeMCC-B cDNA clones was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using a combination of the following primers: λgt10 forward and reverse primers, M13 forward and reverse primers, andMCC-B-specific primers AM819 (5′-GGCAGGAATGTAGGCACCAC-3′) and AM0404 (5′-TAACCGCTTCCTCTCCACCTC-3′). Primers were used at a concentration of 3 μm (vector-specific primers) or 0.3 μm (MCC-B-specific primers). In situ hybridizations to RNA were conducted as detailed by Ke et al. (16.Ke J. Choi J.K. Smith M. Horner H.T. Nikolau B.J. Wurtele E.S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MCC-A and MCC-BmRNAs were detected by subjecting histological sections to hybridization with the respective 35S-labeled antisense RNA probes. Control hybridizations were conducted with35S-labeled sense RNA probes. Hybridizations with antisense and sense MCC-A and MCC-B probes were carried out on histological sections prepared from the identical tissue block. Allin situ hybridization experiments were conducted in triplicate, each of which gave similar results. RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis plant tissues by a phenol/SDS method (19.Dean C. vandenElzen P. Tamaki S. Dunsmuir P. Bedbrook J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3055-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot membranes were hybridized (16.Ke J. Choi J.K. Smith M. Horner H.T. Nikolau B.J. Wurtele E.S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled MCC-A or MCC-BcDNA probes (13.Weaver L.M. Lebrun L. Franklin A. Huang L. Hoffman N. Wurtele E.S. Nikolau B.J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1013-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine the absolute amounts ofMCC-A and MCC-B mRNAs in each RNA sample, nonradioactive MCC-A and MCC-B RNA standards were produced by in vitro-transcription using bacteriophage RNA polymerases (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The concentrations of the MCC-A andMCC-B RNA standards were determined by two methods: absorbance at 260 nm, and comparison of the UV-induced fluorescence of ethidium bromide-stained MCC RNA standards with RNAs of known concentrations (RNA Ladder from Life Technologies, Inc.).Arabidopsis RNA samples (20 μg/lane) and MCC-Aand MCC-B RNA standards were subjected to electrophoresis, Northern blotting, and hybridization with radioactive MCC-Aand MCC-B specific antisense RNA probes. The radioactivity associated with each hybridizing band was quantified with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All Northern blot hybridization experiments were conducted in triplicate. MCC-B was expressed in Escherichia coli as follows. The 1336-base pairSalI-NotI cDNA fragment from the clone 145L1T7 was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in-frame with the GST gene. Cultures of E. coli strain XL1Blue containing this construct (p145GEX) were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. E. coli cultures containing p145GEX accumulate a 66.5-kDa protein not present in control cultures containing pGEX-4T-1 (Fig.2 A). The presence of this 66.5-kDa protein and the concomitant absence of the nonrecombinant GST protein in p145GEX-containing cultures are consistent with the addition of 397 amino acids to the 27.5-kDa GST protein. This 66.5-kDa recombinant protein was recovered in inclusion bodies, and its purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. These analyses indicated that the 66.5-kDa recombinant protein accounted for over 80% of the protein associated with the isolated inclusion bodies. Hence, this protein was purified by preparative SDS-PAGE and used to generate antiserum. MCCase was purified from soybean seedlings by procedures previously used to purify this enzyme from carrot (8.Chen Y. Wurtele E.S. Wang X. Nikolau B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); these procedures included chromatography on Cibacron Blue, Q-Sepharose, and monomeric-avidin affinity matrices. Purification of the enzyme was monitored by determining the specific activity of MCCase in each fraction (8.Chen Y. Wurtele E.S. Wang X. Nikolau B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20.Song J. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA Carboxylase from Soybean. Ph.D. Thesis.

In addition, proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), nondenaturing PAGE (47.Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar), and Western blotting (23.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Purification of MCCase was repeated more than four times with similar results. MCCase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities were determined as the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA- and acetyl-CoA-dependent rates of conversion of radioactivity from NaH14CO3 into an acid-stable product (5.Wurtele E.S. Nikolau B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with 1.25 mg of SDS-PAGE-purified protein antigen emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. One month later and at 2-week intervals thereafter, rabbits were challenged with intramuscular injection of protein antigen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Serum was collected 2.5 months after the primary injection. To identify the MCC-B cDNA, we searched theArabidopsis expressed sequence tag data base for sequences similar to carboxyltransferase domains of biotin enzymes, specifically those utilizing substrates chemically similar to methylcrotonyl-CoA. The Arabidopsis partial expressed sequence tag cDNA clone 145L1T7 was identified by the BLAST algorithm because of its similarity to the carboxyltransferase domain of propionyl-CoA carboxylases. The 145L1T7 clone contains a 1330-nucleotide partial cDNA, which codes for 397-residue polypeptide. The corresponding full-length cDNA was isolated in two steps: first, by screening a λgt110 Arabidopsis cDNA library, which resulted in the isolation of p5CMB (a 1790-nucleotide partial cDNA clone), and second, by screening a size-selected λZAPII ArabidopsiscDNA library, which resulted in the isolation of the near-complete cDNA clone pMCC-B. The 1890-nucleotide MCC-B cDNA encodes a 587-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 64 kDa. The 5′ untranslated region is at least 78 nucleotides long, and the 49-nucleotide 3′ untranslated region contains the eukaryotic polyadenylation signal sequence AAUAAA 29 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail (24.Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The MCC-B cDNA hybridizes to a single mRNA of approximately 2.0 kb, indicating that it is nearly full-length. To identify the biochemical function of the protein encoded by the MCC-BcDNA, we expressed a portion of this cDNA in E. colias a GST fusion protein (termed 145GEX) (Fig. 2 A). The expressed protein was used to generate anti-145GEX serum. MCCase was purified from 5-day-old soybean seedlings (TableI) (20.Song J. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA Carboxylase from Soybean. Ph.D. Thesis. Iowa State University, 1993Google Scholar) using a procedure similar to one previously used to purify this enzyme from carrots (8.Chen Y. Wurtele E.S. Wang X. Nikolau B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Typically, this procedure gave a purified MCCase preparation with a specific activity about 400-fold higher than that found in the crude extract; in four repetitions of this purification, specific activity ranged between 300 and 650 milliunits/mg. These MCCase preparations were judged near homogeneous based upon two criteria. Analysis of these preparations by nondenaturing PAGE (47.Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a single protein that migrated with a molecular weight of about 900,000 (Fig. 2 D, lane 1). We concluded that this protein is MCCase because it contains biotin, which was detected with 125I-streptavidin-Western analyses (Fig. 2 D, lane 2), and it reacts with anti-MCC-A serum (data not shown). Attempts to further purify MCCase by gel-filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 did not increase the specific activity of the preparation. Furthermore, MCCase activity eluted from the Sephacryl S-400 column as a single peak corresponding to a molecular weight of about 900,000. This MCCase preparation contains biotin and reacts with anti-MCC-A serum (data not shown). Hence, based upon these analyses, we conclude that the MCCase preparation obtained following monomeric avidin affinity chromatography is a near homogeneous preparation of this enzyme. The specific activity of the purified soybean MCCase (300–650 milliunits/mg) compares favorably with previous purifications of this enzyme from carrot (700 milliunits/mg) (8.Chen Y. Wurtele E.S. Wang X. Nikolau B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and maize (200–600 milliunits/mg) (11.Song J. Wurtele E.S. Nikolau B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5779-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, it is an order of magnitude lower than the MCCase purified from animals (25.Lau E.P. Cochran B.C. Fall R.R.

Based on the structure of MCCase from other plant sources (8.Chen Y. Wurtele E.S. Wang X. Nikolau B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9.Alban C.

Biochem. 1975; 60: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,27.Fall R.R. Hector M.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4000-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the smaller, 60-kDa polypeptide was tentatively identified as the nonbiotinylated subunit of MCCase. Evidence in support of this identification was obtained by subjecting the purified MCCase preparations to nondenaturing PAGE followed by SDS-PAGE. In these analyses, the 900-kDa MCCase protein contained both the 85-kDa MCC-A subunit and the 60-kDa polypeptide, and these were the only polypeptides detected in these preparations. These experiments were conducted with both the monomeric avidin affinity purified MCCase fraction and the MCCase-containing fraction obtained following a subsequent gel filtration chromatography purification step. These findings imply that the 60-kDa polypeptide is the MCC-B subunit. Evidence in support of the conclusion that the pMCC-B clone codes for the nonbiotinylated subunit of MCCase was obtained from immunological analyses using the anti-145GEX serum. SDS-PAGE and Western analyses of soybean (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) and Arabidopsis (Fig.2 C, lane 4) seedling extracts show that the anti-145GEX serum reacts with a single polypeptide in each extract that is about 60 kDa. In addition, this antiserum reacts with the 900-kDa purified MCCase protein (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). To further demonstrate that pMCC-B codes for the nonbiotinylated subunit of MCCase, the various fractions obtained during the purification of the soybean MCCase were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with either125I-streptavidin or anti-145GEX serum. These characterizations demonstrate that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the specific activity of MCCase, the relative intensity of the MCC-A subunit band detected with 125I-streptavidin, and the relative intensity of the MCC-B subunit band detected with anti-145GEX serum (Fig. 2 C and Table I). Finally, we tested the effect of anti-145GEX serum on the catalytic activity of MCCase (Fig. 3). Whereas preimmune control serum did not inhibit MCCase or acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity (acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the only other biotin-containing enzyme known in Arabidopsis), anti-145GEX serum specifically inhibited MCCase activity, without affecting acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. In toto, this series of experiments establish that pMCC-A codes for the non-biotin-containing subunit of MCCase. Southern blot analysis of Arabidopsis(ecotype Columbia) DNA digested with EcoRI,HindIII, BamHI, or KpnI and probed with the MCC-B cDNA reveals a single hybridizing band in each digest (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the MCC-B subunit is probably encoded by a single gene. An Arabidopsis (ecotype Landsberg) genomic DNA library was screened by hybridization with the MCC-B cDNA to isolate the gene encoding the non-biotin-containing subunit of MCCase. Twenty-nine hybridizing plaques (out of the 3.0 × 104 plaques that were screened) were identified. These represented overlapping clones of a single region of theArabidopsis genome. Two clones, A2041 and A2102, were analyzed in detail. A 4.2-kb SalI fragment, which contained the 3′ end of the MCC-B gene (pMBG), and a 5.2-kbEcoRI fragment, which contained the 5′ end of theMCC-B gene (pMAGP), were subcloned and sequenced. Together, these two overlapping subclones contain the entire MCC-Bgene (Fig. 4 B). Comparison of the sequences of the full-length MCC-BcDNA and gene demonstrate that the MCC-B subunit is encoded by a 2.78-kb stretch of the genomic sequence and that the transcribed region is interrupted by nine introns. There are only two sequence differences between the Landsberg gene and Columbia cDNA: a change of C to T at nucleotide 795 of the cDNA and a change of A to G at nucleotide 855; neither results in an amino acid change. The 10 exons ofMCC-B range in length from 56 to 434 nucleotides. The nine intervening introns are from 77 to 164 nucleotides, larger than the minimum intron length of 70–73 nucleotides (28.Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2635-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The splice sites of each intron agree with plant consensus splice site sequences (29.Simpson C.G. Leader D.J. Brown J.W.S. Croy R.R.D. Plant Molecular Biology. BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, San Diego, CA1993: 183-239Google Scholar), and all nine introns contain the highly conserved dinucleotide sequences GT and AG at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the introns, respectively. In addition, the AU content of every intron is greater than 59%, which has been recognized as the minimum AU content for efficient splicing in dicots (28.Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2635-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The MCC-B subunit is a polypeptide of 587 amino acid residues. The N-terminal sequence of the MCC-B protein has characteristics of a mitochondrial transit peptide (30.Boutry M. Chaumont F. Brennicke A. Kuck U. Plant Mitochondria with Emphasis on RNA Editing and Cytoplasmic Male Sterility. VCH Publishers, New York, NY1993: 321-329Google Scholar), consistent with the location of MCCase in mitochondria (9.Alban C. Baldet P. Axiotis S. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence of the proposed transit peptide (residues 1–26) with the HELICALWHEEL algorithm of the GCG Sequence Analysis package predicts that it will form an amphiphilic α-helix, a common feature of transit peptides (31.Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of the pre-MCC-B protein is predicted by the PSORT algorithm (32.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) to occur at residue 27, within the sequence IRP↓GTD. This is consistent with the finding that an arginine residue is often present at residue −2 relative to the cleavage site (33.Wallace T.P. Howe C.J. Croy R.R.D. Plant Molecular Biology Labfax. BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, San Diego, CA1993: 287-292Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cleavage at residue 27 would result in a mature polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 60,900, similar to the apparent molecular weight of the polypeptide immunologically detected in Arabidopsis leaf extracts with anti-145GEX serum (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Furthermore, these findings agree with previous determinations of the molecular mass of the MCC-B subunit of MCCase purified from maize (58 kDa), carrot (65 kDa)"

The conjugation products are more water-soluble, usually less toxic, and can be degraded or transported outside of the cell. Furthermore, GSTs have been implicated in the development of resistance of various tumor cell lines to anti-cancer drugs. A higher level of expression of Alpha class GSTs was observed when Chinese hamster ovary cells were exposed to the nitrogen mustard alkylating agent chlorambucil (7.Lewis A.D. Hickson I.D.

All structures share similar topology, with each enzyme subunit having a glutathione binding site and an electrophilic substrate binding site. In addition, a nonsubstrate steroid binding site for Alpha class glutathione S-transferase, isoenzyme 1-1, was located in the cleft formed between the two enzyme subunits (21.McTigue M.A. Williams D.R.

The two subunits in the structures of isoenzymes complexed with various products or product analogues show no significant structural difference between them, suggesting that the two active sites in the enzyme dimer act independently (1.Armstrong R.N.

GlutathioneS-transferase, isoenzyme 2-2, is designated as the rGST A3–3 isoenzyme. and μ class enzymes GST 3–3 and GST 3–4 are consistent with two noncooperative active sites (23.Ivanetich K.M. Goold R.D. Sikakana C.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the large bulky aflatoxin-glutathione conjugate has been shown recently to bind to mouse Alpha class 2-2 enzyme with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of enzyme dimer, and binding of this ligand completely abolished the catalytic activity of both enzyme subunits (24.McHugh T.E. Atkins W.M. Racha J.K. Kunze K.L. Eaton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27470-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, binding studies of glutathione to the human Pi class enzyme show that binding displays positive cooperativity above 35 °C, whereas negative cooperativity occurs below 25 °C (25.Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Ascenzi P. Nicotra M. Nuccetelli M. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19276-19280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the two active sites might not be independent. In this paper, we use the bulky product analogue glutathionyl S-[4-(succinimidyl)benzophenone] (GS-Succ-BP) as a photoaffinity label to probe the interactions between the two enzyme subunits.GS-Succ-BP was used previously in this laboratory as a photoaffinity label for the electrophilic substrate site of the rat liver Mu class GST 4–4 (26.Wang J. Bauman S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15671-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In that study, Met-112 was identified as the reaction site. The benzophenone moiety of GS-Succ-BP binds in the cleft between the subunits, and modification of Met-112 of one enzyme subunit not only prevents the binding and the modification of the corresponding methionine residue on the other subunit but also inhibits the enzyme activities of both enzyme subunits. Comparison between the sequences of rat subunits 4 and 1 reveals only 29% identical plus similar amino acid residues. The sequence differences are undoubtedly responsible for the marked distinctions in substrate specificities between the 4–4 and 1-1 enzymes. In this paper, we show that GS-Succ-BP reacts with the Met-208 of the rat liver Alpha class GST 1-1. This residue, unlike Met-112 of GST 4–4, is located away from the enzyme dimer interface. Modification of Met-208 of one enzyme subunit completely abolishes the catalytic activities of the enzyme dimer. Examination of the catalytic activities of the heterodimer GST 1-2, which was generated from the modified GST 1-1 and GST 2-2, suggests that two enzyme active sites of the dimer are coordinated in the homodimer GST 1-1 but not in the heterodimer GST 1-2.DISCUSSIONGS-Succ-BP functions as a photoaffinity label for rat liver GST 1-1. The initial rate of inactivation shows a nonlinear dependence on the concentration of the reagent, suggesting that a reversible enzyme-reagent complex forms prior to the irreversible modification of the enzyme. Protection against inactivation by the reagent is afforded by the long chain glutathione analogues (S-hexylglutathione or p-nitrobenzylglutathione) or the electrophilic substrate analogues (ethacrynic acid or dinitrobenzene), but not by the short chain glutathione analogue, S-methylglutathione. These results indicate that the reagent binds to the enzyme and reacts within its electrophilic substrate binding site. Steroids (Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione and 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate) afford little protection against inactivation, suggesting that the reagent binds and reacts outside of the steroid binding sites of the enzyme.Inactivation of the enzyme is proportional to the covalent incorporation of the reagent into the enzyme. When the enzyme is completely inactivated, an incorporation of about 0.5 mol of reagent per mol of enzyme subunit is observed. Met-208 was identified as the only amino acid being modified by GS-Succ-BP. The location of this residue is quite different from Met-112 of GST 4–4, which was the reaction site of GS-Succ-BP (26.Wang J. Bauman S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15671-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). (Met-112 is not conserved in GST 1-1.) Met-208 is located at the beginning of the C-terminal region of GST 1-1, which undergoes a structural change upon binding substrate analogues (14.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 44.Schramm V.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The docking of GS-Succ-BP into the enzyme was modeled, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The structure of the rat GST 1-1 from residue 1 to 208 was based on the x-ray coordinates of the human GST 1-1 apoenzyme (1GSD in the PDB). The glutathionyl moiety of the reagent was positioned in one of the enzyme's active sites so that it coincided with the glutathionyl of S-benzylglutathione bound to the human GST A1-1 (1GUH in the PDB). Bonds between the sulfur atom of the glutathione and succinimidylbenzophenone, between the sulfur atom and the rest of the glutathione moiety, and between the nitrogen atom of the succinimidyl and benzophenone were rotated, while the intermolecular van der Waals potential and electrostatic potential between the apoenzyme and the reagent was monitored in order to position the carbonyl group of the benzophenone moiety close enough to react with the methyl group of Met-208 without significant steric hindrance from other enzymatic groups. Fig.9 shows the model that resulted from the overall energy minimization of the initial model of the enzyme-reagent complex (with the reagent in green and yellow). In this structure, the Met-208 residue (shown in red) is pointed away from the cleft of the enzyme dimer interface, which was previously identified as the location of the nonsubstrate steroid binding sites of the enzyme (21.McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 22.Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, our earlier results from the photoaffinity labeling of GST 4–4 with GS-Succ-BP led to the conclusion that the benzophenone moiety of the reagent actually binds in the cleft between the two enzyme subunits. The results indicate that the large reagent (and corresponding large electrophilic substrates) binds distinctively in different isoenzymes. The electrophilic substrate does not protrude into the steroid binding site of the enzyme in the Alpha class isoenzyme, as suggested by McHugh et al. (24.McHugh T.E. Atkins W.M. Racha J.K. Kunze K.L. Eaton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27470-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The C terminus (starting from Met-208) of the human GST 1-1 is not observed in the crystal structure of the apoenzyme (presumably, it is mobile), while it forms a helical cap over the active site of the enzyme enclosing the electrophilic substrate in the structure of enzyme complexed with EA-glutathione or with S-benzylglutathione (14.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol.

Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The C-terminal helix in the enzyme-S-benzylglutathione complex (1GUH) is shown inwhite in Fig. 9. Severe steric hindrance exists between the reagent modeled into the apoenzyme and residues of this helix, suggesting that in the enzyme-GS-Succ-BP complex, the position of this helix is not the same as that of enzyme S-benzylglutathione complex; probably, it is a little bit lower to accommodate the bulky moiety of our reagent.The dissociation rate of GS-Succ-BP from the enzyme-reagent complex is extremely slow. This observation is probably due to the dynamics of the C-terminal structural transition between enzymes with and without the large product analogue. It has been shown that the binding of the product analogue and the enzyme involves a conformational change (isomerization) of the enzyme-reagent complex, which mainly involves the helix formation of the C terminus of the enzyme (46.Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the large electrophilic substrates of this enzyme, the low catalytic activity is probably due to the slow rate of the product release from the enzyme.In this study, when the enzyme is completely inactivated, only one of the enzyme subunits of the enzyme dimer is modified. This result is consistent with our observation that only 1 mol of reagent binds noncovalently with 1 mol of enzyme dimer in the dark. This finding is somewhat surprising, because each subunit of the enzyme dimer has an active site, and, in the crystal structure of the human GST 1-1 complexed with the EA-glutathione conjugate (1GSE in PDB) or in the crystal structure of GST 1-1 complexed withS-benzylglutathione (1GUH in PDB), it is clear that both active sites of the enzyme are occupied by the product (or product analogue). It has been reported that larger conjugation products (or product analogues) bind to Alpha class enzymes with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of enzyme dimer:S-[[(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxy-3-pyrrolidinyl)-carbamoyl]methyl]glutathione for GST 1-1 (44.Schramm V.L.

The structures of these glutathione conjugates are shown in Fig. 10. The reagent we are using, GS-Succ-BP, is much larger than p-nitrobenzylglutathione,S-2,4-dinitrobenzylglutathione, and EA-glutathione conjugate but smaller than 8,9-dihydro-8-(S-glutathionyl)-9-hydroxyl-aflatoxin B1. Our results indicate that the binding of GS-Succ-BP to the enzyme is similar to that of the larger glutathione conjugate.Figure 10Selected product analogues of glutathioneS-transferase.

This result is consistent with the observation that the binding of one large conjugation product to one enzyme dimer completely inhibits the enzyme catalytic activity toward CDNB (24.McHugh T.E. Atkins W.M. Racha J.K. Kunze K.L. Eaton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27470-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In our study, the unmodified subunit of the GS-Succ-BP-modified enzyme can still bind the electrophilic substrate monobromobimane, which then reacts with both Cys residues in the electrophilic substrate binding site of the unmodified subunit. This result suggests that loss of the enzyme activity of the unmodified subunit is probably not due either to the physical barrier to the substrates binding or to the lower binding affinity for substrates induced by the modification of the other subunit but rather results from a conformational change in the unlabeled subunit induced by the modification of the other subunit. This conformational change may cause the substrates to bind in a nonproductive way in the unmodified enzyme. The secondary structures (monitored by CD spectra) show no significant difference between the control enzyme and the modified enzyme, indicating that this conformational change is subtle.It has been generally accepted that the enzyme active sites in the two subunits of glutathione S-transferases are independent (1.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), although it has been shown that the binding of the glutathione to human Pi class enzyme is negatively cooperative at low temperatures and positively cooperative at high temperatures (25.Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Ascenzi P. Nicotra M. Nuccetelli M. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19276-19280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we observe that the modification of one enzyme subunit of the GST 1-1 homodimer not only abolishes the enzyme catalytic activity of that subunit but also inhibits the catalytic activity of the other subunit of the dimer. This finding suggests that the two enzyme active sites in GST 1-1 are coordinated. On the contrary, results of activity measurements from the GST 1-2 generated from the modified GST 1-1 and control GST 2-2 indicate that modification of the GST 1 subunit of the heterodimer has no effect on the catalytic activity of the GST 2 subunit. Thus, the two active sites in the heterodimer GST 1-2 appear to be independent. These two isoenzymes share 68% sequence identity. It remains to be seen what interaction(s) between the two enzyme subunits cause the active sites to be coordinated in the case of homodimers (GST 1-1) but independent in the case of heterodimers (GST 1-2). Additional study is needed to ascertain whether our results from this pair of homo- and heterodimers are specific or can be generalized to all isoenzymes.In recent years, equilibrium unfolding studies have been performed on Pi class (47.Dirr H.W.

In these studies, urea or guanidinium chloride was added to the enzyme solution to cause denaturation and inactivation, and its dye binding ability, as well as UV, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectral characteristics were monitored to study the unfolding pathway. GSTs from Pi class, Schistosoma japonicum and Alpha class unfold via a two-state pathway in which only folded dimers or unfolded monomers are detectable at equilibrium (47.Dirr H.W. Reinemer P.

Hornby J.A.T. Armstrong R.N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15534-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In most of these studies, the refolding of the urea or guanidinium chloride-denatured enzymes was accomplished by dilution (at least 10-fold) in buffer without the denaturant. The enzyme catalytic activity recovered varied from 40–55% in the case of Pi enzyme (48.Aceto A. Caccuri A.M. Sacchetta P. Bucciarelli T. Dragani B. Rosato N. Federici G. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to 95–98% for the Alpha enzyme (51.Wallace L.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5320-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we were able not only to dissociate the enzyme dimer unequivocally but also to reassociate and recover the enzyme dimer without loss of the protein and the enzyme activities. This approach provides a method to directly study the interaction between enzyme subunits and to elucidate the residue(s) that determines the specificity during dimer formation.In summary, GS-Succ-BP acts as a photoaffinity label for rat GST 1-1, modifying the Met-208 residue. Modification of one subunit of the enzyme dimer completely abolishes the enzyme catalytic activity. Analysis of the ligands that protect against photoinactivation and of models of the enzyme structure suggests that the reagent binds outside the steroid binding site of the enzyme, which is in the cleft between the subunits. Furthermore, reaction of GS-Succ-BP with one subunit causes a conformational change that prevents the binding of the reagent to the other subunit and inhibits the enzyme activity on the unmodified subunit. This interaction is absent in GST 1-2. Glutathione S-transferases (GST)1 (EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of detoxification enzymes that catalyze the conjugation reaction of glutathione with a variety of endogenous electrophiles and xenobiotics (1.Armstrong R.N.

This study investigated the effect of a Gq-coupled receptor on protein synthesis and the phosphorylation state and function of 4E-BP1 in Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing the human α1A adrenergic receptor. Treatment of cells with phenylephrine (PE), a specific α1adrenergic receptor agonist, increased protein synthesis and induced the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its release from translation initiation factor 4E. Although the PE-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, neither phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase nor Akt, its downstream effector, is activated in cells treated with PE (Ballou, L. M., Cross, M. E., Huang, S., McReynolds, E. M., Zhang, B. X., and Lin, R. Z., J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4803–4809). The effect of PE on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was also abolished in cells depleted of intracellular Ca2+ and in cells pretreated with calmodulin antagonists. By contrast, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 still occurred in cells in which the Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C were down-regulated by prolonged exposure to a phorbol ester. We conclude that activation of the α1A adrenergic receptor in Rat-1 fibroblasts leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 via a pathway that is Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms do not appear to be required in this signaling pathway.

In eukaryotes, translational control is exerted mainly at the level of initiation (1.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 2.Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In translation initiation, methionyl-tRNA and several initiation factors bind to the 40 S ribosomal subunit to form the 43 S preinitiation complex, the complex binds to the 5′ end of the mRNA and translocates to the initiation codon, and then the 60 S ribosomal subunit is added to form an active 80 S ribosome. Binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex to mRNA is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)1 4F. eIF4F in mammals contains three subunits; one of them, eIF4E, binds directly to the m7GpppN (where N is any nucleotide) cap on the 5′ end of the mRNA. Together with eIF4B, eIF4F unwinds the secondary structure in the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA to create a binding site for the 43 S preinitiation complex (1.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 2.Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Activation of protein synthesis by growth factors is a complex process that involves phosphorylation of a number of translation initiation factors, regulatory proteins and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (1.Pain V.M.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is a 12-kDa translation repressor that is thought to be a key player in the regulation of protein synthesis (3.Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In resting cells, hypophosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 bind tightly to eIF4E on the mRNA cap, thus preventing formation of a functional eIF4F complex (3.Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 5.Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with growth factors leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on multiple sites and its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby relieving the translational block. Translation of mRNAs with extensive secondary structure at the 5′ end is thought to be particularly sensitive to regulation by 4E-BP1 (3.Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the S6 protein in 40 S ribosomal subunits is another mechanism that mediates growth factor-induced activation of protein synthesis (4.Jefferies H. Thomas G. Hershey J. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). The major kinase that phosphorylates S6 is theM r = 70,000 S6 kinase (p70 S6 kinase) (4.Jefferies H. Thomas G. Hershey J. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar, 6.Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p70 S6 kinase is activated by phosphorylation of the enzyme at multiple sites (7.Pullen N. Thomas G.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal subunit by p70 S6 kinase is thought to selectively up-regulate translation of certain mRNAs that contain a polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the mRNA cap (5′-TOP mRNAs; Refs. 9.Amaldi F.

Intense study has been aimed at identifying upstream regulators in the signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase. These pathways appear to be quite similar. First, it has been demonstrated in many cell systems that growth factor-induced phosphorylation of both proteins is blocked by the immunosuppressant rapamycin (11.Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V.

Rapamycin, when bound to its intracellular receptor FKBP12, inhibits the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase of which the catalytic domain resembles that of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (15.Kunz J.

Indeed, it was recently reported that mTOR in immunoprecipitates phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and fragments of p70 S6 kinase in vitro (17.Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H.

Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A second similarity between the pathways leading to phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase is their apparent dependence on PI 3-kinase and its downstream effector, the protein kinase Akt. Treatment of cells with wortmannin or LY294002, two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, prevents the phosphorylation of both proteins following growth factor treatment (23.Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L.

Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) upon PDGF treatment. These results have led to the proposal of a signaling pathway leading from growth factor receptors to PI 3-kinase, Akt, mTOR, and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase (26.Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In contrast to this proposed signaling pathway, we recently found that stimulation of the α1A adrenergic receptor (AR) leads to an increase in p70 S6 kinase activity without activation of PI 3-kinase or Akt (35.Ballou L.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). α1 ARs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, but little is known about the signaling pathways utilized by these receptors to regulate translation (36.Schluter K.D. Piper H.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (suppl.): S17-S22PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes in vitrowith the α1 AR agonist phenylephrine (PE) was reported to activate p70 S6 kinase and stimulate protein synthesis and hypertrophic cell growth (37.Boluyt M.O. Zheng J.S. Younes A. Long X. O'Neill L. Silverman H. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the study of these events in cardiac myocytes is complicated by the fact that they express all three of the known α1 AR subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D; Refs. 38.Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I.

In this and our recent (35.Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) study, we used Rat-1 fibroblasts that stably express the human α1A AR as a simplified model system to study signaling pathways that regulate translation. We show here that stimulation of the α1A AR leads to an increase in protein synthesis accompanied by phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its dissociation from eIF4E. This response is not mediated by PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling, but rather by a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent pathway. PE was purchased from Sigma; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), A23187, ophiobolin A, and calmidazolium chloride were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); BAPTA-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); 7-methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate (m7GTP) Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; [3H]leucine (>140 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 4E-BP1 and protein A-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and human recombinant PDGF A/B was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All remaining reagents were from common commercial sources. Rat-1 fibroblasts stably transfected with the human α1A AR were a gift from G. Johnson of Pfizer Laboratories (40.Kenny B.A. Miller A.M. Williamson I.J. O'Connell J. Chalmers D.H. Naylor A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cells do not express endogenous α1 ARs (41.Chen J. Lin R. Hu Z.W. Hoffman B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1376-1384PubMed Google Scholar). They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified environment of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/plate and used 3–4 days later when they were 80–90% confluent. The cells were incubated for 20–24 h in serum/antibiotic-free medium before starting experimental treatments. For experiments involving Ca2+, the cells were preincubated for 1 h in high salt glucose buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmMgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4 and 10 mm glucose) plus either 2 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+. Drugs were then added directly to the buffer at the indicated doses. To prepare lysates, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and the cell layers were incubated with cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and supernatants were retained. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford microprotein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in cell extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products). S6 kinase activity in cell lysates was measured using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrate as described previously (24.Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M. Parker P.J. Ballou L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The amount of 32P incorporated into S6 was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. One unit of enzyme incorporates 1 pmol of Pi into S6 per min. 4E-BP1 binding assays were performed as described previously (42.Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer as described above. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were diluted with 4E-BP1 binding assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm2-glycerophosphate, 100 μm GTP, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to bring the volume to 350 μl. Twenty-five microliters of m7GTP Sepharose beads were added to each sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Then, the beads were washed three times with the same buffer, and 4E-BP1 protein bound to the beads was eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 4E-BP1 was detected by Western blotting as described above. Cells were seeded in 12-well culture dishes at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well, and the next day, they were placed in serum-free medium. Twenty hours later, the cells were treated with 10 μm PE or 50 ng/ml PDGF. After 2 h, 1 μCi/ml of [3H]leucine was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of growth factors. Then, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer. One-half ml each of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20% trichloroacetic acid were added to each sample, and after 30 min on ice, they were passed through glass microfiber filters. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with 2 ml of ethanol and air dried for 30 min. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using the StatView program (Abacus Concept, Berkeley, CA). Pairwise comparisons were obtained using Fisher's post hoc tests. Values were considered significantly different whenp ≤ 0.01. To evaluate the effect of α1A AR stimulation on protein synthesis, Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing the receptor were treated with PE and incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cell material was measured. Protein synthesis in cells treated for 6 h with PE was 34% higher than the basal level in control cells (p < 0.001; Fig. 1). By comparison, PDGF treatment increased protein synthesis by 41% above the control (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at sites that cause it to dissociate from eIF4E is thought to contribute to growth factor-induced increases in the rate of protein synthesis (3.Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the extent of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by gel mobility shift assays after exposing Rat-1 cells to PE for various periods of time. 4E-BP1 migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels as three species designated α, β and γ. The γ band is the most highly phosphorylated species, and the α band is the least phosphorylated form. Stimulation of cells with PE led to a moderate increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, as judged by the mobility shift of the protein on Western blots (Fig.2). The fraction of 4E-BP1 migrating as the γ band reached a maximum after 10 min in the presence of PE, and thereafter it appeared that 4E-BP1 underwent some dephosphorylation, as the α band became more intense (Fig. 2). In contrast to PE, PDGF treatment induced a much higher level of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at every time examined, and the protein remained highly phosphorylated over the entire time course (Fig. 2). Prior studies have indicated that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, interferes with the pathway that leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to a variety of growth factors (13.Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of this molecule in signaling by the α1A AR, cells were preincubated in the presence of rapamycin prior to addition of PE and the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 was determined by mobility shift assays. Similar to the results in Fig. 2, the predominant isoform of 4E-BP1 in control cells was the hypophosphorylated β band (Fig.3 A, left panel). PE treatment converted about half of the protein to the hyperphosphorylated γ species, whereas in cells exposed to PDGF, essentially all of the 4E-BP1 was converted to the γ band. In control cells incubated with rapamycin, the basal level of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was decreased so that equal amounts of the α and β bands were visible (Fig.3 A, middle panel). The PE-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was completely inhibited in the presence of rapamycin, and the drug also strongly inhibited phosphorylation of the protein in response to PDGF. p70 S6 kinase activity measured in the same cell extracts was similarly inhibited by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3 C). This result suggests that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by the α1A AR is mediated by a pathway that requires mTOR. We have recently shown that PE treatment of these cells activates p70 S6 kinase with no corresponding increase in PI 3-kinase or Akt activity (35.Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the response of p70 S6 kinase to PE is still inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3 C and Ref. 35.Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with LY294002 also reduced the basal phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in control cells and completely inhibited phosphorylation of the protein in response to both PE and PDGF (Fig.3 A, right panel). These results indicate that 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and p70 S6 kinase activation induced by the α1A AR are similar in that both responses are independent of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling but exhibit sensitivity to LY294002 inhibition. Cell stimuli such as insulin induce the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, and it is not yet clear how these sites contribute to the control of 4E-BP1 function (20.Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because of this complexity, gel mobility shift assays reveal little about the functional state of 4E-BP1. To investigate the effect of α1A AR stimulation on binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, we measured the amount of 4E-BP1 that was coprecipitated with eIF4E using the mRNA cap affinity resin m7GTP Sepharose. Extracts of control and treated cells were incubated with m7GTP Sepharose and 4E-BP1 associated with the beads was visualized on Western blots. A large amount of 4E-BP1 was recovered from extracts of untreated control cells, due to tight binding between eIF4E and hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3 B, left panel;Ref. 5.Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The amount of 4E-BP1 precipitated by m7GTP Sepharose was greatly reduced in extracts of cells treated with PE, consistent with the interpretation that PE-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 disrupts the 4E-BP1-eIF4E complex. A similar result was obtained using extracts of cells treated with PDGF (Fig. 3 B,left panel). In addition, we determined that the PE-induced release of 4E-BP1 from m7GTP Sepharose and activation of p70 S6 kinase are insensitive to pertussis toxin (data not shown), indicating that these events are mediated by α1A AR signaling through Gq and not Gi proteins. m7GTP Sepharose binding assays were also done to evaluate the effect of rapamycin and LY294002 on 4E-BP1 function. In agreement with the mobility shift assays (Fig. 3 A), rapamycin completely inhibited the PE-induced dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E, whereas some release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E still occurred in PDGF-treated cells (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). By contrast, pretreatment with LY294002 completely blocked dissociation of the 4E-BP1-eIF4E complex induced by both PE and PDGF (Fig.3 B, right panel). Western blots from an experiment similar to the one shown in Fig. 3 B were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to eIF4E. Equal amounts of eIF4E were found in each lane, indicating that PE treatment of cells does not affect the ability of eIF4E to bind to the mRNA cap affinity resin (data not shown). These data show that stimulation of the α1A AR promotes the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at sites that cause it to be released from eIF4E. This mechanism may account at least in part for the PE-induced increase in protein synthesis illustrated in Fig. 1. As for all Gq-coupled receptors, stimulation of the α1AAR leads to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) and activation of diacylglycerol- and Ca2+-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) (36.Schluter K.D.

(1999) FEBS Lett. 457, 169–173). To determine the spatial proximity of these two residues, cross-linking gel-shift assays of the L30C/A354C double mutant were performed after the mutant had been oxidized with Cu2+/o-phenanthroline. The results indicated that Leu30 and Ala354 are close to each other but that Gly62, which is located in cytoplasmic loop 2–3, and Ala354 are distant from each other, as a negative control. Then, a single Cys residue was introduced into each of the six periplasmic loop regions (P1-P6), and eleven double mutants were constructed. Of these eleven double Cys mutants, the L30C/A354C and L30C/T235C mutants showed a mobility shift on oxidation, indicating that P1 is spatially close to P4 as well as P6.

The S92C and S296C mutants showed dimerization on intermolecular cross-linking, indicating that P2 and P5 are located at the periphery of the helix bundle. Our previous study on second-site suppressor mutations of the Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+antiporter suggested that Leu30 and Ala354, located in periplasmic loop 1–2 and 11–12, respectively, are conformationally linked to each other (Kawabe, T., and Yamaguchi, A.

Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phenylenedimaleimide 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane major facilitator superfamily Cu2+/o-phenanthroline N-ethylmaleimide The Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (TetA(B))1 is a typical bacterial drug export protein (2.McMurry L.

A. 1991; 88: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). TetA(B) belongs to a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (7.Henderson P.J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, the direction of the coupling of substrate transport with protons is opposite to that in the case of MFS symporters such as lactose permease. The transmembrane helix arrangement in lactose permease has been extensively studied by use of double Cys mutants as an alternative means of three-dimensional structure prediction without x-ray crystallographic analysis (8.Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9.Wu J. Hardy D. Kaback H.R.

It is of interest to find out whether antiporters and symporters are the same with regard to the fundamental molecular construction or whether the difference in the coupling direction reflects the helix arrangement. The twelve-transmembrane structure of TetA(B) has been experimentally confirmed (11.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the exact range of each transmembrane segment was determined on the basis of site-directed chemical modification of cysteine-scanning mutants (12.Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13.Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To evaluate the mutual proximity of transmembrane helices of TetA(B), we introduced a Cys residue into each periplasmic loop on the basis of a Cys-free mutant. To obtain double Cys combinations, we first looked for a pair for which close proximity was expected. In our previous paper (1.Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we reported that both G62L, which is in cytoplasmic loop 2–3, and G332S, which is in cytoplasmic loop 10–11, are suppressed by the second-site mutations of both L30S and A354D, which are located in periplasmic loop 1–2 and loop 11–12, respectively. G62L and G332S mutations both have a similar conformational effect on positions 30 and 354, resulting in the embedding of these residues in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Second-site mutations at Leu30 and Ala354 prevent the remote conformational distortion caused by the G62L and G332S mutations (1.Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16.Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results indicate the possibility that positions 30 and 354 are spacially close to each other. Thus, the L30C/A354C double mutant was prepared and the cross-linking was examined, with the G62C/A354C double mutant as a negative control. As a result, we could detect intramolecular cross-linking as an SDS-PAGE mobility shift of the double mutant after oxidation; then we introduced a Cys residue into each of the six periplasmic loop regions and constructed double Cys mutants. The results of the cross-linking assay indicate that the two ends, P1 and P6, are close to each other and that one of the central loops, P4, is close to P1. Such a periplasmic loop arrangement is similar to that of lac permease (17.Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), indicating that the MFS transporters may have a general three-dimensional structure despite the difference in the proton-coupling direction. Single Cys mutants were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (18.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). For the mutagenesis, plasmid pCTC377A (12.Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used as a template, where the Cys377→Ala mutation was introduced into pCT1183 (19.Someya Y. Niwa A. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which carries the 2.45-kilobase pair Tn10tetA and tetR gene fragments. Mutations were detected as the appearance of a newly introduced restriction site and verified by DNA sequencing. To avoid unexpected additional mutations, a cassette of the mutated fragment after sequencing was exchanged with the corresponding DNA fragment of the wild-type plasmid. Low copy number mutant plasmids were constructed through exchange of theBglII-BamHI fragment of the cysteine-scanning mutant tetA gene with the corresponding fragment of the low copy number plasmid pLGT2 (20.Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Ono N. Someya Y. Nakatani M. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7490-7498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for the construction of double Cys mutants. Double Cys mutants were constructed by recombination of a DNA fragment of one single Cys mutant gene with the corresponding fragment of the other single Cys mutant gene. L30C-containing double Cys mutants were constructed by exchanging theBglII-EcoRV fragment of the L30C DNA with the corresponding fragment of the other single Cys DNA. When the S92C, S156C, or G62C mutation was combined with the T235C, S296C, or A354C mutation, the BglII-EcoRI fragment of the former mutant was used for recombination. Crude membranes containing double Cys mutants were prepared by brief sonication of Escherichia coli W3104 cells carrying a mutant plasmid. Disulfide cross-linking was carried out by incubation of the membrane suspension (1.6 mg of protein/ml) in 180 μmCu2+/o-phenanthroline (CuPh) and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 5.7 mm). The samples were mixed with β-mercaptoethanol-free SDS sample buffer, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The TetA(B) bands were visualized by Western blotting using anti-TetA(B) C-terminal antiserum (21.Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As a control, the sulfhydryl groups of the double Cys mutants were masked by preincubation with 33 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at 30 °C for 10 min prior to the cross-linking reaction. When the effect of tetracycline was examined, the membranes were preincubated with 1 mm tetracycline and 50 mm MgSO4 for 5 min at 30 °C prior to the oxidation. o-Phenylenedimaleimide (PDM),m-PDM, p-PDM (Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH) (Pierce, Illinois) were used as cross-linking reagents. A membrane suspension (1.6 mg of protein/ml) was incubated with 0.5 mm cross-linking reagent in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol-free SDS sample buffer. The cross-linking bands were detected as described above. TableI shows the drug resistance of E. coli W3104 cells carrying the plasmid encoding the double Cys mutant tetA(B) gene. All of the double Cys mutants showed significant tetracycline resistance except for G62C/A354C, indicating that these mutants fundamentally maintained the normal conformation.Table ITetracycline resistance levels of E. coli W3104 cells harboring a plasmid encoding double-Cys mutantsMutantMICμg/mlno plasmid1.6pLGT2200C377A200L30C/S92C150L30C/S156C100L30C/T235C100L30C/S296C150L30C/A354C150S92C/T235C100S92C/S296C150S92C/A354C150S156C/T235C25S156C/S296C50S156C/A354C50G62C/A354C6.3The resistance levels are expressed as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Open table in a new tab The resistance levels are expressed as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Leu30 and Ala354 are located in putative periplasmic loops P1 and P6 (Fig.1). The topology shown in Fig. 1 was partially revised from a previous figure (11.Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) on the basis of our recent results relating to the chemical modification of cysteine-scanning mutants around transmembrane segment 1 (TM1). 2S. Iwaki, T. Someya-Kimura, N. Tamura, and A. Yamaguchi, unpublished results. In the current topology, Leu30 is at the middle of P1 whereas Ala354 is near the boundary between TM11 and P6. The L30C and A354C single mutants and the L30C/A354C double mutant showed the same mobility (34 kDa) as the Cys-free TetA(B) during SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A); however, after oxidation of the membranes with Cu2+/o-phenanthroline, only the L30C/A354C double Cys mutant gave a new band (30 kDa) exhibiting significantly increased mobility in the gel (Fig.2 A) in addition to the non-oxidized band. The 30-kDa band was not observed when the sulfhydryl groups were masked by preincubation of the membranes with NEM (Fig. 2 A). In addition, when oxidized L30C/A354C membranes were reduced with β-mercaptoethanol, the 30-kDa band was not observed (Fig.2 A). The 30:34-kDa band ratio depended on the temperature and the period of oxidation; however, the 34-kDa band remained under all conditions. On the basis of the mobility of the 30-kDa band and disappearance of the band on masking of the SH groups or under reducing conditions, it is concluded that the 30-kDa band of the L30C/A354C double Cys mutant observed under oxidizing conditions is due to the conformational shrinkage caused by intramolecular cross-linking. These results indicate that positions 30 (P1) and 354 (P6) are spatially close to each other.Figure 2Cu 2+ /o-phenanthroline-catalyzed mobility shift assay by SDS-PAGE.

In lane 6, the SH groups of the double Cys mutant were masked by NEM prior to oxidation. Inlane 7, the oxidized double Cys mutant was reduced with β-mercaptoethanol.

In our previous study, it was confirmed that Gly62 is located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (16.Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As expected, the G62C/A354C double Cys mutant showed no mobility shift under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2 B). Combinations of the L30C mutation and a Cys mutation in each periplasmic loop region were constructed. Of the four double Cys mutants, only L30C/T235C produced a 30-kDa band like the L30C/A354C mutant. Masking by NEM and reduction with β-mercaptoethanol completely prevented this mobility shift (Fig.3). Thus, it is concluded that positions 30 (P1) and 235 (P4) are close to each other. The other three combinations of L30C with S92C, S156C, and S296C did not produce a 30-kDa band (Fig. 3). However, in the case of the L30C/S92C and L30C/S296C mutants, a 64-kDa band corresponding to a dimer appeared under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3). The 64-kDa band disappeared with masking by NEM. The 64-kDa band was also observed for the S92C and S296C single Cys mutants but not for the L30C single Cys mutant (data not shown). Therefore, the 64-kDa band clearly represents the dimer formation due to Cys92-Cys92 or Cys296-Cys296 intermolecular cross-linking, suggesting that positions 92 and 296 are located at the periphery of the transmembrane helix bundle. On the other hand, the L30C/T235C mutant did not produce a 64-kDa band. The L30C/S156C mutant produced a 71-kDa band, the appearance of which was independent of oxidation. The double Cys mutants containing S156C combined with L30C (Fig. 3), T235C (Fig.4 A), and A354C (Fig.4 A) all did not produce a 30-kDa band under oxidizing conditions. The S156C/S296C double mutant produced an oxidation-dependent 64-kDa band that drastically decreased with masking of SH groups by NEM (Fig. 4 A). The S156C single Cys mutant did not produce a 64-kDa band. This finding also supported the Cys296-Cys296 intermolecular cross-linking. The S156C/T235C mutant gave an unidentified and oxidation-independent 71-kDa band similar to the L30C/S156C mutant. The double Cys mutants containing S92C combined with L30C (Fig. 3), T235C, S296C, and A354C (Fig. 4 B) all did not produce a 30-kDa band under oxidizing conditions. On the other hand, all of these double Cys mutants produced an oxidation-dependent 64-kDa band, confirming the Cys92-Cys92 intermolecular cross-linking. In the case of the S92C/T235C mutant, the 64-kDa band was very thin but significant. The S92C/S296C double Cys mutant produced 98 and 118-kDa bands corresponding to a trimer and a tetramer, respectively, in addition to the 64-kDa band, indicating that both Cys92 and Cys296 in this mutant can undergo intermolecular cross-linking and confirming the location of these positions at the periphery of the helix bundle. As to the S92C/S296C double Cys mutant, several cross-linking reagents for SH groups were tested. As shown in Fig. 4 C, all of the cross-linking reagents tested here caused the formation of dimers, trimers, and tetramers; however, the degree of the multimer formation was in the following order: p-PDM > BMH >m-PDM > o-PDM. NEM pretreatment prevented the multimer formation with cross-linking reagents. These results supported the hypothesis that positions 92 and 296 are located at the periphery of the periplasmic helix bundle of TetA(B). In our previous study, we found that conformational changes in the cytoplasmic and periplasmic loop regions were induced in the presence of tetracycline (22.Kimura T. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of tetracycline on the cross-linking was examined. Among the eleven periplasmic double Cys mutants, only the cross-linking of the L30C/T235C mutant was significantly prevented in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 5), suggesting that the distance between P1 and P4 and/or the orientation of the side chains could be changed by tetracycline. In this study, we showed that intramolecular disulfide cross-linking could be detected as a mobility shift during SDS-PAGE of double Cys mutants under oxidizing conditions. On the basis of this mobility shift, we investigated the proximity of the periplasmic loop regions. As a result, it was revealed that P1 was close to P6 and P4. The P2 and P5 loops seem to be located on the outside surface of the helix bundle. These results indicate that in the periplasm, the terminal loops are proximal to each other in addition to one of the central loops, and the second two loops from the terminal are at the periphery of the helix bundle. Tetracycline caused alteration of the distance between and/or orientation of P1 and P4 but did not affect the distance between P1 and P6. Our site-directed chemical modification studies on the cysteine-scanning mutants of TetA(B) 3The results of TM2, 3, 6, and 9 were reported in Refs. 14.Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

The results of other helices are now in preparation for publication. exhibited that helices 3, 6, 9 and 12 are completely embedded in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane whereas helices 2, 5, 8, and 11 face a water-filled channel throughout their length. On the other hand, helices 1 and 7 face the channel only at their periplasmic halves whereas helices 4 and 10 face the channel at their cytoplasmic halves; that is, these four helices tilt with respect to the channel. On the basis of the results of site-directed chemical modification studies and the current results of cross-linking studies, we presented a model of the helix arrangement of TetA(B) on the periplasmic surface of the membrane as shown in Fig. 6. In this study, we examined the intramolecular cross-linking on the basis of a mobility shift during SDS-PAGE caused by a cross-linking-induced conformational change of TetA(B). This method is remarkable because it can be performed with intact membrane proteins retaining full transport activity; however, when the cross-linking-induced conformational change is small, the cross-linking may be missed in the gel shift assay. Split proteins (9.Wu J. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or protease digestion of protease-site-introduced proteins (17.Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has been generally used to confirm intramolecular cross-linking. Unfortunately, because split TetA(B) proteins exhibit reduced transport activity (23.Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the efficiency of the membrane assembly by the Cys mutants of the split TetA(B) was very low, we could not use split TetA(B) proteins. Similarly, protease-site-introduced TetA(B) proteins could not be used in this experiment. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine whether the Cys residues in the double Cys mutants showing no mobility shift during oxidation are really distant from each other. However, the proximity of the Cys residues in the double Cys mutants showing a mobility shift is beyond doubt. Cross-linking studies on membrane transporters have been extensively performed by Kaback et al. (8.Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with lactose permease, and were revealed to be very useful for estimating the helix arrangements of polytopic membrane proteins. For periplasmic loops of lactose permease, Sun and Kaback (17.Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that P1 is close to P4 and P6, and P2 and P5 are at the periphery. The cross-linking between P1 and P4 was affected by the ligand-induced conformational change (24.Sun J. Kemp C.R. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The results of the cross-linking studies on the periplasmic loops are strikingly similar to the current results for TetA(B). As for the transmembrane segments of lactose permease, TM1 is close to TM5, 7, and 11 (10.Wang Q. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25.Wu J. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15785-15790Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TM5 is also close to TM7 and 8 at the periplasmic side (27.Wu J. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2320-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If cross-linking can be formed across the water-filled channel, our model for helix packing of TetA(B) was perfectly consistent with the cross-linking results for lactose permease. Goswitz and Brooker (26.Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) presented a general model for the transmembrane helix arrangement of MFS transporters. When considering the tilting of helices 1, 4, 7, and 10, our model is consistent with the Goswitz and Brooker model (26.Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), including the order of each helix arrangement. Our current study strongly supports the idea that MFS transporters have a common three-dimensional structure."

The recent resolution of the crystallographic structure of mitochondrial Cyt bc 1 has made it possible to correlate the orientations of the gx, gy, and gz axes with the geometry of the iron-sulfur cluster. Similarly, EPR studies on a crystal of oxidized Cyt c (29.Mailer C. Taylor C.P.S. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) established that the gx and gy axes of the tensor lie along the two N-Fe-N axes, and the gz axis is normal to the plane. In principle, this information could be used to try and determine by EPR the orientation of thec 1/f- and b-hemes in thebf-bc complexes. In practice, however, the low amplitude and overlap of the EPR signals render a precise study difficult (26.Riedel A. Rutherford A.W. Hauska G. Müller A. Nitschke W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Erecińska M. Wilson D.F. Blasie J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 501: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Linear dichroism (LD) constitutes an alternative method. The α, β, and γ optical absorbance bands of Cyt c are known to correspond to electronic transitions lying in the heme plane (31.Eaton W.A. Hochstrasser R.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1967; 46: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), a conclusion tentatively extended to other hemes (32.Hofrichter J.J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Each of these bands corresponds, in many but not all cases (33.Verméglio A. Breton J. Barouch Y. Clayton R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), to the overlap of two transitions. The directions of the two transitions in the plane of the heme are not known with certainty but have been proposed to lie along the X and Y Fe-pyrrole ring directions (34.Gouterman M. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Academic Press, New York1978: 1-165Google Scholar,35.Adar F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Academic Press, New York1978: 167-209Crossref Google Scholar). Bacteriochlorophylls (BChl) and chlorophylls (Chl) lack the high degree of symmetry of porphyrins, and the absorbance bands associated with different directions in the plane of the chlorin ring are therefore always distinct (32.Hofrichter J.J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36.Breton J. Verméglio A. Govindjee R. Photosynthesis: Energy Conversion by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1982: 153-194Crossref Google Scholar). In the present work, we have applied LD to studying the orientation of the hemes and of Chla in the Cytb 6 f complex from the freshwater alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This study has been complemented by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) signal that results from excitonic interaction between the b-hemes, whose intensity depends on their distance and relative arrangement in space. Altogether, these data provide information about similarities and differences in the organization of prosthetic groups in the Cytb 6 f complex as compared with that in the mitochondrial enzyme. C. reinhardtii Cytb 6 f was purified as described previously (19.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cyt b 6 concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8543 spectrophotometer following reduction with either ascorbate or dithionite, taking the molar extinction coefficient in the difference spectrum to be ε564 = 20,000m−1·cm−1 (37.Rich P.R. Heathcote P. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 138-151Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reaction centers (RC) were purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides R-26 by a protocol derived from Ref. 38.Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 459: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar. The membrane fragments were resuspended to A 870 = 50 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. LDAO (0.1% w/v) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min at room temperature in the dark and centrifuged at 255,000 × g for 90 min. After dialysis, the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% LDAO (buffer C), and eluted with a 10–500 mm NaCl linear gradient. Fractions containing the RC were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against buffer C. A second chromatography was then performed in the identical manner. The pure RC (A 280/A 800 <1.3) was pooled, concentrated, and stored at −70 °C. Cytb 6 f complex was co-reconstituted into lipid vesicles along with RC using a procedure similar to that described in Ref. 39.Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. RC was first transferred from LDAO to Hecameg (HG) solution by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. Cytb 6 f, RC, and a solution of egg phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in HG were mixed in a weight ratio of 1:1:10 in HG solution (20 mm in 20 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), respectively, and the mixture was diluted with Tricine buffer below the critical micellar concentration of HG (39.Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 90,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min on a 30% w/v sucrose cushion in the same buffer. Optical redox titrations were done using the following mediators: 20 μmbenzyl viologen, 40 μm duroquinol, 20 μmphenazine, 20 μm naphthoquinol, 20 μmanthraquinol 2-sulfonate, 20 μm2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinol, 40 μm2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Samples were supplemented with 60% glycerol (v/v). Equilibrium redox titrations were performed with an anaerobic redox cuvette as described in Ref. 40.Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar. Reduction was achieved by adding aliquots of an extemporaneously prepared concentrated solution of sodium dithionite. Samples were transferred into sealed optical cuvettes after redox equilibrium (monitored under argon) was reached. Absorbance spectra were recorded at 100 K on a Cary 14 interfaced to a microcomputer. LD spectra were recorded at 10 K on isolated Cyt b 6 f complexes and proteoliposomes integrated into squeezed polyacrylamide gel as described previously (41.Haworth P. Tapie P. Arntzen C. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 152-159Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42.Tapie P. Haworth P. Hervo G. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 339-344Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Polymerization of the gel was accompanied by a partial and variable bleaching of theb 6 f-associated Chla. In the spectra from these samples, the contribution of Chlatherefore is less than in the originalb 6 f preparations (compare Fig. 2with Fig. 2 of Ref. 19.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The different redox states were obtained by incubating the gels overnight in 27 mm Tris-HCl, 60% (v/v) glycerol, containing either 25 mm ferricyanide, 100 mm ascorbate, or 100 mm dithionite. In some samples, heme b H turned out to be partially reduced by ascorbate, which helped in the decomposition of theLD spectra. LD spectra were recorded on a home-built spectrophotometer (42.Tapie P. Haworth P. Hervo G. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 339-344Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43.Breton J. Contribution á Pétude de Pórientation des Pigments dan les Membranes Photosynthétiques par Spectroscopic Optique Enlumiére Polariséc. Doctoral dissertation. Université Paris-XI, Orsay1977Google Scholar). The orientation of electronic transitions was calculated using Equation 1. LD/A=3/2α(3 cos2β−1)Equation 1 where LD represents the amplitude of the linear dichroism signal, A that of the absorbance signal, β the tilt of the transition with respect to the gel compression axis, and α a constant that is a function both of the statistical orientation parameter of the sample in the polyacrylamide gel and of the characteristics of the spectrophotometer. When the two transitions X and Y are energetically distinct the angles βx and βy for each transition can be determined. Assuming X andY transitions to be orthogonal to each other and to lie in the plane of the tetrapyrrole ring, the tilt τ of the normal to the ring with respect to the gel compression axis is given by Equation2. sIN2τ=cos2βX+cos2βYEquation 2 If X and Y transitions are not orthogonal, the angles are related by the function shown in Equation 3. sIN2τ=cos2βX+cos2βY+cos2φ−2 cosβX·cosβY·cosφEquation 3 where φ is the angle between the X and theY transitions. A fitting program (Sigma Plot, Jandel Scientific) was used to simultaneously fit LD and absorption (from dichroism and redox titration experiments) spectra. The fitting procedure held, for a heme, the wavelength positions of the X and Ytransitions constant in the LD and absorption spectra and held theA X/AY areas ratio constant in all absorption spectra and between two LD spectra, but allowed these ratios to vary between absorption and LD spectra. Gaussian line shapes were used. There are two sources of experimental errors, measurements and analysis. The laboratory-built spectrophotometer used yields measurements (recorded twice and averaged) whose noise level does not exceed 1% of the signal. The main source of errors therefore arises from the fitting procedure. For a given heme, we allowed a maximum 2% of variation in the respective contributions of the X andY transitions to independent spectra. Global fits were constrained to respect a maximum 3% of deviation of fittedversus experimental values. From Equation 1, we can evaluate the propagation of errors, ΔLD and ΔA, on the orientation of a single transition, Δβ, as shown in Equation 4. Δβ=arccos[1/3[2/3(ΔLD/ΔA)+1]] 1/2Equation 4 The value of Δβ depends on that ofLD/A, but in the worst case and considering the largest error, the margin of error is ± 2.5°. Most results presented in this paper refer to normal to the heme plane as defined by the X and Y transitions instead of angles of individual transitions. From Equation 2, we can evaluate the resultant errors, Δτ, on the tilt angle τ of this normal, as shown in Equation 5. Δτ=arcsin[1/3[2+2/3(ΔLDX/ΔAX+ΔLDY/ΔAY)] 1/2Equation 5 The error again depends on LD/A, but in the worst case we calculate a maximal theoretical margin of error of ±3.5°. CD spectra were measured on a Mark V Jobin & Yvon spectropolarimeter, using 0.7-ml samples in 2-mm path length quartz cuvettes (Hellma, QS 0.200 series 282). Spectra were scanned between 380 and 460 nm in 0.2-nm steps, using a response time of 1 s and a sensitivity of 2–5 × 10−6, first after reducing the samples with solid ascorbate and then following reduction by solid dithionite. Absolute spectra were obtained as the average of two scans minus that of two buffer blanks. Data are shown as the difference between absolute spectra recorded in the two redox conditions. Monomerization of Cytb 6 f was achieved by supplementing a dimeric sample in 400 mm ammonium phosphate, 20 mm HG, 0.1 g/liter egg phosphatidylcholine with solid HG in order to make it 100 mm HG and incubating for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark (cf. Ref. 39.Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Examination of protein crystal structure and geometrical measurements were carried out using the CCP4 program package (44.Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, distance and angle measurements on Cyt bc 1 refer to the complex from chicken muscle mitochondria (Protein Data Bank code 1BCC; Ref. 2.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M.

Determining the orientation of chromophores in a complex requires the use of an oriented sample. In the present experiments, immobilization was achieved by supplementing samples with polyacrylamide and inducing polymerization. It did not affect the spectrum of the hemes in the b 6 fcomplex, but depending on the exact experimental conditions, chlorophyll a, on the other hand, could be bleached to different extents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Orientation was then induced by compressing the gel (as detailed in Ref. 45.Tiede D.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 397-410Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have performed LD studies both on isolated C. reinhardtii Cytb 6 f and on liposomes containing Cytb 6 f co-reconstituted along withRb. sphaeroides RC. The first type of samples allows only the relative orientation of chromophores with respect to each other to be determined but offers a good resolution of complex spectral contributions. Reconstituted samples enable one to determine the absolute orientation of chromophores with respect to the membrane plane by including a protein of known structure as an internal reference while limiting the overlapping contribution of the large number of chromophores that would be present in native membranes. The orientation of a tetrapyrrole ring can be deduced from that of itsX and Y electronic transitions. Establishing the orientation of the three hemes in theb 6 f complex, therefore, requires determining the orientations, for each heme, either of the directions of its X and Y transitions (if they are distinguishable) or that of the normal to the ring plane in which they lie (if they are degenerate). In the fully reduced complex, the corresponding absorbance bands overlap. Since the three hemes, however, have different midpoint redox potentials, their spectra can be separated by analyzing spectra of the complex recorded at 100 K at various redox potentials. Given the E m values of the three hemes (19.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), only Cytf contributes to spectruma of Fig. 1 A. Under the redox conditions of spectrum b, the totality of Cytf is reduced together with part of hemeb H. Spectrum c corresponds to the sum of Cytf and heme b H. Spectrumd also contains a contribution from partially reduced hemeb L, whereas in spectrum e all of the three hemes are totally reduced. Decomposition of the ensemble of spectra allows one to resolve the contributions of each heme, as shown in Fig. 1 B. The spectrum of Cytf features α-band maxima at 547.2 and 551.4 nm and that of hemeb H α-band maxima at 557.5 and 561 nm (calculated by subtracting spectrum a from spectrumc), whereas the spectrum of heme b L(obtained by subtracting spectrum d from spectrume) presents a single α-band maximum at 560 nm. In this, as in most respects, the Cyt b 6 fcomplex from C. reinhardtii is similar to the complex from spinach (46.Hurt C. Hauska G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 413-419Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Time-resolved measurements have shown that, at room temperature, the α-band maxima of b H andb L differ by only 0.6 nm (47.Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 319-333Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), making them indistinguishable in static measurements (19.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As our results show, they can, however, be resolved from each other at 100 K, a prerequisite to a detailed LD analysis. Because of the 4-fold symmetry of metalloporphyrins, α transitions are expected to be degenerate in the heme plane (the X andY transitions being isoenergetic). However, imbalance along these two axes may arise from asymmetric electrostatic fields created by the surrounding protein (36.Breton J. Verméglio A. Govindjee R. Photosynthesis: Energy Conversion by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1982: 153-194Crossref Google Scholar). As will be shown below, at 100 K theX and Y transitions of bothb H and b L are separated by ∼3.5 nm. In b H, the absorbance of the two bands is in such a ratio (0.39:1) that the blue-shifted band appears as a distinct shoulder to the left of the α peak, whereas inb L its contribution is smaller (0.26:1) and is mainly reflected in the asymmetry of the peak (Fig. 1 B) (see below in the “Discussion”). Well resolved spectra recorded on the isolated complex were used to ascertain the amplitude and position of each A and LD band. Absorbance and LD spectra recorded on the dithionite-reduced complex (Fig. 2) show relatively well resolvedX and Y transitions of heme f at 547.2 and 551.4 nm, whereas peaks at 560.5 nm in the absorbance spectrum and at 556.7 and 561 nm in the LD spectrum reflect the superposition of spectral contributions of b H andb L. At 665.2 nm, the spectra show the pure contribution of the QY transition of Chla, and at 627.7 nm the smaller contribution of the QX transition of chlorophyll overlapped with a vibrational component of the QYone (36.Breton J. Verméglio A. Govindjee R. Photosynthesis: Energy Conversion by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1982: 153-194Crossref Google Scholar). The normalized dichroism (LD/A ratio) did not change significantly across the 665.2 nm band, showing that it is indeed a pure single transition. It was not affected by the variable degree of bleaching occurring upon gel polymerization, indicating that, from the point of view of their orientation, Chla molecules were a homogeneous population. In order to resolve the complex spectra in the Cyt α-band region, we first calculated LD/A ratios for the Cytftransitions using spectra recorded on an ascorbate-treated complex, where only Cytf was reduced (Fig.3 A and TableI). Spectra obtained under more reducing conditions, where the b H-heme appeared partially reduced (see “Experimental Procedures”), allowed us to determine the LD/A values for the X and Ytransitions of heme b H (Table I; spectra not shown). After subtracting the f andb H contributions from the LD spectrum of a dithionite-reduced sample, we finally resolved the two transitions of the b L-heme at 556.4 and 559.8 nm (Table I; note that the X and Y transitions ofb L, largely overlapped in absorbanc"

The combination of redox-resolved absorption spectrophotometry and linear dichroism experiments at low temperature allows the determination of the orientation of the three hemes with respect to the membrane plane. The orientations of theb H-and b L-hemes of theR. sphaeroides and beef heart mitochondrial complexes are similar to those determined by crystallographic studies of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1. On the other hand the orientations of the b-hemes of the R. rubrum complex lead to the conclusion that theb H-heme is more perpendicular to the membrane plane than the b L-heme. This could be explained by a specific organization of the b-hemes due to subunit composition of the complex or, alternatively, to a different spatial position of the heme transitions with respect to the porphyrin macrocycle compared with the other complexes. Moreover, our results demonstrate a different orientation of the hemec 1 of the three studied complexes in comparison to crystallographic studies. This difference may arise from the above hypothesis on the transitions of the heme or from flexibility of this subunit in function of its redox state.

These enzymes couple the two-electron oxidation of quinol (ubi-, mena-, or plasto-) and the one-electron reduction of cytochrome (Cyt)1 c (or Cytc 2, HiPIP, plastocyanin) to the electrogenic translocation of protons across the membrane bilayer. These complexes therefore contribute to the electrochemical proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The catalytic heart of the enzyme consists of three subunits, Cytb, Cyt c 1, and the iron sulfur protein (termed the Rieske protein) that carry four redox centers. The Cyt b subunit contains a high potential and a low potentialb- type heme (termed b H andb L, respectively); the Cytc 1 subunit contains a c-type heme, and the Rieske protein contains a 2Fe-2S cluster. The complete atomic structure of the mitochondrial enzyme from two species has recently been published (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M. Chi Y.- I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), but no such structure is presently available for any of the bacterial counterparts. For structural and functional studies of the Cyt bc 1 complex, the photosynthetic bacteria provide, however, several experimental advantages as follows: (i) the bacterial enzyme shows a much simpler organization than the mitochondrial enzyme. Although the mitochondrial Cyt bc 1 complex contains 11 subunits (the functions of which are mostly unknown except those of the catalytic one), the complex from Rhodobacter (Rb.)sphaeroides is reduced to four subunits (7.Andrews K.M. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8.Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4934-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the enzyme from Rhodospirillum (Rs.)rubrum represents the simplest composition with only the three catalytic subunits (9.Kriauciunas A., Yu, L., Yu, C.-A. Wynn R.M. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (ii) The reactions catalyzed by the Cytbc 1 complex of photosynthetic bacteria can be triggered by light which allows the (kinetic) temporal resolution of the different electron transfer events in the complex. (iii) The prokaryotic systems are well suited for application of site-directed mutagenesis techniques, since mutated Cyt bc 1complexes that do not function properly can be examined using biochemical and biophysical techniques. This is possible because the presence of Cyt bc 1 complex is not strictly required during aerobic growth due to the presence of alternative quinol oxidases constituting a Cyt c-independent respiratory system. Due to these experimental advantages and the far-going similarities with the mitochondrial enzyme, the proteobacterial Cytbc 1 complexes provide ideal model systems for structure/function studies. However, a thorough comparison of the general structure, and first of all of the spatial organization of the cofactors, in the bacterial and mitochondrial complexes is a prerequisite for the transposition of the bacterial results to the mitochondrial counterpart. In the absence of the atomic structure, the orientation of the Cytbc complex cofactors can be determined by use of spectroscopic techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) or linear dichroism (LD) on oriented immobilized samples.

This is most probably due to the small signal sizes as well as to the spectral overlap of b- and c-hemes in these enzymes (13.Erecinska M. Wilson D.F. Blasie J.K. Biochim. Biophys.

The porphyrin π electronic transitions, which produce the α, β, and γ optical bands, are in fact ideal for molecular orientation studies, since the polarization ratio (LD/A) for a linear absorber can be related to the orientation of the X and Yaxis in the porphyrin plane (21.Eaton W.A.

In the present study we have ascertained this LD approach by a study of the beef heart mitochondrial complex for which the atomic structure has been determined (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M.

We have then applied this method to determine the orientation of the three hemes associated with the Cyt bc 1 complexes from Rb. sphaeroides and Rs. rubrum. Rb. sphaeroides R-26 andRs. rubrum G9 were grown phototrophically for 48 h at 29 °C in sealed bottles in modified Hutner medium (25.Clayton R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 575-580Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Membrane fragments from Rs. rubrum andRb. sphaeroides were prepared from French press cell extracts by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 255,000 ×g for 90 min. Membranes were stored at −70 °C. Purification of the Cyt bc 1 complexes was achieved by a procedure similar to those of Andrews et al.(7.Andrews K.M. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and Kriauciunas et al. (9.Kriauciunas A., Yu, L., Yu, C.-A. Wynn R.M. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

The second steps of chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B without glycerol in the original paper (9.Kriauciunas A., Yu, L., Yu, C.-A. Wynn R.M. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Pure Cytbc 1 complex fractions (followed spectrophotometrically by theA 280/A 417 ratio) were pooled, dialyzed to remove NaCl, concentrated, and stored in 20% glycerol at −70 °C. Submitochondrial fractions were kindly given by G. Brandolin. The purification of the Cyt bc 1complex was done by a procedure similar to the one published by Berryet al. (26.Berry E.A. Huang L. DeRose V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9064-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The submitochondrial fraction was washed as described in Ref. 26.Berry E.A. Huang L. DeRose V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9064-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, but purification of the Cyt bc 1 complex was performed directly on this washed submitochondria without applying it on the Percoll gradient purification steps. Fractions presenting Cyt bc 1complex without oxidase were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 20% glycerol, 260 mm NaCl at −70 °C. Optical redox titrations were done as described previously (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) on sample supplemented with 60% glycerol. After redox equilibrium was reached, samples were transferred into sealed optical cuvettes. LD spectra were recorded on purified Cytbc 1 complexes integrated into squeezed polyacrylamide gel as described previously (27.Haworth P. Tapie P. Arntzen C. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 152-159Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28.Tapie P. Haworth P. Hervo G. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 339-344Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The different redox states were obtained by overnight incubation in 27 mmTris-HCl, 60% glycerol with either 25 mm ferricyanide or 100 mm ascorbate or 100 mm dithionite. The LD spectra were recorded on a laboratory-built spectrophotometer previously described (28.Tapie P. Haworth P. Hervo G. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 339-344Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29.Breton J. Contribution á Pétude d P'orientation des Pigments dan les Membranes Photosynthétiques par Spectrocopic Optique Enlumiére Polariséc. Doctoral dissertation. Université Paris-XI, Orsay1977Google Scholar). The analysis of the different spectra was done as previously detailed (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When both X andY transitions can be defined, the orientation of the transitions were calculated according to Equation 1. LD/A=3/2 α (3cos2β−1)Equation 1 where LD is the Linear Dichroism signal, Athe absorption signal, α the statistical orientation parameter of the sample in the polyacrylamide gel, and β the angle between the considered transition and the orientation axis (in degrees). Assuming that X and Y transitions are orthogonal and lie in the heme plane, the tilt τ of the chromophore normal to the orientation axis can be determined by Equation 2. sin2τ=cos2βX+cos2βYEquation 2 When the transitions X and Y are energetically equivalent (case of circular degeneracy), only the angle τ between the normal of the heme plane and the orientation axis can be calculated using Equation 3. LD/A=3/4 α (1−3cos2τ)Equation 3 A fitting program (Sigma Plot, Jandel Scientific) was used to simultaneously fit LD and absorption (from dichroism and redox titration experiments) spectra as detailed previously (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The experimental errors calculation, as detailed elsewhere (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), determine, for the case of distinguishable X and Ytransitions, that angles are ± 3.5° reliable. For the case of circular degeneracy, the use of Equation 3 evaluates the consequent margin in the angle determination Δτ of the normal, arising from these experimental errors ΔLD/ΔA as shown in Equation 4. Δτ=arcos[1/3(1−4/3(ΔLD/ΔA))] 1/2Equation 4 this determines the extent of the margin in calculated τ angle, in the worse case, at 8°. The angles between heme plane and membrane plane are therefore reliable in ±4° in the case of circular degeneracy. To determine the orientation of the three hemes of the complex, we must know the specific spectral contributions ofc 1-, b H-, andb L-hemes. Because the three hemes can be distinguished by their mid-point redox potential, we have performed redox-resolved spectra. For a better spectral resolution, all the experiments were performed at 100 or 10 K. The absorption and LD spectra recorded at 10 K on the isolated Cyt bc 1 complex from beef heart mitochondria in the ascorbate-reduced state (Fig. 1 A) and the dithionite-reduced state (Fig. 1 B) are presented in Fig.1. Taking into account the ambient redox potential imposed by the ascorbate, and the mid-point redox potentials of the hemes c 1-, b H-, and b L-hemes (+232, +93, and −34 mV respectively (30.Nelson B.D. Gellerfors P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 357: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), the spectral contributions observed in Fig.1 A are unambiguously attributed to thec 1- and b H-hemes. Thec 1-heme presents two distinct transitions centered in the absorption spectra and in the LD spectra at 548.2 and 552.8 nm. The spectra in the Cyt b region are more complex. In the absorption and LD spectra of ascorbate-reduced complex, a single maximum is observed at 558.4 and 557.6 nm, respectively. This difference in wavelength position implies that theb H-heme absorption is composed of two transitions absorbing at slightly different wavelengths. The best simultaneous deconvolution of the LD and absorption spectra of ascorbate-reduced sample was obtained by supposing that, in addition to the transitions of the c 1-heme, theb H-heme possesses two contributions at 555.6 and 558.8 nm. Redox-resolved spectra (data not shown) confirmed this deconvolution. For the dithionite-reduced sample, the absorption spectrum presents, in addition to the transitions of hemec 1, a unique maximum at 559 nm whereas two minima are observed at 557.6 and 561 nm in the corresponding LD spectrum. This implies that the b L-heme possesses two distinct transitions absorbing at 557.4 and 561.8 nm with amplitude ratio of 1 to 2, respectively, in agreement with room temperature spectra (31.Arutjunjan A.M. Kamensky Y.A. Milgröm E. Surkov S. Konstantinov A.A. Sharonov Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 95: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The above results allow the complete attribution of transitions of each heme in the low temperature spectrum of reduced Cytbc 1 complex of beef mitochondria as shown in Fig. 1 B. To the best of our knowledge this represents the first determination of the optical contributions of all the hemes of the mitochondrial enzyme at low temperature. The transitions of theb H-heme that are unresolved at room temperature (31.Arutjunjan A.M. Kamensky Y.A. Milgröm E. Surkov S. Konstantinov A.A. Sharonov Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 95: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) are hardly distinguished even at low temperature. The spectrum ofb H is similar to the one published forSaccharomyces cerevisiae (32.Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillote P. di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except for a small difference in wavelength maximum. The deconvolution in single components allowed us to calculate theLD/A ratio for each individual transition of hemes c 1, b H, andb L. However, the absolute orientation of the hemes could not be determined. In fact the squeezed polyacrylamide gel method (as well as most of the methods of orientation) leads to an incomplete orientation of the sample, represented by the term α in Equations 1 or 3. Therefore the recorded LD/Aratio allows us only to deduce relative angles. To obtain the exact angle, it is necessary to calibrate the term α by an other approach. For this we have used the results of the crystallographic studies on the beef heart mitochondrial complex. Theb L-heme plane is proposed to be tilted at 82° with respect to the membrane plane when taking theN A–N C andN B–N D axes as defining the heme plane (6.Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The b L-heme normal would therefore be 82° tilted with respect to the orientation axis. By using this value, the orientation parameter α is determined, and the absolute orientation of the other two hemes of the complex are then calculated. We determined tilt angles of 75 and 58° with respect to the membrane plane for b H- andc 1-hemes, respectively. The value obtained for the b H is, within experimental errors (±3.5 degrees, see “Experimental Procedures”), fully compatible with the one (76°) deduced from the crystallographic structure of Iwataet al. (6.Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the orientation of the heme of Cyt c 1 deduced from our LD study is significantly different from the value proposed by the crystallographic structure (79°). This discrepancy will be discussed in detail later. In the ascorbate-reduced complex we can determine the relative orientation of the b H- andc 1-hemes in conditions where theb L-heme is oxidized. If we consider a similar orientation for the b H-heme in both redox conditions, i.e. 75°, tilt angle of thec 1-heme is found equal to 56°. From both experiments performed on the mitochondrial complex, we therefore determined tilt angles of the b H- andc 1-heme at 75 and 57 ± 1°, with a reference value for the b L-heme at 82°. The different contributions of the hemes in the Cyt bc 1 complex fromRs. rubrum were determined by applying redox-resolved spectrophotometry at low temperature. Upon gradual reduction of the sample, as shown in Fig.2 A, a peak centered at 549.5 nm followed by a second peak centered at 555.2 nm and by a third one at 560.1 nm appeared. Taking into account the mid-point redox potentials determined by Kriauciunas et al. (9.Kriauciunas A., Yu, L., Yu, C.-A. Wynn R.M. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (−30 and −90 mV for the b H-, and b L-heme, respectively), we deduced that hemes c 1,b H, and b L have α-band wavelength maxima at 549.5, 554.5, and 560.1 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Each heme presents a single optical component, without any distinction in absorption between theX and Y transitions, even at low temperature. Only the b L spectrum is clearly asymmetric. As shown in Fig.3, both the absorption and the LD spectra of the Cyt bc 1 complex from Rs. rubrum, in dithionite-reduced state, present three peaks. The near mid-point redox potential of the b H- andb L-hemes does not allow us to obtain spectra with only the b H-heme reduced in gel-immobilized sample. Deconvolution of the spectra reveals that the absorption peaks correspond closely to the LD absorption peaks, and we assign the 549.5, 554.5, and 560.1 nm peaks to the c 1-,b H-, and b L-hemes, respectively. This implies that the transitions of thec 1-, b H-, andb L-hemes are circularly degenerate. Even if the study of isolated complex does not allow the determination of absolute angles, the relative values of the LD/A for the optical transition of each heme show that the tilt ofb H-heme with respect to the membrane plane is in any case greater than the one of b L-heme contrary to the case of the beef heart mitochondrial complex. The assumption that the b L-heme of the Rs. rubrum and beef heart mitochondria complexes have the same orientation with the membrane plane (i.e. 82°) leads to a mathematical impossibility for the calculation of the angle of theb H-heme with respect to the membrane. The assumption of a similar orientation (i.e. 76°) for theb H-heme of Rs. rubrum and of beef heart mitochondrial complex determines, averaging results from three independent experiments, tilts with respect to the membrane plane of 61 ± 2 and 66 ± 2° for c 1 andb L, respectively. The redox-resolved absorption spectra obtained for the three hemes associated with the Cytbc 1 complex from Rb. sphaeroides are shown in Fig. 4. According to the redox potentials determined by Andrews et al. (7.Andrews K.M. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the spectruma represents the c 1-heme reduced only, and the spectrum b represents part of theb H-heme reduced in addition to thec 1-heme. The spectrum c contains, in addition, part of the b L-heme reduced, and the spectrum d represents the three hemes completely reduced. By combinations of these different spectra the following attributions shown in Fig. 4 B can be made: the α-band wavelength maxima are at 549.3 and 551.6 nm for heme c 1, 557 nm for heme b H, and 555.2 and 561.2 nm for hemeb L in agreement with Gabellini and Hauska (34.Gabellini N. Hauska G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both results, our and those of Gabellini and Hauska (34.Gabellini N. Hauska G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), determined, therefore, the b L-heme presenting two peaks at ∼555 and ∼561 nm but with different bandwidth, the 555 nm peak being narrower than the 561 nm one. The large differences in bandwidth and in wavelength position of the two transitions are unusual for cytochromes. To explain this fact, we propose that part of the absorption changes observed upon reduction of theb L is not a direct contribution of this heme but is linked to a small blue shift (1 nm) of the b Hoptical transition. In this hypothesis the reducedb L-heme presents two transitions with similar bandwidth and amplitude ratio of 0.6 and 1, respectively. This interpretation is in agreement with room temperature redox titration of Cyt bc 1 complex of Rb. sphaeroideswhich shows that the b L-heme presents two transitions centered at 558.5 and 565 nm in relative amplitude of 0.6 to 1 and with identical bandwidth (7.Andrews K.M. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the ascorbate-reduced state thec 1-heme is totally reduced, whereas theb H-heme appears partially reduced (Fig.5 A). The two transitions from the c 1-heme, at 549.3 and 551.6 nm in Fig. 4, appear as an unresolved band in absorption spectrum but as two distinct bands of opposite sign in LD spectrum. In the ascorbate-reduced sample (Fig. 5 A), the contribution of theb H-heme is centered at 557 nm in both the absorption and LD spectrum showing that this heme possesses a single transition in agreement with the redox-resolved spectra presented in the preceding paragraph. The exact correspondence between the absorption peak and the LD shows that the X and Ytransitions are circularly degenerate for theb H-heme. In addition to the two peaks due to thec 1-heme (Fig. 5 B), two peaks, at 555.8 and 561.2 nm in the LD spectrum and 556.2 and 561.2 nm in the absorption spectrum, are observed for the dithionite-reduced sample. The best fits for both the absorption and LD spectra are presented in Fig. 5 B. This deconvolution corresponds to spectral contributions at 549.3, 551.6, 556, 556.8, and 561.4 nm, with two distinct transitions for the b L-heme and theb H-heme at 556 nm in the dithionite-reduced complex, compared with 557 nm in the ascorbate-reduced complex. This blue shift is not surprising since several CD studies on the beef heart mitochondrial and Rb. sphaeroides Cytbc 1 complexes have shown that theb-hemes are in very strong electronic coupling yielding a rotation of the b H-heme plane with respect to the b L-heme plane upon reduction of theb L-heme (Ref. 35.Palmer G. Degli Esposti M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and references therein). This electronic coupling could induce not only a change in orientation but also a change in the energy of the X and Yelectronic transitions that could explain the shift in the wavelength position of the absorption band of theb H-heme. From the deconvolution of the spectra, the LD/Aratios for the transitions of hemes c 1 andb L or for the degenerate transitions of hemeb H can be calculated. As already stated, we can only calculate the relative orientation of the three hemes. If we consider a similar orientation for the b L-heme in the Rb. sphaeroides and in the mitochondrial complexes,i.e. 82°, the tilt angles with respect to the membrane plane of the b H- andc 1-hemes planes are found equal to 79 and 64°. The value determined for the b H-heme is, within experimental errors (±3.5°, see “Experimental Procedures”), equal to the one (i.e. 76°) determined from the crystallographic data of the mitochondrial complex. As for the case of beef heart mitochondria and Rs. rubrum complexes, the tilt angle determined for c 1-heme of Rb. sphaeroides is in the range of 60° with respect to the membrane plane and not 79° as calculated from the crystallographic structure. In the ascorbate-reduced complex we can determine the relative orientation of the b H- andc 1- hemes under conditions where theb L-heme is oxidized. If we consider a similar orientation for the b H-heme in the ascorbate-reduced complex and in the dithionite-reduced complex,i.e. 79°, the tilt angle of thec 1-heme is calculated at 61°. From both experiments performed on the Rb. sphaeroides complex, we therefore determined tilt angles of the b H- andc 1-heme at 79 and 62.5 ± 1.5°, with a reference value for the b L-heme at 82°. Owing to the 4-fold symmetry of the metalloporphyrin, the α-electronic transitions are predicted to be circularly degenerate in the heme plane (the X and Y axes being equivalent in absorption) (22.Hofrichter J.J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23.Gouterman M. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 3. Academic Press, New York1978: 1-165Google Scholar). However, the results presented here and those collected on the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) show that in several cases some imbalance along these two axes arising from asymmetric electrostatic effects of the binding protein removes this degeneracy and allows a distinction of the two optical transitions for some of the hemes. The surrounding polypeptide not only removes, in major cases, the 4-fold symmetry of the porphyrin but also has a determining influence in the wavelength position andLD/A ratio of the transitions determined for thec 1-, b H-, andb L-hemes in the three studied complexes. It signifies that the primary sequence of the binding protein has a determinant effect on the energy and orientation of the Xand Y transitions of the bound porphyrin. As indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” the quality of the measurements permits us to limit the strict instrumental errors. The “main” source of errors should arise from the fitting procedure. But as detailed previously (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) our fitting procedure imposed strong constraints resulting from the optical theory (for example, imposing that absorption and LD spectra are composed of same component, with identical bandwidth and wavelength position, allowing different amplitudes and signs) and from mathematical tolerance (for a global fit, maximum 3% of deviation with respect to the measurement). All these constraints permit us to assert our angle calculations with ± 3.5° theoretical confidence. In fact, in the case of the Cytc 1 of the mitochondrial and Rb. sphaeroides complex (two independent LD experiments) or all hemes of the Rs. rubrum complex (three independent LD experiments), the determined tilt angles are identical within ±2 (see “Results”). Since the deconvolution, between ascorbate- and dithionite- reduced state in the two first cases, is partly independent due to the contribution of the Cyt b L, this implies that the observed confidence is smaller than the theoretical confidence calculated. With the assumption that the X and Y transitions of theb-hemes are orthogonal and lie in the macrocycle, the orientations deduced for these hemes by our LD measurements are in very good agreement with the crystallographic structure obtained by Zhanget al. (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M. Chi Y.- I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and Iwata et al. (6.Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the deduced orientation for the c 1-heme is significantly different. This difference is common to the three complexes considered in the present study and to the Cytb 6 f complex (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In these four cases the tilt angle calculated for thec 1/f-heme is 49–64° with respect to the membrane plane compared with 79° deduced from the crystallographic data. Two main hypothesis could explain this discrepancy. (i) As already stated our orientation determinations are based on the hypothesis that the X and Y transitions are orthogonal and lie in the macrocycle considered to be planar. This hypothesis has been shown to be valid in the case of ferricytochromec (21.Eaton W.A. Hochstrasser R.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1967; 46: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but it cannot be excluded that the precise orientation of the transitions, which depends upon the distortion of the macrocycle induced by the polypeptide, could vary from one heme to another. In fact, the comparison of the LD values of both transitions of the mitochondrial c 1-heme to those of the f-heme of the Cytb 6 f complex (20.Schoepp B. Chabaud E. Breyton C. Verméglio A. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5275-5283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or to those of the c 1-heme of the Rb. sphaeroidesCyt bc 1 reveals that, depending on the considered complex, the sign of these LD values can vary and therefore the orientation of the transitions of the c-type heme with respect to the macrocycle can change. The distortion on the macrocycle can be much more important for c-type heme compared with b-type heme because of the covalent nature of the ligation of the first one. The influence of the assumption on the position of the X and Y transitions with respect to the macrocycle on the determined value of the tilt angle from thec 1-heme is great. Assuming that βX and βY are the tilts of the X and Ytransitions with respect to the orientation axis and φ the angle between them (supposing that the transitions lie in the macrocycle), the tilt τ of the normal of the heme plane with respect to the orientation axis can be calculate with Equation 5. The maximum of this function is given by the value of 105° for φ corresponding to a maximum value of 79° for τ, therefore solving the discrepancy between the crystal structure and the LD experiment. (ii) A second explanation would be that changes in the redox state of the c 1-heme induce movement of this heme leading to distinct orientations with respect to the membrane plane. One must remember that our LD study was performed in the reduced state, whereas the crystallographic structure published by Zhang et al. (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M. Chi Y.- I. Kim K.K.

Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) was obtained for the Cytbc 1 complex in the native state, i.e.in the oxidized state. A movement in function of the redox state has been demonstrated in the case of the Rieske protein by EPR studies (12.Brugna, M., Rodgers, S., Schricker, A., Montoya, G., Kazmeier, M., Nitschke, W., and Sinning, I. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Moreover, the relative orientation of b-hemes has been shown to be highly dependent of the presence of specific inhibitors in the Qi and/or Qo sites in the case of the chicken heart mitochondrial complex by Zhang et al. (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M. Chi Y.- I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In the native form, the tilt angles of b H-,b L-, and c 1- hemes with respect to the membrane plane are 73.4, 77.7, and 74.4°, respectively, and the values of 83.7, 76.3, and 73°, respectively, have been determined when stigmatellin and antimycin are bound to the complex (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M. Chi Y.- I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). These results therefore reveal that, depending on the redox state or the binding of inhibitors, the mitochondrial complex can present large changes in the orientation of the redox centers. Such a rotation of the b-heme planes has already been suggested by CD studies on the mitochondrial Cyt bc 1 complex (Ref. 35.Palmer G. Degli Esposti M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and references cited). This interpretation was based on the strong modification of b H-heme CD spectrum uponb L-heme reduction. We favor this second hypothesis. A definitive answer will require a detailed LD study of crystals of Cyt bc 1complexes and the examination of movement of thec 1-heme in function of the redox state. This would require the crystallographic analysis of the complex in the reduced state. Alternatively, the comparison of LD signals of oriented samples chemically reduced to oriented samples reduced at low temperature (and therefore in a frozen immobilized oxidized state) by γ-ray ionization as recently described (12.Brugna, M., Rodgers, S., Schricker, A., Montoya, G., Kazmeier, M., Nitschke, W., and Sinning, I. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar) can bring new insights on this proposal. These experiments are under progress. The b-hemes orientations determined for theRb. sphaeroides complex are in very good agreement with the crystallographic structure of the beef heart mitochondrial complex, but our LD study of the purified Cyt bc 1 complex from Rs. rubrum clearly shows a different orientation of the two b-hemes compared with those of the beef heart mitochondrial or Rb. sphaeroides complexes. The simplicity of the LD and absorption spectra obtained on the Rs. rubrumcomplex leaves no doubt on the deconvolution and therefore on this conclusion. There are several reasons that can explain the difference in orientation between Rs. rubrum and mitochondrial orRb. sphaeroides complexes. (i) An explanation could be that the X and Y transitions are differently oriented compared with the mitochondrial and Rb. sphaeroidescomplexes. Our orientation calculations are indeed based on the assumption that the X and Y transitions lie in the heme plane and that the cross-product of these transitions represents the normal to the heme plane. If this would not the case, the plane from which we calculated the orientation does not represent the heme plane. In agreement with this proposal, our recent resonance Raman study of the Cyt bc 1 complex fromRs. rubrum suggests that the b Lmacrocycle was much more distorted compared with theb H macrocycle (36.Le Moigne C. Schoepp B. Othman S. Verméglio A. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 1998; 38: 1066-1076Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure reveals that it is the opposite case in the beef heart mitochondria. The precise position of the X and Ytransitions with respect to the macrocycle could therefore explain our results. (ii) The subunit composition of this bacterial complex is significantly different from the beef heart mitochondrial counterpart. The enzyme of Rs. rubrum is the simplest complex with only three subunits (9.Kriauciunas A., Yu, L., Yu, C.-A. Wynn R.M. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fact that the X and Ytransitions are degenerate for the three hemes in the Rs. rubrum complex contrary to what is observed for the mitochondrial and Rb. sphaeroides complexes shows the peculiarity of this bacterial complex. From comparison with the orientation of the hemes determined in the Rb. sphaeroides complex, we can conclude that the orientation determined in the Rs. rubrum complex is not a common feature of bacterial systems. As discussed in the preceding paragraph, calculations on the structure proposed by Zhanget al. (5.Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisterr V.M. Chi Y.- I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) reveal that, in the mitochondrial complex, theb H-heme can be more tilted with respect to the membrane than the b L-heme. This observation therefore argues for the reality of the possible different orientation determined for the Rs. rubrum complex, due to some specific biochemical character or to a special state of the system. For example it could be explained by the uncontrolled presence or absence of quinol that could induce a similar effect as is observed for the chicken complex with inhibitors.
