https://openalex.org/W2047852384,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) has essential roles in adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis, and is a molecular target of insulin-sensitizing drugs. Although the ability of PPAR-gamma agonists to antagonize inflammatory responses by transrepression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) target genes is linked to antidiabetic and antiatherogenic actions, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the identification of a molecular pathway by which PPAR-gamma represses the transcriptional activation of inflammatory response genes in mouse macrophages. The initial step of this pathway involves ligand-dependent SUMOylation of the PPAR-gamma ligand-binding domain, which targets PPAR-gamma to nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)-histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) complexes on inflammatory gene promoters. This in turn prevents recruitment of the ubiquitylation/19S proteosome machinery that normally mediates the signal-dependent removal of corepressor complexes required for gene activation. As a result, NCoR complexes are not cleared from the promoter and target genes are maintained in a repressed state. This mechanism provides an explanation for how an agonist-bound nuclear receptor can be converted from an activator of transcription to a promoter-specific repressor of NF-kappaB target genes that regulate immunity and homeostasis."

Using event-related fMRI, we examined whether anticipatory neural activity would predict optimal and suboptimal choices in a financial decision-making task. We characterized two types of deviations from the optimal investment strategy of a rational risk-neutral agent as risk-seeking mistakes and risk-aversion mistakes. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded risky choices as well as risk-seeking mistakes, while anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices as well as risk-aversion mistakes. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipatory affect promote different types of financial choices and indicate that excessive activation of these circuits may lead to investing mistakes. Thus, consideration of anticipatory neural mechanisms may add predictive power to the rational actor model of economic decision making."
https://openalex.org/W1998279268,"The signals that determine whether axons are ensheathed or myelinated by Schwann cells have long been elusive. We now report that threshold levels of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III on axons determine their ensheathment fate. Ensheathed axons express low levels whereas myelinated fibers express high levels of NRG1 type III. Sensory neurons from NRG1 type III deficient mice are poorly ensheathed and fail to myelinate; lentiviral-mediated expression of NRG1 type III rescues these defects. Expression also converts the normally unmyelinated axons of sympathetic neurons to myelination. Nerve fibers of mice haploinsufficient for NRG1 type III are disproportionately unmyelinated, aberrantly ensheathed, and hypomyelinated, with reduced conduction velocities. Type III is the sole NRG1 isoform retained at the axon surface and activates PI 3-kinase, which is required for Schwann cell myelination. These results indicate that levels of NRG1 type III, independent of axon diameter, provide a key instructive signal that determines the ensheathment fate of axons."
https://openalex.org/W2031898618,"In response to activity deprivation, CNS neurons undergo slow adaptive modification of unitary synaptic transmission. The changes are comparable in degree to those induced by brief intense stimulation, but their molecular basis is largely unknown. Our data indicate that prolonged AMPAR blockade acts through loss of Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels to bring about an increase in both vesicle pool size and turnover rate, as well as a postsynaptic enhancement of the contribution of GluR1 homomers, concentrated at the largest synapses. The changes were consistent with a morphological scaling of overall synapse size, but also featured a dramatic shift toward synaptic drive contributed by the Ca2+-permeable homomeric GluR1 receptors. These results extend beyond ""synaptic homeostasis"" to involve more profound changes that can be better described as ""metaplasticity""."
https://openalex.org/W2138136052,"Modification of AMPA receptor function is a major mechanism for the regulation of synaptic transmission and underlies several forms of synaptic plasticity. Post-translational palmitoylation is a reversible modification that regulates localization of many proteins. Here, we report that palmitoylation of the AMPA receptor regulates receptor trafficking. All AMPA receptor subunits are palmitoylated on two cysteine residues in their transmembrane domain (TMD) 2 and in their C-terminal region. Palmitoylation on TMD 2 is upregulated by the palmitoyl acyl transferase GODZ and leads to an accumulation of the receptor in the Golgi and a reduction of receptor surface expression. C-terminal palmitoylation decreases interaction of the AMPA receptor with the 4.1N protein and regulates AMPA- and NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization. Moreover, depalmitoylation of the receptor is regulated by activation of glutamate receptors. These data suggest that regulated palmitoylation of AMPA receptor subunits modulates receptor trafficking and may be important for synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2096725231,"Declarative memory permits an organism to recognize stimuli that have been previously encountered, discriminating them from those that are novel. One basis for recognition is item memory strength, which may support the perception of stimulus familiarity. Though the medial temporal lobes are known to be critical for declarative memory, at present the neural mechanisms supporting perceived differences in memory strength remain poorly specified. Here, functional MRI (fMRI) and anatomically constrained magnetoencephalography (MEG) indexed correlates of graded memory strength in the human brain, focusing on medial temporal cortex. fMRI revealed a decrease in medial temporal cortical activation that tracked parametric levels of perceived memory strength. Anatomically constrained MEG current estimates revealed that strength-dependent signal reductions onset within 150-300 ms. Memory strength appears to be rapidly signaled by medial temporal cortex through repetition suppression (activation reductions), providing a basis for the subjective perception of stimulus familiarity or novelty."
https://openalex.org/W2113780363,"We investigated a possible beneficial role for bilirubin, one of the products of heme degradation by the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 in counteracting Escherichia coli endotoxin-mediated toxicity. Homozygous jaundice Gunn rats, which display high plasma bilirubin levels due to deficiency of glucuronyl transferase activity, and Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to sustained exogenous bilirubin administration were more resistant to endotoxin (LPS)-induced hypotension and death compared with nonhyperbilirubinemic rats. LPS-stimulated production of nitric oxide (NO) was significantly decreased in hyperbilirubinemic rats compared with normal animals; this effect was associated with reduction of inducible NO synthase (NOS2) expression in renal, myocardial, and aortic tissues. Furthermore, NOS2 protein expression and activity were reduced in murine macrophages stimulated with LPS and preincubated with bilirubin at concentrations similar to that found in the serum of hyperbilirubinemic animals. This effect was secondary to inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase since 1) inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase attenuated NOS2 induction by LPS, 2) bilirubin decreased NAD(P)H oxidase activity in vivo and in vitro, and 3) down-regulation of NOS2 by bilirubin was reversed by addition of NAD(P)H. These findings indicate that bilirubin can act as an effective agent to reduce mortality and counteract hypotension elicited by endotoxin through mechanisms involving a decreased NOS2 induction secondary to inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2066583605,"Dopamine signaling is mediated by five cloned receptors, grouped into D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3 and D4) families. We identified by reverse transcription-PCR the presence of dopamine receptors from both families in INS-1E insulin-secreting cells as well as in rodent and human isolated islets. D2 receptor expression was confirmed by immunodetection revealing localization on insulin secretory granules of INS-1E and primary rodent and human beta cells. We then tested potential effects mediated by the identified receptors on beta cell function. Dopamine (10 μm) and the D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole (5 μm) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion tested in several models, i.e. INS-1E beta cells, fluorescence-activated cell-sorted primary rat beta cells, and pancreatic islets of rat, mouse, and human origin. Insulin exocytosis is controlled by metabolism coupled to cytosolic calcium changes. Measurements of glucose-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization and ATP generation showed that dopamine and D2-like agonists did not inhibit glucose metabolism. On the other hand, dopamine decreased cell membrane depolarization as well as cytosolic calcium increases evoked by glucose stimulation in INS-1E beta cells. These results show for the first time that dopamine receptors are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. Dopamine inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, an effect that could be ascribed to D2-like receptors. Regarding the molecular mechanisms implicated in dopamine-mediated inhibition of insulin release, our results point to distal steps in metabolism-secretion coupling. Thus, the role played by dopamine in glucose homeostasis might involve dopamine receptors, expressed in pancreatic beta cells, modulating insulin release.

Thus, the role played by dopamine in glucose homeostasis might involve dopamine receptors, expressed in pancreatic beta cells, modulating insulin release. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a critical role in neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, and drug addiction (1Callier S. Snapyan M. Le Crom S. Prou D. Vincent J.D. Vernier P. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence also shows implication of dopamine in various physiological functions such as cell proliferation (2Hoglinger G.U. Rizk P. Muriel M.P. Duyckaerts C. Oertel W.H. Caille I. Hirsch E.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), gastrointestinal protection (3Mezey E. Eisenhofer G. Harta G. Hansson S. Gould L. Hunyady B. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10377-10382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and inhibition of prolactin secretion (4Freeman M.E. Kanyicska B. Lerant A. Nagy G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1523-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Effects of dopamine on insulin secretion in general and on pancreatic beta cell function in particular have been poorly studied. Insulin exocytosis from the beta cell is primarily controlled by metabolism-secretion coupling. First, glucose equilibrates across the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated by glucokinase, initiating glycolysis (5Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mitochondrial metabolism generates ATP, which promotes the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and, as a consequence, depolarization of the plasma membrane (6Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This leads to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels and a rise in cytosolic calcium, triggering insulin exocytosis (6Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 7Lang J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Additional signals participating in the amplifying pathway (8Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) are necessary to reproduce the sustained secretion elicited by glucose. Insulin secretion evoked by glucose metabolism can be further modulated by parasympathetic and sympathetic neurotransmitters (9Ahren B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Treatment with dopamine precursor l-dopa in humans suffering from Parkinson disease reduces insulin secretion upon oral glucose tolerance test (10Rosati G. Maioli M. Aiello I. Farris A. Agnetti V. Eur. Neurol. 1976; 14: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In rodents, a single injection with l-dopa results in the accumulation of dopamine in beta cells and inhibition of the insulin secretory responses (11Ericson L.E. Hakanson R. Lundquist I. Diabetologia. 1977; 13: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Zern R.T. Bird J.L. Feldman J.M. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In isolated islets, analogues of dopamine inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release (13Arneric S.P. Chow S.A. Long J.P. Fischer L.J. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas one study reports potentiation of insulin secretion upon acute dopamine accumulation (14Ahren B. Lundquist I. Pharmacology. 1985; 30: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, these previous studies suggest that beta cells might be directly responsive to dopamine. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms implicated in beta cell responses to dopamine action. In particular, the present data demonstrate the presence of dopamine receptors in beta cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of dopamine are predominantly ascribed to activation of the D2-like receptor family members. INS-1E Cells and Pancreatic Islets—INS-1E cells, used as a well differentiated beta cell clone (15Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in a medium composed of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. For rodent islets, Wistar rats or BALB/c mice weighing 200–250 g and 25–30 g, respectively, were obtained from in-house breeding (CMU-Zootechnie, Geneva, Switzerland). We followed the principles of laboratory animal care, and the study was approved by the responsible ethics committee. Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and handpicking from male Wistar rats or BALB/c mice as described previously (16Carobbio S. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1856-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were cultured free-floating in RPMI 1640 medium before experiments. For human islets, pancreata were harvested from braindead donors and islets isolated after enzymatic ductal perfusion and cultured in non-adherent dishes.

Reverse transcription (see TABLES ONE and TWO for the list of oligonucleotides) was performed using 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen). The PCR program for cDNA was as follows; initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at specific temperatures for 30 s, and elongation for 30–45 s at 72 °C. A final elongation step of 7 min at 72 °C allowed extension of truncated product to full-length. PCR reactions were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) with 1 μm concentrations of each primer. Control experiments demonstrated that amplification products were absent after reactions in the absence of reverse transcriptase.TABLE ONEOligonucleotides used for expression analysis by RT-PCR in INS1-E cells and rat islets1048ratD1.for5′-GCCTTTGACATCATGTGCTC-3′1644ratD1.rev5′-CAGAAAGGAACCATACAGTTC-3′1029ratD2.for5′-GCAGTCGAGCTTTCAGAGCC-3′1432ratD2.rev5′-TCTGCGGCTCATCGTCTTAAG-3′823ratD3.for5′-CATCCCATTCGGCAGTTTTCA-3′1023ratD3.rev5′-TGGGTGTCTCAAGGCAGTGTCT-3′341ratD4.for5′-CTGCAGACACCCACCAACTA-3′561ratD4.rev5′-CACTGACCCTGCTGGTTGTA-3′782ratD5.for5′-AGCATGCTCAGAGTTGCCGG-3′990ratD5.rev5′-ACAAGGGAAGCCAGTCTTTGG-3′806ratDDC.for5′-GGAACCACATCTTGCTGCTC-3′1051ratDDC.rev5′-GGCTTCGGTTAGGTCAGTTC-3′704ratGAPDH.for5′-AGAACATCATCCCTGCATCC-3′1070ratGAPDH.rev5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOOligonucleotides used for expression analysis by RT-PCR in human islets1414hD1.for5′-CAGTCCACGCCAAGAATTGCC-3′1868hD1.rev5′-ATTGCACTCCTTGGAGATGGAGCC-3′360hD2.for5′-GCAGACCACCACCAACTACC-3′609hD2.rev5′-GGAGCTGTAGCGCGTATTGT-3′2181hD2.for5′-AGGGTCTATGGGGAGAGGAA-3′2419hD2.rev5′-AGAGAGGAAAGGCCAGAAGG-3′1047hD3a.for5′-GCGTTACTACAGCATCTGCCAGGAC-3′1484hD3a.rev5′-AGACAGGATCTTGAGGAAGG-3′963hD4.for5′-CCCACCCCAGACTCCACC-3′1221hD4.rev5′-GAACTCGGCGTTGAAGACAG-3′349hD5.for5′-GTCGCCGAGGTGGCCGGTTAC-3′711hD5.rev5′-GCTGGAGTCACAGTTCTCTGCAT-3′1615hDDC.for5′-CTGTGGCTTCCCATGTCTTT-3′1858hDDC.rev5′-GTTGCGTGAACATTGATTGC-3′58hGAPDH.for5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′303hGAPDH.rev5′-TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG-3′ Open table in a new tab Immunostaining—INS-1E cells were grown on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips for 3 days. For immunofluorescence on rat, mouse, and human islets, islets were isolated and cultured for 24–48 h. The islet cells were then dispersed by trypsinization and plated onto polyornithine-treated glass coverslips (17Rubi B. del Arco A. Bartley C. Satrustegui J. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55659-55666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Monolayers of INS-1E or islet cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 30 min in a 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies, either rabbit anti-dopamine receptor antibody D2 recognizing the third intracellular loop of both short and long isoforms (18Boundy V.A. Luedtke R.R. Artymyshyn R.P. Filtz T.M. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar) D2L and D2S (1:150, AB5084P, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or mouse monoclonal anti-human insulin (1:600, I-2018, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were exposed to the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate and goat antimouse rhodamine, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Dako, and samples were analyzed using a Zeiss laser confocal microscope (60×, LSM 510, Zurich, Switzerland). Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—INS-1E beta cells were cultured for 4–5 days before cell fractionation. Cells were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline on ice, scraped in 0.32 m sucrose (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and homogenized in a Teflon-glass potter. The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 800 g to pull down nuclei, and supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g, thereby giving the cytosolic fraction in the supernatant. The corresponding pellet was washed by a second run of suspension and centrifugation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.32 m sucrose before incorporation onto a continuous sucrose gradient made of 5 ml of 1 m sucrose and 5 ml of 2.2 m sucrose at pH 7.5 (10 mm Tris-HCl) before centrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The visible cell membrane fraction was collected in the supernatant, and the pellet, corresponding to the granule fraction, was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen. After the Bradford assay for measurements of protein concentrations, fractions (2 μg of proteins per lane) were subjected to SDS/PAGE (10%) before transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) gelatin protein (Top-Block, Juro, Switzerland). The membranes were washed five times in Trisbuffered saline/Tween at room temperature. Membranes were probed with the rabbit anti-dopamine receptor antibody D2 (L/S) (1:300, AB5084P, Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C before incubation for 2 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). The signal was detected by chemiluminescence. As controls, rat brain homogenates were used for detection of D2 receptors, and GLUT2 antibody served in parallel immunoblotting for assessment of cell membrane fraction. Insulin Secretion—INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates (15Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) were washed twice and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) of the following composition: 135 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Next, cells were washed once with glucose-free KRBH and then incubated for 30 min in KRBH and test compounds as indicated. At the end of the incubation, supernatants were collected for measurement of insulin release and cellular insulin contents using rat insulin radioimmunoassay (15Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Handpicked islets (10 per tube) were incubated over a period of 60 min in KRBH containing secretagogues as indicated, and insulin release was measured by radioimmunoassay (17Rubi B. del Arco A. Bartley C. Satrustegui J. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55659-55666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and ATP Levels—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured in INS-1E cells preincubated with 10 μg/ml rhodamine-123 for 20 min at 37 °C in KRBH. Mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored at 37 °C in a plate-reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) with excitation and emission filters set at 485 and 520 nm, respectively. ATP levels were monitored in INS-1E cells expressing the ATP-sensitive bioluminescent probe luciferase after infection with the specific viral constructs (19Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transduced with AdCA-cLuc, (driving the expression of cytosolic luciferase) and used 20 h later for experiments. Cells were washed with 1 ml of KRBH and incubated for 30 min at 37°C at 2.5 mm Glc. Then, KRBH containing 100 μm luciferin was added, and the luminescence was monitored in the plate-reader luminometer (Fluostar Optima) (15Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Calcium Concentration Measurements—Cytosolic calcium changes were monitored in INS-1E cells preincubated for 90 min with 2 μm Fura-2AM (Teflab, Austin, TX) in KRBH at 37 °C and then washed before the experiment. Ratiometric measurements of Fura-2 fluorescence were performed in a plate-reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima) with filters set at 510 nm for excitation and 340/380 nm for emission. For mitochondrial calcium measurements, INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates for 3–4 days were transduced with AdCA-mAeq adenovirus, enabling expression of the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin targeted to the mitochondria. Twenty hours after viral treatment cells were loaded with the aequorin prosthetic group coelenterazine (2.5 μm) in KRBH for 1 h, and the luminescence was monitored in the plate reader luminometer (15Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Cell Membrane Potential and cAMP Levels—Cell membrane potential was monitored using 100 nm concentrations of the fluorescent probe bis-oxonol (bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol) in a thermostatted (37 °C) plate reader fluorimeter. Filters used for excitation and emission had wavelength optima at 544 and 590 nm, respectively (15Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For cAMP measurements, INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were exposed to 2.5 or 15 mm glucose for 30 min in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm) and tested compounds as indicated. At the end of incubation cells were lysed following the manufacturer's instructions, and cAMP quantification was determined by a commercially available enzyme immunoassay from Amersham Biosciences. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. as indicated. Differences between groups were assessed by Student's t test, and a p < 0.05 was considered as reflecting significant variance. Expression Analysis of Dopamine Receptors in INS1-E Beta Cells and Rat Islets—RT-PCR revealed the presence of dopamine receptors and dopamine decarboxylase in INS-1E cells and rat islets (Fig. 1). Specifically, clonal INS-1E beta cells expressed D1, D2 short and long isoforms, and D3 and D5 dopamine receptors, whereas rat islets expressed all known dopamine receptors: D1, D2 short and long isoforms, D3, D4, and D5. Amplification of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) was performed to guarantee integrity of the cDNAs used. PCR reactions in which reverse transcriptase was omitted, as well as PCR reactions without cDNAs, were run as negative controls and gave no amplification product. The oligonucleotides used are listed in TABLE ONE. The sizes (bp) of the amplification products were as expected. Moreover, the specific fragments were cut from the gel and sequenced, confirming the identity of the amplification products. Immunodetection of Dopamine Receptor D2 in INS-1E Cells and Rodent Islets—We next assessed the presence of D2 receptors at the protein level in beta cells as well as its subcellular localization. INS-1E cells were immunostained with anti-D2 receptor antibody and visualized by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Double labeling experiments showed that dopamine receptor 2 colocalized with insulin-containing secretory granules without significant labeling on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A–C). Cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting using INS-1E cells was performed to further question this unexpected localization of the dopamine receptor 2. As shown in Fig. 2D, neither the cytoplasmic nor the plasma membrane fractions contained detectable levels of dopamine receptor 2. On the contrary, a band of ∼64 kDa was observed on the granule fraction, corresponding to the upper band of the doublet exhibited by the rat brain extract used here as positive control. Therefore, only the D2 long isoform of the receptor was detected by immunoblotting in INS-1E beta cells. Nonetheless, according to relatively low amounts of proteins loaded on gels, the presence of other isoforms expressed at lower levels cannot be excluded. Quality of the plasma membrane fraction was assessed in parallel immunoblotting by GLUT2 detection (not shown). Double labeling experiments performed on islets of mouse and rat origin confirmed the colocalization of dopamine receptor 2 with insulin-containing secretory granules in primary beta cells (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Immunostaining of D2 receptor in rat and mouse islets.

Results are the means of three experiments performed in quadruplicate. Secretory responses in INS-1E cells stimulated with 15 mm glucose were 3.6-fold versus basal release (p < 0.05). As shown on Fig. 4A, dopamine dose-dependently inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at 1 μm (-33%), 10 μm (-56%, p < 0.05), and 100 μm (-76%, p < 0.05). Dopamine treatment over the 30-min period tested did not change cellular insulin contents (not shown). Effect of D2/D3 and D1/D5 Agonists on Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—We next tested if the effect of dopamine on insulin secretion could be mimicked by selected activation of D2 and D5 receptors expressed in the cells. To this end, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion experiments in INS1-E cells were performed in the absence or the presence of D2/D3 agonist quinpirole (21Lacey M.G. Mercuri N.B. North R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 392: 397-416Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and D1/D5 agonist SKF38393 (22Memo M. Lovenberg W. Hanbauer I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4456-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Incubation at 15 mm glucose stimulated insulin secretion in control cells 5.4-fold (p < 0.01). Fig. 4B shows that quinpirole (5 μm) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 43% (p < 0.05). D1/D5 agonist SKF38393 (10 μm) also inhibited the secretory response to glucose, although to a lesser extent (-26%, p < 0.01, Fig. 4C). The inhibitory effect of dopamine on insulin secretion was not affected when blocking GABA-A receptors and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors by 10 μm AP-5 and 10 μm bicuculline (data not shown). Effects of Dopamine and Quinpirole in Rodent Beta Cells—The following experiments compared the effects of dopamine and quinpirole on insulin secretion in pancreatic islets versus fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified beta cells isolated from rats. Stimulation of isolated rat islets with 16.7 mm glucose for 30 min increased insulin secretion 4.5-fold (p < 0.0001) versus basal release at 2.8 mm glucose (Fig. 5A). Dopamine (10 μm) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 59% (p < 0.001) at stimulatory glucose concentrations. D2/D3 agonist quinpirole (10 μm) also inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (-50%, p < 0.05, Fig. 5B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified beta cells were responsive to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (6.3-fold versus basal glucose, p < 0.05), and secretory responses were inhibited by the addition of 10 μm quinpirole (-41%, p < 0.05, Fig. 5C). The effects of dopamine and quinpirole were also tested in isolated mouse islets (Fig. 5D). Glucose (22.8 mm) stimulated insulin secretion in control islets (4.2-fold versus basal release, p < 0.01). The secretory responses to stimulatory glucose concentration were inhibited by dopamine (at 10 μm, -73%, p < 0.01) and quinpirole (at 5 μm, -58%, p < 0.05). Effects of Dopamine and Quinpirole on Mitochondrial Activation— Because mitochondrial activation is mandatory for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we tested the effects of dopamine on mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization induced by 15 mm glucose in INS-1E beta cells. Dopamine (10 μm) exhibited no effects on glucose-induced hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 6A). Respiratory chain activation was not affected by quinpirole (up to 25 μm) as shown in Fig. 6B. Therefore, dopamine and quinpirole, in conditions inhibiting insulin secretion, do not affect glucose-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Cellular ATP levels were monitored in cells expressing cytosolic luciferase. Glucose (15 mm) increased cytosolic ATP in INS-1E cells as expected (Fig. 6C). Dopamine and quinpirole did not inhibit glucose-induced ATP generation. On the contrary, dopamine (10 μm) increased ATP levels at 15 mm glucose (p < 0.05, Fig. 6C), and quinpirole (5 μm) exhibited similar effects (p < 0.05, Fig. 6D). Effects of Dopamine on Cell Membrane Potential, Ca2+ Levels, and cAMP Generation in INS-1E Cells—As expected, raising glucose from 2.5 to 15 mm induced cell membrane depolarization, as revealed by bisoxonol fluorescence recordings (Fig. 7A). The means of 4 independent experiments indicated inhibition of glucose-induced cell membrane depolarization in the presence of 10 μm dopamine. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations is the consequence of cell membrane depolarization and is required for the secretory response to glucose. Cytosolic Ca2+ changes evoked by 15 mm glucose were monitored in INS-1E cells loaded with Fura2-AM. As shown in Fig. 7B, glucose-induced cytosolic Ca2+ augmentations were reduced in the presence of 10 μm dopamine. Glucose-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ augmentations were monitored in INS-1E cells expressing the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin targeted to the mitochondria. Upon 15 mm glucose stimulation, cells exhibited a biphasic increase in mitochondrial Ca2+. First-phase glucose-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ rise, reflecting changes in cytosolic Ca2+, was reduced by 10 μm dopamine (Fig. 7C). Because cAMP renders beta cells more responsive to glucose (9Ahren B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), we also tested such a possible dopamine target by quantifying cAMP in INS-1E cells. As expected, upon a 30-min incubation period in the presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, cAMP levels were similar at 2.5 and 15 mm glucose (27.9 ± 1.0 versus 30.3 ± 3.4 fmol/μg protein, respectively; n = 4 in one of three independent experiments). At 15 mm glucose, glucagon-like peptide-1 (10 nm), used as a positive control, raised cAMP levels 7.3-fold (221.5 ± 47.8 fmol/μg of protein, p < 0.001 versus control at 15 mm glucose). Neither dopamine (10 μm) nor D2 agonist quinpirole (5 μm) reduced cAMP levels (45.2 ± 8.5 and 48.7 ± 7.3 fmol/μg of protein, respectively), arguing against cAMP-mediated inhibition by dopamine in beta cells. Dopamine Receptors in Human Beta Cells—Immunostaining studies revealed the presence of D2 receptors in human beta cells. Dopamine receptor 2 co-localized with insulin (Fig. 8A), in good agreement with observations in rodent beta cells (Fig. 3), showing that dopamine receptor 2 is present on insulin granules. RT-PCR analyses revealed the presence of D1, D2, D4, and D5 receptors as well as dopamine decarboxylase in human islets (Fig. 8B). Amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed to guarantee integrity of the cDNAs used. PCR reactions without reverse transcriptase or without cDNAs were run as negative controls. The amplification products were found at the expected size, according to the oligonucleotides used (TABLE TWO). Insulin secretion was stimulated 3.1-fold (p < 0.05) in isolated human islets exposed to 16.7 mm glucose versus basal 2.8 mm glucose. The D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (5 μm) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 46% (p < 0.05, n = 5). This study provides the basis of molecular mechanisms mediating dopamine inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. Dopamine receptors were present in INS-1E beta cells as well as rat, mouse, and human islets. Dopamine inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, an effect reproduced by activation of D2-like receptors using the dopamine 2/3 receptor ago"
https://openalex.org/W2045969244,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) plays a pivotal role in oxidative stress-induced cell death. Reactive oxygen species disrupt the interaction of ASK1 with its cellular inhibitor thioredoxin and thereby activates ASK1. However, the precise mechanism by which ASK1 freed from thioredoxin undergoes oligomerization-dependent activation has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that endogenous ASK1 constitutively forms a high molecular mass complex including Trx (∼1,500-2,000 kDa), which we designate ASK1 signalosome. Upon H2O2 treatment, the ASK1 signalosome forms a higher molecular mass complex at least in part because of the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6. Consistent with our previous findings that TRAF2 and TRAF6 activate ASK1, H2O2-induced ASK1 activation and cell death were strongly reduced in the cells derived from Traf2-/- and Traf6-/- mice. A novel signaling complex including TRAF2, TRAF6, and ASK1 may thus be the key component in oxidative stress-induced cell death.

Among various stimuli tested, oxidative stress is one of the most potent activators of ASK1 (3Matsukawa J. Matsuzawa A. Takeda K. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin (Trx), a reduction/oxidation (redox) regulatory protein, inhibits the kinase activity of ASK1 by its direct binding to the N-terminal noncatalytic region of ASK1 (6Saitoh M. Nishitoh H.

Following the dissociation of Trx, autophosphorylation-dependent activation of ASK1 occurs most likely through mechanisms involving homo-oligomerization (10Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

Upon H2O2 treatment, ASK1 was dissociated from Trx but reciprocally associated with TRAF2 and TRAF6. The recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF6 but not TRAF5 to ASK1 signaling complex was required for H2O2-induced activation of ASK1 and cell death. These results propose a novel signaling mechanism involving TRAF family proteins and ASK1 in oxidative stress-induced cell death. Cell Culture and Plasmids—HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 100 units/ml penicillin G in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. HA-tagged wild-type ASK1 (ASK1WT-HA) and HA-tagged C-terminal coiled-coil domain deletion mutant of ASK1 (ASK1Δcoil-HA) have been described previously (11Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Reagents and Antibodies—Transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human recombinant TNFα was obtained from WAKO. The antibody to HA (clone 3F10) was from Roche Applied Science. Phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-ASK1, anti-Trx, anti-TRAF2, anti-TRAF5, and anti-TRAF6 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against phospho-ASK1 (Thr838) was described previously (11Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To generate anti-TRAF6 antibody, the synthetic peptide RKEGFQPRSTD was used as immunogen, and the antisera obtained from immunized rabbit was affinity-purified by the synthetic peptide (36Matsuzawa A.

Preparation of S-100 Fraction—To purify the ASK1 complex, HEK293 cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm H2O2 or 100 ng/ml TNFα. The cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed by using a glass Dounce homogenizer in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) plus 0.1% Chaps and 0.01% Brij35, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S-100) was flash-frozen and stored at -135 °C. Gel Filtration Chromatography—S-100 fraction from HEK293 cells was loaded onto a Superose6 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.1% Chaps and 0.01% Brij35. The proteins were eluted at 0.3 ml/min. Each fraction (0.5 ml/fraction) was precipitated using acetone/ethanol (1:4). Samples from one or four column runs were pooled and analyzed by Western blotting for the indicated antibodies. Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in buffer A plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—The cells were lysed in buffer A plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. The beads were washed four times with the same buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Splenocyte-derived Macrophage—Because the number of bone marrow cells was reduced significantly in Traf6-/- mice because of severe osteopetrosis, macrophages were generated from splenocytes of Traf6+/- and Traf6-/- mice (30Gohda J. Matsumura T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). After 6 days of culture with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), almost equal numbers of adherent cells, which displayed typical macrophage morphology, were obtained from both Traf6+/- and Traf6-/- splenocytes. More than 95% of the adherent cells from both Traf6+/- and Traf6-/- mice expressed CD11b and F4/80 (data not shown), indicating that TRAF6 deficiency does not affect macrophage differentiation. Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion Assay—For the trypan blue dye exclusion assay, cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were plated in 12-well plates. Twenty-four h after the plating, the cells were treated with 0.1 mm H2O2 for 10 h. The cells were then directly stained with 0.4% trypan blue dye or harvested with trypsin followed by staining with 0.4% trypan blue dye. The trypan blue-positive cells were counted by using a hemocytometer under phase contrast microscopy. ASK1 Forms a High Molecular Mass Signaling Complex in the Cell—We previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the activation loop of ASK1 kinase domain (Thr838 and Thr845 of human and mouse ASK1, respectively) is required for activation of ASK1 in response to various stresses (11Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We also showed that the activation state of ASK1 can be monitored by the phospho-ASK1 antibody that detects activating phosphorylation of this threonine residue (11Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis using the phospho-ASK1 antibody revealed that basal activity of a mutant form of ASK1 that lacked C-terminal coiled-coil domain (ASK1Δcoil) was much lower than that of wild-type ASK1 (ASK1WT) when each construct was expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Overexpression of ASK1Δcoil was not able to induce the activation of JNK and p38 nor to inhibit the activity of co-transfected ASK1WT (data not shown). These results confirm our previous finding that homo-oligomerization through the C-terminal coiled-coil domain is required for the activation of ASK1 (11Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); however, regulatory mechanisms of ASK1 oligomer have been largely unknown. To investigate how homo-oligomerization of ASK1 is involved in its activation, we first examined the potential complex formation of ASK1 in the cells using a gel filtration column chromatography by an approach similar to that used to characterize the apoptosome (37Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The expected molecular mass of monomeric ASK1 is ∼160 kDa. When HA-tagged ASK1WT was expressed in HEK293 cells, we found that ASK1WT formed a high molecular mass (HMM) complex in fractions 1-8 (>1,500 kDa; Fig. 1C, top panel, lanes 1-8) with relatively high basal activity detected by the phospho-ASK1 antibody (Fig. 1C, second panel). A kinase-negative mutant of ASK1 (ASK1K709R) also formed an HMM complex (data not shown), suggesting that the kinase activity of ASK1 is not a prerequisite for the HMM complex formation. On the other hand, ASK1Δcoil formed a smaller complex (∼500 kDa; but still larger than monomeric ASK1) with no detectable activity (Fig. 1C, bottom two panels, lanes 11-15). It is noteworthy that a minor part of transfected ASK1Δcoil also formed an HMM complex with certain kinase activity (Fig. 1C, bottom two panels, lanes 5-7). These results suggest that oligomerization-dependent formation of the HMM complex is required for the kinase activity of ASK1. ROS Induce a Higher Molecular Mass Complex Formation of ASK1—We next examined the states of endogenous ASK1 by gel filtration analysis. Fractionation of the extracts from HEK293 cells through a gel filtration column revealed that although confined to fractions 5-8 (∼1,500-2,000 kDa), endogenous ASK1 formed a similar HMM complex as was formed by exogenously expressed ASK1WT (Fig. 2A, top panel). A similar pattern of HMM complex was detected in all of the cultured cells we tested, e.g. HeLa cells, HT1080 cells, and MEFs (data not shown), suggesting that the HMM complex formation is a general feature of endogenous ASK1. Under unstimulated conditions, the kinase activity of ASK1 is negatively regulated by its association with Trx (6Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). To examine whether Trx is a component of the unstimulated HMM complex, ASK1-containing fractions (corresponding to lanes 5-8 in Fig. 2A, top panel) were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ASK1 antibody. Trx was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with ASK1 (Fig. 2B), indicating that endogenous ASK1 forms a static HMM complex containing Trx, which may function as a signalosome competent to ROS-dependent activation of ASK1. When cells were treated with H2O2, the ASK1 signalosome was eluted in higher molecular mass fractions, i.e. fractions 1-4 (>3,000 kDa; Fig. 2A, second and third panels). This elution profile was similar to that of exogenously expressed ASK1WT (Fig. 1C), suggesting that a certain population of exogenous ASK1 comprises an activated complex without any stimuli. The shift of the ASK1-containing fractions was inhibited by the pretreatment of cells with anti-oxidants such as propyl gallate (Fig. 2A, bottom panel) and N-acetyl cysteine (data not shown). The changes in the elution pattern of the ASK1 complex correlated well with the activation states of ASK1 and its downstream targets, JNK and p38 (Fig. 2C), as monitored by immunoblotting analysis using the aliquots of each cell extract prepared for the gel filtration. These results suggest that recruitment of additional component(s) to the HMM signaling complex of ASK1 may be involved in H2O2-induced activation of ASK1. To examine the binding states between Trx and ASK1 after ROS exposure, nontransfected HEK293 cells lysate was subjected to the coimmunoprecipitation analysis. As previously demonstrated in ASK1-transfected HEK293 cells (6Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar), we confirmed that H2O2 treatment disrupted the endogenous interaction between Trx and ASK1 in nontransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2D). When nontransfected HEK293 cells lysate was analyzed by gel filtration, endogenous Trx was found to exist in all fractions regardless of the presence of ASK1 (Fig. 2E, second and fourth panels). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of individual fractions showed that the interaction of ASK1 and Trx in unstimulated cells was clearly detectable in the HMM fractions almost in parallel with the amount of ASK1 in each fractions (Fig. 2E, top panel, lanes 5-10; compare with Fig. 2A, top panel); however, Trx-ASK1 interaction was strongly reduced in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 2E, third panel). This indicates that the H2O2-induced higher molecular mass complex of ASK1 (corresponding to lanes 1-4 of the second and third panels in Fig. 2A) does not contain Trx. These results suggest that dissociation of Trx from and reciprocal association of additional component(s) to the preexisting HMM signaling complex of ASK1 may occur during ROS-induced activation of ASK1. TNFα Also Induces Higher Molecular Mass Complex Formation of ASK1—We have previously demonstrated that TRAF2 interacts with and activates ASK1 in TNFα signaling (5Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We have also reported that ROS-dependent prior dissociation of Trx is required for the TNFα-induced TRAF2-ASK1 interaction and activation of ASK1 (6Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar, 17Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that TNFα activated endogenous ASK1 in HEK293 cells within 15 min and peaked at 30 min after the treatment with TNFα. The interaction between exogenously expressed ASK1 (ASK1-HA), and endogenous TRAF2 was also found to peak at 30 min after the treatment with TNFα in HEK293 cells, and ASK1 co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF2 was found to be phosphorylated as determined by immunoblotting with phospho-ASK1 antibody (Fig. 3B). When TNFα-treated cell extract was analyzed by the gel filtration column, a shift of the ASK1-containing HMM fractions toward the higher molecular mass fractions was clearly observed in a TNFα-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that TNFα activates the static HMM ASK1 complex by recruiting additional components including TRAF2. ASK1 Interacts with TRAF2 in a ROS-dependent Manner—The similarity between H2O2- and TNFα-induced changes in the ASK1 signaling complex (Figs. 2A and 3C), together with the finding that TNFα-induced activation of ASK1 depends largely on ROS (6Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar, 17Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether TRAF2 may also be involved in the mechanism of ROS-induced activation of ASK1. In support of this idea, it has recently been reported that TRAF2 is required for H2O2-induced JNK activation and cell death (38Shen H.M. Lin Y. Choksi S. Tran J. Jin T. Chang L. Karin M. Zhang J. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether TRAF2 is involved in H2O2-induced activation of ASK1. In parallel with the time course of H2O2-induced activation of ASK1 (Fig. 3D), ASK1 was co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF2 in an H2O2-dependent manner, and co-immunoprecipitated ASK1 was phosphorylated and thus activated (Fig. 3E). These results strongly suggested that the molecular components responsible for H2O2-induced larger complex formation of the ASK1 signalosome include TRAF2. TRAF2 and TRAF6 but Not TRAF5 Are Required for ROS-induced Activation of the ASK1-JNK/p38 Pathways—Among the TRAF family members, not only TRAF2 but also TRAF5 and TRAF6 activate ASK1 (5Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent report demonstrated that ROS-dependent interaction of TRAF6 and ASK1 is crucial for lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway (36Matsuzawa A. Saegusa K.

We thus explored the possibility of whether TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are involved in ROS-induced ASK1 activation. To examine the requirement of TRAFs for ROS-induced ASK1 activation, we analyzed MEFs deficient for TRAF2 (39Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L.

AR antagonists are currently used to treat prostate cancer. However, mutations commonly develop in patients that convert these compounds to agonists. Recently, our laboratory discovered selective androgen receptor modulators, which structurally resemble the nonsteroidal AR antagonists bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide but act as agonists for the androgen receptor in a tissue-selective manner. To investigate why subtle structural changes to both the ligand and the receptor (i.e. mutations) result in drastic changes in activity, we studied structure-activity relationships for nonsteroidal AR ligands through crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis, comparing bound conformations of R-bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and two previously reported nonsteroidal androgens, S-1 and R-3. These studies provide the first crystallographic evidence of the mechanism by which nonsteroidal ligands interact with the wild type AR. We have shown that changes induced to the positions of Trp-741, Thr-877, and Met-895 allow for ligand accommodation within the AR binding pocket and that a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of Leu-873 and the ketone of hydroxyflutamide is present when bound to the T877A AR variant. Additionally, we demonstrated that R-bicalutamide stimulates transcriptional activation in AR harboring the M895T point mutation. As a whole, these studies provide critical new insight for receptor-based drug design of nonsteroidal AR agonists and antagonists.

The androgen receptor (AR) 3The abbreviations used are: ARandrogen receptorDHTdihydrotestosteroneHFhydroxyflutamideTwild typeLBDligand binding domainDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 3The abbreviations used are: ARandrogen receptorDHTdihydrotestosteroneHFhydroxyflutamideTwild typeLBDligand binding domainDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid is a ligand-inducible nuclear hormone receptor involved in regulation of prostate growth, muscle and bone mass, and spermatogenesis in males. Endogenous ligands for the AR include the steroid, testosterone, and its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Agonist compounds for the AR provide therapeutic potential in the treatment of osteoporosis, cachexia, contraception, and androgen deficiency (1Negro-Vilar A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 3459-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Antagonist AR ligands are commonly used in the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer. The clinically available nonsteroidal antiandrogens, flutamide and bicalutamide, are advantageous over steroidal drug treatments because of their oral bioavailability and lack of cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors. Mutations to the AR that cause resistance to antiandrogens by converting the compounds to agonists exist and represent a significant problem with currently prescribed prostate cancer drugs that target the AR (2Hara T. Miyazaki J. Araki H. Yamaoka M. Kanzaki N. Kusaka M. Miyamoto M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 149-153PubMed Google Scholar, 3Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Trapman J.

Prostate. 1996; 29: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Different AR mutations cause agonism for hydroxyflutamide (HF, active form of flutamide) as compared with bicalutamide, suggesting that these ligands do not antagonize the AR by the same mechanism. Our recent report of the W741L-R-bicalutamide crystal structure (5Bohl C.E. Gao W. Miller D.D. Bell C.E. Dalton J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6201-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) demonstrated that R-bicalutamide induces the same overall fold of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) observed in steroidal androgen-bound AR LBD crystal structures when bound to a mutant AR associated with resistance. Additionally, mutations to Thr-877 (4Suzuki H. Akakura K. Komiya A. Aida S. Akimoto S. Shimazaki J. Prostate. 1996; 29: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6Steketee K. Timmerman L.

Subtle differences in the AR-ligand interaction therefore are responsible for the activity of androgen antagonists. The recent discovery of nonsteroidal AR agonists by structural modification of bicalutamide and HF further reinforces this finding (8Dalton J.T. Mukherjee A. Zhu Z. Kirkovsky L. Miller D.D. Biochem.

None of these models resembled the bound conformation of R-bicalutamide in the W741L mutant (5Bohl C.E. Gao W. Miller D.D. Bell C.E. Dalton J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6201-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, questions regarding how R-bicalutamide and structurally related selective androgen receptor modulators could be accommodated in the wild type (WT) AR remained unanswered. The presence of the Trp-741 side chain would seemingly preclude the B-ring of nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators from binding in the same position occupied by the B-ring of R-bicalutamide in the W741L AR. Although our efforts to obtain crystal structures of the AR LBD complexed to pure antiandrogens have been unsuccessful due to tight association with the groEL chaperone protein, crystal structures of the WT AR bound to agonists that closely resemble bicalutamide and HF in structure were obtained. Herein we present the first evidence as to how nonsteroidal ligands are accommodated in the WT AR by inducing changes to the positions of residues in the binding pocket. We also report the crystal structure of HF bound to the well known resistance mutation, T877A. Lastly, we present evidence that M895T represents a novel resistance mutation for R-bicalutamide and may also be involved in bicalutamide withdrawal syndrome similar to mutations to Trp-741 (2Hara T.

The AR LBD was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 at 15 °C for 16 h by induction with 30 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 units/ml DNase I, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.5% CHAPS, 100 μm ligand, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by three cycles of freeze-thaw.

WT-S-1 crystals were obtained in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.6 m sodium citrate after 4 weeks. Nucleation sites from these WT-S-1 crystals were transferred with a cat whisker into freshly mixed protein and reservoir solution ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 m sodium citrate with 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, to improve WT-S-1 crystal quality and size. Crystals formed in 1–2 days using this technique allowing for optimization. The WT-R-3 crystals were obtained by transferring microseeds with a cat whisker from T877A-HF crystals in 0.3-0.6 m sodium citrate with 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5. Prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, AR LBD crystals were transferred to a solution consisting of 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.7 m sodium citrate, and 20% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator and an R-axis IV++ image plate (Rigaku, The Woodlands, TX) and processed with Crystal Clear software (Molecular Structure Corporation, The Woodlands, TX). The W741L-R-bicalutamide structure (Protein Data Bank code 1Z95) was used as a starting structure for refinement using Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). After an initial round of refinement, electron density maps allowed for accurate fitting of the ligand. Model building and water molecules were added using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan Kjeldgaard S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), and further rounds of refinement were performed using rigid body, torsion angle simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor modules of CNS. Figures were prepared with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System).Cotransfection Assay—CV-1 cells (green monkey kidney cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% streptomycin and penicillin to confluency in T175 tissue culture flasks. Cells were then transfected with 3 μg of the CMVhAR expression vector (WT or mutant), 30 μg of an androgen-dependent luciferase reporter construct (pMMTV-luc; generously provided by Dr. Ronald Evans at The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), and 30 μg of a β-galactosidase expression construct (pSV-β-galactosidase; Promega, Madison, WI) via 30 μl of Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and 40 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 4 h, the medium was exchanged to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were transferred 12 h later to 24-well tissue culture plates and after another 6 h were treated with 0.1–1000 nm, drug or no drug (control). After another 24 h, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by incubation with 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 min. An aliquot (50 μl) of the lysate was then added to an opaque 96-well plate, and luciferase activity was monitored after automated injection of 50 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) with a MicroLumatPlus LB96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN) using the WinGlow software package. An aliquot (50 μl) of the lysate was also added to a clear 96-well plate along with 50 μl of β-galactosidase assay buffer. An absorbance measurement at 420 nm was taken following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C on a Dynex MRX plate reader. Luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity to account for differences in cell number and/or loss in transfection efficiency. Transcriptional activation was interpreted as the -fold increase (relative luciferase units) over control (i.e. non-drug treated) wells.RESULTSAll crystal structures of AR LBD solved to date have been in an orthorhombic P212121 space group (5Bohl C.E.

Purification of AR LBD bound to agonist ligands is well documented and involves removal of contamination chaperones, dnak and groEL, through cation exchange chromatography (21Matias P.M.

The AR LBD is not retained by cation exchange chromatography in the presence of antagonist compounds and co-elutes with groEL after anion exchange chromatography, suggesting that antagonist-bound AR LBD is tightly associated with groEL, possibly as a result of partial receptor unfolding (25Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 26Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, mutations to the AR that confer resistance to antiandrogens offer a viable method to obtain crystallographic evidence for antagonist binding conformations to the AR and provide insight as to how they would alter the conformation in the WT AR to stabilize association with heat shock proteins (3Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 29Kallio P.J.

AR LBD bound to the partial agonists S-1 and R-3 demonstrated a fractional amount of cation exchange retention compared with DHT-bound LBD. The yields of purified S-1-associated AR LBD were, however, substantially improved in the T877A and W741L AR mutants. Additionally, crystal formation of the AR LBD-S-1 complex was also significantly facilitated in these mutants. WT-S-1 crystal formation took nearly one month as opposed to 1–2 days for the mutant complexes, likely because of slowed nucleation, and was circumvented by using microseeding. Furthermore, WT-R-3 crystals did not form in similar conditions or any of numerous crystal screens. Because WT-S-1 and T877A-HF complexes crystallized in the same space group with nearly the same unit cell dimensions and same overall protein fold (TABLE ONE), we predicted that the WT-R-3 crystals would be similar. Therefore, we obtained crystals of the WT-R-3 complex by transferring microseeds from T877A-HF crystals. Clear electron density for Thr-877 and the bromine atom insured that we had, in fact, obtained the WT-R-3 complex.TABLE ONECrystallographic data and refinement statistics Values for data in the last resolution shell are shown in parenthesis.

Kirkovsky L. Miller D.D. Dalton J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Addition of a bromine at this position results in a large increase in binding affinity to the AR (8Dalton J.T. Mukherjee A. Zhu Z. Kirkovsky L. Miller D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, R-3 elicits agonist activity for the AR only at high concentrations (i.e. ≥100 nm) (Fig. 2a). The crystal structure of R-3 bound to the native AR LBD demonstrates a very similar bound conformation as R-bicalutamide in the W741L (5Bohl C.E. Gao W. Miller D.D. Bell C.E. Dalton J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6201-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Arg-752 and Gln-711 hydrogen bond with the nitro group of R-3 directly and by way of a water molecule (Fig. 3, a and b), resembling the hydrogen bond pattern seen with the cyano group of R-bicalutamide. However, Gln-711 is likely too distant (3.7 Å) from the cyano in the W741L-R-bicalutamide complex for direct hydrogen bond formation. The amide nitrogen of R-3 is within hydrogen bond distance to the backbone oxygen of Leu-704, and the chiral hydroxyl group of R-3 is within distance for hydrogen bonds with Asn-705 Oδ1 and the backbone oxygen of Leu-704, identical to the interactions observed with R-bicalutamide in the W741L mutant AR. Thr-877 is also oriented as in the W741L-R-bicalutamide complex, which is rotated 180° compared with steroidal bound AR structures. The Trp-741 indole ring, which is absent in the W741L-R-bicalutamide complex, borders the region occupied by bromine along with Met-742 and Met-895 residues as shown in Fig. 3b. Bulk provided by the bromine atom in this region therefore appears to greatly enhance binding affinity as compared with HF. Furthermore, the W741L and M895T mutations, which decrease bulk around the location of the bromine atom of R-3, demonstrate a decrease in transcriptional activation with R-3 relative to the WT (Fig. 2, c and d). A gain of AR-mediated transcription with R-3, however, is observed in the T877A AR (Fig. 2b).FIGURE 2AR-mediated transcriptional activation by DHT, R-bicalutamide (R-bic), S-1, HF, and R-3 in the WT (a), T877A (b), W741L (c), and M895T (d) AR variants. Relative luciferase units (RLU) normalized with β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity. Inter-experiment variation was observed with RLU/β-galactosidase values due to transfection efficiency, but relative drug-induced transcriptional activation was found consistent and therefore more accurately represents changes in functional activity observed in AR mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Stereo representations of AR interactions with R-3 and S-1. a, WT-R-3 complex fit into the 2Fo - Fc electron density maps contoured at the 2σ level (cyan) with R-3 shown in the Fo - Fc simulated annealing omit map contoured at the 4σ level (red).

Possible hydrogen bonds within 3.5 Å are represented by dashed lines. Notice that Gln-711 and Arg-752 hydrogen bond with the nitro group of R-3. Leu-704 and Asn-705 also form hydrogen bonds with R-3. Also notice the hydrophobic contacts from Trp-741, Met-742, and Met-895 with the R-3 bromine atom.

Similar hydrogen bonds to the AR are present in S-1 as with R-3. Notice the increased size of the S-1 binding pocket as compared with R-3 due to the S-1 B-ring. A water molecule hydrogen bonds to the His-874 side chain and backbone atoms of helices 4 and 5 within 3.0 Å of the B-ring fluorine atom, similar to that seen in the W741L-R-bicalutamide complex. Also notice the clear electron density for Trp-741 at the 2σ level as compared with the R-3-bound structure, likely because of decreased mobility of Trp-741 from binding of the S-1 B-ring.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structure of Ether-linked Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator in WT AR—S-1 is an agonist for the AR that exhibits tissue-selective pharmacologic effects in vivo and therefore represents a novel class of AR ligands known as selective androgen receptor modulators (1Negro-Vilar A.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5420-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). S-1 resembles R-3 structurally but contains an ether-linked phenyl ring with a para-fluoro substituent in place of the bromine atom (Fig. 1). S-1 also closely resembles R-bicalutamide in structure, differing only at the linkage group and A-ring para position (Fig. 1). It is therefore surprising that S-1 elicits significantly more agonist activity than these structural analogs in the WT AR (Fig. 2a). The crystal structure of the WT-S-1 complex (Fig. 3, c and d) demonstrates that S-1 superimposes identically to the A-ring and amide portion of R-3. At the chiral hydroxyl group, S-1 bends and orients the B-ring nearly parallel to helix 12. Displacement of the Trp-741 indole ring by the B-ring of S-1 opens up an additional cavity in the AR binding pocket (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W1988596534,"Here, we demonstrate that the BMP receptor Wishful Thinking (Wit) is required for synapse stabilization. In the absence of BMP signaling, synapse disassembly and retraction ensue. Remarkably, downstream Smad-mediated signaling cannot fully account for the stabilizing activity of the BMP receptor. We identify LIM Kinase1 (DLIMK1)-dependent signaling as a second, parallel pathway that confers the added synapse-stabilizing activity of the BMP receptor. We show that DLIMK1 binds a region of the Wit receptor that is necessary for synaptic stability but is dispensable for Smad-mediated synaptic growth. A genetic analysis demonstrates that DLIMK1 is necessary, presynaptically, for synapse stabilization, but is not necessary for normal synaptic growth or function. Furthermore, presynaptic expression of DLIMK1 in a wit or mad mutant significantly rescues synaptic stability, growth, and function. DLIMK1 localizes near synaptic microtubules and functions independently of ADF/cofilin, highlighting a novel requirement for DLIMK1 during synapse stabilization rather than actin-dependent axon outgrowth.

Throughout the vertebrate nervous system, precisely wired neural circuitry is established through an initial overproduction of synaptic connections followed by the selective loss of a subset of these synapses. The molecular mechanisms that specify which synapses will be retained and which will be lost are unknown. There is additional complexity because synapse disassembly occurs coincidently with synapse growth in most systems. For example, live imaging studies have shown that single motoneurons can simultaneously disassemble synapses at some target muscles while increasing the size of synaptic connections at other muscle targets (Kasthuri and Lichtman, 2003Kasthuri N.

Similar observations have been made in live imaging studies of dendritic remodeling of vertebrate central neurons (De Paola et al., 2003De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P.

Thus, a molecular understanding of synapse development and neural circuit formation will require investigation of both synaptic growth and stabilization and an understanding of how these two processes are coordinately controlled (Goda and Davis, 2003Goda Y. Davis G.W. Mechanisms of synapse assembly and disassembly.Neuron. 2003; 40: 243-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is well established that cell growth, synapse formation, and synaptic competition are influenced by the action of trophic signaling molecules (Huang and Reichardt, 2001Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F.

Increased expression or activity of the neurotrophins can promote synapse formation (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F. Bonhoeffer T.

Conversely, impaired neurotrophin signaling can lead to decreased synapse number through effects on synaptic growth and stability in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (Belluardo et al., 2001Belluardo N.

The current challenge is to dissect the signaling systems downstream of these trophic receptors to determine how receptor activation could influence the seemingly disparate processes of synaptic growth, synaptic stability, and synapse disassembly. To investigate this, we have turned to a trophic signaling system recently identified at the Drosophila NMJ. The canonical bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling system has been implicated in diverse cellular and developmental processes ranging from cell growth to tissue patterning (Massague, 1998Massague J.

At the Drosophila NMJ, a BMP signaling system has been identified that controls synaptic growth via canonical Smad-mediated signaling to the cell body (Aberle et al., 2002Aberle H. Haghighi A.P.

It has been demonstrated that mutations in the BMP ligand glass bottom boat (gbb), the type I and type II BMP receptors thick veins (tkv) and wishful thinking (wit), and the Smad homologs mad and medea all significantly impair synaptic growth and function. These data define a retrograde trophic signaling system that functions through transcriptional mechanisms in the cell soma to control motoneuron synaptic growth. In this study, we demonstrate that BMP signaling at the Drosophila NMJ is not only required for normal synaptic growth, but also for synaptic stabilization. In the absence of BMP signaling, we observed significant increases in synapse retraction and disassembly. We then demonstrate that signaling downstream of the BMP receptors can be genetically separated into two pathways: Smad-dependent synaptic growth and LIM Kinase1-dependent synaptic stability. LIM Kinase1 (LIMK1) is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase that was originally isolated in screens for novel kinases expressed in the nervous system (Bernard et al., 1994Bernard O. Ganiatsas S.

Limk1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and phosphorylates serine, threonine and tyrosine residues in vitro.Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1271-1281PubMed Google Scholar). Findings in LIMK1 knockout mice reveal defects in dendritic spine morphology and activity-dependent plasticity, although neither synaptic growth nor synaptic stability has been specifically analyzed (Endo et al., 2003Endo M.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Drosophila central nervous system, DLIMK1 has been implicated in the mechanisms of axonal outgrowth during metamorphosis, acting through ADF/cofilin to modulate the actin cytoskeleton, a mechanism also documented in other tissues (Arber et al., 1998Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P.

Commun. 2000; 276: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our genetic analyses define a new function for DLIMK1 during synaptic stability in comparison with its function in axonal outgrowth. We find that synaptic DLIMK1 is closely associated with the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. In addition, genetic manipulation of ADF/cofilin activity does not affect synaptic stability at the NMJ. These data highlight differences in LIMK1 function during the rapid, dynamic process of axon outgrowth compared to the slower, more prolonged mechanisms that govern synapse stabilization at the NMJ. Together, our data define genetically separable signaling pathways downstream of the BMP receptor that could allow a single trophic signaling event to coordinately control synaptic growth and synaptic stabilization. We have previously established an assay to quantify synaptic retraction at the Drosophila NMJ and have used this assay to identify molecules involved in synaptic stability (Figure 1A ; Eaton et al., 2002Eaton B.A. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Dynactin is necessary for synapse stabilization.Neuron. 2002; 34: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the demonstration that the formation of organized postsynaptic muscle membrane folds, termed the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), requires the presence of the presynaptic nerve terminal (Guan et al., 1996Guan B. Hartmann B. Kho Y.H. Gorczyca M. Budnik V. The Drosophila tumor suppressor gene, dlg, is involved in structural plasticity at a glutamatergic synapse.Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Saitoe et al., 2001Saitoe M. Schwarz T.L. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Kidokoro Y. Absence of junctional glutamate receptor clusters in Drosophila mutants lacking spontaneous transmitter release.Science. 2001; 293: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, the SSR and proteins that localize to this structure will only be present at sites where the nerve terminal resides, or where it has recently resided. Thus, observed sites of organized postsynaptic SSR that lack opposing presynaptic neuronal markers identify regions of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where the nerve terminal once resided and has since retracted. This interpretation has been confirmed in previous studies using light-level, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological analyses (Eaton et al., 2002Eaton B.A. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Dynactin is necessary for synapse stabilization.Neuron. 2002; 34: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Pielage et al., 2005Pielage J. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Presynaptic spectrin is essential for synapse stabilization.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 918-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Sites of synapse retraction are referred to as “retraction events” or “synaptic footprints” and represent a quantitative assay for synaptic stability. In our prior studies, we used a wide array of pre- and postsynaptic markers to clearly define synaptic retraction events. Synaptic retractions can be identified with equal efficiency using antibodies that recognize diverse presynaptic antigens including cytoplasmic, membrane-associated, cytoskeleton, or vesicle-associated proteins (Eaton et al., 2002Eaton B.A. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Dynactin is necessary for synapse stabilization.Neuron. 2002; 34: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Pielage et al., 2005Pielage J. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Presynaptic spectrin is essential for synapse stabilization.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 918-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Several postsynaptic markers have also been used to quantify synapse retractions, including Discs-large, Shaker-GFP, and the clustered postsynaptic glutamate receptors (Eaton et al., 2002Eaton B.A. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Dynactin is necessary for synapse stabilization.Neuron. 2002; 34: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Pielage et al., 2005Pielage J. Fetter R.D.

A subset of these pre- and postsynaptic markers is used in the present study. We have used our retraction assay to test whether BMP signaling in Drosophila motoneurons is required for synapse stabilization (Figure 1). We first confirmed that mutations in the BMP type II receptor Wit and the BMP ligand Gbb cause a significant decrease in bouton number (Figure 1D) (Aberle et al., 2002Aberle H. Haghighi A.P.

Neurobiol. 2003; 55: 134-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that these mutations also cause a significant increase in synaptic footprints, demonstrating that synaptic stability is significantly compromised in the absence of BMP signaling (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1E). Synaptic footprints were identified in equal numbers using multiple presynaptic markers, including anti-Synapsin and anti-nc82, which recognizes an antigen at the presynaptic active zone (Figures 1B and 1C). We also demonstrate that synaptic footprints can be rescued in the wit mutant background by neuronal expression of the full-length wit transgene, demonstrating that synapse destabilization is caused by the absence of the presynaptic Wit receptor. (Figures 1D and 1E; see Figure 3 for an example of a rescued wit NMJ that lacks footprints). The number of synapse retractions is slightly, but statistically significantly, less in gbb compared with that in wit. This could be due to the fact that wit is a null mutation, whereas the gbb genotype that we used is not (McCabe et al., 2003McCabe B.D. Marques G. Haghighi A.P. Fetter R.D. Crotty M.L. Haerry T.E.

The BMP homolog Gbb provides a retrograde signal that regulates synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.Neuron. 2003; 39: 241-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Null mutations in gbb do not survive through larval development and, therefore, we have used the genetic combination previously used in studies of its effects on synaptic growth (McCabe et al., 2003McCabe B.D. Marques G. Haghighi A.P. Fetter R.D. Crotty M.L. Haerry T.E. Goodman C.S. O’Connor M.B. The BMP homolog Gbb provides a retrograde signal that regulates synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.Neuron. 2003; 39: 241-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We next extended our analysis to mutations that disrupt additional downstream components of the canonical BMP signaling cascade (Figure 2A ). We tested mutations in the BMP type I receptor thick-veins (tkv), the Smad homolog mad, and the co-Smad medea (Figure 2). We find that all three mutations decrease bouton numbers to levels that are statistically identical to those observed in the wit and gbb mutations, confirming previous reports (Figure 2B) (McCabe et al., 2003McCabe B.D.

Neurobiol. 2003; 55: 134-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that all three mutations also cause a statistically significant increase in synaptic footprints compared to wild-type (Figure 2C; p < 0.001), demonstrating that canonical BMP signaling is necessary for synaptic stability as well as for growth. The fact that synaptic footprints in wit can be rescued by neuronal expression of UAS-wit suggests that BMP signaling is necessary in the motoneuron for synaptic stability. To confirm that Smad-mediated signaling is also required within the motoneuron for synaptic stabilization, we neuronally overexpressed the inhibitory Smad dad (Figures 2B and 2C; dad gain of function, DAD GOF). Genetic evidence suggests that this manipulation can block both Mad and DSmad2 signaling (Marquez et al., 2001Marquez R.M. Singer M.A. Takaesu N.T. Waldrip W.R. Kraytsberg Y. Newfeld S.J. Transgenic analysis of the Smad family of TGF-beta signal transducers in Drosophila melanogaster suggests new roles and new interactions between family members.Genetics. 2001; 157: 1639-1648PubMed Google Scholar). We find that neuronal DAD GOF decreases bouton numbers and increases synaptic footprints to levels that are near those observed in tkv, mad, and medea (Figures 2B and 2C). Finally, in order to examine whether Smad signaling is required in the cell soma for synaptic stabilization, we examined a genetic interaction between the wit mutation and the overexpression of a dominant-negative Glued transgene (DN-Glued) that disrupts retrograde axonal transport. Previous work has demonstrated that impairment of dynactin function in motoneurons disrupts retrograde axonal transport and causes synapse retraction at the NMJ (Eaton et al., 2002Eaton B.A. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Dynactin is necessary for synapse stabilization.Neuron. 2002; 34: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, LaMonte et al., 2002LaMonte B.H. Wallace K.E.

Disruption of dynein/dynactin inhibits axonal transport in motor neurons causing late-onset progressive degeneration.Neuron. 2002; 34: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We find that the number of retractions in the DN-Glued; wit double mutant (36.6%, n = 91 synapses) is not additive with respect to the wit mutation or DN-Glued overexpression (44.5%, n = 137 synapses for wit; 29.6%, n = 98 synapses for DN-Glued). Although the overexpression of DN-Glued cannot be considered a null mutant condition, it is sufficient to block the accumulation of nuclear phospho-Mad and therefore prevents BMP signaling to the nucleus (Allan et al., 2003Allan D.W.

Thus, we conclude that Smad-mediated signaling to the motoneuron cell soma is necessary for both synaptic growth and synaptic stability. Together, these data establish an in vivo link between retrograde axonal transport, an essential trophic signaling system, and the mechanisms of synaptic stabilization. We performed additional experiments to test whether mutations that decrease the number of boutons always increase the number of footprints. In these experiments, we analyzed mutations that decrease bouton number but which have not been implicated in the BMP signaling system. Bouton numbers are significantly decreased in these three independent mutations: the cell adhesion molecule fasciclin II (fasII) (Schuster et al., 1996Schuster C.M. Davis G.W. Fetter R.D.

The transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase DLAR controls motor axon guidance in Drosophila.Cell. 1996; 84: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and the microtubule binding protein futsch (Roos et al., 2000Roos J.

Drosophila Futsch regulates synaptic microtubule organization and is necessary for synaptic growth.Neuron. 2000; 26: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In each of these three mutations, bouton numbers are significantly decreased whereas the number of synaptic footprints remains unchanged (Table 1). It has also been shown that impaired synaptic growth in a presynaptic calcium channel mutant does not alter synaptic stability (Rieckhof et al., 2003Rieckhof G.E. Yoshihara M. Guan Z. Littleton J.T. Presynaptic N-type calcium channels regulate synaptic growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41099-41108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). From these data we can conclude that impaired synaptic growth does not necessarily impair synaptic stabilization. By extension, we conclude that BMP signaling is required for two separable processes, synaptic growth and synaptic stability.Table 1Synaptic Growth and Retraction AnalysisGenotypeaBouton # (SEM)aBouton numbers represent the average number of boutons from the synapse on muscle 4 in segment A3.p valuebP values for bouton counts were determined by comparison to third instar wild-type using a standard t test analysis.

While all of the mutations in canonical BMP signaling molecules decrease bouton numbers to the same extent, there are significantly fewer synaptic footprints in the tkv, mad, and medea mutations (as well as in DAD GOF) when compared to the wit mutation (Figure 2C). Thus, while canonical BMP signaling is required for both synaptic growth and stability, the Wit receptor has an additional stabilizing influence on the NMJ that cannot be accounted for by the downstream Smad signaling system. We therefore pursued experiments to investigate the mechanism of Wit-mediated synaptic stability that ap"
https://openalex.org/W2079833508,"Motor neurons, alone among neurons in the vertebrate CNS, extend axons out of the neural tube to innervate peripheral targets. Two classes of motor neurons, termed vMNs and dMNs, extend axons out of the neural tube via ventral and dorsal exit points, respectively, in accord with their homeodomain transcription factor repertoire. Downstream of these transcriptional codes, the cell surface receptors that shape initial motor axon trajectories have not been identified. We show here that the chemokine receptor Cxcr4 is expressed on the axons of vMNs as they follow their ventral trajectory, whereas its ligand, Cxcl12, is expressed by mesenchymal cells surrounding the ventral neural tube. Genetic studies reveal that Cxcl12-Cxcr4 signaling directs the ventral trajectory of spinal vMNs. In its absence, these neurons adopt a dMN-like trajectory, despite preservation of their vMN transcriptional identity. Thus, the status of Cxcr4 signaling helps to determine the initial axonal trajectory of mammalian motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2150954602,"Dendritic spikes that propagate toward the soma are well documented, but their physiological role remains uncertain. Our in vitro patch-clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging show that direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) utilize orthograde dendritic spikes during physiological activity. DSGCs signal the direction of image motion. Excitatory subthreshold postsynaptic potentials are observed in DSGCs for motion in all directions and provide a weakly tuned directional signal. However, spikes are generated over only a narrow range of motion angles, indicating that spike generation greatly enhances directional tuning. Our results indicate that spikes are initiated at multiple sites within the dendritic arbors of DSGCs and that each dendritic spike initiates a somatic spike. We propose that dendritic spike failure, produced by local inhibitory inputs, might be a critical factor that enhances directional tuning of somatic spikes."

Incorporation of secretins into the Escherichia coli outer membrane causes neither leakage of periplasmic proteins nor increased sensitivity to small toxic compounds that are unable to breach the outer membrane (19Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7212-7220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PulD, pIV, XcpQ, and YscC all form very small conductance channels in lipid bilayers (13Burghout P. Van Boxtel R. Van Gelder P. Ringler P. Muller S.A. Tommassen J. Koster M. J.

Comparison of secretin sequences led to the definition of two major domains of approximately equal length (19Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7212-7220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted domain organization was confirmed by analysis of trypsin or proteinase K-resistant domains of PulD and XcpQ (14Brok R.

Pugsley A.P. Engel A.

These data prompted speculation that the well conserved secretin C domain is anchored in the outer membrane by 10–14 potentially transmembrane amphipathic β strands (19Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7212-7220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) characteristic of other outer membrane proteins (22Koebnik R. Locher K.P. Van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The N domain, corresponding approximately to the first half of the protein, is much less conserved. The Erwinia chrysanthemi exoprotein pectate lyase binds to this region of its cognate secretin, OutD, indicating that it might carry a specific exoprotein recognition determinant (23Shevchik V.E. Robert-Badouy J. Condemine G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A third secretin domain sometimes present downstream from the C domain (the S domain) interacts with a protein (pilotin) that facilitates secretin targeting to the outer membrane (24Daefler S.

The three-dimensional structures of detergent-solubilized secretins pIV and N. meningitidis PilQ were determined by cryo-electron microscopy to resolutions of 18 and 12 Å, respectively. The pIV complex is ∼13.5 nm in diameter and 12 nm deep and comprises three stacked rings with two large chambers separated by a central protein mass (18Opalka N. Beckmann R. Boisset N. Sion M.N. Russel M. Darst S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The C and N domains, identified by labeling specific cysteine residues with nanogold particles, are on opposite rings (18Opalka N. Beckmann R. Boisset N. Sion M.N. Russel M. Darst S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, PilQ complexes have a cone-like structure that is closed at the tip (12Collins R.F. Davidsen L. Derrick J.P.

Individual secretin subunits were not resolved in either structure, but symmetries of 14 (pIV) and 12 (PilQ) were inferred from analysis of the rotational power spectrum (18Opalka N. Beckmann R. Boisset N. Sion M.N. Russel M. Darst S. J. Mol.

The pullulanase T2SS of K. oxytoca is one of the most extensively studied secretons and has been completely reconstituted in E. coli. A low resolution three-dimensional structure of a purified complex of the pullulanase T2SS secretin PulD and its pilotin, PulS, revealed a cylindrical complex with 12-fold symmetry and a central open channel of about 7 nm encircled by radial spokes that we originally presumed to be the pilotin, which is absent from pIV and PilQ (16Nouwen N.

Here, we report refined biochemical and structural analyses of intact and proteolyzed PulD multimers. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The E. coli strains PAP105 (Δ(lac-pro) F′(lacIq1 proAB+ Tn10)) and XL1-Blue (ΔlacZM15 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 glnV44 relA1 F′(lacIq1proAB+ Tn10)) were used for recombinant DNA work. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (F- ompT hsdSB gal dcm) was used to produce the PulD N domain. The principal characteristics of the plasmids used in this study are summarized in TABLE ONE. Bacteria were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (31Miller J.H.

Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Pugsley A.P. Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the fragment corresponding to pulDhis was ligated into pSU18 (32Bartolomé B. Jubete Y. Martinez E. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and cleaved by the same enzymes to create pCHAP3678. The ability of PulDhis to replace PulD was tested in a pullulanase enzymatic assay (33Michaelis S. Chapon C. d'Enfert C. Pugsley A.P. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 633-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using strain PAP105 carrying pCHAP1226 (encoding all Pul secretion factors except PulD (34Possot O. Vignon G. Bomchil N. Ebel F. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). Bacteria were grown in LB medium buffered with 10% M63 salts solution (31Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1992; : 437-439Google Scholar) and 0.4% maltose to induce expression of genes encoding pullulanase secretion factors. pCHAP3678 restored secretion to 83% of the wild-type level. PulShis was constructed by amplifying pulS using pCHAP585 template DNA (19Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Sauvonnet N. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7212-7220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and reverse M13 sequencing primer and the primer 5′-ATCGGAAGCTTTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTATTGTCGCGCAGGC-3′, which inserts codons for eight histidines at the 3′ end of the amplicon. The amplicon was digested with HindIII and inserted in puc19 to generate pCHAP5506. The sequence of the entire gene was confirmed by sequencing. The ability of PulShis to replace PulS was tested as above in strain PAP7500S (Δ(lac-argF)U169 araD139 relA1 rpsL150 ΔmalE444 malG501 F′(lacIq1 pro+ Tn10) malP::(pulS::Tn5 pulA-pulB pulC-pulO)) into which pCHAP5506 was introduced. PulShis restored secretion to 100% of the wild-type level. Construction and Purification of PulD-N—See the supplemental material. Purification of Secretins—Outer membranes were isolated from PAP105 (pCHAP3516/pCHAP5506) and PAP105 (pCHAP3678/pCHAP585) producing PulD and PulShis or PulDhis and PulS, respectively, as described previously (16Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Ghazi A. Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8173-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 3% n-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate (ZW3–14), 250 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml protease inhibitor Pefablock (Pierce) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Solubilized proteins were recovered after ultracentrifugation at 185,000 × g and mixed with cobalt-agarose resin (Talon, Clontech) previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6% ZW3–14, 250 mm NaCl (TZN buffer) containing 5 mm imidazole for 1 h at 20 °C. The resin was washed with 10 volumes of TZN buffer plus 5 mm imidazole and then poured into a column. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of TZN buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and immediately loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP column (1 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an AKTAprime system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. After extensive washing, secretin complexes were eluted using a linear gradient of 250 mm to 1.25 m NaCl. To completely dissociate PulS from the complex, the fractions containing PulD (eluted at 700–750 mm NaCl) were incubated with 50 mm reducing agent Tris[2-carboxyethylphosphine] hydrochloride (Pierce) for 2 h at 20 °C. PulS was separated from the PulDhis complex by gel filtration on Sephacryl S300HR. The absence of PulS in the PulDhis fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against MalE-PulS. The fractions were concentrated on Q-Sepharose and stored in 100-μl aliquots at -80 °C. Trypsin Proteolysis of PulDhis Secretin—100 μg of purified PulDhis complex (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 μg/ml N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 2 h at 18°C. Pefabloc was then added to 0.1 mg/ml, and the sample was immediately injected onto a Sephacryl S300HR column. A control experiment was performed under the same conditions except that the trypsin was omitted. In both cases aliquots from all fractions were treated with phenol to dissociate the PulD complexes (8Hardie K.R. Lory S. Pugsley A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Sephacryl S300HR column was calibrated using thyroglobulin, alcohol dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase. PulD-containing fractions were concentrated and stored in 50-μl aliquots at -80 °C for electron microscopy. Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Protein Sequencing—See supplemental material. Circular Dichroism Analysis—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded from 190 to 250 nm on a Jasco dichrograph (J-710) equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder and connected to a computer for data acquisition. Purified PulD-N at 100 μg/ml was dialyzed against 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 250 mm NaF and submitted to CD analysis in a 1-mm quartz cell (3 data sets were acquired). The PulD-C domain was dialyzed against 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm NaF and 0.6% ZW3–14 immediately before analysis in a 5-mm quartz cell at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (5 data sets were acquired). Purified PulDhis at 60 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.6% ZW3–14 was diluted twice in 500 mm NaF containing 0.6% ZW3–14 immediately before CD analysis in a 1-mm quartz cell (5 data sets were acquired). Peptide Analysis by HPLC, Sequencing, and Mass Spectrometry—See the supplemental material. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy—A Vacuum Generators (East Grinstead) HB-5 STEM interfaced to a modular computer system (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems) was used. Samples were prepared on 200-mesh-per-inch, gold-plated copper grids as previously (35Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Grids were washed on 5–7 droplets of quartz double-distilled water to remove detergent. Isolated tobacco mosaic virus particles (kindly supplied by R. Diaz-Avalos) adsorbed to a separate grid and air-dried served as the mass standard. For structural examination, digital 512 × 512 pixel dark-field images were recorded from negatively stained (2% uranyl acetate) PulD at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV and a nominal magnification of 500,000× using doses between 3450 and 10250 electrons/nm. The pixel size (around 0.33 nm) depended on the focus conditions (35Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For mass determination, digital 512 × 512 pixel dark-field images were recorded from unstained freeze-dried samples of the PulD complexes at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and a nominal magnification of 200,000×. The recording dose used varied between 295 and 640 electrons/nm2 for these main data sets. In addition, repeated low dose scans were recorded from some grid regions to assess beam-induced mass loss (35Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The images were evaluated with the IMPSYS program package as described previously (35Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Complexes were delimited by circles, the total mass was calculated, and the background was subtracted. The beam-induced mass loss was assessed as previously (35Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The experimental mass data were multiplied by the correction factors calculated for the recording doses used and scaled according to the mass-per-length measured for tobacco mosaic virus particles. Finally, they were binned into histograms and fitted with Gauss curves. The overall experimental uncertainty of the results was estimated from the corresponding S.E. (S.E. = S.D./√n) and the 5% uncertainty in the calibration of the instrument by calculating the square root of the sum of the squares. Metal Shadowing—A 5-μl aliquot of purified sample at 0.05 mg/ml was applied to copper grids covered with a thin carbon film of uniform thickness, blotted with Whatman 2 filter paper, washed with 5 droplets of water to remove excess detergent, and quick-frozen in liquid ethane at -178 °C. The frozen grids were transferred into a Balzers 300 freeze-etching unit and freeze-dried at -90°Cfor 5 h in a vacuum of ∼1.3 × 10-5 Pa. Platinum/carbon (1–2-nm thick) was evaporated onto the surface at an angle of 45° while the sample was rotating. Images were taken on Kodak SO163 film at a nominal magnification of 50,000× with a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The film was digitized at 4 Å/pixel with a Primescan D 7100 drum scanner (Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG). EMAN boxer (36Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) was used to interactively select 1300 particles. Neural network-based classification, averaging, and calculation of the rotational power spectra (37Crowther R.A. Amos L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were done using the Xmipp (38Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) software package. Cryo-electron Microscopy and Single Particle Analysis—A 5-μl aliquot of purified sample at 0.05 mg/ml was applied to thin carbon film mounted on copper grids, washed with 5 droplets of water to remove excess detergent, and then quick-frozen in liquid ethane at -178 °C. The frozen grids were transferred to a Philips CM200-FEG electron microscope using a Gatan cryo-holder. Images were recorded on Kodak SO163 film at a nominal magnification of 50,000× and an accelerating voltage of 200 kV under low dose conditions. The defocus of the micrographs ranged between 2.4 and 5.1 μm. The negatives were digitized at 2 Å/pixel with a Primescan D 7100 drum scanner. Particles were selected interactively from the images with the EMAN boxer (36Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) software and analyzed using the SPIDER image processing programs (39Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Reference-free alignment (40Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and classification by correspondence analysis was employed to generate class averages. These were then used as references for iterative multi-reference alignment, with the cycles of alignment and classification repeated until no further change was observed in the class averages. For the intact complex, the various side views were utilized to generate a rough starting model by a common line search varying only one Euler angle. A cyclic 12-fold symmetry (C12) was imposed for the starting model, which was refined by projection matching of the top and side views while still imposing the C12 symmetry for the final volume. Several cycles of projection matching with increasing numbers of reference projections followed by iterative back projection in real space were required to obtain the final volume. All particle views were included in the refinement and matched to evenly balanced projections covering the whole three-dimensional space. The mandatory contrast-transfer function correction at the defocus values employed was made by a Wiener filter using a combination of the MRC (41Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and SPIDER (39Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar) software suites. The resolution of the generated map was estimated from the Fourier shell correlation function using the 50% threshold. Because practically only dimers of side views of the proteolyzed PulDhis complexes were available, a first volume of the dimer was computed and"
https://openalex.org/W2042089046,"The canonical extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade, consisting of the Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK module, is critically important to many cellular functions. Although the general mechanism of activation of the ERK cascade is well established, additional noncanonical components greatly influence the activity of this pathway. Here, we focus on the group A p21-activated kinases (Paks), which have previously been implicated in regulating both c-Raf and Mek1 activity, by phosphorylating these proteins at Ser338 and Ser298, respectively. In NIH-3T3 cells, expression of an inhibitor of all three group A Paks reduced activation of ERK in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) but not to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells using small interference RNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of both Pak1 and Pak2 to reduce group A Pak function. Inhibition of Pak kinase activity dramatically decreased phosphorylation of Mek1 at Ser298 in response to either PDGF or EGF, but this inhibition did not prevent Mek1 activation by EGF, suggesting that although Pak can phosphorylate Mek1 at Ser298, this event is not required for Mek1 activation by growth factors. Inhibition of Pak reduced the Ser338 phosphorylation of c-Raf in response to both PDGF and EGF; however, in the case of EGF, the reduction in Ser338 phosphorylation was not accompanied by a significant decrease in c-Raf activity. These findings suggest that Paks are required for the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338 in response to either growth factor, but that the mechanisms by which EGF and PDGF activate c-Raf are fundamentally different. The canonical extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade, consisting of the Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK module, is critically important to many cellular functions. Although the general mechanism of activation of the ERK cascade is well established, additional noncanonical components greatly influence the activity of this pathway. Here, we focus on the group A p21-activated kinases (Paks), which have previously been implicated in regulating both c-Raf and Mek1 activity, by phosphorylating these proteins at Ser338 and Ser298, respectively. In NIH-3T3 cells, expression of an inhibitor of all three group A Paks reduced activation of ERK in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) but not to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells using small interference RNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of both Pak1 and Pak2 to reduce group A Pak function. Inhibition of Pak kinase activity dramatically decreased phosphorylation of Mek1 at Ser298 in response to either PDGF or EGF, but this inhibition did not prevent Mek1 activation by EGF, suggesting that although Pak can phosphorylate Mek1 at Ser298, this event is not required for Mek1 activation by growth factors. Inhibition of Pak reduced the Ser338 phosphorylation of c-Raf in response to both PDGF and EGF; however, in the case of EGF, the reduction in Ser338 phosphorylation was not accompanied by a significant decrease in c-Raf activity. These findings suggest that Paks are required for the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338 in response to either growth factor, but that the mechanisms by which EGF and PDGF activate c-Raf are fundamentally different.

The Paks are divided into two distinct subgroups: the well studied group A, comprising Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3, and the more recently identified group B, comprising Pak4, Pak5, and Pak6. In addition to regulating morphological pathways, Paks contribute to a variety of transcriptional signaling cascades, such as the p38, Jun kinase (3Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchinson M.R. Marcus S.

The ERK pathway is of particular interest because group A Paks are known to be required for ERK activation and transformation by Ras (6Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Fields J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and two of the three components of this pathway, Mek1 and c-Raf (also known as Raf-1), have been proposed to be direct Pak substrates (7King A.J.

The canonical ERK activation pathway from receptor protein-tyrosine kinases is relatively well understood. Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor autophoshorylate upon ligand stimulation, thereby recruiting a variety of SH2-containing proteins, including Grb2, which binds SOS, an activator of Ras. Ras in turn recruits Raf to the plasma membrane where this kinase becomes activated, thereupon phosphorylating and activating Mek, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK. However, additional components play an important role in regulating ERK activation. For example, Mek1 is phosphorylated by group A Paks at position Ser298, and it is thought that this phosphorylation is essential for transmitting mitogenic signals (10Slack-Davis J.K. Eblen S.T. Zecevic M. Boerner S.A. Tarcsafalvi A. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. Catling A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Mek1 at this site is not in itself sufficient for activation; rather, it is thought to increase the affinity of Mek1 for ERK and/or c-Raf (11Eblen S. Slack J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the case of c-Raf, several groups have reported that Paks target a critical regulatory residue, Ser338 (7King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 8Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr.

Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), rendering this kinase competent for activation by Ras. However, other groups have suggested that either phosphorylation of Ser338 is dispensable for c-Raf activity (13Oehrl W. Rubio I. Wetzker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17819-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or that Ser338 phosphorylation is required for maximal activity but that Paks are not the relevant Ser338 kinases (14Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The regulation of c-Raf by phosphorylation is complex. In addition to the Ser338 and the adjacent Ser339 positions, phosphorylation at Tyr340 and Tyr341 also influence c-Raf conformation and activity. The Ser338/339 and Tyr340/341 sites have been identified as being coordinately regulated and required for maximal c-Raf activity (15Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or to promote the redistribution of c-Raf to different subcellular compartments (16Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recently, activation of c-Raf by angiogenic factors has demonstrated a differential phosphorylation of these two proximal regulatory sites: Ser338/339 and Tyr340/341. Basic fibroblast growth factor was reported to promote c-Raf activation through Pak-dependent phosphorylation of Ser338/339, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was reported to promote c-Raf activation by Src-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr340/341 (16Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In other systems phosphorylation of Tyr341 is dependent on the Src-like kinase Lyn (17Tilbrook P.A. Colley S.M. McCarthy D.J. Marais R. Klinken S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we used a specific inhibitor of group A Paks, the Pak1 inhibitor domain (PID) (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to analyze the Raf/Mek/ERK cascade in murine fibroblasts stimulated with growth factors. When expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, the Pak1 PID efficiently blocks the activation of all three group A Paks and blocks stimulation of ERK by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) but not by epidermal growth factor (EGF). An independent approach, siRNA, yielded similar results, but only if both Pak1 and Pak2 were simultaneously knocked down. For both EGF and PDGF, PID expression blocked Mek1 phosphorylation at Ser298, suggesting that this site is not required for Mek1 activation of ERK. Stimulation of c-Raf Ser338 phosphorylation by either growth factor was also blocked by PID expression. However, this blockade reduced c-Raf activation by PDGF but not by EGF. These results demonstrate that Ser338 phosphorylation of c-Raf is dependent on Pak activity in NIH-3T3 cells and that this phosphorylation is required for c-Raf activation by PDGF but not EGF. Further, these results show that alternate c-Raf activation mechanisms exist in NIH-3T3 cells and that similar growth factors use distinct signaling pathways to activate the ERK cascade. Materials—Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies (12CA5) were obtained from BabCo, and polyclonal anti-Myc and monoclonal anti-GST antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against group A Paks were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Pak1) and Cell Signaling Technology (Pak2 and Pak3). Antibodies against activated ERK and Mek (Ser217/221) were obtained from Promega and Cell Signaling Technologies, respectively, and antibodies against total ERK and Mek were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Monoclonal anti c-Raf and polyclonal anti-Ser(P)338 c-Raf antisera were from BD-Pharmingen and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Polyclonal anti-phospho Mek Ser298 were obtained from BIOSOURCE International. secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. SMARTpool® siRNAs against human Pak1 and Pak2 were purchased from Dharmacon. Expression Plasmids—The Pak1 PID (amino acids 83–149 in Pak1) was cloned as a BamHI/Acc65I fragment into pEBG (19Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This plasmid was then mutagenized to create SalI sites upstream of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) leader and downstream of the 3′ end of the PID. The insert was then excised with SalI and cloned into pTet-Splice (20Shockett P. DiFilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). An expression vector for activated c-Raf (c-Raf S338D/Y341D/T491E/S494D (DDED)) was obtained from K.-L. Guan (21Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses—The AdenoEasy system was used to create recombinant viruses bearing the PID or its inactive control PID L107F (22He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). The PID or PID L107F was subcloned into pAdTrack cytomegalovirus, and this plasmid, along with the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, was cotransformed into BJ5183 bacteria. Recombinants were identified by restriction analysis, and the adenovirus was amplified in 293 cells and purified by CsCl step gradient. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum. NIH-3T3 cells and derivatives were maintained in DMEM plus 10% calf serum and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin. The NIH-3T3 variant S2-6 (20Shockett P. DiFilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), bearing a tetracycline-regulated transactivator, was used to construct cell lines that inducibly express the Pak1 PID. To prepare stable, regulated clonal cell lines, S2-6 cells were cotransfected with the pTet-Splice-PID plasmids plus a plasmid encoding a puromycin resistance gene using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were selected in medium containing 2.5 mm histidinol (to retain the tetracycline-VP16 transactivator), 2 μg/ml puromycin (to select for the tetracycline-regulated expression vector), and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (to repress transgene expression during selection. Clonal cell lines were isolated and expanded, and at least 24 lines were examined for inducible transgene expression by anti-GST immunoblot. Transient Transfection—The cells were plated at 3.2 × 105 cells/35-mm culture dish in DMEM plus 10% calf serum and transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells plated in 24-well dishes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For double siRNA, the amounts of each SMARTpool was reduced by a factor of two. Immunoblot—The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol-phosphate) or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (24Muller J. Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Equivalent amounts of cleared cell lysate extract were fractionated by 10% SDS/PAGE and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked using fat-free milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (for phospho-specific antibodies) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, probed with antibodies, and developed using an alkaline-phosphatase-based chemiluminescent system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kinase Assays—Raf kinase assays were preformed as suggested by Muller and Morrison (24Muller J. Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), using endogenous c-Raf immunoprecipitated from 100-mm plates of 25A3 cells. In-gel kinase assays were preformed as described by Ding and Badwey (25Ding J. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17326-17333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with histone H4 (Fluka) as substrate rather than p47phox. The PID from Pak1 Serves as a Potent Inhibitor of All Group A Paks—Based on similarities between the group A Paks (Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3), we postulated that expression of the PID (residues 83–149 of Pak1) (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could serve as a group-specific Pak inhibitor. This construct has previously been used to inhibit Pak1 and Pak3 kinase activity (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its ability to inhibit Pak2 has not been assessed. Indeed, Fackler et al. (26Fackler O.T. Lu X. Frost J.A. Geyer M. Jiang B. Luo W. Abo A. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have argued that the Pak1 PID should not affect Pak2 activity, because the N termini of these two kinases differ substantially. This is a particularly important issue because Pak2 is abundantly expressed in most cell types. To evaluate the ability of the Pak1 PID to inhibit group A Paks, recombinant GST-PID or an inactive control (GST-PID Phe107) (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to recombinant His-Pak1, which was then activated by exposure to GTP-loaded Cdc42 and assayed for kinase activity. As expected, the Pak1 PID effectively blocked Pak1 activation, whereas the inactive inhibitor did not (Fig. 1A). The Pak1 PID also inhibited Pak2 activity to approximately the same extent as it inhibited Pak1 (Fig. 1B). Similar behavior was observed in cell-based assays. U2OS cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing GST-PID or GST-PID Phe107 (Fig. 1C). One day after adenoviral infection, the cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding an active allele of Myc-Cdc42 and an expression plasmid encoding HA-Pak1 or -Pak2. These kinases were subsequently immunoprecipitated and tested for autokinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1D, the PID of Pak1 potently inhibited both Pak1 and Pak2. Group B Paks, such as Pak4 and Pak5, were unaffected (data not shown). Because the Pak1 PID has already been shown to act on Pak3 (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results show that, despite the sequence differences between Pak1 and Pak2, this protein fragment can be used as a general inhibitor of all three group A Paks in cells. To evaluate the physiological effect of ablation of group A Pak activity, we engineered a cell line that inducibly expresses a GST-tagged Pak1 PID construct. When grown in the presence of tetracycline, these cells showed no detectable expression of the PID; in the absence of tetracycline, the PID was strongly induced (Fig. 2A). This inducibility was not affected by the presence of growth factors or calf serum; inducible expression of the GST-PID construct was seen when cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM or in DMEM supplemented with calf serum as long as tetracycline was absent (data not shown). We determined whether this construct could inhibit endogenous Paks in NIH-3T3 cells. To evaluate the activity of endogenous Paks, we relied on an in-gel kinase assay with histone H4 as substrate, because this assay allows simultaneous readouts for Pak1 and Pak2 (Pak3 is not resolvable from Pak1 on standard SDS/PAGE, but is, in any case, expressed at very low levels in NIH-3T3 cells). When cells were grown in the absence of tetracyline, PID expression was strongly induced (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, this induction was accompanied by an up-regulation of endogenous Pak1 and Pak2 expression (Fig. 2B; actin control not shown). In the absence of PID expression, PDGF and lysophosphatidic acid potently stimulated several protein kinases with molecular masses of ∼60–70 kDa, whereas a more modest effect was seen with insulin and EGF (Fig. 2C). When the PID was expressed, these renaturable kinases, which migrated at the same molecular mass as Pak1 and Pak2 (Fig. 2B), were inhibited irrespective of the stimulus used. It is important to note that there are several renaturable, H4 kinases of unknown origin that were unaffected by expression of the PID, suggesting that the inhibition is highly selective for group A Paks. These results indicate that the PID serves as a potent and specific inhibitor of group A kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Group A Paks Are Required for PDGF, but Not EGF or Lysophosphatidic Acid, Stimulation of ERK—The ERK cascade is critical to many of the cellular responses to growth and motility signals. Two components of this cascade, c-Raf and Mek1, are thought to be targets of group A Pak kinase activity, suggesting that the loss of Pak activity might affect ERK activation. The cells were grown to ∼75% confluence in the presence of tetracycline and then transferred to serum-free DMEM ± tetracycline for 19–22 h prior to stimulation with growth factors. ERK activity was measured 5 min after growth factor stimulation, because maximal ERK activity was seen at this time point for most growth factors that we tested, and this property was not affected by PID expression (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, inhibition of group A kinase activity inhibited PDGF but not EGF or lysophosphatidic acid-mediated stimulation of ERK. Expression of the PID had no effect on the activation of Ras by either PDGF or EGF, indicating that this inhibitor does not interfere with proximal signaling from the these receptors (Fig. 3B). The inability of PID expression to inhibit EGF activation of ERK was not due to overstimulating cells with excess growth factor, because similar effects were seen even at the lowest concentrations of EGF (Fig. 3C). These results, combined with those in Fig. 2, show that group A Pak activity is required for ERK activation downstream of the PDGF, but not the EGF receptor, and suggest that these two receptors employ different strategies to activate ERK. As an independent check on the PID approach, we also performed gene knockdown experiments, using siRNA pools against Pak1, Pak2, or both together. For these experiments, we used HeLa in place of NIH-3T3 cells, because of their ease of transfection. Transfection with siRNA pools directed against human Pak1 gave potent and selective knockdown of this protein (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Pak2 siRNAs yielded knockdown of Pak2. When transfected together, the Pak1 and Pak2 siRNA pools caused a marked decrease in the expression levels of both these proteins. Having established that these siRNA pools are potent and selective, we tested their effect on ERK activation by EGF and PDGF. As in NIH-3T3 cells, Erk was strongly activated by EGF and by PDGF in HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of Pak1 or Pak2 alone had little effect; however, simultaneous knockdown of both proteins selectively reduced ERK activation by PDGF but not by EGF. These results are consistent with those obtained in NIH-3T3 cells using the PID fragment to simultaneously reduce the function of all group A Paks. Further, these data show that Pak1 and Pak2 are likely to share overlapping function in ERK activation, and that, in cells expressing these two forms of Pak, both must be inhibited to block ERK activation by PDGF, but that neither are required for ERK activation by EGF. Group A Paks Are Selectively Required for PDGF-mediated Activation of Mek, Unrelated to Its Effects on Mek Ser298 Phosphorylation—The results above indicate that Pak1 is required for PDGF, but not EGF stimulation of ERK. We next examined the upstream kinase required for ERK activation, Mek. Mek1 is particularly interesting, because this protein has been reported to be a direct substrate for Pak1, and the phosphorylation of Mek1 by Pak1 at Ser298 is thought to be required for Mek1 activation (10Slack-Davis J.K. Eblen S.T. Zecevic M. Boerner S.A. Tarcsafalvi A. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. Catling A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 11Eblen S. Slack J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As with ERK, we found that expression of the PID resulted in a PDGF-specific ∼70% reduction in Mek1 activation, as assessed by phosphorylation of Mek1 at Ser217/221 (Fig. 5A). We also confirmed these results using an siRNA approach. Combined knockdown of Pak1 and Pak2 in HeLa cells prevented Mek activation by PDGF but not by EGF (Fig. 5B). We then examined the effect of PID expression on Mek1 Ser298 phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, we found that Mek1 activity and Mek1 Ser298 phosphorylation were not coupled. In control cells, Mek1 was heavily phosphorylated at Ser298 under basal and growth factor-stimulated conditions, and expression of the PID blocked this phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). These results are consistent with the idea that Paks act as Mek Ser298 kinases in vivo but cast doubt on the relevance of this phosphorylation to growth factor-mediated activation of Mek and ERK. Group A Paks Are Required for Ser338 Phosphorylation of c-Raf—To investigate whether the reduced Mek1 activity in cells expressing the PID is due to defects in c-Raf activation, we examined the phosphorylation status and activity of c-Raf. Both PDGF and EGF promoted phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338, as determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific sera (Fig. 6A). Expression of the PID strongly inhibited this phosphorylation by either growth factor, consistent with the notion that group A Paks are required for the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338. Interestingly, in the case of EGF, the phosphorylation of c-Raf at this site did not strictly correlate with enzymatic activity, as assessed by immune complex protein kinase assay. PDGF activated c-Raf ∼8-fold; this activation was inhibited about 40% by the PID (Fig. 6B). In contrast, EGF had a more modest stimulatory effect on c-Raf; this effect was not significantly inhibited by the PID. If Paks are required for efficient phosphorylation and activation of c-Raf by PDGF, then expression of an appropriate phosphomimic c-Raf mutant should bypass this requirement. PID-expressing cells were transfected with a constitutively activated form of c-Raf (21Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and assayed for ERK activity under basal and growth factor-stimulated conditions. This activated form of Raf stimulated ERK activity, and the stimulation was unaffected by PID expression (Fig. 7). These results show that the PID acts primarily at the level of Raf, either by interfering with its catalytic activity and/or its ability to couple to downstream effectors. A number of groups have shown that group A Paks can phosphorylate Mek1 at Ser298 and c-Raf at Ser338. In the case of Mek1, the Ser298 phosphorylation is thought to increase the affinity of Mek for ERK and/or c-Raf (11Eblen S. Slack J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), thus assisting in activation of the cascade. In fibroblasts, such phosphorylation has been reported to be essential for activation of ERK in response to growth factor and integrin signals. In the case of c-Raf, phosphorylation at Ser338 is thought to relieve autoinhibition (8Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, there is substantial controversy regarding the role of Paks in the ERK cascade. For this reason, we reassessed the function of endogenous group A Paks in this signaling pathway using a loss of function technique. Using two independent approaches, a peptide inhibitor and siRNA, we found that group A Pak activity is required for ERK activation by PDGF but not by EGF. This result is surprising, because the receptors for PDGF and EGF are thought to use similar mechanisms to activate the ERK cascade. However, recent studies have indicated that the signaling mechanisms activated by these receptors are distinct. For example, Mann's group has recently shown that the phosphorylation profile elicited by PDGF is substantially different from that elicited by EGF (27Kratchmarova I. Blagoev B. Haack-Sorensen M. Kassem M. Mann M. Science. 2005; 308: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that PDGF-dependent ERK inhibition is mirrored by reduced Mek Ser217/221 phosphorylation, which is known to correlate with Mek activity (28Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, this inhibition is not due to the loss of Mek1 phosphorylation on Ser298. Under all of the conditions tested, expression of the PID strongly suppressed Mek1 Ser298 phosphorylation, but this suppression did not correlate with Mek activity. Thus, our data confirm that Pak activity is required for Mek1 Ser298 phosphorylation but also show that phosphorylation at this site is not required for ERK activation by EGF. These results are seemingly at odds with those of Slack-Davis et al. (10Slack-Davis J.K. Eblen S.T. Zecevic M. Boerner S.A. Tarcsafalvi A. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. Catling A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and Edin and Juliano (29Edin M.L. Juliano R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4466-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who have reported that Pak-mediated phosphorylation of Mek1 Ser298 and c-Raf Ser338 is essential for adhesion signal propagation to ERK in NIH-3T3 cells. It is possible that the requirement for Pak-mediated Mek1 Ser298 phosphorylation applies to integrin-generated signals but not to growth factor-generated signals. Reduced Mek activation in PID expressing cells is likely to be the result of the reduced ability of c-Raf to phosphorylate Mek. c-Raf kinase activity and Ser338 phosphorylation in response to PDGF are both reduced by reduction of group A kinase activity; however, the reduced c-Raf activity is still nearly equal to that seen with EGF stimulation (Fig. 6B). Why then, are PDGF stimulation or Mek and Erk so severely affected? It is know that Raf activity in vitro is often not strictly correlated with its effects on signaling. For example, some transforming mutants of v-Raf are less active than the wild-type kinase (30Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Project. C.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). In such cases, it is thought that changes in Raf complexes (e.g. with c-Raf) mediate the effects on signaling. It is possible that, rather than its mild inhibitory effects on c-Raf kinase activity, the loss of Pak function has a greater effect on the ability of PDGF-stimulated c-Raf to efficiently couple to Mek, perhaps by affecting its interactions with other Raf members or with specific scaffolding proteins. This latter possibility is strongly supported by the recent report that the Mek scaffolding protein MP1 regulates Pak-dependent ERK activation by adhesion but is not required for ERK activation by PDGF (31Pullikuth A. McKinnon E. Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5119-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of PDGF, our results suggest that PDGF activates Pak and that, in this setting, Pak-dependent phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338 is required for activation of the ERK cascade in fibroblasts. In the case of EGF, loss of group A Pak activity inhibits the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338, but, in contrast to the results with PDGF, c-Raf activity is nearly unaffected. These findings suggests that c-Raf activation in response to EGF circumvents the requirement for Ser338 phosphorylation. As discussed above, these results may indicate that different scaffold proteins engage c-Raf when cells are activated by PDGF versus EGF. To date, the contribution of Paks to c-Raf activation have relied predominantly on the use of inhibitors of Pak activators or dominant negative alleles of Pak or Rac/Cdc42 (32Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Wortmannin and LY294002, established PI3K inhibitors, have been used as means to inhibit Pak (14Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), because Pak activation is thought to rely on a Ras to PI3K to Cdc42 or Rac pathway (33Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34Nosaka Y.A. Arai A. Kanda E. Akasaki T. Sumimoto H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In cells treated with such inhibitors, Ser338 phosphorylation of c-Raf was retained even under conditions in which PI3K and downstream signaling molecules such as Pak were strongly inhibited, prompting the conclusion that Ser338 phosphorylation of c-Raf is independent of Pak (14Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, because PI3K inhibitors inhibit a protein several steps upstream of Pak and also because Pak can be activated by a variety of different mechanisms, the use of such inhibitors is not ideal for this purpose. On the other hand, dominant negative (kinase-dead) alleles of Pak have been used to support the notion that Paks are required for c-Raf Ser338 phosphorylation, but these results are difficult to interpret because of the propensity of overexpressed, dominant negative molecules to sequester limiting signaling components. This is likely to be true for Paks, which bind SH3 proteins such as Nck, Grb2, and PIX; GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac; and a host of other signaling proteins. Because the PID is not known to bind any proteins besides Pak itself, we believe the results obtained by this approach are less subject to misinterpretation. In addition, our siRNA data show that Pak1 and Pak2 are likely to share a common function in ERK activation and that both must be inhibited to elicit this signaling defect. The regulation of c-Raf kinase activity is complex and involves a variety of different regulatory mechanisms (32Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 35Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). The Ser338 and Tyr340/341 sites that are thought to be targeted by Pak and Src, respectively, are critical to the activation of c-Raf. The proximity of these sites and the results of a variety of different mutational studies suggest that these two sites operate, either in isolation or cooperatively, to relieve Raf autoinhibition (36Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Chong H. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36269-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by early observations that truncation of the C terminus leads to constitutively activation of c-Raf. The interdependence of these sites is not entirely clear, because early results suggested that mutationally inactivating Ser338 prevented c-Raf activation by Src, but more recent results have suggested that c-Raf activation by either site can occur independently of the other site. For example, Alavi et al. (16Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two pro-angiogenic factors both activate Raf but do so by different mechanisms; basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates c-Raf by a Pak and Ser338-dependent mechanism, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates c-Raf in a Src and Tyr340/341-dependent mechanism. In each case the specificity of the phosphorylations was nearly absolute; very little vascular endothelial growth factor-induced c-Raf Ser338 phosphorylation or basic fibroblast growth factor-induced Tyr340/341 phosphorylation was observed. However, another recent report showed that permeabilized cells loaded with GTP activate c-Raf by a mechanism that does not require Ser338 phosphorylation (13Oehrl W. Rubio I. Wetzker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17819-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In light of the work by Alavi et al. (16Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), a possible explanation for these seemingly contradictory reports is that GTP loading of permeabilized cells promotes the Src-dependent activation of c-Raf. These results suggest that, although Ser338 phosphorylation correlates well with Pak-dependent c-Raf activation, Ser338 phosphorylation is clearly dispensable for c-Raf activation by certain stimuli. If so, these results also mean that phospho-specific Ser338 antibodies might not be generally useful as a surrogate marker for Raf activation. Despite these reservations, whether Ser338 phosphorylation is required for maximal activation of c-Raf still remains to be determined. In the works cited above, Src-mediated activation of Raf was shown occur without Ser338 phosphorylation, but whether c-Raf would be further activated by Ser338 phosphorylation remains an unanswered question. If the two regulatory sites are indeed cooperative with respect to relieving autoinhibition, it is conceivable that variants of c-Raf in which both sites are phosphorylated may be less autoinhibited than if either single site is phosphorylated. From a therapeutic standpoint, our findings have important implications. Many human malignancies depend on elevated ERK signaling. If Pak is required for full activation of ERK, small molecule inhibitors of Pak might be useful in cancer treatment. However, our results show that the requirement for Pak varies depending on which growth factor receptor is activated. Thus, a tumor driven by an EGF receptor pathway (e.g. many nonsmall cell lung cancers) might be resistant to anti-Pak therapy, whereas a tumor driven by PDGF receptor (e.g. many glial tumors, subsets of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and chronic monomyelocytic leukemias) might be sensitive to such treatment. For these reasons, as well as the intrinsic importance of better understanding how Raf is regulated, the studies described herein could have an impact on our understanding of mitogenic signal transduction and on future therapeutic strategies.

At least 99% of protein phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells occurs on Ser and Thr residues.

In the case of PP2A, the predominant holoenzyme is formed by association of a core dimer of catalytic and scaffold subunits with one of a least 12 regulatory subunits in vertebrates. Since vertebrate A and C subunits are each encoded by two genes and since many regulatory subunits are diversified by alternative splicing, several dozen different PP2A heterotrimers are likely to exist in any given cell type. The three unrelated regulatory subunit gene families (B, B′, B″) are almost certain to utilize different mechanisms to control enzymatic activity and cellular localization of PP2A. The B-family (PR55) of regulatory subunits consists of predicted β-propellers with divergent N-terminal tails that act as subcellular targeting signals (3Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. Strack S.

Here, we have begun to dissect the contribution of different PP2A holoenzymes to growth factor signaling in PC12 cells. The net effect of total PP2A silencing or inhibition was ERK and Akt hyperphosphorylation, most likely as a consequence of direct dephosphorylation of these kinases by PP2A. Cautioning against exclusive reliance on silencing approaches, protracted inhibition of PP2A by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a compensatory uncoupling of growth factor receptors from their kinase effectors. A combination of mutant Aα subunit exchange, regulatory subunit RNAi, and in vitro dephosphorylation assays indicated that PP2A/B′ heterotrimers regulate Akt, whereas PP2A/Bα and Bδ directly dephosphorylate ERKs. Cell Culture—Parental PC6-3 cells were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse and 5% fetal bovine serum (both heat-inactivated). Aα-RNAi cell medium was supplemented with 2 μg/ml blasticidin and 200 μg/ml G418 to maintain tetracycline repressor and inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA constructs, respectively. Medium of Aα-exchange cells additionally included 200 μg/ml hygromycin for selection of the inducible Aα DTP177AAA construct (19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol.

COS-M6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum.

Polyclonal antibodies against B′α and B′β were a gift from David Virshup (University of Utah), and the polyclonal PR59 antibody was from Egon Ogris (Vienna Biocenter). Commercial sources of antibodies were as follows: FLAG epitope (M2 and its agarose conjugate, Sigma); PP2A catalytic subunit (Pharmingen); total ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-Ser-473 Akt, total Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-Smad1/5/8, phospho-Tyr-1045 epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); phospho-Tyr (4G10) and total EGF receptor (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Other Reagents—Rat nerve growth factor (NGF, 2.5 S), mouse EGF, and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Sigma, and Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel), respectively. Growth factors were stored at –20 °C in lyophilized aliquots and dissolved to 100× in medium prior to use. Okadaic acid and microcystin-LR were purchased from Alexis (Lausanne, Switzerland). Plasmids encoding FLAG-ERK2, Ha-Ras V12, the EGF receptor, and FLAG-B″/PR72 were donated by Phillip Stork (Vollum Institute), Jeffrey Pessin (State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook), Nancy Lill (University of Iowa), and Eric Cohen (University of Montreal), respectively. pFC-MEK1, a plasmid encoding constitutively active MEK1 (S218,222D), was supplied as part of the PathDetect Elk1 trans-reporting system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The coding sequence for rat B′β was isolated from rat brain RNA by the reverse-transcriptase-PCR (sequence deposited in GenBank™ as AY251278). FLAG epitope tags were added via PCR to the N terminus of B′β and to the C terminus of Bα and Bδ followed by ligation of PCR products into the pcDNA5/TO expression vector (Invitrogen). MAPK Reporter Assays—The PathDetect Elk1 trans-reporting system was modified for the dual-luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) to quantify ERK activation according to the manufacturers' instructions. PC6-3 cells were plated at 100,000–150,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected 24 h later in triplicate using Lipofectamine 2000 (BD Biosciences). Aα-RNAi and Aα-exchange cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/well reporter plasmid mix (by mass: 92.5% pFR-Luc, 5% pFA2-Elk1, 2.5% pRL-SV40) and 0.5–2 ng/well activator plasmid (Ha-Ras V12, MEK1 S218,222D) or pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Doxycycline (1 μg/ml) or 0.1% ethanol vehicle was added at the same time. PC6-3 cells subjected to transient RNAi were transfected with 0.25 μg/well pSUPER-based plasmids (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar) expressing shRNAs, 0.25 μg/well reporter plasmid mix, and 0.5 ng/well MEK1 S218,222D. After 3 days, cells were preincubated for 1 h in medium with one-tenth original serum concentration ±300 nm okadaic acid (OA) followed by 5–6 h of stimulation with growth factors as indicated. Cultures were lysed and subjected to dual-luciferase assays using a Berthold Sirius tube luminometer. Photinus and Renilla luciferase activity ratios were expressed relative to basal conditions without ERK activator plasmids or growth factor stimulation. Quantitative Immunoblotting with Phospho-specific Antibodies—Aα-RNAi or Aα-exchange cells were seeded at 150,000 cell/well in 24-well plates, in some experiments transfected with EGF receptor plasmids, and treated ±doxycycline (Dox) for 3 days. Cells were serum-starved ±300 nm OA for at least 2 h prior to adding growth factors at staggered times. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested in SDS sample buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 1 μm microcystin-LR, and lysates were probe tip-sonicated to shear the DNA. Protein concentrations were determined by a dot blot assay and normalized prior to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer of samples to nitrocellulose membranes. Enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) images were captured using a Kodak Imager 440, and band intensities were quantified with the ImageJ software gel analyzer plug-in. Phospho-specific antibody signals were divided by total protein antibody signals to control for loading differences. All signal intensities scaled linearly with the amount of lysate loaded. RNAi of Bα and Bδ—Double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding shRNAs were ligated into the H1 promoter-driven pSUPER plasmid as described (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). The following sequences were targeted for RNAi: Bα (α3), 5′-AATCCAGTCTCATAGCAGAGG-3′; Bα (α4), 5′-AAGTGGCAAGCGAAAGAAAGA-3′; Bδ (δ1), 5′-AACAGAATGCTGCTCATTTTC-3′; Bδ (δ2), 5′-AACACTCGGAGGGATGTTACA-3′. [32P]ERK2 Dephosphorylation Assays—2 × 106 COS-M6 cells were plated into a 100-mm dish and cotransfected 24 h later with 10.8 μgof FLAG-ERK2 and 1.2 μg of MEK1 S218,222D plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. After 3 days, cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h with 0.6 mCi/ml 32PO42− (ICN, Irvine, CA) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine). Debris was pelleted (20,000 × g, 15 min), and 32P-labeled FLAG-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate using FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose (3 h at 4 °C). Beads were washed once with 2 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and four times with 2 ml of immuno-precipitation buffer lacking phosphatase inhibitors. PP2A heterotrimers containing FLAG-tagged regulatory subunits were immunoisolated from COS-M6 as described (4Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). [32P]ERK2 and PP2A FLAG-immunoprecipitates were stored at –20 °C in buffer containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA for up to 1 week. PP2A preparations were adjusted for equal catalytic subunit content after quantitative immunoblotting. For phosphatase assays, 32P-labeled FLAG-ERK2 beads (∼10,000 cpm/reaction) were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin. FLAG peptide (50 μg/ml) was added to dissociate FLAG-tagged substrate and phosphatase from the antibody beads for more efficient dephosphorylation. Reactions were started by the addition of 20 μl of diluted [32P]ERK2 substrate to 5 μl of PP2A holoenzyme preparation, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with intermittent agitation on an Eppendorf shaking incubator and then terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). Following centrifugation at 22,000 × g acid-soluble 32PO42− was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Percent ERK2 dephosphorylation was calculated after subtraction of counts from a “blank” reaction containing, instead of PP2A, immunoprecipitates from a mock transfection. PP2A Modulates the MAPK Cascade at the Level of ERK—Inducible knockdown of Aα, the principal PP2A scaffold subunit, promotes apoptosis in PC6-3 cells, a subline of neuronal PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. The loss of viability of Aα-RNAi cells starts 4 days after induction by Dox and is associated with attenuated Akt phosphorylation in response to EGF treatment (19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Viability, as well as growth factor responsiveness, are rescued by constitutive or inducible expression of an RNAi-resistant Aα cDNA (Ref. 19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and data not shown). To further explore the effect of Aα silencing on growth factor signaling, ERK/MAPK reporter assays were carried out in Aα-RNAi cells treated ±Dox for 3 days to induce shRNA expression, which results in 20–25% inhibition of PP2A activity (19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cultures were also treated for 5 h with 300 nm okadaic acid to acutely inhibit PP2A. At this concentration, okadaic acid is a selective inhibitor of PP2A, and possibly, the related PP4, PP5, and PP6 catalytic subunits in intact cells (39Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 40Honkanen R.E. Golden T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2055-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid increased MAPK reporter activation dramatically (170 ± 41-fold, n = 3), whereas Aα silencing had a more modest, but still significant, effect (2.7 ± 0.3-fold, n = 3; Fig. 1A). Similar effects were observed by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for ERK1/2 dually phosphorylated on Thr and Tyr residues in the activation loop (Fig. 1A). To determine the level at which PP2A inhibits the MAPK cascade, cells were transfected with constitutively active Ras (oncogenic Ha-Ras V12) or MEK1 (S218,222D). Plasmid concentrations were titrated to achieve 100–150-fold reporter activation over empty vector transfected cells. Okadaic acid and Aα silencing stimulated ERK activity further, to about 600- and 400-fold above basal, respectively (Fig. 1B). Importantly, Ras V12 and MEK1 S218,222D-induced reporter activations were equivalently augmented by disabling the phosphatase. The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that PP2A inhibits the ERK/MAPK cascade predominantly at the level of the terminal kinases, the ERKs. PP2A Silencing Attenuates, whereas PP2A Inhibition Promotes Growth Factor-dependent Akt and ERK Phosphorylation—To further investigate the loss of EGF responsiveness following Aα silencing (19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), Aα-RNAi cells were pretreated with okadaic acid or Dox as before followed by stimulation with various growth factors. EGF stimulation led to transient activation of Akt (detected with a phospho-Ser-473 specific antibody) and ERK, both peaking at 5 min (Fig. 2A). Okadaic acid potentiated basal as well as EGF-stimulated Akt and ERK phosphorylation, whereas Aα silencing attenuated phosphorylation of both kinases. Opposite effects of PP2A inhibition and knockdown were also observed on FGF2- and NGF-stimulated Akt and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B and not shown). On the other hand, phosphorylation of the transcription factors Smad1/5/8 following stimulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2 Ser/Thr kinase receptors was unaffected by either manipulation of PP2A, demonstrating specificity for receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (Fig. 2C). ERK/MAPK reporter assays confirmed that although okadaic acid stimulated growth factor-dependent transcriptional activity by 4–20-fold, Aα knockdown resulted in a paradoxical loss of responsiveness to EGF, FGF2, and NGF (∼50%, Fig. 2D). This blunted reporter activation was observed over a wide range of EGF and NGF concentrations (Fig. 2, E and F). A detailed time course of NGF-dependent Akt and ERK phosphorylation was examined in ±Dox-treated Aα-RNAi cells (representative immunoblot in Fig. 3A, quantification of three independent experiments in Fig. 3, B and C). Aα knockdown decreased peak ERK and Akt phosphorylation somewhat and had a dramatic effect on the sustained phase of NGF signaling. The diminished responsiveness of growth factor signaling cascades following Aα-RNAi not only contrasted with the effects of pharmacological PP2A inhibition but also with the increase in basal and constitutively active Ras/MEK1-dependent ERK activity seen after Aα knockdown (Fig. 1). It was therefore most likely that the blunted growth factor response reflects a cellular adaptation to a chronic decrease in PP2A activity, presumably mediated by feedback of the disinhibited kinases. Aα-RNAi Uncouples EGF Receptor Activation from Downstream Signaling—To pinpoint the site of this compensatory response to Aα silencing, the activation state of the EGF receptor was assessed. Low expression levels (<30,000 receptors/cell in parental PC12 cells (41Chandler L.P. Chandler C.E. Hosang M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3360-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) precluded an analysis of the endogenous EGF receptor. Instead, Aα-RNAi cells were transfected with EGF receptor plasmids at a concentration that preserved the ligand dependence of Tyr phosphorylation. Although Akt and ERK stimulation by EGF was blunted as before, Aα knockdown had no effect on expression levels of the EGF receptor, total Tyr phosphorylation, or phosphorylation of Tyr-1045, an autophosphorylation site that recruits the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase c-Cbl (42Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Thus, Aα silencing attenuated growth factor-dependent ERK and Akt phosphorylation downstream of the EGF receptor. Since Aα silencing stimulated oncogenic Ras-dependent ERK activation (Fig. 1B), compensatory uncoupling may occur at the level of receptor tyrosine kinase adaptor proteins or guanylate exchange factors. B′-family Regulatory Subunits Mediate Akt Modulation by PP2A—The observation that PP2A keeps both Akt and ERK signaling in check raised the question whether different PP2A regulatory subunits might be involved. If so, cells would have the ability to throttle the output of both kinase cascades independently. Aα-exchange PC6-3 cell lines were previously generated in which Dox treatment silences the endogenous Aα subunit, concomitant with expression of an RNAi-resistant Aα subunit mutant defective in binding to select regulatory subunit families (19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In Aα(+-+)-exchange cells, wild-type Aα is replaced with the Aα DTP177AAA mutant, which binds to B and B″ but not B′ subunits (19Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Quantitative Aα subunit exchange is evident not only as the disappearance of wild-type Aα and appearance of the epitope-tagged, slightly larger mutant but also as the selective loss of B′α and B′β protein after 3 days in Dox (Fig. 5B) because monomeric B′ (and B) family subunits are unstable in cells (5Strack S.

https://openalex.org/W2114854701,"Attention can facilitate visual processing, emphasizing specific locations and highlighting stimuli containing specific features. To dissociate the mechanisms of spatial and feature-based attention, we compared the time course of visually evoked responses under different attention conditions. We recorded from single neurons in area V4 during a delayed match-to-sample task that controlled both spatial and feature-based attention. Neuronal responses increased when spatial attention was directed toward the receptive field and were modulated by the identity of the target of feature-based attention. Modulation by spatial attention was weaker during the early portion of the visual response and stronger during the later portion of the response. In contrast, modulation by feature-based attention was relatively constant throughout the response. It appears that stimulus onset transients disrupt spatial attention, but not feature attention. We conclude that spatial attention reflects a combination of stimulus-driven and goal-driven processes, while feature-based attention is purely goal driven."
https://openalex.org/W2156138194,"The mechanisms contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as the protective pathways of the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS), are incompletely understood. In a kallikrein-overexpressing rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy, we investigated the involvement of inflammatory pathways, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Six weeks after STZ injection, impairment of left ventricular (LV) function parameters measured by a Millar-tip catheter (peak LV systolic pressure; dP/dtmax; dP/dtmin) was accompanied by a significant increment of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (CAMs) expression, as well as of beta2-leukocyte-integrins+ (CD18+, CD11a+, CD11b+) and cytokine (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta)-expressing infiltrates in male Sprague-Dawley (SD-STZ) rats compared with normoglycemic littermates. Furthermore, SD-STZ rats demonstrated a significant impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by acetylcholine and significantly increased plasma TBARS (plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) levels as a measure of oxidative stress. These diabetic cardiomyopathy-associated alterations were significantly attenuated (P<0.05) in diabetic transgenic rats expressing the human kallikrein 1 (hKLK1) gene with STZ-induced diabetes. CAMs expression, beta2-leukocyte-integrins+, and cytokine-expressing infiltrates correlated significantly with all evaluated LV function parameters. The multiple protective effects of the KKS in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy comprise the inhibition of intramyocardial inflammation (CAMs expression, beta2-leukocyte-integrins+ infiltration and cytokine expression), an improvement of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the attenuation of oxidative stress. These insights might have therapeutic implications also for human diabetic cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2045595107,"Sensory neurons with related functions form ganglia, but how these precisely positioned clusters are assembled has been unclear. Here, we use the zebrafish trigeminal sensory ganglion as a model to address this question. We find that some trigeminal sensory neurons are born at the position where the ganglion is assembled, whereas others are born at a distance and have to migrate against opposing morphogenetic movements to reach the site of ganglion assembly. Loss of Cxcr4b-mediated chemokine signaling results in the formation of mispositioned ganglia. Conversely, ectopic sources of the chemokine SDF1a can attract sensory neurons. Transplantation experiments reveal that neuron-neuron interaction and the adhesion molecules E- and N-Cadherin also contribute to ganglion assembly. These results indicate that ganglion formation depends on the interplay of birthplace, chemokine attraction, cell-cell interaction, and cadherin-mediated adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2018054347,"Insulin resistance is a primary characteristic of type 2 diabetes and likely causally related to the pathogenesis of the disease. It is a result of defects in signal transduction from the cell surface receptor of insulin to target effects. We found that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of serine 307 (corresponding to serine 302 in the murine sequence) in the immediate downstream mediator protein of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), is required for efficient insulin signaling and that this phosphorylation is attenuated in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of serine 307 phosphorylation by rapamycin mimicked type 2 diabetes and reduced the sensitivity of IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin, while stimulation of the phosphorylation by okadaic acid, in cells from patients with type 2 diabetes, rescued cells from insulin resistance. EC50 for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of serine 307 was about 0.2 nm with a t1/2 of about 2 min. The amount of IRS1 was similar in cells from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects. These findings identify a molecular mechanism for insulin resistance in non-selected patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is a primary characteristic of type 2 diabetes and likely causally related to the pathogenesis of the disease.

These findings identify a molecular mechanism for insulin resistance in non-selected patients with type 2 diabetes. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is rapidly increasing in all parts of the world that allows a sedentary and affluent lifestyle, as the disease is closely associated with obesity. It has been estimated that over 200 million people will be afflicted with the disease by the end of this decade. The pathogenesis of diabetes is not understood in any great detail, but it is generally believed that insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and especially in adipose tissue is an early, if not primary, event. The peripheral insulin resistance is compensated for by increased concentrations of circulating insulin, masking development to diabetes. Eventually the pancreatic β-cells fail to compensate for the insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed. The insulin resistance of muscle and fat tissues is the result of impaired signal transduction from the cell surface receptor of insulin to metabolic effects, such as to increase glucose transport and inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar, 2Birnbaum M.J. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 108: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar). Recently, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 was shown to be the first signaling step to exhibit reduced sensitivity to insulin in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes (3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The finding depended on the realization that adipocytes obtained from human beings become insulin-resistant from the surgical cell isolation procedures and that the resistance is reversed by overnight incubation of the cells (3Danielsson A.

This insulin resistance is manifest downstream of IRS1, and if cells from diabetic patients are not allowed to recover overnight the mix of two different types of insulin resistance will be examined. IRS1 has also been identified as a key step in insulin resistance of human skeletal muscle (4Goodyear L. Giorgino F. Sherman L. Carey J. Smith R. Dohm G. J. Clin.

Recently, phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine 302 in murine 32D cells (corresponding to serine 307 in human IRS1) was reported to be stimulated by insulin and abolishing of this phosphorylation by introduction of an alanine residue in place of serine 302 impaired insulin-stimulated tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of IRS1 (26Giraud J.

Herein we have examined the effect of IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation on IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin and the ability of insulin to induce phosphorylation of serine 307 in primary adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects—Subject characteristics are described in the respective figure legends. Informed consent from patients and approval by the Ethics Committee were obtained. Materials—Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-IRS1 and goat anti-actin-(1–19) polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-phospho-serine 307-IRS1 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Insulin, rapamycin, okadaic acid, and other chemicals were from Sigma or as indicated in the text. Isolation and Incubation of Adipocytes—Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained as described in the figure legends to Figs. 1 and 4. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase (type 1, Worthington) digestion as described (28Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Tissue pieces from biopsies performed with local anesthesia using xylocain were extensively washed in large volumes of 0.15 m NaCl before digestion with collagenase. At a final concentration of 100 μl packed cell volume per ml, cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution (0.12 m NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.40, 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 nm phenylisopropyladenosine, 0.5 unit·ml–1 adenosine deaminase with 2 mm glucose, at 37 °C on a shaking water bath. For analysis after 20–24-h incubation cells were incubated at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in the same solution mixed with an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% (w/v) albumin, 200 nm phenylisopropyladenosine, 20 mm Hepes, 50 UI/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.40 (3Danielsson A.

Before analysis cells were washed and transferred to the Krebs-Ringer solution.FIGURE 4Effects of okadaic acid on insulin-resistant adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. Abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes were obtained from Caucasian male type 2 diabetic subjects (61 ± 2 years; BMI: 36 ± 4 kg/m2, HbA1c: 5.9 ± 0.2%) after local anesthesia with xylocain and needle biopsy through the skin. Cells were incubated with (filled circles) or without (open circles) 1 μm okadaic acid for 15 min when insulin at the indicated concentration was added for 10 min, and cells were analyzed for IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (mean ± S.E., n = 4 subjects).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Cell incubations were terminated by separating cells from medium by centrifugation through dinonylphtalate. To minimize postincubation signaling modifications in the cells and protein modifications during immunoprecipitation, the cells were immediately dissolved in SDS and β-mercaptoethanol with protease and protein phosphatase inhibitors, frozen within 10 s, and thawed in boiling water (28Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cells as determined by lipocrit, which is total cell volume, was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. After SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies that were detected using ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG as secondary antibody and evaluated by chemiluminescence imaging (Las 1000, Image-Gauge, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). By two-dimensional electrofocusing, pH 3–10, SDS-PAGE analysis, and immunoblotting against phosphotyrosine and IRS1, >95% of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 180-kDa band was determined to represent IRS1 (3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of IRS1 Serine 307—In primary subcutaneous adipocytes from a group of non-diabetic subjects insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine 307 (Fig. 1A), thus establishing the physiological relevance of this phosphorylation event in primary human cells. However, in adipocytes from an unselected group of obese female (Fig. 1, B and C) or male (Fig. 1D) patients with type 2 diabetes this insulin-induced serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1 was curtailed, suggesting its involvement in the disease. In these same diabetic patients the insulin-stimulated steady-state phosphorylation of IRS1 on tyrosine was inhibited at submaximal insulin concentrations (cf. Ref. 3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; Fig. 2). Amount of IRS1 in Cells—It has been suggested that the amount of IRS1 protein is reduced in adipocytes from patients with diabetes (12Carvalho E. Jansson P. Axelsen M. Eriksson J. Huang X. Groop L. Rondinone C. Sjöström L. Smith U. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2173-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We found the amount of IRS1 protein to be identical in the adipocytes from the group of patients with type 2 diabetes and the non-diabetic control group (Fig. 1E). However, it can be noted that inter-individual variations were large, thus minor differences in the mean value may not have been revealed. Dose Response and Time Course for Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of Serine 307—Serine 307 was phosphorylated in response to insulin in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 = 0.2 nm in cells from non-diabetic control subjects (Fig. 3A). This is considerably more insulin-sensitive than the insulin receptor autophosphorylation (EC50 = 1–2 nm) (3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) indicating a downstream effect involving enzymatic signal amplification by e.g. additional protein kinases; for comparison see Ref. 3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. Time course studies in cells from non-diabetic control subjects demonstrated a half-maximal phosphorylation of serine 307 after about 2 min (Fig. 3B), which was slower than the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, exhibiting half-maximal effect already within 1 min (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation of Serine 307 in Cells from Diabetics Makes Cells Insulin-sensitive—The phosphoserine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid completely inhibits protein phosphatase-2A at 1 nm and protein phosphatase-1 at 1 μm concentrations in intact cells, including adipocytes (29Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid enhanced the phosphorylation of serine 307 in adipocytes from control subjects and also caused a general increase in the extent of serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS1 as indicated by a shift in its gel mobility (data not shown). In adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes okadaic acid enhanced the phosphorylation of serine 307 on average 1.7 ± 0.4-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 4) and at the same time enhanced the sensitivity to insulin for tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of IRS1 (Fig. 4). It is interesting that okadaic acid has been reported to enhance insulin-induced glucose uptake by human adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes (30Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Rondinone C.M. Carvalho E. Smith U. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Serine 307 Phosphorylation in Cells from Control Subjects Makes Cells Insulin-resistant—Rapamycin has been reported to inhibit insulin-induced phosphorylation of the corresponding residue (serine 302) in mouse 32D myeloid cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts (26Giraud J. Leshan R. Lee Y-H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3447-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S.

In the human adipocytes from non-diabetic subjects in which insulin increased the phosphorylation of serine 307, this increase was inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 5A). Importantly, rapamycin inhibition of phosphorylation at serine 307 impeded insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS1 on tyrosine residues, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity (Fig. 5B) without affecting the maximal response (data not shown). Thus rapamycin inhibited serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1 and concomitantly transformed the cells into a diabetes-like phenotype (3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Rapamycin has been found to enhance insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in adipocytes (32Takano A. Usui I. Haruta T. Kawahara J. Uno T. Iwata M. Iwata M. Iwata T. Kawahara J. Uno T. Iwata M. Kobayashi M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5050-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Tremblay F. Gagnon A.M. Veilleux A. Sorisky A. Marette A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), demonstrating other effects of rapamycin downstream of IRS1 (34Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar), which makes it impossible to extend the analysis of rapamycin effects on serine 307 phosphorylation in human adipocytes to effects on glucose transport (Fig. 5C). This is a first demonstration of a critical function of serine phosphorylation of IRS1 in primary human cells that also are target cells for insulin. More important, in two separate unselected groups of patients with type 2 diabetes these findings identify a mechanism with the potential to explain the insulin resistance of the disease: a curtailed phosphorylation of serine 307 reduces the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 at physiological concentrations of insulin. Type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic component, and it therefore appears that different genetic traits, providing susceptibility to the disease, may converge at curtailed phosphorylation of IRS1 on serine 307. We used two different approaches to manipulate serine 307 phosphorylation that yielded predicted effects on the sensitivity to tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin. (i) Phosphorylation of serine 307 by protein phosphatase inhibition in cells from patients with type 2 diabetes made the cells more insulin-sensitive, mimicking adipocytes from non-diabetic subjects. (ii) Inhibition of serine 307 phosphorylation by rapamycin in adipocytes from non-diabetic subjects made the cells insulin-resistant, mimicking cells from type 2 diabetic patients (3Danielsson A. Öst A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Rapamycin and okadaic acid affect the phosphorylation state of many phosphorylation sites in the cells. They do not, however, directly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS1, and they have entirely different mechanisms of action. In two different and opposite approaches, in normal and diabetic cells, the sensitivity of IRS1 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin was affected in a predicted manner. It is therefore reasonable to interpret these findings as supporting a cause-effect relationship between curtailed serine 307 phosphorylation and reduced insulin sensitivity in cells from patients with type 2 diabetes. To completely establish this it will be necessary to knock out wild-type IRS1 and replace it with serine 307 → alanine-mutated IRS1, to block phosphorylation, in normal adipocytes and with serine 307 → glutamate, to mimic phosphorylation, in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. It cannot be ruled out that additional sites are phosphorylated and cooperate with serine 307 to sensitize IRS1 to tyrosine phosphorylation. Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 302 to alanine in murine 32D cells, however, indicates that blocking the phosphorylation of this serine alone is enough to inhibit IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin (26Giraud J. Leshan R. Lee Y-H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3447-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The EC50 for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of serine 307 indicates downstream protein kinase activation. Serine 307 is located in a consensus sequence (RXRXXS/T) for phosphorylation by the downstream protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) (35Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The ability of rapamycin to inhibit the phosphorylation suggests the involvement of protein kinase mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) in relaying the phosphorylation. The rictor-mTOR complex has indeed very recently been demonstrated to activate PKB by phosphorylation of serine 473, thus complementing PDK1-catalyzed threonine 308 phosphorylation (34Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar). Rictor-mTOR does not seem to be acutely inhibited by rapamycin, but prolonged presence of the inhibitor may inhibit the kinase (34Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar). As a second potential candidate for serine 307 phosphorylation the insulin receptor and mTOR downstream p70 S6 kinase has been shown to effectively phosphorylate IRS1 on serine 307 in vitro (27Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebbholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of IRS1-serine 307 in murine cells (serine 312 in human cells) represents a negative feedback inhibition of prolonged insulin stimulation (23Greene M.W. Sakaue H. Wang L. Alessi D.R. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8199-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). This mechanism is clearly different from the acute insulin-induced phosphorylation of serine 307 in human adipocytes, which sensitizes IRS1 to activation by the insulin receptor. It should be stressed that earlier experiments describing negative (19Werner E.D. Lee J. Hansen L. Yuan M. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35298-35305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebbholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3447-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) effects of murine serine 302 phosphorylation (corresponding to human serine 307) on insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation have been performed in cell lines, whereas the findings herein are from primary human cells. The physiological feed-forward mechanism from insulin via a putative protein kinase mediating the serine 307 phosphorylation would be an example of sensitivity enhancement through positive feed-forward. The mechanism may be critical for maintaining insulin sensitivity in adipocytes of human beings. The delayed IRS1 serine 307 compared with tyrosine phosphorylation indicates that serine 307 phosphorylation is not required for the initial tyrosine phosphorylation but for the subsequently established steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation at physiological insulin concentrations, herein determined after 10 min. This could be achieved by inhibition of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase-catalyzed dephosphorylation of IRS1, as has been described for phosphorylation of the cluster of serines 265, 302, 325, and 358 (murine sequence) in IRS1 of CHO-T cells (36Paz K. Liu Y.F. Shorer H. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Quan M. Kanety H. Seger R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28816-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It will be important to establish whether this mechanism is operating in other target tissues of insulin such as muscle, liver, brain, and in islet β-cells. The protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) involved need to be defined and how they are controlled by insulin and the nature of the interference in type 2 diabetes. The inability of insulin to enhance the phosphorylation of serine 307 may be a distinguishing feature of insulin resistance and predict type 2 diabetes. The protein kinase(s) and the corresponding protein phosphatase(s) involved in controlling serine 307 phosphorylation are potential targets for novel pharmaceutical intervention. We thank Drs. Preben Kjolhede and Gheorghe Andreescu for supplying biopsies of adipose tissue. In particular we acknowledge the generosity of all diabetic and non-diabetic patients that volunteered to donate adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2133933397,"Peptide bond formation is the main catalytic function of the ribo-some. The mechanism of catalysis is presumed to be highly conserved in all organisms. We tested the conservation by comparing mechanistic features of the peptidyl transfer reaction on ribosomes from Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. In both cases, the major contribution to catalysis was the lowering of the activation entropy. The rate of peptide bond formation was pH independent with the natural substrate, amino-acyl-tRNA, but was slowed down 200-fold with decreasing pH when puromycin was used as a substrate analog. Mutation of the conserved base A2451 of 23 S rRNA to U did not abolish the pH dependence of the reaction with puromycin in M. smegmatis, suggesting that A2451 did not confer the pH dependence. However, the A2451U mutation alters the structure of the peptidyl transferase center and changes the pattern of pH-dependent rearrangements, as probed by chemical modification of 23 S rRNA. A2451 seems to function as a pivot point in ordering the structure of the peptidyl transferase center rather than taking part in chemical catalysis.

The active site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is located on the large (50 S) ribosomal subunit. High-resolution crystal structures of the 50 S subunit have revealed that the peptidyl transferase center is composed of RNA (23 S rRNA), with no protein within 15 Å of the active site (1Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar, 2Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). This implies that peptide bond formation is catalyzed by RNA and, thus, the ribo-some is a ribozyme.The peptide bond is formed as a result of nucleophilic attack by the α-amino group of aa-tRNA on the ester carbonyl group of peptidyl-tRNA. The first step is the deprotonation of the α-NH3+ group to create the nucleophilic NH2 group. The pKa of the α-NH3+ group in aa-tRNA is estimated to be around 8, and it is likely that the proton is accepted by water (3Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 1963; 338: 1090-1092Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Subsequent nucleophilic attack of the α-NH2 group on the electrophilic carbonyl group leads to the formation of the zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate, which, by deprotonation, forms the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate. The breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate is initiated by donating a proton back to the leaving oxygen to form the products, i.e. P-site deacylated tRNA and A-site peptidyl-tRNA.In principle, the ribosome may catalyze the reaction by several mechanisms, such as proper positioning of the peptidyl and aminoacyl ends of the tRNAs in the active site in a conformation suitable for the spontaneous reaction, general base-acid catalysis during deprotonation and protonation, or electrostatic stabilization of the transition state(s) (4Barta A.

The pH dependence of peptidyl transfer reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli ribosomes suggested the importance of an ionizing group of the ribosome with a pKa of 7.5, which could contribute to chemical catalysis (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of the 50 S subunit from Haloarcula marismortui, a model was proposed suggesting that one of the RNA bases located within the peptidyl transferase center takes part in the chemical mechanism of peptide bond formation (2Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). In this model, A2451 was proposed to function as a general base that abstracts a proton from the attacking α-amino group and/or stabilizes the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate, thereby accelerating the intermediate formation. As general base catalysis in an aqueous medium of neutral pH requires that the base is ionizing at that pH, it was postulated that the pKa of A2451 is shifted toward neutrality by a network of interactions within the peptidyl transferase center (2Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Another likely role of A2451 is to correctly position the substrate in the active center by forming a hydrogen bond between the attacking α-NH2 group and the 2′ OH group of A2451 (11Hansen J.L.

A. 2002; 99: 11670-11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and biochemical experiments (13Parnell K.M. Seila A.C. Strobel S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In E. coli, any mutation of A2451 is lethal (14Thompson J. Kim D.F. O'Connor M. Lieberman K.R. Bayfield M.A. Gregory S.T. Green R. Noller H.F. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nevertheless, ribosomes carrying mutations at A2451 exhibited considerable catalytic activity in vitro (14Thompson J. Kim D.F. O'Connor M. Lieberman K.R. Bayfield M.A. Gregory S.T. Green R.

Nature. 2001; 411: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic analysis has shown that although the major part of the catalysis is contributed by substrate positioning (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol.

These effects could be explained either by A2451 acting as a general acid/base or by conformational changes in the peptidyl transferase center caused by the A2451U mutation. Further biochemical and genetic work has shown that mutations of G2447, a residue implied in shifting the pKa of A2451 to neutrality, had little effect in vivo and in vitro (14Thompson J. Kim D.F. O'Connor M. Lieberman K.R. Bayfield M.A. Gregory S.T. Green R. Noller H.F. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9002-9007Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Polacek N.

RNA (N.Y.). 2003; 9: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This suggested that A2451 does not participate in catalysis by the mechanism suggested (2Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), but it could not entirely exclude a function of A2451 as a general acid/base, in particularly in conjunction with other charged groups (20Bevilacqua P.C. Brown T.S. Nakano S. Yajima R. Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 90-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Weinger J.S. Parnell K.M. Dorner S. Green R. Strobel S.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).It is reasonable to assume that the mechanism of peptide bond formation is essentially the same on ribosomes from all organisms, although most of the biochemical data available so far have been obtained using E. coli ribosomes and little information on the mechanism of reaction in other organisms is available. The Gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis has significant advantages over E. coli as a model system for genetic experiments, particularly for introducing mutations in rRNA. Several rRNA mutations that are lethal in E. coli have viable phenotypes in M. smegmatis (22Pfister P. Hobbie S. Brull C. Corti N. Vasella A. Westhof E. Bottger E.C. J. Mol.

Böttger, unpublished observations. which allows for the preparation of homogeneous mutant ribosomes without the use of tag systems (25Sander P. Prammananan T. Bottger E.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These advantages prompted us to use M. smegmatis ribosomes to analyze the mechanism of peptide bond formation, identify evolutionary conserved features of the mechanism, and further assess the functional role of A2451. We show that the major conserved contribution to catalysis comes from the lowering of the activation entropy of peptide bond formation. The effects of A2451U are different in E. coli and M. smegmatis, which argues against a mechanism for peptidyl transfer in which A2451 acts as a conserved chemical catalyst; rather, A2451 has an important function in determining the structure of the peptidyl transferase center.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Buffers—Chemicals for ribosome preparation and activity assays were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma (Steinheim, Germany) unless stated otherwise. Chemicals for RNA probing were from Fisher. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) were from Sigma. MFT-mRNA (5′-GGCAAGGAGGUAAAUAAUGUUCACGAUU-3′, underlined sequence coding for fMet-Phe-Thr) was purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Radioactive amino acids were from MP Biomedicals (Eschwege, Germany) or Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). Radioactive nucleoside triphosphates used for primer extension were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Buffer A consisted of: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2. Buffer B consisted of: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm BisTris-HCl (at indicated pH), 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2.M. smegmatis Bacterial Strains and Mutagenesis—The parental strain used was a single rDNA allelic strain of M. smegmatis, mc2155 SMR5ΔrrnB, with one remaining functional operon, rrnA, whereas the rrnB operon was removed completely. No additional resistance determinants were introduced in the genome (23Pfister P. Hobbie S. Vicens Q. Bottger E.C. Westhof E. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1078-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The integrative vector pMV361ΔKan-Gm, which integrates into the genome of M. smegmatis at the unique attB site, was constructed by deletion of the aph cassette of pMV361 with NheI/SpeI and insertion of the gentamicin resistance cassette of pMV361-Gm carried on a 3-kb PstI fragment. An ∼1.4-kbp rRNA gene fragment starting at 23 S RNA position 1929 (E. coli numbering) up to a position 82 bp downstream of the 5 S RNA gene and containing point mutation A2451U was generated by fusion PCR and verified by sequencing. The PCR fragments were subcloned into the pGEMTEasy vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Subsequently, the PCR fragments were isolated by EcoRI digestion and integrated into the single EcoRI site of pMV361ΔKan-Gm. The resulting plasmid was named pMV361ΔKan-Gm-rRNA2451U.The plasmid pMV361ΔKan-Gm-rRNA2451U was transformed into M. smegmatis mc2155 SMR5ΔrrnB. Transformants were selected on LB plates containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin. RecA-mediated homologous recombination was used to introduce the point mutation A2451U into the functional rrn operon (rrnA) as described previously (26Prammananan T. Sander P. Springer B. Bottger E.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinants were colony purified twice; the presence of the mutation was verified by sequencing the 23 S rRNA gene as well as the 23 S rRNA in the ribosome preparations. M. smegmatis mc2155 SMR5ΔrrnB and A2451U were grown on LB agar plates and plates containing linezolid (16 μg/ml), respectively, preventing the loss of the point mutation. For cultivation of bacteria, large flasks with a total volume of 20 liters of LB medium containing Tween 80 (0.05%) were inoculated with colonies collected from plates. After 6–7 generations and an A600 of ∼0.7, the cells were harvested and shock-frozen as dry pellets.Ribosome Preparation—Twenty grams of frozen cells were resus-pended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were opened by passing them through a French press (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY) at 18,000 p.s.i. DNase (RNase-free; Sigma; 3 μg/ml) and pre-cooled alumina (20 g) were added to the cell lysate. Alumina and cell debris were removed by low-speed centrifugation (JA14 rotor; Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA; 9,000 × g, 30 min), and the S-30 fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti50.2 rotor for 60 min. 16-ml portions of the S-30 extract were layered on 9-ml sucrose cushions (1.1 m sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After centrifugation at 33,000 × g in the Ti50.2 rotor for 16 h, ribosome pellets were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 350 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, dissolved in the same buffer, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Ribosomes were pelleted through 1 ml of sucrose cushion as before (Ti 50.2, 6 h, 50,000 rpm), and washed and dissolved in the same buffer. Finally, the ribosomes were centrifuged through 1.5-ml sucrose cushions (Beckman SW28; 28,000 rpm, 13 h). Ribosome pellets were dissolved in buffer A and stored after shock-freezing in liquid nitrogen. The concentration was determined by absorption measurements on the basis of 23 pmol/A260 units.The integrity of 70 S ribosomes was verified by analytical ultracentrifugation. 50 pmol each of 70 S ribosomes from M. smegmatis, E. coli 70 S ribosomes, or E. coli 30 S and 50 S subunits were layered on a 5–40% sucrose gradient in buffer A (association conditions) or in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm BisTris-HCl at pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 70 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm MgCl2 (dissociation conditions). The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 22,000 × g for 17 h. Gradients were pumped out from the bottom of the tubes and ribosome fractions were detected by absorption at 254 nm.Ribosome Activity and Complex Formation—Purified tRNA and translation factors from E. coli were prepared as described (27Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Matassova N.B. Katunin V.I. Semenkov Y.P. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9586-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Initiation complexes were prepared in buffer A by incubating 70 S ribosomes (1.5 μm), MFT-mRNA (1.7-fold excess over ribosomes), and [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet (1.7-fold excess over ribosomes) in the presence of initiation factors 1, 2, and 3 (each in a 1.7-fold excess over ribosomes) for 60 min at 37 °C. To form the ternary complex, EF-Tu·GTP·[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe, EF-Tu (2.4 μm) was incubated with GTP (1 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (3 mm), and pyruvate kinase (0.1 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe (1.2 μm). Equal volumes of initiation and ternary complexes were mixed at 14 mm MgCl2, resulting in pretranslocation complexes. The extent of binding of [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet to the P site and [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe to the A site was controlled by nitrocellulose filtration. Filters were dissolved in 10 ml of scintillation liquid (Quickszint 361; Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt, Germany) and counted in a TriCarb counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Post-translocation complexes were prepared by adding 0.1 μm EF-G to pretranslocation complexes and incubating for 5 min at 20 °C. Post-translocation complexes were purified and concentrated by centrifugation through 1.1 m sucrose cushions in buffer A at 259,000 × g for 2 h (M120GX rotor; Sorvall, Asheville, NC). Pellets were dissolved in buffer B to a concentration of ∼3 μm, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C.Kinetic Measurements of Peptide Bond Formation—For the measurement of tripeptide formation, stock solutions of post-translocation complexes and puromycin were diluted into buffer B; for studying pH dependence, the buffer was adjusted to various pH values ranging from 6 to 9 (37 °C). Puromycin solutions at concentrations of 15–30 mm (see Fig. 1) contained 5–10% Me2SO; Me2SO up to 20% had no effect on the rate of puromycin reaction (data not shown). The final pH of both ribosome and puromycin solutions was measured directly using a small-sized pH electrode. Quench-flow experiments were carried out at 37 °C by mixing equal volumes (13 μl) of ribosome and puromycin solutions in a quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp, Austin, TX). After mixing, the concentration of the post-translocation complex was 0.15 μm. Reactions were quenched with 0.5 m KOH. The [3H]fMet[14C]Phe-puromycin formed in the reaction and unreacted [3H]fMet[14C]Phe, set free from [3H]fMet[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe by alkaline hydrolysis (30 min, 37 °C), were separated by reverse phase-HPLC on a RP-8 column and quantified by double label radioactivity counting (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Alternatively, reactions were quenched with 25% formic acid, and [3H]fMet[14C]Phe-puromycin was extracted in 750 μl of ethyl acetate in the presence of 500 μlof 1.5 m sodium acetate saturated with MgSO4 at pH 4.5. Double label radioactivity counting was used to analyze 500 μl of the organic phase. The rate of dipeptide formation was measured with 0.1 μm initiation complex and 0.6 μm ternary complex, both in buffer B of the desired pH, at 37 °C. The reaction products were released from [3H]fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe by alkaline hydrolysis, separated by reverse phase-HPLC, and quantified by double label radioactivity counting. Time courses of the reaction were evaluated by single exponential fitting.Chemical Probing—RNA probing was carried out generally following the standard procedure (29Merryman C. Noller H.F. Smith C.W.J. RNA:Protein Interactions, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 237-253Google Scholar, 30Bayfield M.A. Dahlberg A.E. Schulmeister U. Dorner S. Barta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10096-10101Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Five μl of vacant ribosomes, isolated as described earlier and stored at 1 μm concentration in a buffer of 50 mm HEPES (adjusted with KOH to pH 6.5, 7.5, or 8.5), 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, and 7 mm MgCl2 were combined with 45 μl of a modification buffer with a pH corresponding to that at which the ribosomes were stored. The following buffers were used for ribosome dilution and probing: 50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 150 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2; 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2; 50 mm Bicine-KOH, pH 8.5, 150 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2. After dilution with modification buffer, ribosome solutions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and stored on ice before use.For DMS modification, 2 μl of DMS:ethanol mixture (1:5, v/v) was added (2 μl of ethanol was added to the control samples) and samples were incubated for 1 h on ice. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 μlof0.6 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and ribosomes were precipitated by the addition of 300 μl of cold ethanol and incubation for 10 min at –70 °C. Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C.For CMCT modification, 5 μlof1 μm ribosome solution in storage buffer, pH 8.5, were combined with 45 μl of Bicine modification buffer, pH 8.5 (see earlier). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, 50 μl of CMCT solution (10.5 mg/ml) in Bicine modification buffer, pH 8.5, was added and samples were incubated for 1 h on ice. Reactions were stopped by adding 100 μlof0.6 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 600 μl of cold ethanol and placing samples at –70 °C for 10 min. Ribosomes were precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C.Ribosome pellets were dissolved in 200 μlof0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS. rRNA was isolated by successive extractions with equal volumes of phenol, phenol/chloroform, and chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation of the aqueous phase. RNA pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of H2O. The distribution of modified nucleotides in 23 S rRNA was assessed by primer extension analysis essentially as described (29Merryman C. Noller H.F. Smith C.W.J. RNA:Protein Interactions, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 237-253Google Scholar) using the DNA primers MS2720 (GTCCTCTCGTACTAGGGACAG), MS2550 (CCAACCCTTGGGACCTGCT), and MS2390 (CAGAGTGGTATTTCAACAACGAC), which allowed for scanning of the entire domain V of M. smegmatis 23 S rRNA.RESULTS70 S Ribosomes from M. smegmatis—The 70 S ribosomes were prepared from the M. smegmatis mc2155 SMR5ΔrrnB strain, which has a single rRNA operon, rrnA (25Sander P. Prammananan T. Bottger E.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The A2451U mutation was introduced into the 23 S rRNA gene by RecA-mediated homologous recombination. The resulting cells, which contained a pure population of ribosomes carrying the A2451U mutation, were viable in liquid culture and formed colonies on agar plates. However, introduction of the A2451U mutation had a major effect on the cell growth: compared with the wild-type (WT), the generation time increased from 3–4 to 15–17 h. Notably, the A2451U mutation conferred resistance to chloramphenicol and linezolid (to be discussed in detail elsewhere). Wild-type and mutant M. smegmatis ribosomes were prepared as described earlier for E. coli ribosomes (27Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with some alterations (see “Materials and Methods”). Whereas most of the ribosomal material prepared from WT M. smegmatis was represented by 70 S particles, 60% of the mutant ribosome preparation was represented by a 70 S peak and the rest sedimented as free 30 and 50 S ribosomal subunits during gradient centrifugation. The 70 S ribosomes prepared from mc2155 SMR5ΔrrnB or mc2155 SMR5ΔrrnB A2451U cells were 50% active in forming the initiation complex, 70S-mRNA-fMet-tRNAfMet. EF-Tu-dependent binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the A site and translocation by EF-G resulted in post-translocation complexes with 40% of peptidyl-tRNA, fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe, in the P site both for WT and mutant ribosomes.Peptide Bond Formation on M. smegmatis Ribosomes with Puromycin as Substrate—The peptidyl transferase activity of WT and A2451U M. smegmatis ribosomes was tested in a rapid kinetic assay (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Post-translocation complexes loaded with fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe in the P site were mixed with puromycin and time courses of fMet-Phepuromycin formation were monitored. Because puromycin binds very rapidly to the A site, the chemistry step appears to be rate-limiting (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Sievers A. Beringer M. Rodnina M.V. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mm puromycin at pH 7.5, the rate of fMet-Phe-puromycin formation was 2.3 s–1 on WT ribosomes (Fig. 1B), and the A2451U mutation reduced the rate ∼15-fold to 0.15 s–1. This rate effect could be because of a decreased rate of the chemistry step or to impaired puromycin binding. To distinguish between these possibilities, the rate of fMet-Phe-puromycin formation was determined at increasing puromycin concentrations (Fig. 1C). The apparent affinity for puromycin, Km = 8 ± 3mm, was identical for the WT and mutant M. smegmatis post-translocation complexes and similar to that observed for E. coli ribosomes, 3–4 mm (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The rates of peptide bond formation at substrate saturation were 4 and 0.25 s–1 for the M. smegmatis WT and A2451U mutant ribosomes, respectively. The rates on E. coli ribosomes were 30 s–1 (on WT ribosomes) and 0.2 s–1 (on A2451U mutant ribosomes) under the same conditions (pH 7.5, 37 °C) (10Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).To obtain further insight into the mechanism of catalysis, activation parameters of peptide bond formation on M. smegmatis ribosomes were measured and compared with those of an uncatalyzed model reaction using Tris as the reacting nucleophile. The rate of peptide bond formation with fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe and puromycin was measured at different temperatures; activation parameters (ΔG‡, ΔH‡, and TΔS‡) w"

Although tremendous progress has been made in recent years in unraveling the mechanisms underlying O2-dependent regulation of HIF through its O2-dependent degradation domain and C-terminal transactivation domain, our understanding of the contributions of other structural elements, particularly the Per/ARNT/Sim (PAS)-A and PAS-B domains, to the activity of HIF is incomplete. Using insights derived from the recently determined solution structures of the HIF PAS-B domains as a starting point, we have explored the function(s) of the HIF-2α PAS domains via mutational analysis. In contrast to recent models, our data reveal that both PAS domains of the HIF-α subunit are necessary for heterodimer formation but are not required to mediate other HIF functions in which PAS domains have been implicated. Because disruption of individual PAS domains compromise HIF function independent of the mechanism of HIF induction, these data demonstrate the potential utility of targeting these domains for therapeutic applications.

Past difficulties in using only sequence data to define the boundaries of low homology PAS domains, as well as reliance on uncharacterized recombinant protein and nonphysiological overexpression of HIF constructs, has complicated the interpretation of some of the data underlying these models. PAS domains are usually about 120 amino acids in size and fold into a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by several α-helices. Recently, we employed NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of the HIF-2α PAS-B domain, showing that it adopts this characteristic mixed α/β fold (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, NMR spectroscopy revealed a direct in vitro association between the PAS-B domains from the two HIF subunits mediated through interactions between their solvent exposed central β-sheets (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Card P.B. Erbel P.J.A. Gardner K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we present evidence supporting the physiological relevance of the observed interaction between the PAS-B domains of the two HIF subunits and demonstrate that both PAS domains of HIF-2α are significantly involved in heterodimer formation in vivo. Although the HIF-2α PAS domains may also contribute subtly to nuclear localization, the presence of the PAS domains had little effect on the sensitivity of HIF-2α to the hsp90 antagonist geldanamycin (GA). In addition to challenging previously held models of PAS domain contributions to HIF biology, our results provide an experimental framework to investigate the feasibility of exploiting PAS domains as targets to disrupt HIF function. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Mutations and deletions to the HIF-2α cDNA were generated by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each construct was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) in which the cytomegalovirus promoter was replaced by the human HIF-1α promoter and 5′-untranslated region (34Iyer N.V. Leung S.W. Semenza G.L. Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to better approximate O2-sensitive responses in HIF-α transcription/translation (35Minet E. Ernest I. Michel G.

The resulting constructs were cotransfected with the pPUR vector (BD Biosciences) conferring puromycin resistance. Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 10 μg/ml puromycin. A second round of clonal selection was performed to ensure that each line contained a homogeneous population of cells Cell Culture—Cell lines were maintained in HyQ Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 1:1 medium (HyClone) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro; 100 I.U./ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) in the presence of 5.0% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were exposed to hypoxia within a humidified hypoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc.) filled with 1% O2, 5.0% CO2 (balance N2) at 37 °C. Geldanamycin (Alexis Biochemicals) was prepared as 150× stocks in Me2SO. For luciferase reporter assays, the cells were plated onto 24-well plates (7.5 × 104 cells/well) 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with 50 ng of the 3×HRE-tk-luc luciferase reporter construct (3Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 3 h the medium was changed, and after an additional 2 h, the cells were incubated for 12 h under normoxic or hypoxic (1.0% O2) conditions.

Western Blot Analysis—The samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE prior to Western blot analysis.

Nuclear Lysate Preparation—3.75 × 106 cells were plated in 15-cm tissue culture plate for 24 h prior to incubation under normoxic or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for 12 h.

Briefly, the plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4. The cells were harvested by scraping and centrifuged at 2200 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. The cells were briefly washed and then swollen on ice in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm NaF, 10 μm Na2MoO4, and 0.1 mm EDTA for 15 min followed by the addition of 50 μl 10% Nonidet P-40 and vortexing for 10 s. The nuclear pellet was collected from the cytosolic supernatant by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and gently stirred for 30 min at 4 °C in 350 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.5), 420 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma).

Nuclear extracts (0.5 μg/μl) were incubated on ice for 5 min in buffer containing 10 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 μg/μl herring sperm DNA (Invitrogen), and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) followed by the addition of the radiolabeled probe and incubation at room temperature for an additional 20 min. Protein-bound DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—100 μl of 1 μg/μl nuclear lysate was added to 650 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% skim milk) containing 15 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and 5 μl of anti-ARNT antiserum elicited in rabbits against the first 140 residues of the human ARNT protein. Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE prior to Western blot analysis. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA samples were independently prepared three times using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.) for each cell line incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (1% O2; 12 h) conditions. First strand cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of each total RNA sample using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample with the 7900HT detection system and software Prism (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using primers designed against the mouse GLUT1 (CGTCGTTGGCATCCTTATTG; GAGGCCACAAGTCTGCATTG) or β-actin (CATCGTGGGCCGCTCTA; CACCCACATAGGAGTCCTTCTG) genes. The data were deemed acceptable if the standard deviation was less than 0.4 for each triplicate set. We calculated relative expression (to β-actin) for GLUT1 using the comparative threshold cycle method. The relative induction by hypoxia was calculated by dividing the hypoxia level of expression by the normoxia level of expression within each set. The data for each gene is the mean of three values determined from the three independently harvested sets. Generation of Stable Cell Lines Expressing HIF-2α Constructs—Improvements in secondary structure prediction methods (39Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) and an increase in the number of known PAS domain structures have greatly improved our ability to accurately predict the boundaries for each HIF PAS domain. Such information is critical when assessing domain function because inappropriate truncations can potentially lead to unintended disruption of neighboring structural elements or the introduction of large unfolded regions within a protein upon partial domain removal. Recently, we determined the solution structure of the HIF-2α PAS-B domain by NMR spectroscopy and demonstrated an interaction with the ARNT PAS-B domain mediated by the surface of its central β-sheet (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We surmised that this in vitro interaction reflected a physiologically relevant interaction likely contributing to heterodimerization of the HIF subunits. However, when recombinant fragments encompassing the bHLH-PAS domains of the HIF subunits were employed in in vitro gel shift assays, deletion of the HIF-2α PAS-B domain had virtually no effect on HIF assembly/DNA binding (data not shown and Ref. 25Chapman-Smith A. Lutwyche J.K. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5353-5362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Careful examination of numerous HIF-1α and -2α protein fragments expressed from heterologous systems under a variety of conditions revealed that, although soluble, the recombinant HIF-α PAS-A domains were always unfolded as indicated by NMR methods (data not shown) that may complicate interpretation of both PAS-A and PAS-B function in a variety of in vitro assays. To better assess the function of the HIF-2α PAS domains under more physiological conditions, we generated a series of HIF-2α constructs (Fig. 1A) containing specific deletions of the PAS domains. Because such large deletions could have unforeseen effects on other HIF domains, we also made a HIF-2α construct containing three point mutations (Q320E/V336E/Y340T) designed to abrogate the observed in vitro interaction between the HIF-2α and ARNT PAS-B domains without causing disruption of the PAS fold itself (PAS-B mut) (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant HIF-2α constructs were introduced into the Ka13 CHO cell line. The Ka13 cell line contains an unidentified genetic lesion that eliminates expression of endogenous HIF-α, although the regulatory pathways that govern hypoxic induction of the α-subunit remain intact (40Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ka13 cell line is well suited for examining HIF activity in a background absent of endogenous HIF expression, allowing one to monitor HIF-α variants expressed at physiologically relevant levels rather than relying on gross overexpression of HIF-α at levels that may overwhelm endogenous regulatory factors. Each HIF-2α construct was cotransfected with a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance to allow for the selection of individual clones in which the HIF-2α expression vector was stably integrated into the genome. For each construct, multiple puromycin-resistant cell lines were selected, and HIF-2α expression levels were assessed by Western blot analysis. To best mimic physiologically meaningful levels of HIF-α expression, we compared the O2 responsiveness of a luciferase reporter gene (3×HRE-tk-luc) governed by multiple HIF response elements (HREs) in clones expressing different levels of wild type HIF-2α. We chose two independently selected, stable wild type HIF-2α-expressing cell lines for additional study that faithfully recapitulated the magnitude of reporter induction under hypoxia observed in a CHO cell line (C4.5) (40Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) expressing endogenous HIF-1α (Fig. 2). Similarly, two cell lines for each mutant HIF-2α construct were subsequently chosen for further study on the basis of comparable levels of HIF-2α accumulation under hypoxia (Fig. 1B). Both HIF-2α PAS Domains Are Required for HIF Activity—Having generated pairs of stably transfected cell lines for each construct with similar HIF-2α protein accumulation levels (Fig. 1B), we examined the effects of PAS domain mutations and deletions on HIF activity. Each cell line was transfected with the HIF-responsive 3-HRE-tk-luc reporter and incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2). As expected, no induction of the HIF reporter was observed in the parental Ka13 cell line lacking HIF-α expression, whereas a >10-fold increase in reporter gene induction was observed for the C4.5 cell line, reflecting the hypoxic induction of endogenous HIF activity. A similar induction of reporter gene expression was observed in each of the two cell lines expressing the wild type HIF-2α subunit, confirming that the expression levels of HIF-2α are appropriate to recapitulate physiologically relevant HIF responses. In contrast, deletion of either or both HIF-2α PAS domains completely blocked HIF activity (Fig. 2) despite equivalent induction of total protein levels (Fig. 1B). Our prior NMR data indicated that the PAS-B domains from the two HIF subunits interact with one another via the exposed face of the β-sheets on the α-subunit (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Card P.B. Erbel P.J.A. Gardner K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by mutating PAS-B residues whose side chains extend out from the β-sheets toward the protein-protein interface. To minimize changes to the β-sheet backbone, these residues were replaced with amino acids that changed the chemical composition of the side chain without altering the α- and β-carbon positions. One such variant PAS-B domain containing three altered residues (Q322E/M338E/Y342T) maintained the PAS domain fold but severely weakened association with the ARNT PAS-B domain in vitro (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In agreement with the spectroscopic data, when placed in the context of the full-length HIF-2α (PAS-B mut), even these subtle mutations have a substantial effect on HIF activity, reducing expression of the HIF reporter gene by >50% (Fig. 2). The relative induction of the HIF reporter in the stably transfected cell lines mirrors previous results obtained upon transient transfection of HIF constructs (32Erbel P.J.A. Card P.B. Karakuzu O. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of HIF-2α function was observed for hypoxic induction of the endogenous gene, GLUT1 (TABLE ONE). Together these data indicate that both PAS domains are required for HIF activity and that disruption of a PAS domain interaction observed by NMR has functional consequences in this model system.TABLE ONEHypoxic induction of GLUT1 mRNACell lineFold hypoxic induction (mean ± S.D.)p valueKa13 (No HIF)0.91 ± 0.140.34Wild type 13.17 ± 1.200.04Wild type 22.39 ± 0.990.07PAS-B mut 11.17 ± 0.360.45PAS-B mut 21.50 ± 0.420.11PAS-A del 11.50 ± 1.350.56PAS-A del 21.67 ± 0.910.27PAS-B del 10.64 ± 0.070.001PAS-B del 20.72 ± 0.190.07PAS-AB del 10.72 ± 0.340.22PAS-AB del 20.84 ± 0.280.39 Open table in a new tab The HIF-2α PAS Domains Do Not Mediate the Sensitivity of HIF to a hsp90 Antagonist—Although both PAS domains are required for HIF function in the cell culture models, the underlying mechanistic role(s) played by these domains remain speculative.

https://openalex.org/W2049844929,"We tested the hypothesis that certain membrane-intercalating agents increase the chemical activity of cholesterol by displacing it from its low activity association with phospholipids. Octanol, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (a diglyceride), and N-hexanoyl-d-erythrosphingosine (a ceramide) were shown to increase both the rate of transfer and the extent of equilibrium partition of human red blood cell cholesterol to methyl-β-cyclodextrin. These agents also promoted the interaction of the sterol with two cholesterol-specific probes, cholesterol oxidase and saponin. Expanding the pool of bilayer phospholipids with lysophosphatides countered these effects. The three intercalators also protected the red cells against lysis by cholesterol depletion as if substituting for the extracted sterol. As is the case for excess plasma membrane cholesterol, treating human fibroblasts with octanol, diglyceride, or ceramide stimulated the rapid inactivation of their hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, presumably through an increase in the pool of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol. These data supported the stated hypothesis and point to competition between cholesterol and endogenous and exogenous intercalators for association with membrane phospholipids.

Sterols associate in roughly equimolar proportions with the phospholipids in artificial membranes (1Huang J. Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The sterols associated with the phospholipids are held at a low chemical activity. In sharp contrast, sterol molecules in excess of the capacity of the phospholipids are free and have a much higher chemical activity (3Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 4McConnell H.M. Radhakrishnan A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The high fugacity (escape potential) of the superthreshold sterol promotes its exit from the membrane, thereby tending to restore the balance between the sterols and phospholipids (2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Most of the cholesterol in mammalian cells is in the plasma membranes, where its abundance appears to be maintained homeostatically near molar equivalence with the phospholipids (5Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cholesterol in excess of the physiological set point appears to have a high chemical activity. One indicator of this activity is the sharp increase in the susceptibility to cholesterol oxidase of human red blood cell and fibroblast plasma membranes that have been augmented slightly with cholesterol (7Lange Y. Cutler H.B. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9331-9337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We interpret this effect to signify that, above the threshold, cholesterol molecules are free of constraint by phospholipids and more frequently bob out of the plane of the bilayer, where the peripherally bound enzyme can access them (see Ref. 9Chen X. Wolfgang D.E. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13383-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rate of transfer to cyclodextrin 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are:cyclodextrinmethyl-β-cyclodextrinceramideN-hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosinediglyceride1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol25HC25-hydroxycholesterolPBS150 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaPi (pH 7.5)HMGhydroxymethylglutarylHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are:cyclodextrinmethyl-β-cyclodextrinceramideN-hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosinediglyceride1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol25HC25-hydroxycholesterolPBS150 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaPi (pH 7.5)HMGhydroxymethylglutarylHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography of membrane cholesterol in slight excess of normal is dramatically increased (2Radhakrishnan A.

A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This effect could reflect a high frequency of transient projections of membrane sterol molecules into the aqueous phase where they can be captured by the acceptor (10Steck T.L. Ye J. Lange Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Finally, augmenting the plasma membranes of fibroblasts with a slight excess of cholesterol drives some to the endoplasmic reticulum, perhaps because of its high escape potential. Multiple regulatory elements in the endoplasmic reticulum sense the elevated cholesterol and respond by reducing the cell cholesterol level (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Passive and active adjustments made in response to the chemical potential of the cholesterol in excess of the equivalence point serve to restore the resting level of plasma membrane cholesterol (2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the association of cholesterol with phospholipids can be perturbed so as to increase its chemical activity. In particular, it has been suggested that ceramides and diglycerides, physiological membrane-intercalating amphipathic alcohols, displace cholesterol from bilayer phospholipids (11Zitzer A. Bittman R. Verbicky C.A. Erukulla R.K. Bhakdi S. Weis S. Valeva A. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In addition, octanol not only stimulates the oxidation of plasma membrane cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase and its transfer to cyclodextrin but also sends the sterol to the endoplasmic reticulum (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Lange Y. Matthies H. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to test the emergent hypothesis that these intercalating alcohols increase the chemical activity of cholesterol by displacing it from phospholipids. Materials—1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol and N-hexanoyl-d-erythrosphingosine were obtained from Avanti. l-α-lyso(palmitoyl)phosphatidyl-l-serine, egg yolk lysophosphatidylcholine, 25HC, cyclodextrin, octanol, and cholesterol oxidase (Streptomyces sp) were all from Sigma. We purchased 1α,2α-[3H]cholesterol from Amersham Biosciences. Blood was donated by a healthy human volunteer. Red blood cells were separated from the plasma and buffy coat and washed thrice with 10 volumes of PBS. Chemical Assay of Red Cell Susceptibility to Cholesterol Oxidase—As described in the figure legends, red cells in PBS were preincubated in microcentrifuge tubes for 5 min at 37 °C with agents or a solvent control (1% v/v ethanol). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h with cholesterol oxidase, chilled on ice, and centrifuged for 5 min to pellet the cells and any membranes released by lysis during the incubation. Supernatants were retained for the assay of hemolysis, and ghosts were prepared from the pellets (14Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Ghost cholesterol was assayed fluorimetrically with Amplex Red (Molecular Probes); cholesterol oxidation was calculated from the difference between enzyme-treated and control cells. These results agreed well with analysis by HPLC (15Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemolysis Assay of Red Cell Susceptibility to Cholesterol Oxidase— Red cells in 96-well plates were preincubated with the agents for 5 min at 37 °C. Cholesterol oxidase was added for a 1–2-h incubation at 37 °C. The samples were mixed by inversion, and their light scattering was determined in a plate reader as the optical absorbance at 500 nm. Alternatively, the cells were allowed to settle or the plates centrifuged briefly and then photographed. Fibroblasts—Human skin fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated overnight in medium plus 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum to induce the expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Other Methods—The transfer of cholesterol from red cells to cyclodextrin was determined as described (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Steck T.L. Ye J. Lange Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For the modification of red cell cholesterol, cells were incubated with cyclodextrin or cyclodextrin-cholesterol complexes to decrease or increase their cholesterol, respectively, as described (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cholesterol mass was determined by HPLC (15Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with Amplex Red. Protein was determined with BCA (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Intercalator Activation of Red Cell Cholesterol Tested by Transfer to Cyclodextrin—We have shown that the rate of efflux of red cell membrane cholesterol to excess cyclodextrin is stimulated both by increasing the cholesterol to just above the physiologic level and by treatment with octanol (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, ceramide and diglyceride also stimulate this transfer reaction. The apparent first-order rate constant for transfer was increased ∼5-fold in both of the experiments shown. The hypothesis under test predicts that it is not the rate of efflux of red cell cholesterol to cyclodextrin that should be increased by its displacement from phospholipids but rather the partition coefficient. We therefore determined the effect of the intercalators on the equilibrium distribution of cholesterol between red cells and cyclodextrin. Both ceramide and diglyceride were found to increase the partition to cyclodextrin by about 40% under specified conditions (not shown). The effect was predictably not large. This was because only the small fraction of cholesterol molecules that were active and not the bulk fraction would have a high escape potential. Furthermore, the amount of cyclodextrin used was minimized to avoid cell lysis. Finally, cholesterol partition might have been reduced adventitiously if the intercalators bound to the cyclodextrin as well as the membranes. Indeed, octanol binding to cyclodextrin could explain why it did not alter the equilibrium partition of cholesterol (data not shown), although octanol did speed cholesterol transfer in kinetic experiments (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Intercalator Activation of Red Cell Cholesterol Tested with Cholesterol Oxidase—The cholesterol in red cells is normally resistant to cholesterol oxidase; however, its susceptibility is greatly enhanced when bilayer cholesterol is increased slightly and also when the cells are treated with octanol (7Lange Y. Cutler H.B. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9331-9337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lange Y. Matthies H. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that treating red cells with three other membrane-intercalated alcohols, ceramide, diglyceride, and 25HC, also strongly increases the oxidation of their cholesterol. 25HC acted at less than a molar equivalence to the red cell cholesterol; ceramide and diglyceride were robust at molar equivalence. The action of the more water-soluble octanol required a ∼20-fold excess over cholesterol (of which, presumably, only a small fraction was actually taken up). In all four cases, the stimulation curve was sigmoidal, reminiscent of the strong threshold effect characteristic of cholesterol concentration dependence (7Lange Y. Cutler H.B. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9331-9337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The oxidation of their membrane cholesterol caused red cells to lyse over time. This hemolytic action offered a convenient way to assess cholesterol oxidation. Fig. 3 shows that hemolysis reports with high sensitivity the same stimulation of cholesterol oxidation by the intercalators as that determined by chemical analysis in Fig. 2. It has been proposed that the action of cholesterol oxidase depends on the chemical activity of cholesterol in the membrane, which, in turn, reflects the fraction of the sterol not associated with phospholipids (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It follows that expanding the membrane phospholipid compartment should reduce the pool of active cholesterol and thereby inhibit cholesterol oxidase attack. This was observed with lysophosphatidylcholine, a convenient water-soluble membrane-intercalating phospholipid (13Lange Y. Matthies H. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). If the mechanism by which intercalators stimulated the cholesterol oxidase action in Figs. 2 and 3 involves the displacement of cholesterol from phospholipids, augmenting the phospholipid pool with a slight excess of lysophosphatidylcholine should inhibit the activity of cholesterol oxidase promoted by these agents. Fig. 4 supports this hypothesis. Intercalator Activation of Red Cell Cholesterol Tested with Saponin— Various lytic agents act on cells in a cholesterol-dependent fashion; for example, the saponins (16Nishikawa M. Nojima S. Akiyama T. Sankawa U. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Francis G. Kerem Z. Makkar H.P. Becker K. Br. J. Nutr. 2002; 88: 587-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the lysis of red blood cells by saponin depends on the activity of excess cholesterol. This seemed not to be the case since cells depleted of ∼20% of their sterol (and consequently far below the threshold at which active cholesterol appears) could nevertheless be fully lysed (Fig. 5A). Rather, the concentration of saponin required for lysis varied inversely with membrane cholesterol. This behavior suggested a high-order mass-action relationship between the saponin and the sterol. If so, saponin might have to compete with phospholipids for association with the sterol. In that case, the intercalators under study should potentiate lysis by displacing cholesterol from the phospholipids. This premise is supported by the results shown in Fig. 5, B and C, for octanol, ceramide, and diglyceride. (Adding 25HC at levels far below that of the membrane cholesterol also promoted saponin hemolysis; however, this potent effect might simply reflect the formation of lytic complexes between 25HC and saponin.) A further prediction of our hypothesis, arising from the findings presented in Figs. 4 and 5, is that introducing lysophosphatides into the membrane should counter the ability of the intercalating alcohols to promote hemolysis by saponin. We found this to be the case with octanol, diglyceride, and ceramide (data not shown). It therefore appeared that although saponin does not report on active cholesterol per se, it still provides a useful reagent for testing cholesterol displacement from membrane phospholipids. Substitution of Intercalators for Cholesterol in Cholesterol-depleted Red Cells—It is well known that sterols such as cholesterol stabilize phospholipid bilayers, presumably through association with the aliphatic chains of the lipids (18Bloom M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1991; 24: 293-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 19Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). If the displacement of sterols from phospholipids by intercalators reflects competition for phospholipid binding sites, they might substitute for the cholesterol removed from red cells by cyclodextrin extraction. Fig. 6 supports this premise by demonstrating that octanol, ceramide, and diglyceride all arrested the hemolysis induced by depleting the membranes of cholesterol. Test of the Effect of Intercalators on Endoplasmic Reticulum Cholesterol—Octanol has been observed to increase the level of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol in fibroblasts (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the mechanism underlying this effect involves the activation of plasma membrane cholesterol through competitive displacement from its association with phospholipids (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of other intercalators on the activity of the cholesterol-sensitive, integral endoplasmic reticulum enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is rapidly down-regulated in response to small increases in plasma membrane cholesterol activity (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We now show that, as predicted, all four intercalators under study here inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase during a 1-h incubation (Fig. 7). The dramatic effect of 25HC is complex; it could reflect the known ability of 25HC to increase the level of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol (20Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, its inhibitory action in this assay is also likely to involve its ability to stimulate the specific, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the enzyme (21Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the other three agents are not known to bind to HMG-CoA reductase, and they did not inhibit its activity when added to cell lysates (not shown but see Ref. 22Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have observed that both octanol (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and diglyceride 3Y. Lange, J. Ye, and T. L. Steck, unpublished data. increase endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol. Ceramide could not be tested because it inhibits the acylcholesterol acyltransferase activity upon which the assay depends (23Ridgway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a check of the specificity of their action, we demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of octanol and diglyceride on HMG-CoA reductase activity were partially offset by reducing plasma membrane cholesterol with cyclodextrin immediately prior to their addition (not shown). This would presumably not be the case if the intercalators acted through a pathway independent of cholesterol. It is therefore parsimonious to infer that intercalating alcohols that displace cholesterol from the plasma membrane increase its abundance in the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby elicit the observed downstream response. Multiwell Screens for Cholesterol-displacing Intercalators—Based on these findings, it seemed reasonable to suppose that a variety of amphipaths might be capable of activating membrane cholesterol by displacing it from bilayer phospholipids. Delineating a family of such compounds could aid in the study of the associations made between phospholipids, sterols, and membrane intercalators. Conversely, it would also be useful to identify agents that associate with sterols, as does lysophosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4), by screening for their ability to oppose the effects of cholesterol enrichment or of the intercalating alcohols examined above. Fig. 8 shows prototypes of such screens. In panel A, red cells were preincubated in microtiter wells with intercalating agents, and then the ability of cholesterol oxidase to induce hemolysis was scored visually. As predicted from the results in Fig. 3, all three agents stimulated the hemolysis induced by cholesterol oxidase. Consistent with Fig. 5, the intercalators also promoted red cell lysis by saponin (Fig. 8B). Finally, Fig. 8C shows how agents that reduce cholesterol activity can be readily identified. It has been demonstrated that increasing membrane cholesterol by a small fraction renders cells susceptible to oxidation by cholesterol oxidase (7Lange Y. Cutler H.B. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9331-9337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylserine countered this effect, presumably because they associated with the excess cholesterol and thereby lowered its chemical activity. Note that the lysophosphatides, normally lytic agents themselves, actually protected against hemolysis in this kind of experiment. This study explored the dependence of the chemical activity of cholesterol on the composition of the bilayer in human red blood cells. It has been suggested that the chemical activity of membrane cholesterol is normally kept low by its association with bilayer phospholipids (2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 3Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Cholesterol in excess of the membrane lipids with which it can associate would be free, would consequently have a high fugacity, and would therefore have a greater potential to exit the bilayer. The chemical activities and extents of the putative pools of phospholipid-associated and free membrane cholesterol species have yet to be measured directly. However, indirect tests showed an order of magnitude increase of sterol activity beyond a threshold that is taken to be the saturation point of the phospholipid. Two such phenomena are an increased rate of cholesterol efflux to cyclodextrin and an increased susceptibility of cholesterol to oxidation by cholesterol oxidase (2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Lange Y. Cutler H.B. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9331-9337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another indirect indicator of cholesterol activity is the dramatic rise of the cholesterol content of fibroblast endoplasmic reticulum in response to small increments in plasma membrane cholesterol (20Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may also be relevant that the θ-toxin of Clostridium perfringens binds with high affinity to phospholipid vesicles and to plasma membranes in which cholesterol is in slight excess of a threshold near the equimolar, physiological level (24Ohno-Iwashita Y. Iwamoto M. Ando S. Iwashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Iwashita S. Slot J.W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There are two competing mechanistic hypotheses for how membrane phospholipids modulate the chemical activity of cholesterol. One postulates that the bulky head groups of bilayer lipids such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin shield neighboring sterol molecules from unfavorable hydrophobic contacts with the aqueous phase (1Huang J. Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 3Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In this model, sterol molecules need not interact directly with the phospholipids but are simply driven into juxtaposition by their aversion to water. Cholesterol molecules in excess of the umbrella of phospholipid heads would be exposed to the bulk water phase and therefore have a high chemical activity. In the original studies, the excess cholesterol formed microcrystals over a period of several days (1Huang J. Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In our short-term experiments, active cholesterol might have remained free in the bilayer, given the evidence that it interacted strongly with probes in the aqueous phase (cholesterol oxidase and cyclodextrin) as well as within the membrane (saponin). The second hypothesis posits that membrane sterols and phospholipids associate as stoichiometric complexes (2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4McConnell H.M. Radhakrishnan A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Adding support to the original evidence for this model is the recent finding that the transfer of cholesterol to phospholipid bilayers is associated with a favorable enthalpy change, presumably reflecting van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bond interactions rather than a hydrophobic driving force (26Tsamaloukas A.D. Szadkowska H. Slotte P.J. Heerklotz H.H. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the associations of phospholipids with various steroids exhibit considerable specificity; see, for example, Refs. 27Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 28Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol.

Biophys J. 2005; 89: 1760-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar. On the other hand, sphingomyelin, a plasma membrane lipid with particular affinity for cholesterol, does not show stereospecificity in its interaction with cholesterol (30Holopainen J.M. Metso A.J. Mattila J.P. Jutila A. Kinnunen P.K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1510-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Mannock D.A. McIntosh T.J. Jiang X. Covey D.F. McElhaney R.N. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1038-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It may therefore be that the associations of the sterols and phospholipids, although strong and enthalpically driven, are not discrete, stereospecific or stoichiometric. Rather, the complexes may be irregular and short-lived, such as those predicted by a computer simulation (32Chiu S.W. Jakobsson E. Mashl R.J. Scott H.L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1842-1853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). (These associations would nevertheless involve close contacts and the formation of liquid ordered clusters that would predispose to but would not necessarily result in phase separation of raft domains (33London E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)). The relevant feature here, as in the first model, is that a given mixture of phospholipids would have a defined capacity for holding cholesterol, beyond which the chemical activity of the free sterol would increase sharply (2Radhakrishnan A. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A recent molecular dynamics simulation supports this concept (34Khelashvili G.A. Pandit S.a. Scott H.L. J. Chem. Phys. 2005; 123: 34910Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It follows that agents that free bilayer cholesterol of its association with phospholipids should increase its chemical activity. Such an action was recently inferred from demonstrations that ceramide and diglyceride potentiate the action of cholesterol-specific bacterial cytolysins (11Zitzer A. Bittman R. Verbicky C.A. Erukulla R.K. Bhakdi S. Weis S. Valeva A. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and displace cholesterol from rafts in synthetic bilayer vesicles (12Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Also consistent with the cholesterol-displacement mechanism were our observations that octanol promoted the susceptibility of cholesterol to cholesterol oxidase and the efflux of cholesterol to cyclodextrin; furthermore, both octanol and 25HC evoked an increase in the cholesterol content of the endoplasmic reticulum of fibroblasts (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Lange Y. Matthies H. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To consolidate the emergent hypothesis, the present study tested four membrane-intercalating alcohols (octanol, ceramide, diglyceride, and 25HC) in a single, favorable system, the human red cell membrane. The assays were the efflux of cholesterol to cyclodextrin (Fig. 1), sensitivity to hemolysis by saponin (Fig. 5), and the susceptibility of cholesterol to cholesterol oxidase (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 8A). In each test, the intercalator mimicked the effect of a slight excess of cholesterol (itself a membrane-intercalating alcohol). That sterols can be displaced from their association with membrane phospholipids is a new concept. We offer as support the findings that non-steroid amphipaths substitute for extracted cholesterol in protecting the cells from lysis (Fig. 6) and that lysophosphatides counter the ability of the intercalators to promote the action of cholesterol oxidase (Fig. 4 and 8C), just as they counter excess cholesterol (13Lange Y. Matthies H. Steck T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Presumably, the lysophosphatides associate with the cholesterol displaced by the intercalators and thereby reduce its chemical activity, hence its susceptibility to the enzyme (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). (It is also conceivable that the lysophosphatides associate to some degree with the intercalators to reduce their effect on cholesterol activity.) There is also calorimetric evidence for competition between octanol and cholesterol for association with phospholipid bilayers (35Rowe E.S. Zhang F. Leung T.W. Parr J.S. Guy P.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As a sterol derivative, 25HC presumably substituted for bilayer cholesterol isosterically, and because it might mimic as well as displace cholesterol, it was not of central importance in this study. Of more interest was the evidence that compounds as different from cholesterol as are diglycerides, ceramides, and octanol not only displace the sterol from phospholipids but substitute for it in maintaining bilayer integrity (Fig. 6). In keeping with the preceding discussion, we surmised that these intercalators, like cholesterol itself, do not make stereospecific complexes but rather that they enter into irregular associations with the phospholipids through hydrogen bonding of the head groups and van der Waals interactions among the hydrocarbon portions. These data encouraged the speculation that one of the several benefits conferred by the evolution of sterols could be their ability to oppose (buffer) variations in the properties of bilayers caused by the transient association of endogenous and exogenous intercalators with phospholipids. Looked at another way, a variety of endogenous and exogenous intercalators might be found to activate and/or substitute for sterols under various physiological and pathological circumstances. Ceramides are an example (12Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 36Van Blitterswijk W. Van Der Luit A. Veldman R. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Finally, our results have bearing on the mechanisms of cholesterol homeostasis. In the simplest case, the high escape potential of the molecules of plasma membrane cholesterol not associated with the phospholipids would, of itself, return the bilayer sterol to its resting level, a simple feedback mechanism. Indeed, in the case of the red blood cell, the physiological level of cholesterol hovers just below molar equivalence with the phospholipids, maintained by a passive collisional equilibrium with plasma lipoproteins (10Steck T.L. Ye J. Lange Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Cooper R.A. J. Supramol. Struct. 1978; 8: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 38Yancey P.G. Bortnick A.E. Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moyo M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cholesterol in the plasma membranes of nucleated cells appears to seek a level that just saturates the phospholipids (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the activity of the cholesterol in the plasma membrane exceeds the physiological threshold, the excess is disposed to move both to extracellular plasma lipoproteins and to intracellular membranes and possibly to binding proteins. Increased cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum would then signal the manifold regulatory elements therein to down-regulate the abundance of cell cholesterol through its esterification, the inhibition of its biosynthesis, and the down-regulation of the expression of genes for its accretion (8Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, although the upstream homeostatic signal arises from the physical chemistry of the plasma membrane bilayer, downstream responses are mediated by a multitude of intracellular proteins. Similarly, in the case of membrane intercalators that displace cholesterol from its association with plasma membrane bilayer phospholipids, the high chemical activity of the displaced cholesterol would also increase the pool in the endoplasmic reticulum. This is how, for example, intercalators evoked the prompt inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity in Fig. 7. It is conceivable that, by this mechanism, certain membrane intercalators could be used to reduce hypercholesterolemia in afflicted individuals. We thank Erwin London (State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook) for helpful discussions."

NHERF contains two amino-terminal PDZ (postsynaptic density 95/disk-large/zonula occluden-1) domains that bind to the cytoplasmic domains of a number of membrane channels or receptors. The carboxyl terminus of NHERF interacts with the FERM domain (a domain shared by protein 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) of a family of actin-binding proteins, ezrin-radixin-moesin. NHERF was shown previously to be capable of enhancing the channel activities of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Here we show that binding of the FERM domain of ezrin to NHERF regulates the cooperative binding of NHERF to bring two cytoplasmic tails of CFTR into spatial proximity to each other. We find that ezrin binding activates the second PDZ domain of NHERF to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of CFTR (C-CFTR), so as to form a specific 2:1:1 (C-CFTR)2·NHERF·ezrin ternary complex. Without ezrin binding, the cytoplasmic tail of CFTR only interacts strongly with the first amino-terminal PDZ domain to form a 1:1 C-CFTR·NHERF complex. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting confirm the specific interactions of NHERF with the full-length CFTR and with ezrin in vivo. Because of the concentrated distribution of ezrin and NHERF in the apical membrane regions of epithelial cells and the diverse binding partners for the NHERF PDZ domains, the regulation of NHERF by ezrin may be employed as a general mechanism to assemble channels and receptors in the membrane cytoskeleton.

The carboxyl terminus of NHERF recognizes the FERM domain (a conserved domain that is shared by protein 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) of a family of cytoskeletal actin-binding proteins, ezrin-radixin-moesin, which are collectively denoted as ERM proteins (Fig. 1). Thus, NHERF is also responsible for bridging the interactions between cell membrane and the cytoskeletal actin networks. As a membrane cytoskeleton adapter protein, NHERF enhances the efficiency and specificity of membrane processes by forming multiprotein macromolecular complexes (20Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W.

For example, recent compelling evidence demonstrates that the macromolecular complexes recruited by NHERF can form homo- and hetero-oligomers between cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and other membrane proteins to facilitate the efficient function of CFTR (21Guggino W.B.

Impaired transport activities by CFTR are related to the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis (27Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of NHERF interact with the PDZ-binding motif DTRL at the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (3Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc.

Another study from the same group finds that phosphorylation of Ser-162 in the PDZ2 domain of NHERF by protein kinase C disrupts the binding between PDZ2 and CFTR and abolishes the ability of NHERF to stimulate CFTR gating (29Raghuram V.

These studies together with the finding that another four PDZ-containing CFTR-associated protein of 70 kDa (CAP70) interacts with the carboxyl-terminal tails of CFTR to generate a more active CFTR channel (23Wang S.

In addition to promoting CFTR-CFTR interactions, NHERF also organizes the interaction between β2-adrenergic receptor and CFTR (25Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). By recruiting both CFTR and β2-adrenergic receptor, NHERF can physically cross-link β2-adrenergic receptor and CFTR into a single signaling complex. Consequently, β2-adrenergic receptor exercises its regulation on CFTR activities through NHERF (21Guggino W.B. Banks-Schlegel S.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The ERM proteins to which NHERF binds are also important linkers between cell membranes and the cytoskeletal networks (30Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The ERM proteins are localized in the apical actin-rich regions of polarized epithelial cells. They contribute to the functional organizations of specialized cell membrane domains in which many transmembrane channels and receptor reside and are localized. The association of NHERF with sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and ezrin is also shown to be essential for cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of NHE3 (33Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The conformation and activity of the ERM proteins are considered to be negatively regulated by intramolecular interactions (34Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In the inactive state of ezrin, the amino-terminal FERM domain of ezrin of ∼300 amino acid residues is proposed to bind to the carboxyl terminus of ezrin with high affinity through a head-to-tail autoregulatory mechanism (35Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). After ezrin is activated by phosphorylation and/or phospholipid binding, the FERM domain releases the carboxyl terminus of ezrin. The activated FERM domain binds to NHERF, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain of ezrin interacts with the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton network (36Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 37Finnerty C.M. Chambers D. Ingraffea J. Faber H.R. Karplus P.A. Bretscher A. J.

The above cell biological and physiological studies demonstrate the important physiological roles of NHERF in organizing membrane channels and receptors. It has also been proposed that the interaction of NHERF with membrane channels and transporters and with ezrin promotes the anchoring of these membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton to maintain their functions (33Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 39Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, how NHERF interacts with ezrin to regulate the assembly of membrane proteins is not known. Here we report a combination of biophysical and in vivo studies to show that ezrin regulates the cooperative assembly of CFTR cytoplasmic domains by NHERF. Due to the high distributions of NHERF and ezrin in the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells, the ezrin-regulated cooperative formation of NHERF recruited macromolecular complexes may be employed as a general mechanism to control the assembly and function of membrane channels and receptors by the membrane cytoskeleton. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNAs encoding the full-length human NHERF-1 and ezrin were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cDNA encoding the human CFTR was kindly provided by Dr. J. Kevin Foskett (University of Pennsylvania). We have employed the pET 100/D-TOPO and pET 151/D-TOPO expression systems (Invitrogen) to express proteins in Escherichia coli. Both the pET100/D-TOPO and the pET151/D-TOPO encode amino-terminal 6× His tags. The pET151/D-TOPO vector also encodes a V5-epitope tag at the amino terminus of the expressed proteins, whereas the pET100/D-TOPO vector expresses an amino-terminal Xpress-epitope tag in the expressed proteins. The cDNA regions encoding the amino acid sequences of 11-99 (PDZ1), 150-240 (PDZ2), 11-240 (PDZ1-PDZ2), 150-358 (PDZ2-CT), 11-358 of NHERF, the FERM domain of ezrin 1-298 of ezrin (ezFERM), and the last 70 amino acid residues (1411-1480) at the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (C-CFTR) were amplified by PCR, respectively. The PCR products were inserted in the expression vectors. After transformation of the plasmids in BL21(DE3) cells, the cells were grown on large scale, harvested by centrifugation, and re-suspended with 30 ml of suspension buffer per liter of culture containing 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm imidazole. The proteins were first purified by a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-charged with Co2+ and pre-equilibrated with the binding buffer (20 mm phosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5). The proteins were then further purified and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography using an ÄKTA fast-protein liquid chromatograph (Amersham Biosciences) with a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular masses of the expressed proteins, calculated according to their amino acid sequences, were 14.0 kDa for PDZ1, 14.2 kDa for PDZ2, 27.0 kDa for PDZ2-CT, 29.4 kDa for PDZ1-PDZ2, 42.3 kDa for NHERF, 39.2 kDa for ezFERM, and 12.5 kDa for C-CFTR. The protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 276 nm using the extinction coefficients calculated by the website ExPASy Proteomics Server (us.expasy.org/). Solution Light Scattering Experiments—Light scattering experiments were performed on a DynaPro Molecular Sizing Instrument with Dynamics V6 data analysis software (Protein Solutions, Inc.). This instrument has the capability of conducting both static light scattering and dynamic light scattering experiments simultaneously. Static light scattering determines the absolute molecular weight of the protein or protein complex in solution, whereas dynamic light scattering measures the hydrodynamic radius Rh and estimates the monodispersity of the protein samples. Before light scattering experiments, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to remove dust. About 24 μl of protein solution was then loaded to the DynaPro cell. At least 60 acquisitions (10 s/acquisition) were collected for each sample. The average of these acquisitions is reported. Light scattering experiments were conducted at 25 °C. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were carried out on BIAcore 1000 instrument. The hydrogel matrix of a BIAcore CM5 Biosensor chip was activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-[3-(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. For studying the binding between C-CFTR and the differently truncated forms of NHERF (or the NHERF·ezFERM complex), the sensor chip was coated with C-CFTR by injecting 3 μl of C-CFTR at 5 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, over the activated SPR sensor chip. For studying the binding of ezFERM to NHERF (or ezFERM binding to the C-CFTR·NHERF complex), the sensor chip was coated with ezFERM by injecting 3 μl of 10 μg/ml ezFERM in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, over the activated surface. Uncross-linked ligand was washed away, and uncoated sites were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The ligand density was controlled by the maximum binding response signal ranging from 150 to 200 response units (RUs). The analytes, NHERF, PDZ2-CT, PDZ2-CT·ezFERM, NHERF·ezFERM, at a series of concentrations were injected over the C-CFTR-coated surface at 50 μl/min for 3 min, respectively. The analytes, NHERF or C-CFTR·NHERF complex, were injected over the ezFERM-coated sensor chip. The response curves were obtained by subtracting the background signal, generated from a control cell injected with the same analyte but without ligand coating of the hydrogel matrix to remove the bulk refractive index effects. The nonspecific binding was corrected by subtracting the signal generated from buffer alone. The binding curve reached an equilibrium plateau in all cases. The RU value corresponding to the plateau was taken as a measure to obtain the binding curves. The binding curves were fit to either the monovalent binding model to obtain Kd or to the bivalent binding model to obtain Kd1 or Kd2 (40Herr A.B. White C.L. Milburn C. Wu C. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Delivering Proteins in Mammalian Cells—BHK cells were kindly provided by Dr. Gergely L. Lukacs (the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). The BHK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were grown in a 6-well plate with wells of 30-mm diameter. The BioTrek Protein Delivery Regent (Stratagene) was used to deliver NHERF or the NHERF·ezFERM complex in BHK cells. Purified NHERF and the NHERF·ezFERM complex were diluted to 150 μg/ml using phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The purified NHERF has an amino-terminal V5-epitope tag, and the purified ezFERM has an amino-terminal Xpress-epitope tag. About 100 μl of the diluted protein solution was transferred to the tube containing the lyophilized BioTrek reagent. The lyophilized reagent was resuspended by pipetting the protein solution up and down for 3-5 times. The BioTrek-protein mixtures were then left at room temperature for ∼5 min. Serum-free medium was then added to the tube to a final volume of 500 μl. When the cell density reached 50-60% confluence, the culture medium was removed from the wells by aspiration. The cells were washed once with serum-free medium. After 500 μl of fresh serum-free medium was added to each well, 500 μl of the BioTrek-protein mixture was added dropwise to the cells. The cell culture plate was then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 4-5 h before immunoprecipitation experiments. When delivering both NHERF and ezFERM in BHK cells, we first delivered ezFERM in cells 2 h before delivering NHERF in cells. The cells were then incubated for 2 h after NHERF was delivered. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiments—Cell monolayers in 30-mm-diameter wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer followed by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer at 4 °C. About 10 μg of mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was added to 500 μg of cell lysate, and the mixture was shaken in a cold room for 4 h to pull-down NHERF. Protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) of 20 μl were added, and the mixture was shaken in a cold room overnight. The beads were then spun and washed three times with 750 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and re-suspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In another experiment, ∼10 μg of mouse anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) was added to 500 μg of cell lysate to pull-down ezFERM. After electrophoresis, proteins in the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting. The membranes were then blocked in 5% fat-free milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 3 h at room temperature. The primary rabbit anti-CFTR antibody (Alomone Laboratory) was used for detecting CFTR, mouse anti-V5 antibody for NHERF detection, or mouse anti-Xpress antibody for ezFERM detection. The primary antibody was added to the blots and incubated overnight in blocking solution. The following day the blots were washed with TBS-T buffer for three times and then incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase for mouse anti-V5 and anti-Xpress primary antibodies, or anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase for rabbit anti-CFTR primary antibody) for 1 h at room temperature and washed for three times with changes of TBS-T buffer. The blots were then developed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection ECL (Pierce) for analysis. Solution Small Angle X-ray Scattering—The SAXS experiments were performed with an in-house apparatus (Rigaku/Osmic, Inc.) with a Q range from 0.009 to 0.30 Å-1, where Q =4π sin(θ/2)/λ is the magnitude of the scattering vector, θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of the x-ray.

The reduced scattering data are plotted as scattering intensity I(Q) versus Q profiles. The radius of gyration Rg, which is related to the size and shape of a protein, can be obtained from the Guinier approximation (43Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering.Academic Press, New York. 1982; : 15-17Google Scholar, 44van Holde K.E. Johnson W.C. Ho P.S.

The forward scattering intensity I(0) is linearly proportional to the molecular weight of the protein complexes. Inverse Fourier transformation of I(Q) gives the length distribution function P(r), which is the probability of finding two scattering points at a given distance r from each other in the measured macromolecule. P(r) functions were generated by the program GNOM (45Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The value at which P(r) becomes 0 reflects the maximum molecular dimension Dmax of the macromolecule averaged over all orientations. The shape of P(r) function and the value of Dmax can be used to deduce the macromolecular shape and the distance between two domains within the protein. The program DAMMIN (46Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar) was used to reconstruct the low resolution three-dimensional molecular structures from SAXS data. The program Situs (47Wriggers W. Chacón P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was used to dock the fragments of known crystal structures (PDZ1 and ezFERM) to the low resolution structures.

Mannose trimming is subsequently initiated in the ER and continues in the Golgi complex by a series of mannosidases prior to the branching and extension of the oligosaccharides by Golgi glycosyltransferases (5Spiro R.G.

Biochem. 1991; 193: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)), M2.1, M2.2, M4.7, M5.1, M6.1, M6.10, M7.1, M7.2, M8.1, M8.2, and M8.4 were purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. Other high mannose-type oligosaccharides were derived from IgY. IgY was isolated from egg yolk using the Eggcellent™ chicken IgY purification kit (Pierce) and digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight. Oligosaccharides were released with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight. After removal of the peptide materials, the reducing ends of the N-glycans were derivatized with 2-aminopyridine (32Yamamoto S. Hase S. Fukuda S. Sano O. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mixture of PA oligosaccharides was sequentially fractionated and isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography on a TSK-gel Amide-80 column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and a Shim-pack HRC-octadecyl silica column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) as described in the literature (33Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). M9.1 and M9.2 were successfully isolated from IgY as PA derivatives. To prepare the analogues of the monoglucosylated high mannose-type oligosaccharides, 1 nmol of GlcMan9GlcNAc2-PA (M9.2) was digested with 2 milliunits of α-mannosidase from jack bean (Seikagaku Kogyo Co.) in 40 μl of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 10 mm ZnSO4, at 37°C for 4 h. The digestion products, separated on Amide and octadecyl silica columns and then subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analyses, contained two isomers of GlcMan8GlcNAc2-PA, which had not been recorded in the GALAXY data base and are designated as M8.3 and M8.5 (31Tomiya N. Lee Y.C. Yoshida T. Wada Y. Awaya J. Kurono M. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Glucosidase II was purified from rat liver microsomes as described by Trombetta et al. (34Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Glucosidase II treatments of M8.3 and M8.5 gave rise to M8.1 and M8.2, respectively, which had already been recorded in GALAXY, indicating that the structures of M8.3 and M8.5 are Manα1-2Manα1-6(Manα1-3)Manα1-6(Glcα1-3Manα1-2-Manα1-2Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA and Manα1-6(Manα1-2Manα1-3)Manα1-6(Glcα1-3Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA, respectively. Extensive α-mannosidase digestion of GlcMan9GlcNAc2-PA, using 1 unit of the enzyme for 1 nmol of the oligosaccharide in 40 μl of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 10 mm ZnSO4, at 37 °C for 27 h, resulted in production of GlcMan5GlcNAc2-PA (designated as M5.5 (31Tomiya N. Lee Y.C. Yoshida T. Wada Y. Awaya J. Kurono M. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)), which was confirmed by a MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Hence, the PA sugar library used in the present study consists of 21 kinds of oligosaccharides, including high mannose-type, hybrid-type, and complex-type oligosaccharides. Protein Expression—The DNA fragment encoding amino acids residues 45-296 of human VIP36, which was designated VIP36-CRD, was cloned into the pET-3c plasmid vector with a C-terminal poly(H) tag moiety. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain (Stratagene) in LB medium. Production of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 0.08 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The poly(H) fusion protein was purified from cell lysates with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was cleaved by incubation with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the poly(H) tag was removed by dialysis. The protein was further purified using a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). FAC Analysis—0.4 mm VIP36-CRD was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, containing 0.1 md-mannose and coupled to the HiTrap NHS-activated column following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After immobilization, the agarose beads were taken out from the cartridge and packed into a stainless steel column (4.0 × 10 mm) (GL Sciences). FAC analysis was carried out as described previously (27Kasai K. Oda Y. Nishikawa M. Ishii S. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 376: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Arata Y. Hirabayashi J.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PA oligosaccharides were dissolved at a concentration of 10 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0-7.5), or 10 mm MES (pH 5.5-6.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA and applied onto the VIP36-CRD column at a flow late of 0.25 ml/min at 20 °C. The elution profile was monitored by the fluorescence intensity at 400 nm (excitation at 320 nm). The retardation compared with the control oligosaccharide was computed using the difference of each elution volume, Vf. The dissociation constant, Kd, of VIP36-CRD for Man9GlcNAc2-PA (M9.1) was determined using equation 1 (28Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), [A]o.(Vf−Vo) = Bt−Kd.(Vf−V0)(Eq. 1) where [A]0, V0, and Bt are initial concentration of the PA oligosaccharide, the elution volume of the control sugar, and the total amount of immobilized VIP36-CRD in the column, respectively. The elution profile was monitored by UV light absorption at 300 nm to avoid possible quenching caused by the relatively high concentration of the PA sugar. For the determination of V0, 50 μmp-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was used. Kd (= 1/Ka) was calculated based on the retardation Vf-V0 measured at concentrations of 150, 100, 50, 25, and 10 mm M9.1. The relative affinity of each oligosaccharide was calculated under conditions where [A]0 is negligibly small compared with Kd, using Equation 2. Vf−V0=Bt/Kd(Eq. 2) In this case, the heptasaccharide Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4(Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3)Galβ1-4Glc-PA was used as a control sugar to determine V0. Ka values are mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Characterization of Sugar-binding Specificity of VIP36 by the FAC Analysis—In this study, we constructed a PA sugar library for the FAC analyses to determine the sugar-binding specificity of VIP36-CRD. Fig. 1 shows typical elution profiles of the PA oligosaccharides overlaid with that of the control sugar. Based on the retardation volume Vf-V0, we could estimate relative affinities of the individual PA oligosaccharides for VIP36-CRD. The Ka of VIP36-CRD for M9.1 was determined as 0.97 (±0.02) × 104m-1 on the basis of dependence of retardation on the ligand concentration. The obtained data were treated according to Equation 1 (Fig. 2). The value of Kd was calculated from the slope, which corresponds to -Kd. The Bt value, which was obtained from the intercept on the ordinate, was 2.1 × 10-8 mol for the immobilized VIP36-CRD column. Inspection of these data allows us to calculate Ka values for all other PA oligosaccharides using Equation 2 (TABLE ONE). The PA sugars with higher affinities for VIP36-CRD are all high mannose-type possessing the Manα1-2Manα1-2Man branch (D1 branch), i.e. M9.1, M8.1, M8.2, and M7.1. Glucosylation or trimming of the D1 arm resulted in significant reduction in affinity for VIP36-CRD. The complex- and hybrid-type oligosaccharides were shown to exhibit lower affinities, which is consistent with the previous analysis (26Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Determination of Ka of M9.1 and Bt for the immobilized VIP36-CRD. M9.1 was dissolved in 10 mm MES containing 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.0, at various concentrations (10-150 μm). The value of Kd can be determined from the slope of the linear plot of [A]0 (Vf-V0) versus (Vf-V0) according to Equation 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE ONEStructures of PA oligosaccharides from N-glycans used in this study and the obtained Ka values for VIP36-CRD immobilized column Open table in a new tab Ca2+ and pH Dependence of Sugar Binding of VIP36-CRD—Next, we analyzed the Ca2+ and pH dependence of the sugar-binding affinity of VIP36-CRD by the FAC method. Fig. 3 shows the elution profiles of M9.1 on the VIP36-CRD affinity column in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. No significant retardation of elution of M9.1 was observed in the presence of EDTA, indicating that Ca2+ is required for sugar binding of VIP36-CRD. Both ERGIC-53 and VIP36 possess two Ca2+-binding sites in their CRDs. The x-ray crystallographic study of the CRD of p58/ERGIC-53 has revealed that one Ca2+-binding site consists of Asp-160, Phe-162, Asn-164, and Asp-189, and the other is composed of Asp-163, Asp-165, Asn-169, Asn-170, and Asp-189 (16Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues, forming the former Ca2+-binding site are all conserved in VIP36-CRD. There exists one conserved histidine residue (His-178 and His-190 in ERGIC-53 and VIP36, respectively) in close proximity in this Ca2+-binding site. A neutral mutation of His-178 inactivated the lectin function of ERGIC-53 (24Appenzeller-Herzog C. Roche A.C. Nufer O. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12943-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of a mutation of His-190 on the sugar binding of VIP36-CRD by the FAC method. A His→ Tyr substitution at position 190 resulted in the disappearance of the retardation of the elution of M9.1, indicating that His-190 plays an essential role in the sugar binding of VIP36-CRD (data not shown). Finally, we analyzed the pH dependence of the sugar binding of VIP36-CRD. Fig. 4 shows the Ka values under varying pH conditions of VIP36-CRD for M9.1, which exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence with a maximum near pH 6.5. VIP36 has been reported to recognize high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing Manα1-2Man residues (26Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we attempted to estimate the contribution to VIP36 binding of the individual mannosyl branches of high mannose-type oligosaccharides by use of the sugar library, including isomeric PA oligosaccharides. The present study exemplifies that the FAC method is extremely powerful in analyzing weak interactions in a quantitative manner. The Ka values of VIP36-CRD for the PA oligosaccharides assessed in the present study were in the range 0.07-1.16 × 104m-1 (TABLE ONE). Such a low affinity binding is widely observed for lectin-carbohydrate interaction systems, which often adopt affinity enhancement by multivalent interaction (35Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that VIP36 clusters on the luminal membrane and thereby achieves affinity enhancement due to multiple interactions with its cargos. We have revealed that VIP36 preferentially binds the D1 branch of high mannose-type oligosaccharides. Principally, the FAC data has shown that glucosylation and trimming of the D1 mannosyl branch interfere with the binding of VIP36-CRD. A cycle of glucose trimming by glucosidase II and reglucosylation by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase coupled with the correct folding of some glycoproteins in the ER, which is assisted by calnexin and/or calreticulin (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 36Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The D1 arm is trimmed by cis-Golgi mannosidase I, giving rise to the Man5GlcNAc2 structure, which also has a lower affinity for VIP36-CRD (6Moremen K.W. Ernst B. Hart G.W. Sinay P. Carbohydrates in Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 3. 2000: 81-117Google Scholar, 38Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). These data indicate that VIP36 exhibits optimal binding affinities for the glycoproteins that leave the calnexin/calreticulin cycle in the ER and yet do not undergo trimming of the D1 mannosyl branch in the cis-Golgi (Fig. 5). The present FAC data also suggest that the affinity for cargos of VIP36 is nominally affected by mannose trimming by ER mannosidases I and II, which gives rise to Man8 and Man7 structures (5Spiro R.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1025-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sugar binding of ERGIC-53 has shown to be Ca2+-dependent (24Appenzeller-Herzog C. Roche A.C. Nufer O. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12943-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Appenzeller et al. (22Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) have reported that the efficiency of cross-linking of ERGIC-53 and its cargo was reduced in Lec1 cells treated with castanospermine, indicating that sugar binding of ERGIC-53 is affected by untrimmed glucose residues. Taken together, our data suggest that ERGIC-53 and VIP36 share common sugar-binding specificities. However, there exist significant differences in the pH dependence of sugar binding between them. ERGIC-53 efficiently binds immobilized mannose at pH 7.4 but not at slightly lower pH, whereas VIP36 exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence of binding to M9.1, with optimal pH values of ∼6.5. Similar pH dependence has been reported for the binding of VIP36 to secretory and postnuclear supernatant proteins (26Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In ERGIC-53, on the basis of the mutagenesis data, ionization of His-178, which is located in the α-helix participating in the Ca2+ coordination, has been suggested to lead to the loss of Ca2+ in the sugar-binding pocket, thereby resulting in a reduction of its lectin activity upon acidification (24Appenzeller-Herzog C. Roche A.C. Nufer O. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12943-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the data presented here suggest that ionization of His-190 of VIP36, which corresponds to His-178 of ERGIC-53, is similarly responsible for the decrease in its sugar-binding affinity to below pH 6.5, the bell-shaped pH dependence cannot be attributed to a single titratable group. There exist several titratable groups, e.g. His-129, in the proximity of the putative sugar-binding site of VIP36-CRD, which was predicted based on the crystal structure of p58-CRD (15Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues are candidates for pH sensing. Further structural and mutational analyses of VIP36-CRD will help to identify the amino acid residue(s) responsible for the pH dependence of sugar binding. There is progressive acidification from the ER through Golgi to the trans-Golgi network because of H+ pumping by v-ATPase (41Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The typical pH values of the ER, cis-Golgi, and trans-Golgi network have been reported to be 7.2, 6.4, and 5.4, respectively (41Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 42Wu M.M. Grabe M. Adams S. Tsien R.Y. Moore H.P. Machen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33027-33035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ERGIC-53 binds to the glycoprotein cargo in the ER and dissociates before reaching the cis-Golgi (22Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which is consistent with its pH dependence of sugar binding (24Appenzeller-Herzog C. Roche A.C. Nufer O. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12943-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By inspection of the specificity and optimal pH of the sugar binding of VIP36 and its subcellular localization, together with the organellar pH, we suggest that VIP36 binds glycoproteins retaining the intact D1 mannosyl branch in the cis-Golgi network and recycles to the ER, where it releases the cargos due to higher pH. It is possible that VIP36 catches and retrieves glycoproteins that have escaped the trimming of the D1 branch, and glycoprotein carrying the correctly trimmed high mannose-type oligosaccharides or more mature hybrid- or complex-type oligosaccharides can no longer interact with VIP36 and move in the secretory pathway. It has been shown that imperfectly folded or partially assembled proteins that exit the ER fail to escape the early secretory system entirely, because they are retrogradely transported from post-ER compartments to the ER (43Hsu V.W. Yuan L.C. Nuchtern J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hammerling G.J. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 44Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This retrieval mechanism is mediated at least partially by interactions between proteins possessing a C-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) sequence, such as immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) and the KDEL receptor (40Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A cross-linking experiment has demonstrated that VIP36 interacts with BiP in HEK293 cells (37Nawa D. Matsumoto N. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2004; 14 (abstr.): 1108Google Scholar). One intriguing possibility is that VIP36 contributes to the retrograde transport of some misfolded or partially assembled glycoproteins in cooperation with BiP and the KDEL receptor, protecting the D1 branch of the cargos, which is subjected to quality control in the ER afterward, against the attack of cis-Golgi mannosidase I. In summary, our study provides direct evidence that VIP36 binds the D1 mannosyl branch of its target glycoproteins, which is tightly associated with quality control at the ER."

The 15-kDa selenoprotein (Sep15) has been implicated in the chemopreventive effect of dietary selenium. Although the precise function of Sep15 remains elusive, Sep15 co-purifies with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT), an essential regulator of quality control mechanisms within the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent studies identified two GT and two Sep15 homologues in mammals. We characterize interactions between these protein families in this report. Sep15 and GT form a tight 1:1 complex, and these interactions are conserved between mammals and fruit flies. In mammalian cells, Sep15 co-immunoprecipitates with both GT isozymes. In contrast, a Sep15 homologue, designated selenoprotein M (SelM), does not form a complex with GT. Sequence analysis of members of the Sep15 family identified a novel N-terminal cysteine-rich domain in Sep15 that is absent in SelM. This domain contains six conserved cysteine residues that form two CxxC motifs that do not coordinate metal ions. If this domain is deleted or the cysteines are mutated, Sep15 no longer forms a complex with GT. Conversely, if the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 is fused to the N-terminus of SelM, the resulting chimera is capable of binding GT. These data indicate that the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 exclusively mediates protein-protein interactions with GT.

The calnexin cycle is a quality control pathway localized to the endoplasmic reticulum that specifically assists in the folding of N-linked glycoproteins (12Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Once a newly synthesized protein enters the endoplasmic reticulum, a glycan core of 14-oligosaccharides (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is covalently linked to appropriate asparagine residues. N-Linked glycoproteins are immediately recognized by glucosidase I and II, the first components of the calnexin cycle, which sequentially trim the two outermost glucose moieties from the glycan core (13Pelletier M.F.

This triggers the binding of ERp57 (a lumenal protein disulfide isomerase) to calnexin and calreticulin and accelerates folding by catalyzing disulfide bond exchange (18Zapun A. Darby N.J.

Regardless of the folded status of the bound glycoprotein, glucosidase II cleaves the remaining glucose residue and the complex disassociates, releasing the glycoprotein. If the glycoprotein is properly folded, it is rapidly exported from the endoplasmic reticulum by vesicular transport to the Golgi complex. Misfolded proteins are re-glucosylated by GT, a 175-kDa lumenal enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to the distal mannose of the glycan core (23Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This event creates a retention signal that re-initiates the calnexin cycle. In this quality control pathway, GT functions as the folding sensor that assesses the folded status of glycoproteins. Although we do not understand how GT senses structural fidelity, several important clues have been revealed. (i) Sensing involves the innermost (and normally buried) N-GlcNAc glycosidic bond of the glycoprotein (24Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 25Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). (ii) GT preferentially monoglucosylates partially folded late folding intermediates as compared with their fully denatured counterparts (26Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. De Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46280-46285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). (iii) GT is capable of distinguishing folded from misfolded domains within a single polypeptide (29Ritter C. Helenius A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Ritter C. Quirin K. Kowarik M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). (iv) Localized folding defects in otherwise correctly folded glycoproteins or individual domains are recognized by GT (30Ritter C. Quirin K. Kowarik M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Taylor S.C. Ferguson A.D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). (v) GT monitors the tertiary and quaternary structures of glycoproteins (32Keith N. Parodi A.J. Caramelo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18138-18141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the sequence diversity of glycoproteins, it is unlikely that the recognition mechanism used by GT involves a specific primary structure motif. A more robust mechanism, involving common biophysical properties of misfolded proteins, seems more plausible. Accordingly, the distribution of glycans and their spatial relationship to normally surface-inaccessible hydrophobic residues influence the order in which polypeptide segments achieve their native conformation (12Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 27Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. De Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46280-46285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GT preferentially recognizes hydrophobic motifs proximal to glycosylation sites in glycopeptides (33Taylor S.C. Thibault P. Tessier D.C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The efficiency of glucosylation can be positively correlated with the spatial proximity of site-directed mutations to each glycan, lending support to the idea that normally buried hydrophobic residues found adjacent to glycans mediate interactions with GT (31Taylor S.C. Ferguson A.D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our initial findings of the interaction between mammalian Sep15 and GT (11Korotkov K.V. Kumaraswamy E. Zhou Y. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15330-15336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that Sep15 might be a misfolded glycoprotein. Although Sep15 does not contain an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence, it is neither secreted or glycosylated, suggesting that this selenoprotein might function as a co-factor that assists GT in assessing structural fidelity. Sep15 deficiencies observed in tumors may also impair GT-mediated regulation of the calnexin cycle. In this report, we characterize interactions between members of Sep15 and GT protein families. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to demonstrate that Sep15 forms a 1:1 complex with GT with an apparent Kd value of 20 nm. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation revealed that Sep15 binds to both human GT isozymes. Although selenoprotein M (SelM) shares significant sequence homology with Sep15 and has also been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, it does not form a complex with GT. The interaction between Sep15 and GT is exclusively mediated by a novel cysteine-rich domain located at the N-terminus of Sep15. This conserved domain is present in other functional Sep15 homologues and contains six conserved cysteine residues that do not coordinate metal ions. When the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 is removed, it no longer forms a complex with GT. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to demonstrate that the structural integrity of the cysteine-rich domain is an essential factor in the ability of Sep15 to bind GT. Plasmids—Genes encoding Mus musculus Sep15 and SelM were PCR amplified from cDNA clones using the following primers: 5′-CATTAGTATCTAATCTCGAGGGCAGACCGCAGGGAT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGGGATACTCTAGAGCG-3′ (Sep15) and 5′-ATCTCGAGATGAGCATCCTACTGTCGCCGCCGTC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTACAGGTCGTCGTGTTCTGAAGCTTCCTCG-5′ (SelM). Both PCR products were digested with XhoI and NotI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector (Promega). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate these genes. The following mutagenic primers were used to replace naturally occurring selenocysteine residues: U93C (5′-CTTGAAGTCTGCGGATGTAAATTGGGGAGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAACCTCCCCAATTTACATCCGCAGACTTCAAG-3′) (designated Sep15-U93C) and U48C (5′-GACCTGTGGAGGATGTCAGTTGAATCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGATTCAACTGACATCCTCCACAGGTC-3′) (designated SelM-U48C). Expected sequence changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Sep15-U93C served as the template to introduce a C-terminal hexahistidine-tag with the following primers: 5′-CATTAGTATCTAATCTCGAGGGCAGACCGCAGGGAT-3′ and 5′-TCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTATGCGTTCCAACTTCTCGCTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of His-tagged Sep15-U93C was performed with the following mutagenic primers: Sep15-C38SU93C (5′-GTTTGCGTCAGAGGCATCCAGAGAGTTGGGTTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAACCCAACTCTCTGGATGCCTCTGACGCAAAC-3′), Sep15-C49SU93C (5′-CCAGCAACTTGCTCTCCAGCTCTTGCGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCGCAAGAGCTGGAGAGCAAGTTGCTGG-3′), Sep15-C52SU93C (5′-CTCTGCAGCTCTTCCGATCTTCTTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCAAGAAGATCGGAAGAGCTGCAGAG-3′), Sep15-C67SU93C (5′-CACTGGACCCTGTTTCCAGAGGGTGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GACAGCACCCTCTGGAAACAGGGTCCAGTG-3′), Sep15-C70SU93C (5′-GTTTGCAGAGGGTCCTGTCAGGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTCCTGACAGGACCCTCTGCAAAC-3′), Sep15-C71SU93C (5′-GCAGAGGGTGCTCTCAGGAAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTTCCTGAGAGCACCCTCTGC-3′). Expected sequence changes were verified by DNA sequencing. A fusion protein of Sep15 and SelM from mouse (designated Sep15::SelM) was generated by fusing the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 to the N-terminus of SelM. The cysteine-rich domain of Sep15, together with its native signal peptide, was PCR amplified using the following primers: 5′-TATAGACTAGACTCGAGGGCAGACCGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCAGACTTCAAGGATGAATTCTGCATACAGCTTTTTGG-3′. This PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector. SelM-U48C was PCR amplified without its signal peptide using the following primers: 5′-CTTGTGGCTCCAGCCGAATTCACCACCAACTACCGACC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTACAGGTCGTCGTGTTCTGAAGCTTCCTCG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector containing the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15. Mammalian expression vectors encoding protein C (PC)-tagged human GT1 and GT2 have been described previously (34Arnold S.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43320-43328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The gene encoding Sep15 from Drosophila melanogaster was PCR amplified from an expressed sequence tag clone using the following primers: 5′-TGCTCGAGCAAATTGGCGCCGAATTGACGGCCGCCGACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTTTGGGTATGGGTACCTTAGATCCTGTTGGTTCGCAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EheI and KpnI and ligated into Baculovirus expression vector pFastBac-HTa (Invitrogen). A previously described cDNA clone (35Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) served as the template to introduce a C-terminal hexahistidine-tag into Drosophila GT. To improve secretion from insect cells the native signal sequence was replaced with the honeybee melittin signal peptide. Moreover, the C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence was removed. Primer sequences are available upon request. Cell Growth, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—Mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to ∼80% confluence. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For each 60-mm plate, 2 μg of DNA, 8 μl of PLUS reagent, and 12 μl of Lipofectamine were used. Protein extracts were prepared 48 h following transfection with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Igepal CA-630 detergent, 0.5% deoxycholate, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Once cleared of cellular debris, cell lysates were incubated overnight with 50 μl of anti-PC affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Igepal CA-630 detergent, and 0.5% deoxycholate and once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630 detergent, and 0.05% deoxycholate. Proteins were eluted with 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using anti-His-tag, anti-PC, anti-Sep15, and anti-SelM antibodies. Native Gel Electrophoresis—Recombinant Drosophila Sep15 and GT proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography. Complexes of Sep15 and GT were prepared by incubating 5 μg of GT dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm CaCl2 with the indicated amounts of Sep15 for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were subjected to non-denaturing PAGE using Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The Sep15-GT complex was visualized by Western blotting with Sep15-specific antibodies. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The apparent association constant for Sep15 binding to GT was determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. Protein solutions of Drosophila Sep15 and GT were dialyzed for 2 days against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. The concentrations of both proteins were determined using Beer's law. This experiment consisted of a series of 8-μl injections of Sep15 into a cell containing 1.4 ml of GT equilibrated at 20 °C. Heats associated with Sep15 binding to GT were measured by an isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal). The apparent association constant derived from these data were determined using software included with the calorimeter. Metal Ion Analysis—The concentrations of twenty biologically relevant metal ions were determined by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrometry at the Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia. Protein samples dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole were analyzed. Metal ion concentrations were calculated by subtracting the ion content of the buffer from that of the protein sample. Sep15, but Not SelM, Interacts with Human GT Homologues—Sep15 is a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that has been previously shown to form a complex with GT when purified from rat and mouse liver (11Korotkov K.V. Kumaraswamy E. Zhou Y. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15330-15336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Two human GT homologues (GT1 and GT2) have been identified (36Arnold S.M. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2149-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These enzymes are highly homologous and display 83% sequence identity in their proposed C-terminal catalytic domains. However, their N-terminal non-catalytic domains are more diverse (49% sequence identity), and only GT1 displays measurable catalytic activity. To assess whether Sep15 functions as a protein co-factor that binds both GT isozymes, mouse Sep15 was co-expressed with PC-tagged GT1 or GT2 in NIH 3T3 cells. Sep15 co-immunoprecipitated with GT1 and GT2 (Fig. 1A), indicating that both human GT isozymes are capable of binding Sep15 in vivo. The reduced intensity of the Sep15 signal observed with GT2 is consistent with its lower level of expression as compared with that of GT1. The recently described selenoprotein SelM (37Korotkov K.V. Novoselov S.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) shares 31% sequence identity with Sep15 (Fig. 2, A and B). Both proteins encode a single selenocysteine residue. Primary sequence alignments illustrate that SelM has an elongated C terminus, whereas Sep15 possesses an extended cysteine-rich N terminus. The N-terminal sequence of Sep15 is conserved among functional Sep15 homologues and is conversely absent in sequence homologues of SelM (Fig. 2C). As observed with Sep15, selenoprotein SelM is also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Given the common intracellular location of Sep15 and SelM and their respective sequence homology, we speculated that SelM might also bind to GT. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that mouse SelM does not form a complex with either human GT1 or GT2 (Fig. 1B). Cysteine-rich Domain of Sep15 Mediates the Interaction with GT— The absence of an N-terminal extension in SelM suggested that this region of Sep15 may potentially mediate protein-protein interactions with GT. To test this hypothesis, the cysteine-rich N-terminal extension of mouse Sep15 was fused to the N terminus of mouse SelM. When expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, this mouse protein chimera co-immunoprecipitates with human GT1 (Fig. 3). These data suggest a functional role for the N-terminal extension of Sep15 in the formation of a complex with GT. Sequence analyses of the N-terminal domain of Sep15 proteins identified six conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 2C). Four of these six cysteine residues form a pair of CxxC motifs. To establish a structural and/or functional role for these cysteine residues and evaluate their potential involvement in constituting the GT-binding site, all cysteine residues were individually replaced with serine residues. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that formation of the Sep15-GT complex was abolished for each mutant (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the N-terminal extension of Sep15 forms a distinct cysteine-rich domain and that the structural integrity of this domain is required for Sep15 to form a complex with GT. Sep15 and GT Form a 1:1 Complex—One technical obstacle to investigating protein-protein interaction between Sep15 and GT is the naturally occurring selenocysteine residue encoded within the Sep15 gene. Selenocysteine-containing proteins are frequently difficult to express and purify. However, the Sep15 protein of Drosophila is not a selenoprotein and encodes two cysteine residues in place of the CxU motif (Fig. 2B). To examine the binding between Drosophila Sep15 and GT, both recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from Sf9 cells. Formation of the complex between Sep15 and GT was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 5). Western blotting using antibodies specific for Sep15 detected a low molecular weight band corresponding to unbound Sep15 in addition to a higher molecular weight band that co-migrates with GT. Several minor low molecular weight bands were also detected, indicating that Sep15 may form homomultimers and/or is degraded under these experimental conditions. The band intensity of the Sep15-GT complex continued to increase as the molar equivalents of Sep15 and GT were increased from 0.2 to 2.0, at which point the amount of unbound and GT-bound Sep15 became equivalent. The stoichiometry of the Sep15-GT complex was precisely determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 6). Sep15 forms a 1:1 complex with GT with an apparent Kd value of 20 nm. The mixed species Sep15::SelM chimera also bound tightly to GT (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, no interactions were observed for SelM and Sep15 without its N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. These isothermal titration calorimetry results were confirmed by measuring the intensity of the strongest methyl resonance by one-dimensional 15N-edited proton NMR spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S2). A decrease in the strongest methyl resonance intensity in the proton NMR spectrum of the protein mixture in comparison to the added strongest methyl resonance intensities of the individual proteins indicates specific protein-protein interactions (38Araç D. Murphy T. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with co-immunoprecipitation and isothermal titration calorimetry data, these NMR data indicate that both Sep15 and the Sep15::SelM chimera form complexes with GT. Conversely, SelM and Sep15 without its corresponding cysteine-rich domain do not bind to GT. Taken together these complementary techniques demonstrate that the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 mediates that formation of a tight 1:1 complex with GT. Formation of the Sep15-GT Complex Is Not Mediated by Coordinated Metal Ions—Four of the six conserved cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 form two CxxC motifs, which are typically involved in metal ion coordination. To establish whether the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 does coordinate metal ions, we further analyzed Drosophila Sep15. When expressed in bacterial or insect cells, purified Sep15 protein was colorless. Moreover, UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis revealed only a single peak centered at 280 nm, indicating the absence of certain co-factors and iron-sulfur clusters. Sep15 protein samples were also analyzed for the presence of twenty biologically relevant metal ions by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrometry. Only Co2+ was detected (0.24 molar equivalents), which is most likely non-specifically bound during protein purification by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography using cobalt-based resin. These data suggest that the cysteine-rich domain itself does not coordinate metal ions. It has been previously reported that the catalytic activity of GT is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations (preferably Ca2+) (39Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although metal ions were not detected in Sep15 protein preparations, it is possible that metal ions mediate the interaction between Sep15 and GT. To address this possibility, complex formation between Sep15 and GT was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions in the absence and presence of 1 mm Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+. However, the Sep15-GT complex was observed independently of the presence of metal ions (data not shown). These results indicate that formation of the Sep15-GT complex is not mediated by coordinated metal ions. Sep15 Does Not Affect Glucosylation of Thyroglobulin—The association of Sep15 with GT suggests that this selenoprotein may modulate the enzymatic activity of GT and/or be involved in assessing structural fidelity. To test this hypothesis, GT activity in the presence of Sep15 was analyzed by monitoring the amount of incorporated [14C]glucose into denatured thyroglobulin. The presence of Sep15 did not affect the GT activity toward this protein (supplemental Fig. S3). These results indicate that, at least in the case of thyroglobulin, Sep15 does not modulate GT activity and is not required for glucosylation under these experimental conditions. Selenoproteins have not been previously shown to participate in the quality control networks of the endoplasmic reticulum. The observation that Sep15 co-purifies with the essential regulator of the calnexin cycle suggests a potential mechanism for the chemopreventive effects of dietary selenium (11Korotkov K.V. Kumaraswamy E. Zhou Y. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15330-15336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized interactions between members of Sep15 and GT families using a series of complementary genetic and biophysical techniques and found that this selenoprotein interacts with both human GT isozymes. The 1:1 stoichiometry of this complex has an apparent Kd value of 20 nm as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry using Sep15 and GT from Drosophila. In contrast, SelM (a sequence homologue of Sep15) does not interact with GT. Multiple sequence analyses identified a novel cysteine-rich domain that is conserved among the N termini of Sep15 proteins, which is not found in the sequences of SelM proteins. If the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 is deleted, the truncated Sep15 protein no longer interacts with GT. However, when the cysteine-rich domain of Sep15 is fused to the N terminus of SelM, the resulting Sep15::SelM protein chimera forms a complex with GT. The sequence of the cysteine-rich domain is highly conserved among Sep15 homologues from plants to humans (40Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), suggesting that interactions between Sep15 and GT have been conserved throughout evolution. Mutating any one of these six conserved cysteine residues disrupts the interaction between Sep15 and GT. As four of these six cysteine residues form a pair of CxxC motifs, we speculated that these motifs might coordinate metal ions, such as iron or zinc. However, metal ion analysis of purified Sep15 protein samples did not identify specifically bound metal ions. It is more likely that these conserved cysteine residues form intramolecular disulfide bonds. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues may disrupt the proper arrangement of these disulfide bonds and compromise the structural integrity of the cysteine-rich domain, which in turn inhibits protein-protein interaction between Sep15 and GT. Taken together, these data unequivocally demonstrate that the cysteine-rich domain mediates the interaction between Sep15 and GT. However, the corresponding regions of GT that are involved in forming the binding surface for Sep15 remain to be established. The fact that Sep15 does not possess the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and its N-terminal part is responsible for maintaining Sep15 in the endoplasmic reticulum (41Kumaraswamy E. Korotkov K.V. Diamond A.M. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggests that its location in this cellular compartment is the result of the interaction with GT. The biological significance of protein-protein interactions between Sep15 and GT within the endoplasmic reticulum is poorly understood. One possibility is that Sep15 modulates the enzymatic activity of GT by functioning as a protein co-factor that assists this folding sensor in assessing the structural fidelity of misfolded glycoproteins. However, our data show that GT-mediated labeling of thyroglobulin is not directly affected by Sep15. Sep15 appears to occur exclusively in the complex with GT, whereas GT is present in both selenoprotein-bound and selenoprotein-free form (11Korotkov K.V. Kumaraswamy E. Zhou Y. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15330-15336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Sep15 is not required for the GT function per se but may be required for the recognition of glycoproteins with incorrectly formed disulfide bonds. It is an attractive possibility that the unusual CxU motif of Sep15 may participate in the reduction, isomerization, or oxidation of disulfide bonds of glycoprotein substrates of GT. We thank S. M. Arnold and R. J. Kaufman for providing human GT expression constructs, D. Araç and J. Rizo for their assistance with NMR data collection, C. A.

https://openalex.org/W2022118749,"The Epstein-Barr virus early protein EB2 (also called BMLF1, Mta, or SM), a protein absolutely required for the production of infectious virions, shares properties with mRNA export factors. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified the human protein OTT3 as an EB2-interacting factor. OTT3 is a new member of the Spen (split end) family of proteins (huSHARP, huOTT1, DmSpen, and muMINT), which are characterized by several N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a highly conserved C-terminal SPOC (Spen Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal) domain that, in the case of SHARP, has been shown to interact with SMRT/NCoR corepressors. OTT3 is ubiquitously expressed as a 120-kDa protein. Transfected OTT3 is a nonshuttling nuclear protein that co-localizes with co-transfected EB2. We also showed that EB2 interacts with the SPOC domains of both OTT1 and SHARP proteins. Although the OTT3 interaction domain maps within the 40 N-terminal amino acids of EB2, OTT1 and SHARP interact within the C-terminal half of the protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the capacity of the OTT3 and OTT1 SPOC domains to interact with SMRT and repress transcription is far weaker than that of SHARP. Thus there is no evidence for a role of OTT3 in transcriptional regulation. Most interestingly, however, we have found that OTT3 has a role in splicing regulation; OTT3 represses accumulation of the alternatively spliced β-thalassemia mRNAs, but it has no effect on the β-globin constitutively spliced mRNA.

In eukaryotic cells, an intensely active bidirectional transfer of RNAs and proteins occurs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Several cellular factors involved in the export of mRNAs have been identified, including UAP56 (yeast Sub2p), REF (yeast Yra1p), and TAP (yeast Mex67p), that play a major role in the nuclear export of most mRNAs generated from intronless and intron-containing genes (for reviews see Refs. 1Cullen B.R.

Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More importantly, epithelial cells carrying an EBV genome with the EB2 gene deleted do not produce infectious virions, and this appears to be due to the inefficient nuclear export of a specific subset of early and late viral mRNAs (9Gruffat H. Batisse J. Pich D. Neuhierl B. Manet E. Hammerschmidt W. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9635-9644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which EB2 exports nuclear mRNAs to the cytoplasm remain elusive. Evidence that DNA transcription, mRNA processing, and mRNA export are coupled in yeast and mammalian cells has accumulated recently (for review see Refs. 16Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 17Dimaano C. Ullman K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In yeast, recruitment of nuclear export factors to nascent messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) appears to occur by direct interaction with RNA polymerase II (18Lei E.P. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or through interaction with the yeast elongation complex THO to form the TREX complex (TRanscription EXport complex) (19Farago M. Nahari T. Hammel C. Cole C.N. Choder M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2744-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The critical factors that are likely to be loaded onto nascent mRNPs during transcription are the yeast factors Sub2p and Yra1p (20Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 22Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or their mammalian homologs, respectively, UAP56 and Aly/REF (23Luo M.L. Zhou Z. Magni K. Christoforides C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Reed R. Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, splicing appears to largely influence the efficiency of mRNA export in mammalian cells. The first clue that splicing and mRNA export are coupled came from micro-injections studies of Xenopus oocytes, showing that splicing enhances the efficiency of mRNA export (24Luo M. Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14937-14942Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by the identification, in metazoans, of the exon junction complex, a multiprotein complex deposited some 20-24 nucleotides upstream of the exon-exon junction (25Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Ultimately, exon junction complex-associated mRNPs are directed to the nuclear pore complex by the interaction between Aly/REF and the soluble mRNA export heterodimer TAP/p15 (26Le Hir H. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) (Mex67p/Mtr2p in yeast) (27Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown recently that recruitment of the mammalian TREX complex (unlike that of the yeast TREX) is only indirectly coupled to transcription through splicing (28Masuda S. Das R. Cheng H. Hurt E. Dorman N. Reed R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1512-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, it must be emphasized that in yeast and mammalian cells, some mRNAs generated from intronless genes are also efficiently exported. Most interestingly, Sub2p (20Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), Yra1p (29Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Mex67p (30Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Lürhmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) in yeast and mammalian splicing factors SRp20, 9G8 (31Huang Y. Steitz J.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are essential for the export of these mRNAs transcribed from intronless genes through their interaction with TAP/p15. What emerges from the above findings is that splicing factors are essential for the loading of nuclear export factors onto mRNPs generated both from intron-containing and intronless genes. Moreover, in recent years, several transcriptional co-regulators have been found to play a role in other steps of gene expression, in particular splicing (for a review see Ref. 34Auboeuf D. Dowhan D.H. Dutetre M. Martin N. Berget S.M. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Among these transcriptional co-regulators, SHARP and the related protein OTT1 co-purify with the spliceosome (35Zhou Z. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be involved in splicing regulation and could participate in the loading of export factors onto mRNPs. SHARP (36Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and OTT1 (also called RBM15) (37Mercher T. Coniat M.B. Monni R. Mauchauffe M. Khac F.N. Gressin L. Mugneret F. Leblanc T.

Squire J. Scherer S.W. Hitzler J.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 220-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) are members of the Spen (split end) family of nuclear proteins. These proteins are conserved in man (huSHARP and huOTT1/RBM15), mouse (MuMint), Drosophila (DmSpen), and Caenorhabditis elegans (CeSpen) (39Ariyoshi M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). They are characterized by the presence of several RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) located at their N terminus and by a C-terminal conserved SPOC (Spen Paralog Ortholog C-terminal) domain. Recent crystallographic studies (39Ariyoshi M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggest that the SPOC domain of the Spen proteins directly interacts with SMRT/NCoR co-repressors and may have an essential function in repression of transcription. Indeed, Spen proteins have a repressor function in several signaling pathways. DmSpen is a tissue/promoter-specific regulator of Wingless signaling in larval tissues (40Lin H.V. Doroquez D.B. Cho S. Chen F. Rebay I. Cadigan K.M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and regulates neuronal cell fate and axon extension in the Drosophila embryo by reducing the level of the repressors Suppressor of Hairless and Yan, which are essential for Notch and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, respectively (41Kuang B. Wu S.C. Shin Y. Luo L. Kolodziej P. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1517-1529PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rebay I. Chen F. Hsiao F. Kolodziej P.A. Kuang B.H. Laverty T. Suh C. Voas M. Williams A. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 2000; 154: 695-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHARP is a component of co-repressor complexes recruited to the steroid receptor (36Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It also interacts with RBP-Jκ, which mediates Notch signaling (43Oswald F. Kostezka U. Astrahantseff K. Bourteele S. Dillinger K. Zechner U. Ludwig L. Wilda M. Hameister H. Knochel W. Liptay S. Schmid R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5417-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). MINT binds to and represses the function of Msx2, a homeodomain transcriptional repressor involved in skeletal and neural development (44Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the Spen proteins, in the course of their corepressor function, may potentially bind to RNA through interaction with spliceosome components. Here we have characterized a novel human Spen protein, OTT3, by virtue of its interaction with the EBV mRNA export factor EB2. OTT3 has three N-terminal RRMs and a C-terminal SPOC domain and is ubiquitously expressed. Most interestingly, we found that EB2 also interacted with the two other members of the Spen family known in man, SHARP and OTT1. SHARP was described previously as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the SMRT/NCoR co-repressor via its SPOC domain. We found that despite the similarity of structure of the SPOC domains of the three human proteins, OTT3, OTT1, and SHARP, only SHARP can efficiently recruit the SMRT co-repressor and repress transcription via this domain. Finally, we have shown that OTT3 functions in the repression of alternative splicing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using the MATCHMAKER system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An EBV-transformed human peripheral lymphocyte two-hybrid cDNA library and pGBT9-EB2 were co-transfected into the yeast strain YRG2. Yeast transformants were selected on Leu-Trp-His-depleted DOBA medium (Bio 101, Inc.) for 4 days at 30 °C. Clones positive for histidine expression were further tested for β-galactosidase activity using the classical colony lift filter assay. Clones positive in this second assay were selected and subjected to sequencing. Plasmids—A partial OTT3 cDNA containing the whole OTT3 coding sequence was reconstructed by assembling two I.M.A.G.E. Consortium/LLNL EST clones, BF309623 and AI910922. Clone BF309623 digested with EcoRI and XhoI and clone AI910922 digested with XhoI and XbaI were ligated in a three fragment reaction into a polylinkermodified version of the pSG5 vector (Amersham Biosciences) linearized with EcoRI and SpeI to give plasmid pSG5-OTT3. pSG5FLAG-OTT3 was constructed by PCR amplification of the OTT3 ORF and insertion as a fusion with the FLAG epitope into the polylinker of a modified version of pSG5FLAG. The following eukaryotic expression plasmids are all CMV immediate-early promoter-based vectors (pCI from Promega). When F precedes the name of the protein, the corresponding protein was tagged at its N terminus with a FLAG epitope, which can be detected with the monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). pCIF.EB2 contains the intronless BSLF2/BMLF1 cDNA.

The deletion was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GAGATTTCATCCTCAGAGGAGGAGGGCCACAAAAGGCGACGCGG-3′ and its complement on the opposite strand. In pCIF.EB2.ΔD, EB2 is deleted from aa 181 to 260. The deletion was generated as described above but with the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GCAACAGAGCAACCAGAGGTAAAGTGCAACCCAGACACGAG-3′ and its complement on the opposite strand. pCIF.EB2.N-ter contains the 184 N-terminal aa of EB2 and was generated by replacing an XhoI-XbaI fragment from pCIF.EB2 with a PCR fragment amplified from pCIF.EB2 using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TGCCTCGAGTTCCTTCTCAGAGAC-3′ and 5′-TGCTCTAGACTATTCTGACCGGGGACC-3′ and subsequently cut by XhoI-XbaI. pCIF.EB2.M1 has the 50 aa at the N-terminal end deleted. pSG5F.SMRT.VP16 was generated by subcloning a PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing sequences coding for the region between aa 981 and the C-terminal of human SMRT (45Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) into pSG5F.NLS.VP16, making a fusion with the SV40 T antigen NLS and the VP16 activation domain.

Transfections and Heterokaryon Assays—HeLa cells and NIH3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm diameter Petri dish 10 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed by the calcium precipitate method. Plasmids used for transfections were prepared by the alkaline lysis method and purified through two CsCl gradients. For the heterokaryon assays, 24 h post-transfection the precipitate was washed, and cells were trypsinized, and ∼2 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips with an equal number of NIH3T3 cells in 35-mm dishes. The cells were allowed to grow overnight and were then treated for 2 h with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the heterokaryon formation was carried out by incubating the coverslips for 2 min in 50% PEG 3000-3700 (Sigma) in PBS. Following cell fusion, coverslips were washed extensively in PBS and returned to fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide. After 2 h at 37°C, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed, essentially as described previously (12Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L.

An Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (H + L; Interchim) or a TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as a secondary antibody, and the nuclei of the cells were stained by incubation with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) solution at 5 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitations—For the co-immunoprecipitations of transiently expressed OTT3 and EB2 proteins, HeLa transfected cells were harvested from 100-mm dishes 48 h post-transfection and lysed in 1 ml of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were incubated with a rabbit anti-EB2 polyclonal antibody (51Buisson M. Manet E. Biemont M.C. Gruffat H. Durand B. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5276-5284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of the endogenous OTT3 protein, epithelial and B-cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Cell extracts were incubated with the anti-OTT3 mAb (1D2) for 2 h at 4 °C and then with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein-antibody complexes were purified using 30 ml of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunopurified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro GST Pull-down Assays—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus strain and affinity-purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-Labeled F.EB2, F.EB2 mutants, and SMRT-VP16 were produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription/translation TnT system (Promega). Binding reactions were carried out in 500 ml of MTPBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.3) for 1 h at 4°C, and then complexes bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were washed five times in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bands revealed by autoradiography were subsequently quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager. Quantification of CAT Protein—CAT protein expression was evaluated by using the CAT enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). RNA Purification and RT-PCR—Cytoplasmic RNAs were prepared by resuspending cells in 475 μl of Lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) that was kept in ice for 5 min before the addition of 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. After 5 min of incubation in ice, the nuclei were recovered by centrifugation. RNA was extracted from both the nuclei and the cytoplasmic fraction by using the Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). β-Globin and β-thalassemia transcripts were PCR-amplified from the reversed-transcribed cDNA using the following primers: pA (5′-CATTTGCTTCTGACACAACTG-3′) and pB (5′-GTGCAGCTCACTCAGTGTGGC-3′). Actin transcripts were PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-GCTGCGTGTGGCTCCCGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-ATCTTCATTGTGCTGGGTGCCAG-3′. Each PCR was performed in the presence of 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and the amplified fragments separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel were visualized by autoradiography. The conditions of the PCR were chosen so as to be in the linear range of the amplification evaluated by using various dilutions of the reverse-transcribed cDNA. HuOTT3 Is an EB2-interacting Protein—In order to isolate cofactors for the EBV EB2 protein, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using EB2 as a bait, and a human B-cell line cDNA library, which was cloned in pACT. We selected eight cDNA clones that all contained sequences identical to the 3′-end of the human chromosome 3p21.1 gene deposited in the GenBank™ data base under the name HUMAGCGB (accession number NM013286). Although a 563-aa-long protein sequence was proposed to be the HUMAGCGB gene product because the DNA sequence located upstream of the proposed start codon was relatively extensive and not interrupted by stop codons in the same frame, we suspected that the ORF could be longer. Therefore, we searched for additional 5′-sequences in the htgs and dbest data bases. Analysis of sequences found in the htgs data base and that overlapped with the 3p21.1 sequence allowed us to find a putative initiation codon 981 bp upstream from the first methionine of the protein described previously, with stop codons and promoter-like sequences lying upstream of this new ATG. A Blast search with the putative 890-amino acid protein sequence (Fig. 1A) revealed that it was related to the Spen (Split ends) family of proteins and had previously been named OTT3 following its identification in the data bases as being closely related to the OTT1 protein (37Mercher T.

To map functional epitopes of fimbriae that interact with these pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), we examined 20 synthetic peptides covering the entire length of the 41-kDa fimbrillin subunit. Using direct or competitive inhibition assays for receptor binding or cell activation, the CD14 binding activity of fimbriae was localized to residues 69–90 and was essential for TLR2-dependent cytokine induction. The CD11b/CD18 binding activity of fimbriae was localized to two neighboring epitopes defined by residues 166–185 and 206–225. Unlike epitope 69–90 that constitutively bound CD14, the CD11b/CD18 binding activity of epitopes 166–185 and 206–225 was inducible by integrin activators. The CD11b/CD18 binding activity played a contributory role to TLR2-dependent induction of tumor necrosis factor-α by fimbriae but was involved in specific down-regulation of interleukin-12. Cell activation by a combination of fimbrillin peptides corresponding to the CD14 and CD11b/CD18 binding activities resulted in higher tumor necrosis factor-α responses than would be expected from a simply additive effect, attributable to CD14-dependent inside-out signaling leading to enhanced binding interactions with CD11b/CD18. These data suggest that P. gingivalis fimbriae display a modular structure that interacts through discrete epitopes and in a regulated mode with distinct PRRs, which in turn differentially modulate the state of cell activation.

Periodontol. 2000. 2003; 31: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These cells express multiple PRRs, including CD14 and CD11b/CD18, which play an important accessory role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent innate immune and inflammatory responses (18Perera P.-Y.

It is thought that these PRRs function as TLR-associated co-receptors that detect microbial pathogens or components thereof and present them to TLRs for activation of signaling pathways (19Triantafilou M.

Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). In our efforts to determine the PRRs and the mechanisms involved in innate immune recognition of P. gingivalis fimbriae, we have found that CD14 directly binds fimbriae (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and mediates their ability to stimulate TLR2-dependent TNF-α release (14Hajishengallis G. Martin M.

Periodontol. 2002; 7: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The β2 integrin CD11b/CD18 is also involved in P. gingivalis fimbria-induced cell activation (23Hajishengallis G. Sharma A. Russell M.W. Genco R.J. Ann. Periodontol. 2002; 7: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although it does not constitutively recognize this bacterial molecule (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the ligand binding activity of CD11b/CD18 is stimulated through an inside-out signaling pathway that is activated by fimbriae and involves the participation of CD14, TLR2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Although CD14 and CD11b/CD18 function as constitutive and inducible binding receptors for fimbriae, respectively, it is unknown which fimbrial segments interact with which receptor. The objective of the current study was to identify fimbrial epitopes that interact with CD14 or CD11b/CD18 leading to cell activation. Our approach was based on the use of a series of synthetic peptides covering the entire length of the fimbrillin (FimA) subunit of P. gingivalis fimbriae. Similar FimA peptides were used previously to identify fimbrial domains interacting with fibronectin (8Sojar H.T. Lee J.-Y. Genco R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or salivary proteins (7Amano A. Sharma A. Lee J.Y. Sojar H.T. Raj P.A. Genco R.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1631-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that CD14 and CD11b/CD18 recognize distinct fimbrial domains; CD14 constitutively interacts with a domain corresponding to amino acid residues (aa) 69–90, whereas CD11b/CD18 inducibly interacts with fimbrial segments defined by aa 166–185 and 206–225. Moreover CD14 was found to be indispensable for cell activation by fimbrial peptide or intact protein, whereas fimbriae-CD11b/CD18 interactions are involved in both positive and negative regulation of innate immune responses. It appears, therefore, that P. gingivalis fimbriae interact through discrete domains with CD14 and CD11b/CD18, which in turn differentially modulate the activation state of monocytes/macrophages.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFimA Peptides—Synthetic peptides (17–22 aa) covering the entire length of P. gingivalis fimbrillin (FimA) (TABLE ONE), in standard or biotinylated form were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA) or the Peptide Synthesis Core Laboratories of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA. For control purposes, the reverse amino acid sequences were also synthesized for selected FimA peptides that gave positive results in cell activation assays (i.e. peptides 5, 11, and 13). All peptides were >95% pure (by high pressure liquid chromatography) and tested negative for endotoxic activity in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Native fimbriae were used as a positive control in the peptide experiments and were purified from P. gingivalis 381 as described previously (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J.

Incidental non-monocytes were removed by magnetic depletion using a mixture of biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and magnetic microbeads coupled to anti-biotin mAb (monocyte isolation kit II; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA).

Both cell lines were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Cytokine Induction Assays—Human monocytes, differentiated THP-1 cells, or mouse macrophages (1.5 × 105/well) were stimulated with FimA peptides (10–500 μg/ml) or native fimbriae (1–10 μg/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. For control purposes, cells were treated with medium supplemented with the appropriate concentration of Me2SO (vehicle control for peptide stimulation). Culture supernatants were collected at the end of the experiment and stored at -80 °C until assayed for TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-12 p70 responses using ELISA kits (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). None of the peptides or native protein affected cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion. In assays involving peptide interactions with activated human CD11b/CD18, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml VIM12 (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), an activating mAb to CD11b (32Stöckl J.

This is an ELISA-based procedure in which the detecting antibody recognizes an epitope of NF-κB p65 that is accessible only when NF-κB is activated and bound to its target DNA (containing the NF-κB consensus binding site 5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) attached to 96-well plates. Extract preparation and ELISA were carried out according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Monocytes were incubated with FimA peptides or native fimbriae as described above for cytokine induction assays except for the time used for stimulation; the optimal stimulation time (90 min) and the amount of total protein used in the ELISA (7.5 μg) were determined in earlier experiments (33Hajishengallis G. Martin M. Schifferle R.E. Genco R.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6658-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Hajishengallis G. Genco R.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).PI3K Activation Assay—PI3K activity was measured as enzymatic production of PI(3,4,5)P3 from PI(4,5)P2 substrate by means of a PI3K ELISA kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT). Briefly PI3K was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-PI3K antibody and protein A-agarose beads, and the bead-bound enzyme was subsequently incubated with 100 pmol of PI(4,5)P2 substrate in kinase reaction buffer (4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 25 μm ATP) for 2 h at room temperature. The generation of PI(3,4,5)P3 product was determined in competitive ELISA. Specifically the reaction product was incubated with PI(3,4,5)P3 detector protein for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, and the mixture was then added to a PI(3,4,5)P3-coated microplate for competitive binding. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, the plate was washed. The manufacturer's peroxidase-linked secondary reagent was then added to colorimetrically probe plate-bound PI(3,4,5)P3 detector protein. The colorimetric signal is inversely proportional to the amount of PI(3,4,5)P3 produced by PI3K activity, which was calculated from a calibration curve generated using known concentrations of PI(3,4,5)P3 standard.CD11b/CD18 Activation Assay—The CBRM1/5 epitope induction assay was used to monitor the activation state of CD11b/CD18 as we have described previously (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the property of the CBRM1/5 mAb to detect a conformational change on CD11b that signifies the high affinity binding state of CD11b/CD18 (35Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).CD14 Binding Assay—The binding of biotinylated FimA peptides (100 μg/ml) or native fimbriae (0.25 μg/ml) to plate-immobilized CD14 was determined as described previously (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) based on the method developed by Cunningham et al. (36Cunningham M.D. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Bainbridge B. Aruffo A. Darveau R.P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with 2 μg/ml CD14 or CD40 as receptor control (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Biotinylated fimbriae or peptides were allowed to bind to the plates for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, bound biotinylated molecules were detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin followed by addition of tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic substrate. The optical density signal at 450 nm was read in a Bio-Tek Instruments (Winooski, VT) microplate reader.Binding of FimA Peptides to Primary Cells or Cell Transfectants—Biotinylated FimA peptides (100 μg/ml) were allowed to bind to monocytes (1.5 × 105 cells/well) for 30 min at 37 °C in complete RPMI as described previously (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To activate the ligand binding capacity of CD11b/CD18, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with a 10 μg/ml concentration of the activating mAb VIM12 (Caltag) or for 10 min with 10-7mN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP; Sigma) (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following incubation with the biotinylated peptides, the cells were washed and incubated on ice with FITC-labeled streptavidin in the dark. After washing, binding was determined by measuring cell-associated fluorescence (in relative fluorescence units) on a microplate fluorescence reader (FL600; Bio-Tek Instruments) with excitation/emission wavelength settings of 485/530 nm. Background fluorescence was determined in cells treated with medium only and FITC-streptavidin. To investigate the blocking effect of mAbs to CD14 (MEM-18) or to CD11b (2LPM19c), the cells were pretreated for 30 min with mAb or IgG1 isotype control prior to addition of biotinylated peptides or fimbriae. Binding of biotinylated FimA peptides to cell surface CD14 was determined using the THP-1/CD14 cell line and the CD14-non-expressing control THP-1/RSV (26Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding assay was performed as outlined above for primary monocytes. To determine FimA peptide binding to CD11b/CD18 (also known as CR3), we used CHO/CR3 cells, while CHO/CR1 cells served as negative control. CHO/CR3 or CHO/CR1 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The following day the adherent cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and incubated with biotinylated FimA peptides in the presence of 100 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound peptides were removed by washing, and the cells were then incubated on ice with FITC-labeled streptavidin in the dark. After washing, the binding of peptides was determined by measuring cell-associated fluorescence as described above.Statistical Analysis—Data were evaluated by analysis of variance and the Dunnett multiple comparison test using the InStat program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Where appropriate (comparisons involving two groups only), two-tailed t tests were performed. Statistical differences were considered significant at the level of p < 0.05.RESULTSScreening of FimA Peptides for Induction of Cell Activation—A series of synthetic peptides (17–22 aa) covering the entire length of P. gingivalis fimbrillin (TABLE ONE) were examined for their ability to activate human primary monocytes or differentiated (macrophage-type) THP-1 cells. In a preliminary screening of the peptides for TNF-α induction in monocytes, only FimA peptide 5 (aa 69–90) induced TNF-α release at levels (283 ± 36 pg/ml) substantially higher than background levels (≤20 pg/ml) in unstimulated cells. However, we thought that FimA peptides that could potentially induce TNF-α release through interaction with CD11b/CD18 could not demonstrate this effect under the experimental conditions used. This is because CD11b/CD18 requires prior activation to effectively recognize ligands (37Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), although native fimbriae are capable of both activating and binding CD11b/CD18 (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, if these two activities involve discrete fimbrial regions, it appears somewhat unlikely that a relatively short (17–22-aa) peptide would contain both regions and thus retain both activities.Therefore, we repeated the preliminary experiment, and the peptides were now allowed to interact with monocytes in the absence or presence of VIM12 mAb, a CD11b/CD18 activator (32Stöckl J. Majdic O. Pickl W.F. Rosenkranz A. Prager E. Gschwantler E. Knapp W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5452-5463PubMed Google Scholar) that does not induce TNF-α release on its own (Fig. 1). Unlike most physiologic stimuli that activate CD11b/CD18 through inside-out signaling, VIM12 activates this integrin by binding to a CD11b site distal to the ligand-binding domain (32Stöckl J. Majdic O. Pickl W.F. Rosenkranz A. Prager E. Gschwantler E. Knapp W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5452-5463PubMed Google Scholar). We first confirmed that VIM12 induces the high affinity conformation of CD11b/CD18 (not shown), detected by the reporter mAb CBRM1/5 as we have described recently for other integrin activators (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the presence of VIM12 (but not of IgG1 isotype control), there was a dramatic increase in the ability of two FimA peptides for cell activation (Fig. 1). Specifically peptides 11 (aa 166–185) and 13 (aa 206–225) induced activation of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 1A) and release of TNF-α (Fig. 1, B and C) in VIM12-activated primary monocytes or differentiated THP-1 cells; the level of activation was almost comparable to that induced by native fimbriae (≤50%) (Fig. 1). On the other hand, peptide 5 (aa 69–90) induced modest activation of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 1A) and TNF-α release (Fig. 1, B and C) regardless of the presence or absence of VIM12. These data collectively suggest that the FimA regions defined by residues 69–90, 166–185, and 206–225 are involved in cell activation interactions. Further experiments were designed to better define those interactions and the PRRs involved.Interactions of FimA Peptides with CD14—We have previously shown that CD14 and CD11b/CD18 recognize native fimbriae in a constitutive or inducible mode, respectively (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that FimA peptide 5 may interact with CD14 because this peptide induces NF-κB activation and TNF-α release regardless of the activation state of CD11b/CD18 (Fig. 1). In contrast, FimA peptides 11 and 13 were hypothesized to interact with CD11b/CD18 because their ability for cell activation is strictly dependent upon the CD11b/CD18 activator VIM12 (Fig. 1).Using a CD14 binding assay developed for native fimbriae (22Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of biotinylated FimA peptide 5 to bind C"
https://openalex.org/W2109020239,"Biological visual systems are extraordinarily capable of recovering the shape and brightness of objects from sparse and fragmentary information. Using functional magnetic imaging, we show that two associative areas of the dorsal pathway--in the caudal region of the intrapariatal sulcus and in the lateral occipital sulcus--respond specifically to the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet illusion generated by high-pass filtered edges. Other visual areas, including primary visual cortex, also respond strongly to the retinotopic location of the edge, but these areas respond equally well to a line of matched contrast and detectability, rather than specifically to the brightness illusion. The reconstruction of surface and/or its brightness seems to be achieved by associative areas from the information about visual features provided by the primary visual cortices, even where there is no physical difference in luminance."
https://openalex.org/W2141766281,"The interactions of a range of synthetic peptidoglycan derivatives with PGRP-Iα and PGRP-S have been studied in real-time using surface plasmon resonance. A dissociation constant of KD = 62 μm was obtained for the interaction of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-Iα with the lysine-containing muramyl pentapeptide (compound 6). The normalized data for the lysine-containing muramyl tetra- (compound 5) and pentapeptide (compound 6) showed that these compounds have similar affinities, whereas a much lower affinity for muramyl tripeptide (compound 3) was measured. Similar affinities were obtained when the lysine moiety of the muramyl peptides was replaced by meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP). Furthermore, the compounds that contained only a stem peptide (pentapeptide, compound 1) and (DAP-PP, compound 2) as well as muramyldipeptide (compound 3) exhibited no binding indicating that the muramyltripeptide (compound 4) is the smallest peptidoglycan fragment that can be recognized by PGRP-Iα. Surprisingly, PGRP-S derived significantly higher affinities for the DAP-containing fragments to similar lysine-containing derivatives, and the following dissociation constants were measured: muramylpentapeptide-DAP, KD = 104 nm; muramyltetrapeptide-DAP, 92.4 nm; and muramyltripeptide-DAP, 326 nm.

It responds rapidly to highly conserved families of structural patterns, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 4The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PGN, peptidoglycan; TLR, Toll-like receptor; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; DAP, meso-diaminopimelic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; DMF, dimethylformamide; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MDP, muramyldipeptide; RU, resonance unit(s); Lys-PP, pentapeptide; MTP, muramyltripeptide; MTrP, muramyltetrapeptide; MPP, muramylpentapeptide; HRMS, high resolution mass spectrometry; PES, polyethersulfone. which are integral parts of pathogens, and are perceived as danger signals by the host. Examples of PAMPs include bacterial cell wall structures that are absent from the host such as lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid, mannans, DNA sequences containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, flagellin, and peptidoglycan (PGN) (2Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6246) Google Scholar, 3Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). The recognition of PAMPs is mediated by sets of highly conserved pattern recognition receptors (5Van Amersfoort E.S. Van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 379-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), each of which binds to a variety of PAMPs. Cellular activation by these receptors results in acute inflammatory responses that include the production of a diverse set of cytokines and chemokines, direct local attack against the invading pathogen, and the initiation of responses that activate and regulate the adaptive component of the immune response. The discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) less than a decade ago has advanced our understanding of the early events in microbial recognition and response and the subsequent development of an adaptive immune response (6Beutler B.

The Toll protein was first discovered in Drosophila, in which it has a pivotal role in embryonic development and microbial detection. Subsequently, a family of proteins structurally related to Toll was identified in higher organisms. Collectively, these transmembrane receptor proteins are referred to as TLRs. To date, eleven members of the mammalian TLR family have been identified, each potentially recognizing a discrete class of PAMP (13Tsan M.F. Gao B.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). For example, lipopolysaccharides are recognized by TLR4, bacterial flagellin by TLR5, double-stranded RNA by TLR3 (14Sarkar S.N. Peters K.L. Elco C.P. Sakamoto S. Pal S. Sen G.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and bacterial DNA by TLR9. The most recently discovered member of this family, TLR11, plays a critical role in the recognition and control of uropathogenic bacteria, and two recent studies have demonstrated that TLR3 is involved in the recognition of single-stranded viral RNA. Although it was initially believed that TLR2 in combination with TLR1 or TLR6 recognizes PGN, recent studies with highly purified PGN indicate otherwise (15Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Blanot D. Nahori M.A. Werts C. Boneca I.G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Instead, it appears that NOD proteins (NOD1 and NOD2) (16Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat.

Immunol. 2004; 40: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) are the pattern-recognition receptors that detect PGN. PGRPs are a relatively new class of pattern-recognition receptors that are highly conserved from insects to mammals (19Liu C. Xu Z.J. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 20Kang D.W. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These PGRPs can be divided in extracellular (e.g. PGRP-SA), transmembrane (e.g. PGRP-LC), and intracellular or secreted (e.g. PGRP-LE) proteins (18Dziarski R. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To date, four PGRPs have been discovered in humans, namely PGRP-S, PGRP-Iα, PGRP-Iβ, and PGRP-L (19Liu C. Xu Z.J. Gupta D.

In this respect, PGNs are large polymers composed of alternating β(1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 2Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev.

Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the amino acid composition of position 3 of the peptide chain, PGNs are classified as either l-lysine-type (Lys-type) or meso-diaminopimelic acid-type (DAP-type). The lysine-type, typical for Gram-positive bacteria, is normally connected to the d-Ala of another peptide chain by a short bridge varying in length and amino acid composition, depending on the bacteria. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacilli, DAP-type is normally found as the third amino acid and is directly connected to d-Ala of another peptide chain. Drosophila PGRP-SA has been shown to interact with lysine-type PGN, activating the Toll receptor pathway (23Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE recognize DAP-type PGN activating the Imd/Relish pathway (24Werner T. Borge-Renberg K.

PGRPs have high homology with the T7 lysozyme, a type 2 N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase that hydrolyzes the bond between MurNAc and l-Ala of PGN (29Cheng X.D. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier F.W.

In addition, the mode of cellular activation and bactericidal activity of these PGRPs is largely unknown. The limited data for PGRP-L indicates that this protein exhibits lytic activity (31Wang Z.M.

Mouse PGRP-S found in neutrophil tertiary granules participates in the intracellular neutralization of bacteria. Mice deficient in this PGRP are much more susceptible to intraperitoneal infections with low pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. (33Dziarski R. Platt K.A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Gupta D.

To determine in the ligand requirements for various PGRPs, we have synthesized a range of partial structures of PGN (see Fig. 1) that contain lysine or DAP as the third amino acid. The interactions of these compounds with human PGRP-S and the C-terminal domain of human PGRP-Iα containing two tandem domains have been studied in real-time using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Procedures for the expressing recombinant PGRP-IαC (residues 177-341) by in vitro folding from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies have been described previously (35Guan R.J. Malchiodi E.L. Wang Q.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 2107-2110Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (100 mg, 42 μmol, Novabiochem) was swelled in dry dimethylformamide (DMF, ∼120 min, 3 ml), treated with 20% piperidine in DMF (3 × 5 min, 3 × 2 ml), washed with freshly distilled DMF (3 × 3 ml), and then reacted with Fmoc-d-Ala-OH (26.12 mg, 84 μmol, Novabiochem) in DMF by using PyBOP (43.7 mg, Novabiochem), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (11 mg, Aldrich), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (29.2 μl, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA). Progress of the reaction was monitored by the Kaiser test. After completion of the coupling, the resin was washed with (3 × 3 ml), and the Fmoc protecting group was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF (3 × 5 min, 3 × 2 ml). The reaction cycle was repeated using Fmoc-d-Ala-OH (26.1 mg, 84 μmol), Fmoc-l-Lys(Mtt)-OH (52.4 mg, 84 μmol), Fmoc-d-isoglutamine (30.9 mg, 84 μmol), Fmoc-l-Ala-OH (26.12 mg, 84 μmol, Novabiochem), and, subsequently, 2-N-acetyl-1-β-O-allyl-4,6-benzylidene-3-muramic acid (37Chowdhury A.R. Siriwardena A. Boons G.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 7805-7807Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (35.4 mg, 84 μmol). The resulting resin-bound glycopeptide was washed with DMF (3 × 3 ml), dichloromethane (7 × 3 ml), and methanol (3 × 3 ml). The resin was dried in vacuo for 4 h, reswelled in dichloromethane (DCM) (∼5 ml), and filtered. The glycopeptide was released by treatment of the resin with 2% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM (10 × 2 ml). The combined washings were concentrated under reduced pressure and co-evaporated with toluene (3 × 10 ml) to remove traces of trifluoroacetic acid. The crude product was subjected to 20% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM to ensure complete removal of the benzylidene protecting group. The resulting product was purified by Sephadex G15 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography to give (allyl-2-N-acetyl-3-O-muramyl)-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine (23.4 mg, 70%) as a white amorphous solid. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): δ = 5.87-5.93 (1H, m, OCH2CHCH2), 5.25-5.32 (2H, dd, OCH2CHCH2), 4.53 (1H, d, H1, J = 8.3 Hz), 4.13-4.35 (8H, m, α H-Ala ×3, α H-Lys, α H-Glu, α H-lactic acid, OCH2CHCH2), 3.93 (1H, d, H6a, J = 12.2 Hz), 3.85 (1H, t, H2), 3.76-3.79 (1H, dd, H6b), 3.45-3.57 (3H, m, H3, H4, H5), 3.00 (2 H, t, ϵ CH2-Lys), 2.36-2.43 (2H, m, γ CH2-Glu), 2.12-2.18 (1H, m, β CH2-Glu), 1.94-2.03 (4H, m, β CH2-Glu, NHAc), 1.67-1.82 (4H, m, β, δ-CH2-Lys), 1.37-1.45 (14H, m, CH3-lactic acid, γ CH2-Lys, CH3-Ala × 3) 13C NMR (75 MHz, D2O): 177.88, 175.98, 175.93, 175.31, 175.22, 174.92, 174.83, 174.26, 133.52 (OCH2CHCH2), 118.23 (OCH2CHCH2), 100.27 (C1), 82.98, 75.78, 68.84 (C3, C4, and C5), 70.66 (OCH2CHCH2), 60.86 (C6), 55.29, 54.30, 52.89, 50.14, 49.95, 49.60 (α-Cs), 39.30 (ϵ CH2-Lys), 31.46 (γ CH2-Glu), 30.25 (β CH2-Glu), 26.51 (β CH2-Lys), 22.34, 22.21 (δ CH2-Lys, NHCH3), 18.91, 16.68, and 16.36.

Once cleaved from the resin, the DAP-PGNs were treated with 20% trifluoroacetic acid to deprotect the tert Butoxycarbonyl and tert butyl protecting groups on the side chain of the DAP. The deprotected derivative was precipitated from cold diethyl ether to afford an off-white compound. To a solution of this compound in EtOH:H2O:1 (n) HCl (4:2:0.01, 0.6 ml), 10% Pd/C (5 mg) was added and stirred at room temperature for 16 h.

HRMS-MALDI-TOF calc. for C25H45N7O11 (M + HCl): 842.2914, found 842.6710. The biospecific interaction analysis was performed using BIAcore 3000 biosensor system (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The CM-5 research grade sensor chip, HBS-EP buffer, and immobilization reagents (1-ethyl-3-(3-N,N-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS), and ethanolamine) were obtained from BIAcore Inc. phosphate-buffered saline buffer was purchased from Sigma, and MDP was purchased from Calbiochem. All solutions were filtered using a 0.22-μm PES membrane syringe filter and degassed prior to use. PGRP-IαC was covalently immobilized by a standard amine coupling procedure using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer. A fixed flow rate of 10 μl/min was used throughout the immobilization procedure with HBS-EP (pH 7.4, 0.01 m HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20) as the running buffer. The surface was activated using 70 μl of freshly mixed 1:1 100 mm NHS and 391 mm EDC for 7 min. Upon activation, a 60 μg/ml solution of PGRP-Iα in 10 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5) was injected for 8 min. The remaining active esters on the surface were quenched using 70 μl of 1.0 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5) for 7 min. A ligand density of ∼10,000 RU was achieved. Blocking of a control flow cell was accomplished by activation followed by an immediate quenching of the flow cell as described above. PGRP-S immobilization was accomplished using the same protocol as above with a change to 5 mm maleate buffer (pH 6.0) as the immobilization buffer. A ligand density of ∼5,000 RU was achieved after 8 min of protein injection. Although a higher initial immobilization density was targeted, longer PGRP-S injections resulted in no change of protein density. Initial binding studies of the DAP containing compounds with PGRP-S suggested high affinity prompting the formation of a low density immobilization surface for kinetic analysis. A similar protocol was used with an injection of PGRP-S solution of 50 μg/ml in 10 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5) for 5 min to afford an immobilized surface of 2,700 RU. For the binding studies, fixed flow rates of 5 μl/min for association and dissociation with a constant temperature of 25 °C were employed. The association and dissociation times were 5 min and 10 min, respectively. These surfaces had greater than 90% reproducibility if used within a 3- to 4-day period. PGRP Iα: phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4, 0.01 m phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) was selected as both the running and dissociation buffer. The lysine containing analytes, pentapeptide (Lys-PP 1), muramyldipeptide (MDP 3), muramyltripeptide (MTP 4), muramyltetrapeptide (MTrP 5), and muramylpentapeptide (MPP 6), were passed over the surface at a concentration range from 20 to 60 μm using the kinetic wizard method. The surface did not require a regeneration injection for the Lys-PP, MDP, or MTP. For MTrP and MPP, a regeneration injection of 0.01% Tween-20 in water for 20 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min followed by 15 min of stabilization time was required to achieve prior baseline status. The DAP-containing analytes, DAP-PP (2), MTP-DAP (7), MTrP-DAP (8), and MPP-DAP (9), were passed over the surface at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μm. For MTrP-DAP and MPP-DAP, the regeneration was performed as described for the lysine-containing fragments. For PGRP-S, HBS-EP buffer was selected as both the running and dissociation buffers. Due to a greater variation in binding affinity, optimum concentration ranges for each analyte were established. For the lysine-containing compounds, MTP was examined from 500 to 1000 μm, MTrP from 200 to 500 μm, and MPP from 50 to 300 μm. Initial binding studies were conducted on a flow channel with 5000 RU density. The DAP-containing muramyl peptides showed high affinity biding with on and off rates in the measurable range for kinetic analysis. These studies were conducted on a flow channel containing 2700 RU of PGRP-S to minimize rebinding and mass transport effect. A concentration range of 10-1000 nm was selected for MPP-DAP and MTrP-DAP and for MTP-DAP, a concentration range of 100-1000 nm was selected. The kinetic studies were performed using wizard kinetic software with a flow rate of 10 μl/min and association and dissociation times of 5 and 10 min, respectively. The surface was regenerated by a 60-s injection of 10 mm NaOH, pH 11.4, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The responses near equilibrium (Req) for the comparative affinity and rate constants k1 and k-1 for kinetic analysis were obtained by fitting the primary sensogram data using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software. The dissociation rate constant is derived using, Rt=Rt0e−k−1(t−t0) where Rt0 is the amplitude of the initial response, and k-1 is the dissociation rate constant. The association rate constant k1 can be derived from the measured k-1 values, using, Rt=Rmax[1−e−(k1C+k−1)(t−t0) where Rt is response at time t, Rmax is the maximum response, C is concentration of the analyte in the solution, and k1 and k-1 are association and dissociation rate constants, respectively. The ratio of k1 and k-1 yields the value of association constant KA (k1/k-1). The interactions of human PGRP-IαC and PGRP-S with a range of synthetic lysine- and DAP-containing PGN fragments were probed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR is a rapid and sensitive method for the evaluation of affinities of bimolecular interactions (39Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H.

https://openalex.org/W1967797122,"Regulated exocytosis in adipocytes mediates key functions, exemplified by insulin-stimulated secretion of peptides such as adiponectin and recycling of intracellular membranes containing GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface. Using a proteomics approach, the v-SNARE Vti1a (vps10p tail interacting 1a) was identified by mass spectrometry in purified GLUT4-containing membranes. Insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased the amounts of both Vti1a and GLUT4 in these membranes, confirming that Vti1a is a component of insulin-sensitive GLUT4-containing vesicles. In the basal state, endogenous Vti1a colocalizes exclusively with perinuclear GLUT4. Although Vti1a has previously been reported to be a v-SNARE localized in the trans-Golgi network, treatment with brefeldin A failed to significantly modify Vti1a or GLUT4 localization while completely dispersing Golgi and trans-Golgi network marker proteins. Furthermore, depletion of Vti1a protein in cultured adipocytes through small interfering RNA-based gene silencing significantly inhibited both adiponectin secretion and insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that the v-SNARE Vti1a may regulate a step common to both GLUT4 and Acrp30 trafficking in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Blood glucose homeostasis is maintained by insulin in part through glucose disposal into muscle and fat tissues. This is achieved by means of a redistribution of the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 from an internal sequestration compartment to the cell surface where it facilitates glucose uptake into these cells. In the absence of insulin GLUT4 recycles very slowly from internal membranes to the plasma membrane, whereas insulin markedly increases the exocytic rate of these GLUT4-containing vesicles. This results in a net increase of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. This regulated trafficking pathway for GLUT4 appears to be distinct from that of many other membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor or the GLUT1 glucose transporter protein. Insulin stimulation of adipocytes increases the abundance of these latter proteins at the cell surface by ∼2-fold, whereas the amount of GLUT4 is increased between 10-20-fold (1Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Zeigerer A. Lampson M.A. Karylowski O. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Other insulin-regulated exocytic pathways likely operate in adipocytes as well, such as a secretory mechanism for peptides like Acrp30/adiponectin. Like transferrin receptor recycling to the cell surface, Acrp30 secretion is only modestly stimulated by insulin (3Bogan J.S. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This large difference in insulin sensitivity indicates that the molecular mechanisms of GLUT4 sequestration and trafficking have unique regulatory elements. To understand insulin action on glucose transport it will be necessary to elucidate the nature of GLUT4 sequestration in intracellular membranes, the transit of GLUT4-containing intracellular membranes toward the cell surface, and the fusion of these membranes with the plasma membrane. Although the trafficking of the transferrin receptor and GLUT4 differ in their response to insulin stimulation, it appears that ∼50% of the intracellular GLUT4 in cultured adipocytes resides in the general endosomal compartment that also contains the transferrin receptor (2Zeigerer A. Lampson M.A. Karylowski O. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Millar C.A. Shewan A. Hickson G.R. James D.E.

The nature of the membrane compartment or compartments containing the remaining insulin-sensitive GLUT4 is not fully established and has been somewhat controversial. This membrane compartment has been referred to as the “specialized” pool or GLUT4-sensitive vesicle compartment (4Millar C.A. Shewan A. Hickson G.R. James D.E. Gould G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3675-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have indicated that this membrane compartment may include the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 4The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; BFA, brefeldin A; siRNA, small interfering RNA. or a specialized compartment derived from it. The evidence supporting this hypothesis is that proteins that are known to traffic between the TGN and endosomes such as the cation-dependent and -independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (6Martin S.

James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are found in GLUT4-containing vesicles. Recently, two well known t-SNAREs syntaxin-6 and syntaxin-16 that reside in the TGN region were found to be enriched in GLUT4-containing vesicles (9Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2946-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A C-terminal acidic motif of GLUT4 was responsible for targeting the GLUT4-containing vesicle to the TGN area (9Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Perera H.K. Clarke M. Morris N.J. Hong W. Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2946-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There is also data derived from electron microscopy indicating GLUT4 is heavily concentrated in the TGN (8Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Ramm G. Slot J.W. James D.E. Stoorvogel W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4079-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with brefeldin A (BFA) which blocks adaptor-related protein complex-1 association with the TGN and disrupts TGN/endosomal sorting had no effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4-containing vesicle trafficking to the cell surface (7Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). BFA treatment did seem to mildly prolong the half-time of reversal of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, however (8Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that there is very little overlap between insulin stimulated GLUT4-containing vesicle trafficking pathway and the furin pathway (1Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This argues against the TGN as a major reservoir for GLUT4-containing vesicles as furin accumulates in the TGN. There is also very little overlap between the GLUT4-containing vesicle compartment and TGN-38, a classical marker for the TGN (9Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recent work (12Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has suggested that there are two distinct populations of GLUT4 vesicles, and they are marked by the presence or absence of cellugyrin, the ubiquitously expressed homologue of synaptogyrin. It was also suggested that insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation results primarily from the stimulation of translocation of small preformed vesicles in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The aim of the present studies was to gain insight into the nature and formation of the specialized GLUT4-containing vesicles in adipocytes through analyzing the protein constituents of these purified membranes. We report here the identification of a v-SNARE, vps10 tail-interacting protein 1a (Vti1a), that is a highly enriched component is insulin-sensitive GLUT4-containing membranes. Vti1a was originally identified as a novel v-SNARE in yeast and was found to be involved in trafficking between the late Golgi and prevacuolar compartments and in membrane transport to the cis-Golgi compartment (15von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, it was identified as a Golgi soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor and was implicated in protein trafficking in the secretory pathway (16Xu Y. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21783-21789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Vti1a-β was also reported to be enriched in small synaptic vesicles isolated from nerve terminals and could be immunoprecipitated with the cis-Golgi t-SNARE syntaxin 5 (17Antonin W. Riedel D. von Mollard G.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5724-5732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the TGN syntaxin 6 and syntaxin 16 (18Kreykenbohm V. Wenzel D. Antonin W. Atlachkine V. von Mollard G.F.

We show siRNA-mediated depletion of Vti1a protein in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibits both insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake and secretion of the peptide Acrp30 without affecting early insulin signaling events. Materials—Rabbit anti-GLUT4 was prepared as described before (20Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Goat anti-GLUT4 and rabbit anti-insulin receptor β-subunit antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-IRS-1 and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse anti-human transferrin receptor antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Acrp30 antibodies were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. Mouse monoclonal anti-Vti1a antibodies were from BD Biosciences and rabbit anti-syntaxin 16 antibodies were purchased from Synaptic Systems (Gottingen, Germany). Rabbit anti-Akt and anti-phospho (Ser473)-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling technologies. Rabbit anti-Myo1c antibodies were prepared as described before (21Bose A. Guilherme A.

Isolation and Fractionation of GLUT4-containing Vesicles—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with or without insulin for 30 min and were then homogenized in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaPPi, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and then subjected to differential centrifugation to isolate the low density microsomal subcellular fractions. The GLUT4-enriched fractions were then isolated from low density microsomal fractions utilizing the sedimentation sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation method as described previously (7Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Heller-Harrinson R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5-2 mg of low density microsomal fractions in buffer B were loaded on to a 10-35% sucrose velocity gradient and centrifuged for 3.5 h at 24,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor (Beckman). Fractions containing GLUT4-containing membranes (fractions 8-18) were pooled, pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 1.5 h, resuspended in buffer B, and then loaded on a equilibrium density sucrose gradient (10-65% w/v) in buffer B and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 18 h in a SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation fractions were collected starting from the top of the gradient and analyzed for total protein content determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad), and the bands were excised from one single dimensional 5-15% gel. The silver-stained bands were then excised and destained, and the peptide was sequenced as described before (20Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown and differentiated as described before (22Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transfection with siRNAs—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with 30 nmol of either Vti1a siRNA 4 days after the addition of differentiation mixture essentially using the method described (21Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I. Nicoloro S.M. Zhou Q.L. Jiang Z.Y. Pomerleau D.P. Czech M.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The cells were kept in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine serum for 72 h after transfection. They were then serum starved for 2-deoxyglucose uptake or were lysed for analysis of different proteins by Western blotting. The target sequences for designing the siRNAs for scrambled and Vti1a are as follows: Scrambled, AACAGUCGCGUUUGCGACUGG and Vti1a, AAACAGGAUGAGAAGCUACAA. Immunofluorescence—3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 7 were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature. Fixed adipocytes were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and stained with mouse anti-Vti1a monoclonal antibody for 2 h, followed by labeling with Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. The cells were fixed again in 4% formaldehyde for 5 min. Subsequently, endogenous GLUT4 was labeled with goat polyclonal antibody for 2 h, followed by labeling with Alexa 488-conjugated chicken anti-goat secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. The cells were preserved in Prolong immersion media (Molecular Probes). For immunofluorescence measurements, optical sections of adipocytes were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 100 × 1.4 NA oil objective. The green fluorescent protein and rhodamine filter cubes (Chroma Techology; Battleboro, VT) were used to image Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 fluorescence, respectively. A combined lateral magnification of 66 nm/pixel and z-spacing of 250 nm was used. The resulting optical sections were processed with a super-resolution deconvolution algorithm, which yields a lateral resolution approaching 100 nm (24Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D. Isenberg G. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional projection images were prepared using custom software developed in the Microscopy Group at UMASS Medical School. Briefly, the dynamic range (i.e. the minimal to maximum pixel intensity range) of the original 14-bit image was first linearly mapped to an 8-bit (i.e. 0-255) color intensity scale. The images were further rescaled to a narrower intensity range (i.e. 20-100) to enhance weak pixel intensities while eliminating background noise. Cell Lysis and Western Blot—At the indicated times cells were lysed in S-50 lysing buffer (22Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with 1% SDS, and 50 μg of total cell lysate was run on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—Glucose uptake of siRNA-transfected cells were measured as described (22Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Identification of Secreted Acrp30—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with siRNA as before. After 60 h, the cells were serum-starved overnight (∼12 h) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The medium was then removed, and fresh serum starvation medium was added with or without insulin. After 30 min this medium was collected, and the secreted proteins in ∼10% of the total volume of the medium for each condition was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-Acrp30 antibody. Aliquots of these media were also loaded into a 5-15% acrylamide gradient gel. Secreted proteins in the media were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. A proteomics strategy described previously (20Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) designed to identify proteins involved in GLUT4 trafficking by mass spectrometry led to the identification of the v-SNARE Vti1a in purified GLUT4-containing membranes (Fig. 1A). GLUT4-containing membranes were purified from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (15von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and an additional sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation step yielded a more pure insulin-sensitive GLUT4-enriched membrane fraction (fractions 7-16) (Fig. 1B). Insulin stimulation led to a decrease of GLUT4 in these fractions consistent with its translocation to the cell surface. Vti1a was also enriched in these fractions and interestingly, its peak coincided with that of GLUT4 in the sucrose gradient. Additionally, similar to GLUT4, insulin stimulation of intact cultured adipocytes resulted in a decrease of Vti1a in these fractions (Fig. 1B). Staining of intact differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a monoclonal antibody against Vti1a revealed that under serum-starved conditions the protein is highly concentrated in perinuclear membranes also containing GLUT4 (Fig. 2). The overlap between anti-Vti1a and anti-GLUT4 staining was striking but not complete, with some perinuclear membranes showing Vti1a without GLUT4. Treatment of these 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin resulted in translocation of some of the GLUT4 to the cell periphery whereas the Vti1a-containing membranes remained predominantly in the perinuclear region (data not shown). These results suggest that a significant amount of GLUT4 and Vti1a reside in the same intracellular membrane compartment in differentiated 3T3 L1 adipocytes.FIGURE 2Vti1a and GLUT4 colocalize in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Three-dimensional images of a differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte labeled with anti-GLUT4 (Alx488) and anti-Vti1a (Alx594) showing immunofluorescence signals presented in green (A, D, and G) and red (B, E, and H) colors, respectively. These images are viewed either top-down in the xy plane (A-C) or from the side in the xz plane (D-F) in a maximum-projection mode that displays only the maximum voxel intensities in the direction of viewing (i.e. along the z (A-C) or y axis (D-F)). 1.25-μm sections of the cell (yellow line in D-F) are shown in G-I. Colocalized voxels in C, F, and I are shown in white, while voxels overlapping each other in the z direction but not truly colocalize are shown in yellow (see Fig. 5). There are lots of white voxels but few yellow voxels in C, F, and I indicating the majority of the GLUT4 colocalizes with Vti1a. Dimensions of the three-dimensional grids are 31 × 31 × 6 μm (A-F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The molecular composition of the intracellular GLUT4-enriched membranes has been under intense investigation over the last several years. Several investigators have postulated that at least part of the insulin-regulated GLUT4 pool resides in a trans-Golgi compartment (8Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and Vti1a has also been postulated to be a TGN v-SNARE. One of the characteristic features of Golgi proteins is that they are sensitive to treatment with BFA. To test whether Vti1a resides in the TGN in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes we treated these cells with BFA and analyzed the localization of Vti1a as well as several Golgi/TGN marker proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, staining of the coatomer protein β-COP and Vti1a revealed a perinuclear Golgi localization of both proteins showing significant but not complete overlap. When these cells were treated with BFA for 1 h, β-COP was completely dispersed throughout the cell as expected. Surprisingly, there was very little change in the localization of Vti1a, which remained primarily in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when cells were immunostained with two other Golgi and TGN marker proteins, p115 and γ-adaptin, respectively. As expected, both of these proteins were completely dispersed from their perinuclear compartment when these cells were treated with BFA (Fig. 3B). This effect is highlighted in a three-dimensional projection image of two cells treated with or without BFA and then stained for intracellular γ-adaptin and Vti1a (Fig. 4). This image also highlights the fact that in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, γ-adaptin, a TGN marker protein does not colocalize with Vti1a (yellow indicates overlap in two-dimensional but no colocalization in three-dimensional, white indicates colocalization in three-dimensional). The results in Figs. 3 and 4 suggest that in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes Vti1a does not reside primarily in the TGN area but is rather present in a BFA-insensitive compartment.FIGURE 4Vti1a does not colocalize with the TGN marker γ-adaptin. Three-dimensional images of 3T3-L1 adipocytes labeled with anti-γ-adaptin (Alx488) and anti-Vti1a (Alx594) showing immunofluorescence signals presented in green (A, D, G, and J) and red (B, E, H, and K) colors, respectively. The cells were treated with (G-L) or without BFA (A-F). These images are viewed either top-down in xy plane (A-C and G-I) or from the side in xz plane (D-F and J-L) in the maximum projection mode. In the merged images (C, F, I, and L), there are many yellow voxels but few white ones. Thus, these voxels overlap in the z direction but do not truly colocalize (see Fig. 2 legend). Dimensions of the three-dimensional grids are 39 × 38 × 12 μm (A-F) and 29 × 29 × 13 μm (G-L).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent reports have indicated that almost 50% of GLUT4 in adipocytes is present in an intracellular membrane compartment that is distinct from transferrin-containing endosomal membranes (2Zeigerer A. Lampson M.A. Karylowski O. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our data suggests that this membrane compartment may also be enriched with the v-SNARE Vti1a. Studies have also indicated that treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with BFA caused tubulation of the GLUT4-enriched membrane compartment without affecting insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface (8Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test whether Vti1a follows GLUT4 into these tubular structures, we treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with BFA and stained these cells for endogenous Vti1a and GLUT4 proteins (Fig. 5). We could confirm that treatment with brefeldin A indeed resulted in tubulation of the GLUT4 enriched membrane compartment, as previously reported (8Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, very little Vti1a followed GLUT4 into these tubular structures, and, instead, it remained mostly associated with perinuclear membranes that also retained a substantial amount of GLUT4. To investigate whether Vti1a plays a role in insulin-stimulated glucose transport we attenuated the expression of this protein in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an siRNA-based gene silencing approach. Depletion of Vti1a protein expression in these experiments varied from about 50-60%, whereas the expression of syntaxin 16 or Myo1c in these cells remained unaffected (Fig. 6A). Introduction of siRNAs specific for Vti1a in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in these cells. This inhibition was apparent at both 1 nm (∼33% inhibition) and 100 nm (∼45% inhibition) insulin when compared with cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 6B). This result suggests that Vti1a either regulates a key step in the insulin signaling cascade or a step in GLUT4 vesicle trafficking. To distinguish between these two possibilities we determined the levels of phosphorylation of several component proteins in the insulin signaling cascade after knockdown of Vti1a protein in these cells. Phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1 and its subsequent activation following insulin stimulation is a hallmark of insulin signaling and is required for glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (23Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 25Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Vti1a depletion did not affect the level of phospho-Akt in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after insulin stimulation as compared with cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 6C). Moreover, no differences in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor or IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in cultured adipocytes following Vti1a knockdown, when compared with scrambled RNA interference (Fig. 6C). Together, these results suggest that Vti1a does not regulate early insulin signaling events. When the level of endogenous GLUT4 was analyzed in cells depleted of Vti1a, the GLUT4 protein level was not affected (Fig. 6D). This data suggested that the effect of Vti1a depletion on glucose uptake was not a result of diminished GLUT4 level in these cells. We therefore determined whether translocation of GLUT4 in response to insulin was diminished. Experiments using an exofacial myc-tagged GLUT4-green fluorescent protein construct to assess exposure of GLUT4 on the cell surface (26Jiang Z.Y. Chawla A. Bose A. Way M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in response to insulin failed to detect a decrease due to Vti1a knockdown (not shown). However, it is likely that the modest ∼50% inhibition observed on insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport cannot be detected by this individual cell method because of its high sensitivity and qualitative nature. Vti1a has previously been reported to play a critical role in the constitutive secretory pathway. Trafficking of the VSV G-protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface in Vero cells was markedly impaired when these cells were microinjected with antibodies against Vti1a (16Xu Y. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21783-21789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes secrete several adipokines including leptin, Acrp30, and tumor necrosis factor-α. To test whether Vti1a is involved in the secretion of Acrp30 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes we monitored the level of this protein secreted into the media under conditions where expression of Vti1a was attenuated by siRNA treatment (Fig. 7A). As previously reported, insulin treatment of differentiated adipocytes results in an increase in secretion of Acrp30 (3Bogan J.S. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Vti1a expression led to a significant inhibition of secreted Acrp30 from these cells under serum-starved as well as insulin-stimulated conditions. However, the level of intracellular Acrp30 remained unaffected after Vti1a depletion. In an attempt to examine whether the effect of Vti1a knockdown on Acrp30 secretion was specific or a result of Vti1a regulating constitutive secretion in adipocytes, total proteins secreted into the medium from scrambled control or Vti1a depleted cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. As depicted in Fig. 7B, no major differences were observed in total proteins secreted in Vti1a knockdown cells, when compared with controls. Taken together, these data suggest that Vti1a may function in the trafficking of secretory vesicles carrying Acrp30 to the cell surface but does not affect the biogenesis of these vesicles or Acrp30. The data presented here reports the identification of the v-SNARE Vti1a in GLUT4-enriched membranes from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Immunofluorescence analysis indicates that a significant portion of GLUT4 resides in the same intracellular membrane compartment as Vti1a. We show that down-regulation of Vti1a protein expression inhibits insulin stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake indicating that Vti1a plays a key role in the insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4-enriched vesicles. Additionally, Vti1a also plays a key role in the secretory pathway leading to secretion of Acrp30 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Vti1a was originally discovered in a two-hybrid screen designed to identify novel yeast proteins involved in the trafficking of the carboxypeptidase Y sorting receptor Vps10p (15von Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It was reported to be involved in two distinct membrane trafficking steps, from the Golgi to the prevacuolar compartment by its interaction with Pep12p and to the cis-Golgi compartment through its interaction with Sed5p. Additionally, in higher eukaryotes Vti1a has been shown to interact with syntaxin 5, syntaxin 6, and syntaxin 16 and has been implicated in trafficking of secreted proteins (16Xu Y. Wong S.H.

Atlachkine V. von Mollard G.F. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the absence of insulin, GLUT4-enriched vesicles are retained in an intracellular compartment, and insulin appears to trigger the release of these vesicles from this compartment. Significant portions of these intracellular GLUT4-enriched vesicles overlap with the localization of Vti1a, which has been shown before and confirmed by us to bind to the TGN t-SNARE syntaxin 16 (data not shown). However, as has been previously suggested this compartment does not resemble the classical Golgi or the trans-Golgi compartment. Two lines of evidence strongly suggest the hypothesis that Vti1a resides outside these Golgi compartments. First, there is very little overlap between Vti1a and γ-adaptin, a classical trans-Golgi marker protein. Secondly, treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with BFA dramatically disperses the Golgi membranes, as is evident from the total dispersion of γ-adaptin, p115, and β-COP, two known Golgi proteins distributed throughout the stacks. However, under the same conditions the subcellular distribution of Vti1a remains largely unaffected. BFA treatment also causes tubulation of the GLUT4-enriched membranes but very little Vti1a follows GLUT4 into these tubular structures. Rather, Vti1a colocalizes with the remaining perinuclear GLUT4-enriched compartment in these treated cells. This strongly suggests that the v-SNARE Vti1a is present in the unique, insulin-sensitive GLUT4-enriched membrane compartment, which is distinct from trans-Golgi membranes. Another novel observation presented here is that Vti1a apparently regulates the trafficking of both GLUT4 and Acrp30, previously thought to involve different trafficking pathways (3Bogan J.S. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, Vti1a is likely regulating a common and early step in the trafficking of GLUT4- and Acrp30-containing vesicles such as the budding of these vesicles from their individual compartments. Experiments designed to rigorously test these hypotheses are currently underway."

The multiple histone H4 genes encode identical proteins, but their regulatory sequences differ. The contributions of these individual genes to histone H4 mRNA expression have not been described. We have determined, by real-time quantitative PCR and RNase protection, that the human histone H4 genes are not equally expressed and that a subset contributes disproportionately to the total pool of H4 mRNA. Differences in histone H4 gene expression can be attributed to observed unequal activities of the H4 gene promoters, which exhibit variations in gene regulatory elements. The overall expression pattern of the histone H4 gene complement is similar in normal and cancer cells. However, H4 genes that are moderately expressed in normal cells are sporadically silenced in tumor cells with compensation of expression by other H4 gene copies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and in vitro DNA binding assays indicated that 11 of the 15 histone H4 genes interact with the cell cycle regulatory histone nuclear factor P, which forms a complex with the cyclin E/CDK2-responsive co-regulator p220NPAT.

Replication of a complete mammalian genome requires 108 of each of the individual histone proteins.

The majority of the 74 known and characterized human histone genes is located in two major clusters at chromosomes 6p21 and 1q21, respectively (TABLE ONE) (1Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Marzluff W.F.

H4 genes in lower eukaryotes (e.g. sea urchin and Drosophila) are organized with the other histone gene types (i.e. H2A, H2B, H3, and H1) into units that are tandemly repeated, and all H4 genes in these organisms have virtually identical promoters and coding regions. Although the coding regions of the human histone H4 genes are translated into identical proteins, there is surprising variation in the organization of the proximal promoters. Based on the availability of the complete human genome sequence, it is now possible to definitively assess the expression and regulation of the full complement of histone H4 genes.TABLE ONEHuman histone H4 genesGeneChromosomal locationAccession no.Ref.H4/a6p21X60481Albig et al.aAlbig, W., Kioschis, P., Poustka, A., Meergans, K., and Doenecke, D.

Recently, HiNF-P has been identified as the protein that, in conjunction with the cyclin E/CDK2-responsive protein p220NPAT, controls H4 gene transcription via binding to its cognate H4 subtype-specific element (25Mitra P. Xie R.L. Medina R. Hovhannisyan H. Zaidi S.K. Wei Y. Harper J.W. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8110-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is necessary to assess whether all human histone H4 genes are coordinately controlled and whether HiNF-P is the key factor that synchronizes transcription of the histone H4 gene family with DNA replication.Because of the extensive similarity of the histone H4 sequences, it has been difficult to determine the relative contributions of the 15 individual H4 genes to the total histone H4 mRNA pool by molecular approaches that require hybridization of relatively large nucleic acid probes (i.e. Northern blotting and RNase protection). However, we have circumvented this limitation by applying PCR-based approaches that discriminate between individual histone genes and transcripts. In this study, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine the expression and regulation of the 15 human histone H4 genes in normal and tumor-derived cells. One key finding of our study is that the expression levels of the individual genes differ considerably, consistent with variations in H4 promoter organization and activity. Furthermore, our results firmly establish that 11 genes, which account for >95% of histone H4 mRNAs, are coordinately controlled during the cell cycle and are responsive to the cyclin E/CDK2/p220NPAT/HiNF-P signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—COS-7, HeLa, HCT116, IMR90, SaOS, and T98G cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The COS-7, HeLa, and T98G stock cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HCT116 and SaOS cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 or 15% fetal bovine serum, respectively, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. IMR90 cells were maintained in Eagle's basal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were split at a ratio of 1:10 when 70% confluent in 100-mm plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Culture conditions were 37 °C in a 98% humidified and 5% CO2 incubator.Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis of H4 Gene Expression—RNA was extracted from specified cell lines using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified total RNA was subjected to DNase I digestion, followed by column purification using the DNA Free RNA KitTM (Zymo Research Corp., Orange, CA). Eluted total DNA-free RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry, and 1 μg was added to a reverse transcription reaction using the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) with a mixture of random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers. Varying dilutions of cDNA were used as templates in qPCRs with oligonucleotides specific to the different histone H4 gene 5′-untranslated regions (see TABLE TWO). Relative quantitation was determined using an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) measuring real-time SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) fluorescence and calculated by the ΔΔCT method as described recently (26Liss B.

Overall efficiencies of qPCR were calculated from the slopes of the standard curves of serial dilutions in steps of 2 (log(2) scale) and found to be nearly identical for each primer set. Expression profiles for H4/a mRNA were extrapolated by comparing qPCRs with H4/a fluorescent minor groove binder probe to qPCRs with both SYBR Green and minor groove binder probes specific for H4/n mRNA.TABLE TWOSpecific primers for the individual histone H4 transcriptsGeneForward primer (5′ → 3′)Reverse primer (5′ → 3′)SYBR Green/FAM MGB probeH4/aTCTCACTTGCTCTTGGTTCACTTCCCCTTCCCGCCCTTACCTGGGAAGTCATGTCTGGAH4/bCAGATTTAACAGCTGTGGTTTCATAGACCCTTTCCGCCCTTACSYBR GreenH4/cAAGTTAAGAGTTGTTGTTTGTCTTCGCCACCTTTGCCTCTACCAGASYBR GreenH4/d and H4/eTGGGTGAGACTCCTCTTGCTAAGACCCTTCCCGCCTTTSYBR GreenH4/gTACCTTCCACTGCGATAGGAAAGCCTTTTCCGCCTTTGSYBR GreenH4/hTCTTAAGTTGGTTTTAGAAGTTGCTTCCCAAACCTTTTCCACCTTTSYBR GreenH4/iTGGTTTTTGTTGTCAGCTGGTCACCTCCCTTACCCAAACCTSYBR GreenH4/jTTTTGCGGCTATTTTCGTTGCCTTTACCCAGTCCCTTTCCSYBR GreenH4/kGCCGTGTTGCATTTTGTTTACTTTGCCCAGACCCTTCCSYBR GreenH4/mGCAGACCTTTGTTCTCTGACCCAGGCCCTTACCTCCTTTGSYBR GreenH4/n and H4/oAGCTGTCTATCGGGCTCCAGCCTTTGCCTAAGCCTTTTCCSYBR GreenH4/n, H4/o, and H4/aGAGACAACATTCAGGGCATCACGAGGCCAGAGATCCGCTTAACATTCGGCGTCTAGCH4/pGCTGAGTAGGCGCTGTGATTCCCTTGCCACCTTTACCTCSYBR Green Open table in a new tab RNase Protection Assays (RPAs)—RPAs were performed as described (27Koessler H. Doenecke D. Albig W. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled antisense RNA was transcribed in vitro from linearized template DNA using the MAXIscript T7/T3 kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) in the presence of 3.3 mm [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 50 mCi) and 50 mm unlabeled UTP for use in RPAs (RPA II kit from Ambion, Inc.). [α-32P]UTP-labeled β-actin antisense RNA was added to each hybridization reaction to normalize RNA quantities. Protected RNA fragments were resolved on a denaturing 8 m urea and 5% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel. A 32P-end-labeled Sau3AI digest of pUC19 DNA was used as a size marker. A PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) was used to quantify protected RNA fragments. The relative expression of the individual histone H4 genes was calculated as the ratio of signal intensity standardized by β-actin. To compare RPA data with qRT-PCR data, the relative expression of H4/d was set to a value of 100% (maximum), and the relative expression levels of the other H4 mRNAs were determined as a percent of this maximal level.Reporter Gene Analysis—In all experiments, promoter activity was measured in whole cell extracts using a luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison WI), and the results were normalized by cotransfection with 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal. To determine the expression of histone H4 as a function of the HiNF-P·p220NPAT complex, cells were transiently transfected with either 150 ng of wild-type HiNF-P or 300 ng of an expression vector containing wild-type p220NPAT or both with 200 ng of one of the wild-type histone H4 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. All cDNAs and reporter constructs were mixed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in 100 μl of serum-free medium for 20 min at room temperature and then applied to cells. Cells were incubated overnight with the DNA mixture in a final volume of 2 ml of medium and then harvested 24 h later. Luciferase activity was measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA).ChIP—Synchronously or asynchronously growing adherent cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on the plate. Cells were immediately treated with 5 ml of 1% formaldehyde cross-linker in 1× PBS at room temperature for 10 min with gentle rotation. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 ml of 0.25 m glycine in 1× PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were then washed twice more with ice-cold 1× PBS, scraped into 5 ml of 1× PBS on ice, and harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cross-linked cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 2× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Lysates were then sonicated to an average DNA size of 500–100 bp by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cleared extracts were divided into sample and input aliquots to allow subsequent quantitation. Sample aliquots were subjected to primary immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of purified immunoglobulin or 3 μl of crude serum for each appropriate antibody. Following primary antibody incubations, a 0.1 volume of protein A/G-agarose bead slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added and allowed to bind for 1–4 h. Immunocomplexes bound to the beads were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min. The beads were then washed consecutively with the following buffers: a low salt buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture; a high salt buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA; 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 250 mm LiCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA; and three washes with 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1) and 1 mm EDTA. Crosslinked protein·DNA complexes were eluted from antibodies and beads twice with 100 μl of 1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3. The pooled eluates were supplemented with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and the cross-links were reversed at 65 °C overnight. DNA was then purified via phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation with 5–20 μg of glycogen carrier. Precipitated DNA was allowed to rehydrate in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), and material ratios between samples and inputs were carefully documented to allow subsequent quantitation of locus immunoprecipitation. ChIP samples were then subjected to qPCR analysis using the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system with locus-specific primers and probes.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—In vitro DNA binding of HiNF-P to selected histone H4 genes was analyzed as described (13van Wijnen A.J. van den Ent F.M.

The radiolabeled probe we used represents an optimized HiNF-P-binding site that is based on the HiNF-P recognition site in Site II of the H4/n gene (5′-CTT CAG GTT TTC AAT CTG GTC CGA TAC T). The probe was incubated with HiNF-P-enriched nuclear extract from HeLa cells. Competition experiments were carried out with a 50-, 100-, 200-, or 400-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides spanning the analogous regions in the promoters of distinct H4 genes.RESULTSmRNAs of Multiple Human Replication-dependent Histone H4 Genes Are Coordinately Induced in S Phase Cells—We predicted temporal and/or quantitative differences in expression of the 15 human histone H4 genes because of the heterogeneity in 5′-flanking sequences of the individual genes. Therefore, we initially examined the relative levels of expression of distinct H4 mRNAs during the cell cycle. Human T98G glioblastoma cells were serum-deprived for 72 h to induce quiescence and then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle with serum. Synchronously cycling cells were harvested at 4, 21, and 25 h post-stimulation, corresponding to the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle, respectively, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 1A). Total RNA was examined by qRT-PCR. The relative contributions of individual histone H4 genes to the total H4 mRNA pool were determined with primer pairs specific to the unique 5′-untranslated region of each H4 gene (TABLE TWO). Primer pairs were tested against dilutions of genomic DNA to verify that the amplification efficiencies were similar. The mRNA levels of each histone H4 gene were up-regulated in S phase between 5- and 20-fold above the levels in G1 and G2 phases (Fig. 1B). This result is the first demonstration that the complement of H4 genes in the human genome is temporally and coordinately controlled at the G1/S phase transition and is consistent with previous studies that examined a limited number of representative human histone H4 genes (9Plumb M.

Biol. 2005; 25: 6140-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Our results also indicate that there are differences in the extent to which distinct H4 mRNA species are maximally expressed. We found that the H4/b, H4/d, H4/e, H4/j, H4/n, and H4/o genes account for >76% of the total histone H4 mRNA during S phase. H4/g, H4/h, and H4/i are moderately expressed, together representing 20% of the total histone H4 mRNA, whereas H4/a, H4/c, H4/k, H4/m, and H4/p contribute minimally to the total H4 mRNA pool (<5%). Thus, nine of the histone H4 genes generate the majority of mRNAs that are required to accommodate DNA replication and nascent chromatin assembly.Differential Regulation of Histone H4 Gene Expression in Normal and Transformed Human Cells—The promoter elements of H4 genes interact with a multiplicity of transcription factors that respond to cell growth-related signaling pathways that may be differentially activated in normal versus tumor cells. Thus, we assessed whether the deregulation of signaling pathways in transformed and tumor cells affects the composition of H4 mRNA pools. We compared the expression patterns of individual human histone H4 genes in fetal liver, fetal colon, and IMR90 (normal diploid lung fibroblast) cells with those in four different tumor-derived human cell lines (i.e. HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, T98G glioblastoma cells, SaOS osteosarcoma cells, and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells).We initially compared the RPA data with the qRT-PCR data in two human carcinoma lines (data not shown). The RPAs and the qRT-PCRs were performed in completely independent experiments. The two assays showed consistent quan"

Here, we reinvestigated detergent-insoluble proteins in AD using modern proteomic techniques. Using liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-MS-based proteomics, we robustly identified 125 proteins in the detergent-insoluble fraction of late-onset AD (LOAD) temporal cortex that included several proteins critical to Abeta production, components of synaptic scaffolding, and products of genes linked to an increased risk of LOAD; we verified 15 of 15 of these proteins by Western blot. Following multiple analyses, we estimated that these represent ~80% of detergent-insoluble proteins in LOAD detectable by our method. Abeta, tau, and 7 of 8 other newly identified detergent-insoluble proteins were disproportionately increased in temporal cortex from patients with LOAD and AD derived from mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2; all of these except tau were elevated in individuals with prodromal dementia, while none except Abeta were elevated in aged APPswe mice. These results are consistent with the amyloid hypothesis of AD and extend it to include widespread protein insolubility, not exclusively Abeta insolubility, early in AD pathogenesis even before the onset of clinical dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2057835530,"The Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS) is one key mechanism to stimulate and/or attenuate insulin signal transduction. Using a phospho-specific polyclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser318 of IRS-1, we found a rapid and transient insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser318 in human and rodent skeletal muscle cell models and in muscle tissue of insulin-treated mice. None of the investigated insulin resistance-associated factors (e.g. high glucose, tumor necrosis factor-α, adrenaline) stimulated the phosphorylation of Ser318. Studying the function of this phosphorylation, we found that replacing Ser318 by alanine completely prevented both the attenuation of insulin-stimulated Akt/protein kinase B Ser473 phosphorylation and glucose uptake after 60 min of insulin stimulation. Unexpectedly, after acute insulin stimulation, we observed that phosphorylation of Ser318 is not inhibitory but rather enhances insulin signal transduction because introduction of Ala318 led to a reduction of the insulin-stimulated Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation. Furthermore, replacing Ser318 by glutamate, i.e. mimicking phosphorylation, improved glucose uptake after acute insulin stimulation. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser318 is not per se inhibitory but is necessary to trigger the attenuation of the insulin-stimulated signal in skeletal muscle cells. Investigating the molecular mechanism of insulin-stimulated Ser318 phosphorylation, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated activation of atypical protein kinase C-ζ and recruitment of protein kinase C-ζ to IRS-1 was responsible for this phosphorylation. We conclude that Ser318 phosphorylation of IRS-1 is an early physiological event in insulin-stimulated signal transduction, which attenuates the continuing action of insulin.

We conclude that Ser318 phosphorylation of IRS-1 is an early physiological event in insulin-stimulated signal transduction, which attenuates the continuing action of insulin. A tight modulation of the insulin signal transduction is necessary to keep the balance between the maintenance of extracellular glucose homeostasis and intracellular energy consumption and storage. The binding of insulin to its receptor initiates and activates the insulin signal transduction cascade, leading to a rapid increase in cellular glucose uptake (1Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The essential physiological balance between activation and termination of this cascade can be achieved by mechanisms whereby kinases modify elements of the signaling cascade, leading to an initial enhancement of signal transduction and to a sequential attenuation. Such a critical key control mechanism of insulin action is the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) 2The abbreviations used are: IRSinsulin receptor substrateDOGdeoxyglucoseGLUTglucose transporterPIphosphatidylinositolPKBprotein kinase BPKCprotein kinase CSer(P)phosphoserineTPA12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-phorbol acetateFCSfetal calf serumMEMminimum Eagle's mediumWTwild typeIGFinsulin-like growth factorTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-α 2The abbreviations used are: IRSinsulin receptor substrateDOGdeoxyglucoseGLUTglucose transporterPIphosphatidylinositolPKBprotein kinase BPKCprotein kinase CSer(P)phosphoserineTPA12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-phorbol acetateFCSfetal calf serumMEMminimum Eagle's mediumWTwild typeIGFinsulin-like growth factorTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-α (2White M.F.

Reports investigating pathological insulin resistance-associated stimuli pointed to the involvement of Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the desensitization of insulin action (2White M.F. Am. J.

Up to now the most important function of insulin-induced PKC-ζ activation is the stimulation of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation and glucose transport, i.e. PKC-ζ serves as a kinase positively transmitting the insulin signal (16Bandyopadhyay G.

Med. Clin. N.

Skeletal muscle cells from different origins including humans were studied. For the investigation of the effect of Ser318 on glucose uptake, the well characterized L6 GLUT4myc cells, which sensitively respond to insulin (21Koivisto U.M. Martinez-Valdez H. Bilan P.J. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2615-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were stably transfected with wild-type or Ala318 or Glu318 mutated IRS-1. We found that: 1) Ser318 is rapidly phosphorylated in various skeletal muscle cells after insulin stimulation and in muscle tissue of insulin-treated mice but not by insulin resistance-inducing pathological stimuli; 2) the rapid phosphorylation of Ser318 exerts an enhancing effect on insulin signal transduction and glucose uptake and is also necessary for the subsequent attenuation of insulin signaling and action as assessed by Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and glucose uptake; 3) the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in muscle cells is mediated by atypical PKC-ζ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Reagents, and Antibodies—C2C12 cells were from ATCC. Parental L6 cells and L6 GLUT4myc cells were kindly provided by A. Klip, Toronto, Canada. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Cell culture media, supplements, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Invitrogen; protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science and phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma; antibodies against phospho-Akt Ser473 and phospho-PKC-ζ-Thr410 were from Cell Signaling (Frankfurt, Germany); antibodies against Akt were from BD Biosciences; the antibodies against IRS-1 (C terminus) and phosphotyrosine (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology; and the PKC-ζ antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-Ser(P)318 antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide (SMVGGKPGpS-FRVRASSD) flanking Ser318 in IRS-1, conserved among mouse, rat, and human. 2-[G-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (specific activity 185–370 GBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Kausch C. Volk A. Klein H.H. Rett K. Haring H.U. Stumvoll M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The donors were normal weight healthy Caucasian subjects. The study was approved by the local ethical committee, and informed written consent had been obtained from all subjects prior to the biopsy. All experiments were performed on the first pass of subcultured cells that were plated at ∼5 × 104 cells in 60-cm2 dishes in a 1:1 mixture of α-MEM and Ham's F-12 supplemented with 20% FCS, 1% chicken embryo extract, and 0.2% antibiotic antimycotic solution (growth medium) as described (23Krutzfeldt J. Kausch C. Volk A. Klein H.H. Rett K. Haring H.U. Stumvoll M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When myoblasts reached 80–90% confluence, the cells were fused for 5 days in α-MEM containing 5.5 mm glucose with 2% FCS and 0.2% antibiotic antimycotic solution (fusion medium). Stimulation of the myotubes with insulin was performed in fusion medium.C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in α-MEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 1.0 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate were transfected using the Ca3(PO4)2-DNA co-precipitation method (24Chen C.

After incubation overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (40 h after transfection), the cells were starved in α-MEM (5.5 mm glucose) without FCS for 3 h and then stimulated with insulin as indicated. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer/well (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Total protein (400 μg) was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins or 20 μg of protein of the total extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and Western blot analysis was performed as described (22Kellerer M. Mushack J. Seffer E. Mischak H. Ullrich A. Häring H.U. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). L6 myoblasts were cultured in α-MEM containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described (21Koivisto U.M. Martinez-Valdez H. Bilan P.J. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2615-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For differentiation, 0.5 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate or 2.0 × 105/well of a 6-well plate were seeded in differentiation medium (α-MEM containing 5.5 mm glucose, 2% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Myotubes were used 7–8 days after cell seeding.Generation of L6 Skeletal Muscle Cells Stably Expressing Wild Type, Ala318, or Glu318 of IRS-1—To obtain stable expression of IRS-1 wild type, Ala318, and Glu318, L6 GLUT4myc myoblasts were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the supplier. 2.0 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate received 0.8 μgof IRS-1 expression vector and 0.2 μg of pSVneo encoding neomycin resistance. Transfected cells were selected for their resistance to the antibiotic G418. G418-resistant clones were screened for Ser318 phosphorylation by Western blotting.In Vivo Insulin Treatment of Mice—Ten-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and studied after 2 weeks of acclimatization. They were maintained on a normal light/dark cycle and kept on a regular diet. For in vivo stimulation mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight), and a total of 5 IU of insulin was injected into the inferior vena cava. Controls received a comparable amount of diluent. Skeletal muscle tissue was removed at the indicated time points and homogenized at 4 °C by Potter homogenization in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 containing a phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixture) (25Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Homogenates were allowed to solubilize for 30 min on ice and were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then collected and protein content determined by the Bradford method. All procedures were approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee.2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—L6 GLUT4myc myoblasts stably transfected with wild type or Ala318 or Glu318 of IRS-1 were seeded in 12-well plates and were differentiated to myotubes. Cells were serum-starved for 3 h in α-MEM prior to the experiment. After stimulation with 100 nm insulin, cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; containing 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2) and 300 μl/well of 2-deoxyglucose mix (HBS containing 0.25 μCi/ml 2-[G-3H]deoxyglucose and 10 μm 2-deoxyglucose) was added. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 7 min, cells were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl and lysed with 250 μl of lysis buffer. Total amounts of cell lysates were counted by liquid scintillation counting. Protein content of lysates generally varied <10%.Statistical Analysis—Results presented are derived from at least three independent experiments. Means ± S.E. were calculated, and groups of data were compared using Student's t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSPhosphorylation of Ser318 by Different Stimuli in Skeletal Muscle Cells— Skeletal muscle is a major target tissue of peripheral insulin action via IRS-1 and consequently of impaired insulin action (insulin resistance). Therefore, we investigated the effects of different substances known to affect insulin signal transduction on the phosphorylation of Ser318 using human myotubes obtained from biopsies from quadriceps femoris and L6 myotubes. Interestingly, substances known to impair insulin signaling like elevated glucose and TNF-α (Fig. 1A) and adrenaline and lipopolysaccharides (Fig. 1B) as well as fatty acids (data not shown) did not stimulate the phosphorylation of Ser318 in myotubes. Remarkably, TNF-α and the Jun-kinase activator anisomycin, which are well known strong inducers of the phosphorylation of the closely adjacent and inhibitory Ser307 in IRS-1 (26Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), exerted no effect on Ser318 (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the physiologically relevant stimuli insulin (Fig. 1) and IGF-1 (Fig. 1B) led to an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser318. Furthermore, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-phorbol acetate (TPA), a pharmacological activator of classical and novel PKC isoforms (22Kellerer M. Mushack J. Seffer E. Mischak H. Ullrich A. Häring H.U. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), strongly increased the phosphorylation of Ser318 in human and L6 myotubes (Fig. 1). Similar stimulatory effects of insulin, IGF-1, and TPA were observed in C2C12 myotubes (data not shown).Insulin Stimulates the Phosphorylation of Ser318 of IRS-1 in Skeletal Muscle Cells in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—Insulin triggers a time- and dose-dependent sequential cascade of tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylations of IRS-1, thereby enhancing/attenuating insulin signal transduction (2White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Zick Y. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Pirola L. Johnston A.M.

Therefore, the time- and dose-response curves of the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser318 were studied. L6 myotubes were treated with various insulin concentrations for 10 min resulting in a clear increase of the Ser318 phosphorylation with 10 nm insulin, which could not be further enhanced using 100 nm (data not shown). Consequently, the phosphorylation kinetic was studied using 10 nm insulin for various time intervals. In the same extracts we monitored the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Insulin stimulated a rapid phosphorylation of both the IRS-1 tyrosine residues and of Ser318 in L6 myotubes within 5 min (Fig. 2). When the phosphorylation of Ser318 reached its maximum after 30 and 60 min, the tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced, well in line with the described attenuation of insulin signal transduction after prolonged insulin stimulation. In the ongoing insulin action at 180 and 360 min the Ser318 phosphorylation was clearly decreased, whereas the level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation recurred up to the intensity at 5 and 10 min. The IRS-1 protein was essentially unchanged during the 6-h experiment (Fig. 2). Because C2C12 myotubes exhibited a similar time-dependent insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser318 (data not shown), L6 as well as C2C12 cells are suitable to study the physiological role of Ser318 in insulin signal transduction in skeletal muscle cells.FIGURE 2Time-dependent insulin-stimulated tyrosine and Ser318 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in a skeletal muscle cell culture model. The time course of insulin action on the phosphorylation of IRS-1 tyrosine residues and of Ser318 was investigated by stimulation of L6 myotubes with 10 nm insulin for 5–360 min. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitated (IP) IRS-1 were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. A representative immunoblot of four independent experiments with the phosphotyrosine and the phosphorylation site-specific Ser318 antibody and reprobe of the same blot with the polyclonal IRS-1 antibody are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insulin Induces the Phosphorylation of Ser318 in Skeletal Muscle of Mice—The rapid phosphorylation of Ser318 during acute insulin stimulation might contribute to an early modulation of the insulin response. To determine whether insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser318 occurs in the whole organism, skeletal muscle from male mice was isolated after 5 and 30 min of insulin stimulation (5 IU/mouse, intravenously). Immunoblotting with the Ser(P)318-specific antibody revealed a very rapid (within 5 min) insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser318 in skeletal muscle from these mice (Fig. 3), similar to the results obtained in cell culture. The data indicate that insulin also stimulates the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser318 in skeletal muscle tissue within minutes.FIGURE 3Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser318 in vivo. Twelve-week-old C57Bl/6 mice were fasted overnight and subsequently intravenously (i.v.) injected with 5 IU of insulin into the inferior vena cava. Skeletal muscle tissue was obtained after 5 and 30 min of insulin treatment. 200 μg of protein of muscle extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Ser318 phosphorylation and IRS-1 protein were detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of Ser318 in Insulin-stimulated Signal Transduction: Phosphorylation of Ser473 of PKB/Akt and Glucose Uptake—The rapid and transient effect of insulin on Ser318 phosphorylation of IRS-1 suggests a physiological function in insulin signaling. This is supported by the lack of enhanced Ser318 phosphorylation by insulin resistance-associated factors. Therefore, we studied the influence of Ser(P)318 of IRS-1 on the insulin-induced time-dependent phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt, a key molecule in downstream signaling (e.g. regulating insulin effects on glucose uptake (27Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar)), in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type or mutated Ala318 IRS-1 and stimulated for various time points with 10 nm insulin (Fig. 4A). The increase in Ser473 phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was less pronounced in Ala318 IRS-1-expressing cells after 10 min of insulin stimulation compared with cells expressing wild-type IRS-1; but in contrast to wild-type cells no decrease was found after 60 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 4B, n = 6). Of note, IRS-1 protein levels were not affected by the Ala318 mutation (Fig. 4A). These data are well in line with our previously reported findings in baby hamster kidney cells (15Moeschel K. Beck A. Weigert C. Lammers M. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Häring H-U. Lehmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25157-25163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), showing that mutation of Ser318 to alanine abrogated the attenuation of insulin signal transduction after 60 min of insulin stimulation. Additionally, these data suggest a possible involvement of the phosphorylation of Ser318 in the early positive modulation of insulin action.FIGURE 4The phosphorylation of Ser318 modulates the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in skeletal muscle cells. A, C2C12 cells, transiently transfected with either the IRS-1 wild type (WT) or IRS-1 Ala318 were stimulated for 5, 10, and 60 min with 10 nm insulin. Cell lysates were analyzed with 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and after Western blotting the phosphorylation of Ser473 of PKB/Akt was investigated. The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a PKB/Akt protein antibody. The IRS-1 amount was analyzed using an IRS-1 C-terminal antibody. Phosphorylation intensity of Ser473 of PKB/Akt was quantified based on scanning densitometry of immunoblots normalized for PKB/Akt protein. B, time course of the increase of Ser473 phosphorylation of PKB/Akt after insulin stimulation in muscle cells transfected with the IRS-1 WT or IRS-1 Ala318. Data are summarized from six independent experiments and are expressed as relative density units of Ser(P)473 of PKB/Akt.

Pilch P.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 337-345PubMed Google Scholar), we studied the effect of Ser318 phosphorylation on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and additionally the upstream activation of PKB/Akt in L6 GLUT4myc myotubes. In these myotubes, insulin stimulates glucose uptake with high sensitivity and maximal responsiveness (21Koivisto U.M. Martinez-Valdez H. Bilan P.J. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol.

Therefore, we created L6 GLUT4myc cell lines transfected with wild-type, mutated Ala318, or Glu318 IRS-1. In each of these three cell lines the expression of the IRS-1 protein was ∼3–4-fold increased compared with endogenous IRS-1 levels (data not shown).

The role of acetylation has been most extensively studied in the context of histones, but it is becoming increasingly evident that this modification now includes other proteins. The Sir2 family of NAD-dependent deacetylases was initially recognized as mediating gene silencing through histone deacetylation, but several family members display non-nuclear sub-cellular localization and deacetylate non-histone protein substrates. Although many structural and enzymatic studies of Sir2 proteins have been reported, how substrate recognition is achieved by this family of enzymes is unknown. Here we use in vitro deacetylase assays and a variety of potential substrates to examine the substrate specificity of yeast homologue Hst2. We show that Hst2 is specific for acetyl-lysine within proteins; it does not deacetylate small polycations such as acetyl-spermine or acetylated amino ter-mini of proteins. Furthermore we have found that Hst2 displays conformational rather than sequence specificity, preferentially deacetylating acetyl-lysine within unstructured regions of proteins. Our results suggest that this conformational requirement may be a general feature for substrate recognition in the Sir2 family.

Protein phosphorylation has long been accepted as a key mechanism in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Lately, other post-translational modifications including methylation, ubiquitination, and particularly, acetylation, are being recognized as playing key roles in protein function (1Yang X.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1653-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation, for example, mediated by the interplay between histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), 2The abbreviations used are:HDAChistone deacetylaseDTTdithiothreitolTAPtandem affinity purificationCBPcyclic AMP response element-binding proteinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine has proven to be vital for control of gene silencing, transcription, replication, and repair (2Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The Sir2 family of NAD-dependent HDACs has homologues in organisms ranging from bacteria to human (3Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Since histones are absent in bacteria, it seems likely that the activity of this family is not restricted to histones, for example some family members display cellular localization outside of the nucleus and deacetylate nonhistone protein substrates (3Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). It is as yet unclear how this family of enzymes achieves its broad substrate specificity. Here we demonstrate that the yeast homologue Hst2 displays conformational rather than sequence specificity, deacetylating acetyl-lysine within unstructured regions of proteins. This suggests that conformational specificity may be a substrate determinant for all members of the Sir2 family. histone deacetylase dithiothreitol tandem affinity purification cyclic AMP response element-binding protein N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Yeast HST2 and HOS3 open reading frames were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET30a at the XhoI/KpnI and BamHI/HinDIII restriction sites, respectively, to produce NH2-terminal His6-tag fusion proteins. Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and the cells were grown at 37 °C to log phase. HST2 expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and overnight incubation at 18 °C. HOS3 expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and overnight incubation at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication and protein purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. Hst2 lysate was bound in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor-EDTA mixture (Roche Applied Science); eluted in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm imidazole; and dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. Hos3 was bound in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; eluted in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 10 μm ZnCl2, 300 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and dialyzed into 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 μm ZnCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The purity of both proteins was estimated to be >90% by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Expression and Purification of TAP-tagged Proteins—TAP containing yeast strains were a gift from J. Greenblatt. All strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) to log phase, harvested, and then lysed by vortexing with glass beads and the TAP-tagged protein purified as described (4Puig O.

Beads were resuspended in deacetylase assay buffer described below. Assays were carried out directly on TAP protein bound to IgG-Sepharose for 3 h at 30 °C. Preparation of Acetylated Substrates—Peptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequences of the yeast core histones (SCH2B1, SAKAEKKPASKAPAEKKPAAC; SCH2A12, SGGKGGKAGSAAKASQSRSAC; SCH3, ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLASKAC; SCH4, SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRC) were synthesized by a PerSeptive Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesizer. Crude peptide was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column using a linear gradient of water-acetonitrile containing 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid. Melittin (M7129), protamine (P3880), cytochrome c (C7752), poly-l-lysine (P0879), poly-d-lysine (P0296), and spermine were purchased from Sigma. Urotensin II was purchased from American Peptide Co. Substrates were lightly acetylated by means of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl [14C]acetate or [13C]acetate, which specifically reacts with lysine, and purified as described previously (5Lewis P.N. Guillemette J.G. Chan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 14C-Acetylated substrate concentration was determined by scintillation counting. Peptide concentration was determined by microbiuret protein assay (6Itzhaki R. Gill D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 9: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Preparation of Denatured Proteins—RNase A was reduced and denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 8 m urea, 37.5 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 10 mm DTT and then alkylated by addition of 5 mm iodoacetamide and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Protein was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 20% and subsequent incubation at –20 °C for 15 min. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, washed with 20% trichloroacetic acid, acetone-0.1% HCl, and finally with dry acetone. Samples were air-dried and redissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Control samples were only trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Acetyl-cyto-chrome c was denatured by heating at 100 °C for 10 min and then immediately transferring to ice. Control samples were kept on ice. Deacetylase Assays—Deacetylase assays were carried out in 10 μl total volume in buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Hst2 reactions contained 0.2 μm purified recombinant enzyme (unless otherwise indicated), with 0.5 mm NAD and 0.2–10 μm [14C]acetyl-substrate or 0.02 nmol [14C]NAD (Amer-sham Biosciences, CFA497) and 80 μm acetyl-substrate and were incubated 5–15 min at room temperature (within the linear range of enzyme activity). Hos3 reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel for 12 min at 200 V in 0.025 m Tris, 100 mm Tricine, 0.1% SDS buffer. [14C]Acetate of known specific activity was included for quantitation. Gels were dried onto filter paper, exposed to a phosphorscreen overnight, and then imaged using the STORM phosphoimager (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified using IPLabGel software (Scanalytics). Competition assays were carried out in the presence of varying amounts of competitors with NAD and [14C]acetyl-poly-l-lysine substrates. Poly-l-glutamate (P1818), poly-l-asparagine (P8137), poly-l-arginine (P4663), Nϵ-acetyl-l-lysine (A4021), l-lysine (L5626), N8-acetyl-spermidine (01466), N1-acetyl-spermine (01467), and RNase A were purchased from Sigma. Acetyl-urotensin II substrate was preincubated with or without 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C, then the reaction was initiated by addition of [14C]NAD and Hst2 and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. All assays were performed at least twice in duplicate. Analysis of Kinetic Data—Data were fitted using Enzyme Kinetics Pro software (ChemSW SynexChem), which uses a least square method to determine kinetic parameters and associated error. Structure Diagrams—Cytochrome c (Protein Data Bank ID: 1AKK) and RNase A (Protein Data Bank ID: 1AFU) structural data were obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data bank (www.pdb.org), and illustrations were created with RasWin Molecular Graphics program (R. Sayle). Circular Dichroism Analyses—Spectra were measured on a JASCO circular dichroism spectrophotometer. Samples were 0.15–0.2 mg/ml. Ellipticity was measured from 190 to 260 nm at room temperature, except for heat-denatured acetyl-cytochrome c, which was measured at 90 °C. Protein Disorder Prediction—Regions of intrinsic disorder were predicted using (i) Regional Order Neural Network (7Thomson R. Esnouf R. Goos G. Hartmanis J. van Leeuwen J.

The Sir2 family of NAD-dependent deacetylases is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including gene silencing, transcription, replication, and control of life span (2Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 3Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Although new substrates for Sir2 proteins are being discovered (3Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), no proven consensus sequences or other substrate determinants have been identified. Our study aims to uncover the mode by which Sir2 proteins recognize their substrates by assaying whether various compounds are deacetylated by or inhibit Hst2 activity in vitro. Since the NH2-terminal tails of histones are known to be a physiological target for various HDACs, we first compared the ability of recombinant Hst2 to deacetylate histone peptides and a completely unrelated peptide, melittin, found in bee venom. As melittin functions in cell lysis (10Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), it is not expected to interact with cellular enzymes in vivo. However, deacetylase assays clearly show that Hst2 is able to deacetylate acetylated histone peptides as well as melittin (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a non-NAD-dependent HDAC, Hos3 (2Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), specifically deacetylates only histone peptide substrates (Fig. 1A). The activity with melittin suggested to us that Hst2 may be able to deacetylate any acetyllysine-containing substrate. To test this, we assayed for deacetylase activity with acetyl-poly-l-lysine. Again, Hst2 efficiently deacetylated this unnatural substrate while Hos3 did not (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, kinetic analyses with these substrates revealed similar specificity constants, kcat/Km, of ∼6–8 × 105m–1 min–1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that Hst2 deacetylates these substrates with comparable catalytic efficiency. To be certain this activity was not a result peculiar to the recombinant protein, we also assayed TAP-tagged enzymes purified from yeast (Fig. 1C). Hst2-TAP deacetylated acetyl-H3 peptide and acetyl-poly-l-lysine. Similarly, Sir2-TAP deacetylated both histone and poly-l-lysine substrates, whereas Hos3-TAP was only able to deacetylate the histone substrate. The ability of both Hst2-TAP and Sir2-TAP to deacetylate acetyl-poly-l-lysine suggests an extreme lack of sequence specificity and that this may be a general feature of the Sir2 family. This is further supported by a recent peptide library study by Guarente and co-workers (11Blander G. Olejnik J. Krzymanska-Olejnik E. McDonagh T. Haigis M. Yaffe M.B. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9780-9785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that demonstrates human homologue SIRT1 shows no sequence specificity surrounding the acetyl-lysine residue. Polycations such as spermine are also acetylated in vivo (12Liu B. Sutton A. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Given their structural similarity to the lysine side chain and the lack of sequence specificity they could also be substrates for Sir2 enzymes. Deacetylase assays with acetyl-spermine showed that Hst2 did not deacetylate this substrate even at high enzyme concentration (Fig. 2), suggesting that polycations are unlikely targets in vivo. Acetyl-spermine and acetyl-spermidine were also unable to compete for activity with acetyl-poly-l-lysine (data not shown), implying that simple similarity to the lysine sidechain is not enough to bind to the enzyme. Remarkably, even a vast excess of lysine or acetyl-lysine amino acids was unable to outcompete the acetyl-poly-l-lysine peptide (data not shown), implying that the peptide backbone is necessary for insertion into the active site. In agreement with this notion, crystal structure studies of Hst2 in complex with an acetyl-histone H4 peptide reveal few residue-specific contacts outside of the acetyl-lysine but numerous contacts with the peptide backbone (13Zhao K. Chai X. Marmorstein R. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further examine the specificity for lysine residues, we assayed for deacetylase activity with NH2-terminally acetylated protamine. Prota-mine is a highly arginine-rich, lysine-deficient, histone replacement in sperm cells. As expected, Hst2 did not deacetylate acetyl-protamine even at high enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2), demonstrating that acetylated NH2 termini are not targets for this enzyme. However, protamine effectively outcompeted acetyl-poly-l-lysine for Hst2 activity (Fig. 3), suggesting the possibility that Hst2 can associate with any peptide even in the absence of lysine residues. Thus, we tested the ability of poly-l-arginine, poly-l-glutamate, and poly-l-asparagine to outcompete the acetyl-poly-l-lysine substrate and found that only poly-l-arginine efficiently inhibited Hst2 activity (Fig. 3). These results indicate that Hst2 preferentially binds positively charged proteins. Interestingly, all of the compounds (poly-l-lysine, protamine, poly-l-arginine, histone peptides, and melittin), which we have shown to be substrates and/or inhibit Hst2 activity, are known to be disordered under our assay conditions (14Tompa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism analysis showed acetyl-poly-l-lysine also retains random coil structure (Fig. 4C). This led us to hypothesize that a disordered or flexible conformation may be key to substrate binding. To test this, we compared the ability of Hst2 to deacetylate native or denatured acetyl-cytochrome c. Cytochrome c is a globular protein containing many lysine residues that are within α-hel-ices or immobile loops on the surface of the protein (15Banci L. Bertini I. Gray H.B. Luchinat C. Reddig T. Rosato A. Turano P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9867-9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), which should be freely accessible for an enzyme to bind (Fig. 4C). Our results clearly showed that Hst2 did not deacetylate native acetyl-cytochrome c but did deacetylate the heat-denatured substrate (Fig. 4A). Likewise, RNase A, which was denatured by reduction and alkylation, but not native RNase A, inhibited Hst2 activity (Fig. 4B). Since RNase A is a globular protein with significant α and β content (16Leonidas D.D. Shapiro R. Irons L.I. Russo N. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5578-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C), this suggests that Hst2 does not bind lysines within α or β structures. Circular dichroism confirmed that the acetylated native proteins were folded and had indeed lost their secondary structures upon denaturation (Fig. 4C). These results further support a complete lack of sequence specificity for this enzyme and clearly demonstrate the inability of this enzyme to deacety-late or bind structured proteins. Lack of activity with acetyl-poly-d-lysine (Fig. 2) and its inability to inhibit Hst2 activity (Fig. 3) show that stereospecificity is also important. Thus, although the adjacent sequence is unimportant, the substrate side chains must be in a precise orientation when inserted into the active site. Crystal structure data shows that the acetyl-H4 peptide binds to the Hst2 active site in an elongated manner (13Zhao K. Chai X. Marmorstein R. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Likewise, acetyl-p53 peptide binds to Sir2 homologue AF2 in an extended conformation (17Avalos J. Celic I. Muhammad S. Cosgrove M. Boeke J. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We propose that an unstructured conformation is necessary to allow binding of the acetyl-lysine substrate in this fashion. Results with acetyl-cytochrome c demonstrate that simple accessibility is insufficient for activity and suggest that the substrate must be free to conform to the enzyme active site. To examine this further, we tested the ability of Hst2 to deacetylate acetyl-urotensin II peptide either in its conformationally restrained cyclic (oxidized) form or free acyclic (reduced) form. We found that acetyl-lysine was much more efficiently deacetylated when the peptide conformation was unrestricted (in the free acyclic form) than when the acetyl-lysine was in a restrained loop (cyclic form) (Fig. 4D). Thus our results strongly suggest that the key to substrate binding by Hst2 is flexibility, rather than simple accessibility, provided by the disordered conformation of the substrate. Similar conformational specificity has been demonstrated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase A, which also binds substrates in an extended conformation (18Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Systematic analysis of protein kinase A phosphorylation sites within various substrates shows these sites to be preferentially contained within regions of predicted or known disorder (19Iakoucheva L.M. Radivojac P. Brown C.J. O'Connor T.R. Sikes J.G. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). We have conducted a similar analysis of acetylated non-histone proteins, using available structural data and several web-based programs (Regional Order Neural Network (7Thomson R. Esnouf R. Goos G. Hartmanis J. van Leeuwen J. Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Vol. 3177. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 108-116Google Scholar), GlobPlot (8Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), and disEMBL (9Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar)) (supplemental Table S1). It is well known that histone NH2-terminal tails protrude from the nucleosome core in a flexible conformation (20Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6926) Google Scholar). Structural studies of p53 reveal that the COOH terminus, which contains the deacetylation sites, is disordered (21Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Analysis of known Sir2 substrates, including Ku70, HIV Tat, E2F1, tubulin, and PGC-1α, suggests intrinsic disorder within the region of deacetylation and is verified by structural studies where available. In fact, intrinsic disorder surrounding the acetyl-lysine is predicted and structurally confirmed for many acetylated proteins for which the deacetylase is unknown. Our results suggest that these proteins, which include Importin α1, high mobility group proteins, and transcription factors MyoD, GATA1, and dTCF, are potential targets for Sir2 deacetylation and support a broad role for Sir2 proteins in a variety of cellular processes. Knowledge of this conformational specificity may therefore be useful in structure-based design of Sir2 inhibitors with potential for therapeutic application. The lack of sequence specificity displayed by Hst2, Sir2, and SIRT1, taken together with the fact that Hst2 is the yeast member most closely related to the mammalian Sir2 proteins (22Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggests that conformational rather than sequence specificity is a general property of the Sir2 family. This is in clear contrast to the non-NAD-dependent HDACs such as Hos3, which display definite substrate specificity (2Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The question of how Sir2 proteins achieve substrate specificity in vivo remains. As with other modifying enzymes, one possibility is through recruitment by cofactor proteins that mediate the subcellular localization of the enzyme and interaction with its substrate. Notably, the eukaryotic Sir2 proteins commonly feature sequence-divergent NH2- and COOH-terminal regions that lie outside of the conserved catalytic core, which could mediate interactions with other proteins (22Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is exemplified by yeast Sir2, which achieves silencing at telomeric and mating-type loci through interaction with Sir3 and Sir4, and at rDNA loci through nucleolar localization facilitated by binding to Net1 (23Cuperus G. Shafaatian R. Shore D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although no in vivo substrates or binding partners for Hst2 have yet been identified, it too has unique NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions (22Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that could mediate interactions with other proteins. It is likely that the cytosolic localization of Hst2 prevents this relatively abundant enzyme from interfering with the activity of the other less abundant Sir2 family members who function in the nucleus (22Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A lack of sequence specificity would also explain the dominant negative effect that Hst2 overexpression has on telomeric silencing (22Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), allowing it to outcompete Sir2 for a common substrate (22Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Many proteins contain regions of intrinsic disorder or flexible structure, which are important to protein function. One example where acetylation within a disordered region mediates protein function is the interaction of p53 with cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP). Upon DNA damage, p53 is acetylated at Lys382 within its disordered COOH terminus. The bromodomain of CBP binds the acetyllysine inducing a conformational change in the p53 COOH terminus, which allows residues surrounding Lys382 to make specific contacts with the CBP bromodomain (24Mujtaba S. He Y. Zeng L. Yan S. Plotnikova O. Sachchidanand Sanchez R. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Ronai Z. Zhou M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Association with CBP promotes p53-mediated transcriptional activation (25Gu W. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Novartis Found Symp. 2004; 259 (223–225): 197-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-Lys382 is also a substrate for SIRT1 (26Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar), so CBP and SIRT1 may compete for binding to the same disordered region. This example shows how the presence of intrinsically disordered regions within proteins allows for the ability to structurally adapt and bind various partners (27Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). Thus, another factor in regulating Sir2 enzyme activity is the disordered state of the substrate itself, which could be affected by the presence of other post-translational modifications, and association with binding partners, which compete for the same site or induce changes in substrate conformation. Equally important is the role of NAD. Since there are many other non-NAD-dependent deacetylases, and the expensive consumption of NAD seems biologically wasteful, it is a mystery as to why a family of NAD-dependent deacetylases exists. A tight link to NAD availability might regulate the activity of these enzymes. In the example given above, the competing activity of SIRT1, which would prevent the interaction between acetyl-p53 and CBP, inhibiting p53 function, is likely restricted by the dramatic reduction in NAD levels which occurs upon DNA damage (28Ying W. Alano C.C. Garnier P. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus the activity of Sir2 proteins is exquisitely controlled by the metabolic state of the cell, which would restrict the availability of NAD, its association with protein binding partners, and the conformational state of the substrate itself. Our findings suggest that the traditional view of protein substrate recognition by consensus sequence is inadequate. Recognition of disordered regions by protein kinase A and Sir2 enzymes suggests this may be a mechanism employed by many different enzymes and emphasizes the importance of natively unfolded regions in protein function (27Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar).

Mouse enteric defensins (cryptdins) are produced and secreted constitutively but are overexpressed in instances of infection and/or inflammation. Our objective was to determine whether the biological clock plays a role in cryptdin expression under healthy conditions. Analysis of cryptdin 1 and cryptdin 4 expression in the ileum and jejunum of the small intestine of FVB/N mice around the circadian cycle revealed oscillation that peaked at the end of the dark phase. To eliminate the possibility that cryptdin oscillation stems from food intake, we analyzed cryptdin expression under fasting conditions and found oscillation but with a 3 h phase-shift. Comparison of cryptdin expression in two mouse strains (C57BL/6 vs. FVB/N) revealed higher levels in C57BL/6, a mouse strain that is highly susceptible to enteric infection, due, most likely, to impaired cryptdin maturation. The results of this study indicate the involvement of the biological clock in regulating cryptdin expression in the small intestine and reinforce the capacity of food to act as a zeitgeber (synchronizer). With the assumption of similar control in humans, our results may imply that defensin expression peaks during the day."

Here we report that Pitx2a, a bicoid-type homeodomain transcription factor, can bind to HPV E6 protein and inhibit E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation. Deletion of the Pitx2a homeodomain abrogates its ability to bind to HPV E6 protein and to induce p53 accumulation in HeLa cells, suggesting that the homeodomain of Pitx2a is essential for inhibition of E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation. Recombinant Pitx2a can also block E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation in vitro, indicating that this function of Pitx2a is independent of its transcription activity. Pitx2a does not regulate Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation, because Pitx2a does not affect p53 protein levels in HPV-negative cells, such as HCT116, U2OS, and C33A cells. In addition, Pitx2a-induced p53 is transcriptionally active and maintains its specific DNA binding activity in HeLa cells.

HeLa cells, derived from cervical carcinoma, express wild-type p53 but only at a very low level, because p53 is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by HPV E6 protein. Each HPV E6 protein consists of ∼150 amino acids and has a molecular mass of ∼18 kDa. E6 is the initiator of p53 degradation in cervical cancer cells. Integration of HPVs into the genome and continuous expression of HPV E6 protein are required for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype of cell lines derived from cervical carcinoma. Binding of HPV E6 protein to E6-associated protein (E6AP), a cellular ubiquitin-protein ligase, enables E6AP to ubiquitinate p53, leading to p53 degradation. E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation was believed to be the major mechanism leading to cervical carcinoma associated with high risk HPVs (11Huibregtse J.M. Beaudenon S.L. Semin.

The homeodomain of Pitx2a is important for Pitx2a-induced p53 accumulation as well as the E6-Pitx2a interaction in HeLa cells. Pitx2a-induced p53 is transcriptionally active and maintains its specific DNA binding activity. These findings indicate that binding of Pitx2a to HPV type 18 E6 protein interferes with E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation, leading to the accumulation of functional p53 protein and the induction of cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells.

The Pitx2a cells express GFP-Pitx2a in the presence (but not in the absence) of doxycycline. The HeLa Tet-On cells (BD Biosciences) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of geneticin (100 μg/ml) (both from Invitrogen). The expression plasmids were transfected into HeLa Tet-On cells using a Lipofectamine 2000 kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The DNA fragment encoding HPV type 18 E6 protein was cloned into pCS3+MT (provided Dr. Y. S. Kim, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health) and pEGFP-C3 (BD Biosciences) to generate Myc-tagged and GFP-tagged HPV 18 E6, respectively. pcDNA3-F:11E6 was kindly provided by Dr. Cheng-Ming Chiang (18Thomas M.C.

Mouse Pitx2a RNAi expression plasmid was constructed using the “PCR-SHAGging” strategy as described in katahdin.cshl.org:9331/RNAi/html/rnai.html (19Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl.

The DNA sequence for the mouse Pitx2a RNAi is 5′-GAGAGGACAGGGGATTGACGTTCATGGAGGAAGCTTGCTCCGTGGACGTCGATCCCTTGTCCTCTC-3′ (the underlined sequence will become the loop when the short hairpin is formed). The human E6AP small interfering RNA oligo was purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). The sequence for its sense oligo is 5′-CUUUCUCAAUGCACUUGUAUU-3′. Transfection of E6AP small interfering RNA into U2OS cells was done using a Lipofectamine 2000 kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Translated Proteins—cDNA fragments encoding mouse Pitx2a was cloned into pGEX-5x-1 expression vector, and the GST-Pitx2a protein was expressed in BL21 cells. Baculoviruses expressing GST-E6AP and GST-p53 were purchased from Orbigen, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione beads (Sigma). Myc-E6 was translated in vitro using a TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and the in vitro translated proteins were confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc (9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In Vitro Binding Assay—GST-Pitx2a immobilized on glutathione agarose beads was incubated with 5 μlof in vitro translated HPV type 18 E6 rabbit reticulocyte lysate in binding buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C overnight. The glutathione-agarose beads were then washed five times with binding buffer. The washed glutathione-agarose beads were boiled in SDS loading buffer for 10 min, and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by immunoblot to detect Myc-tagged HPV E6 protein using Myc (9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz). Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—The transfected cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were clarified at 11,750 × g at 4 °C for 12 min and were incubated with protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by collection of the supernatant. Antibodies were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of protein G-agarose. After another 12 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer four times, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at 23°C,and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 23°C. The blots were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer solution (Pierce). The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit antibody to GFP (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); polyclonal rabbit antibody to E6AP (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology); monoclonal antibodies to p53 (DO-1, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Myc (9E10, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); polyclonal goat antibody to p53 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and polyclonal rabbit antibody to Pitx2 (21Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). p53 in Vitro Degradation Assay—p53 degradation assay was performed as described previously (22Crook T. Tidy J.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated Myc-E6 and GST-p53 were incubated at 23 °C for 0 and 90 min with or without GST-Pitx2a. 10 μg of ubiquitin was also included in the degradation assay mix. The incubation was done in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. The mixed proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by immunoblot analysis to assess the extent of p53 degradation. Luciferase Assay—The Pitx2a cells were transfected with reporter plasmids p53-TA-Luc or ppTA-Luc (BD Biosciences), together with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid. 24 h after the transfection, the transfected cells were split and cultured for another 24 h in the absence or presence of doxocycline. The cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation to remove the cell debris. The luciferase activity was assessed using a TR717 microplate luminometer (Tropix). The light units were normalized by β-galactosidase activity. The p53 response element in p53-TA-Luc is as follows: 5′-ACGTTTGCCTTGCCTGGACTTGCCTGGCCTTGCCTTGGACATGCCCGGGCTGTC-3′. Assay of p53 Binding to Its Consensus Site—The Pitx2a cells were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 2 days. The cells were lysed in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) and clarified by centrifugation to remove cell debris. The clarified supernatant was incubated with agarose-conjugated double-stranded DNA oligos with wild-type or mutant p53 consensus binding sites at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were washed with binding buffer five times and boiled in SDS loading buffer, and the eluted proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We previously generated a stable HeLa cell line inducibly expressing GFP-tagged Pitx2a. The cell line expresses Pitx2a in the presence (but not in the absence) of doxycycline (16Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We will refer to this stable cell line as Pitx2a cells in this article. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of Pitx2a in HeLa cells resulted in the accumulation of p53. In addition, transient expression of GFP-Pitx2a (Fig. 1B, a–c) (but not GFP-vector (Fig. 1B, d–f)) in HeLa cells induced p53 accumulation in the nucleus. Because Pitx2a is a transcription factor, we also tested whether Pitx2a up-regulated p53 expression at the transcriptional level. Total RNA was isolated from the Pitx2a cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed to examine the p53 mRNA level. The result showed that the p53 mRNA level was not significantly affected by Pitx2a, suggesting that Pitx2a does not regulate p53 expression at the transcriptional level (Fig. 1C). This result is consistent with the notion that the p53 level is mainly regulated by ubiquitination and the proteasome-dependent proteolysis pathway (23Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). In addition, the mRNA level for one of the p53 downstream target genes, p21, was up-regulated in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 1C). High risk HPV E6 protein and ubiquitin-protein ligase E6AP play an important role in the regulation of p53 degradation in HPV-positive cells such as HeLa cells. In the presence of HPV E6 protein, E6AP acts as a p53 ubiquitin-protein ligase to target p53 protein for degradation (24Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that down-regulation of E6AP or E6 would result in p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. Pitx2a is a transcription factor. We therefore asked whether Pitx2a could down-regulate the expression of HPV E6 and E6AP in HeLa cells. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that E6 and E6AP mRNA levels in HeLa cells were not significantly affected by Pitx2a (Fig. 1C). Northern blot also revealed that the E6AP mRNA level did not significantly change (Fig. 1D). Therefore, expression of Pitx2a in HeLa cells did not affect the mRNA levels of E6AP and HPV E6, suggesting that Pitx2a-induced p53 accumulation was not because of the repression of E6 and E6AP transcription. HPV E6 can bind to E6AP, forming an E6·E6AP complex, which in turn binds to and ubiquitinates p53 (24Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that E6 protein can bind to p53 in an E6AP-independent fashion to regulate p53-dependent gene activation. Interestingly, this E6-p53 interaction was not involved in p53 degradation (18Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Expression of Pitx2a in HeLa cells did not affect the mRNA levels of HPV E6 and E6AP (Fig. 1, C and D). We therefore hypothesized that Pitx2a could bind to HPV 18 E6 in HeLa cells, interfering with E6/E6AP-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. As indicated in Fig. 2A, immobilized GST-Pitx2a protein (but not GST alone) could pull down the in vitro translated Myc-tagged HPV E6 protein (compare lane 2 with lane 3). This in vitro E6-Pitx2a interaction was also confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in Fig. 2B, Myc-E6 could pull down GFP-Pitx2a in transfected HeLa cells (compare lane 2 with lane 3). Additionally, the HPV E6-Pitx2a interaction was further supported by the similar intracellular localization of HPV E6 and Pitx2a proteins. GFP-tagged Pitx2a was only expressed in the nucleus, and GFP-tagged HPV 18E6 also localized predominantly to the nucleus of this HeLa cell line (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (21Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Tao M. Kruhlak M. Xia S. Androphy E. Zheng Z.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13232-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Lechner M.S. Mack D.H. Finicle A.B. Crook T. Vousden K.H. Laimins L.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that Pitx2a can bind to E6AP and directly inhibit the activity of E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase toward p53. To test this possibility, we transfected GFP-E6AP into Saos-2 cells, and GST pull-down assay was performed to test whether GST-Pitx2a interacted with GFP-E6AP from transfected Saos-2 cells. The Saos-2 cell line was used because it does not express E6 and p53 proteins. We were not able to detect the interactions between GST-Pitx2a and GFP-tagged full-length E6AP in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Pitx2a did not interact with full-length E6AP protein. The Pitx2a homeodomain contains both DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains, which can bind to bicoid DNA binding sites and regulate the transcription of its target genes. We therefore asked whether the homeodomain is required for Pitx2a-induced p53 accumulation. We deleted amino acids 1–38 and 1–98 from the amino terminus of Pitx2a protein, generating truncated Pitx2a polypeptides, Pitx2aΔN (containing amino acids 39–271, with the homeodomain) and Pitx2aΔHD (containing amino acids 99–271, without the homeodomain) (Fig. 3A). The expression plasmids encoding Pitx2a, Pitx2aΔN, and Pitx2aΔHD polypeptides were transfected into HeLa cells, and the p53 protein level was examined 24 h following the transfection. As shown in Fig. 3B, deletion of 38 amino acids from the amino terminus of Pitx2a, i.e. Pitx2aΔN, did not affect the ability of Pitx2a to induce p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. However, deletion of 98 amino acids (including the homeodomain) from the amino terminus of Pitx2a, i.e. Pitx2aΔHD, almost completely abrogated the ability of Pitx2a to induce p53 accumulation, suggesting that the homeodomain of Pitx2a is essential for Pitx2a-induced p53 accumulation. We then asked whether the homeodomain of Pitx2a is essential for its binding to HPV E6. Myc-tagged full-length Pitx2a, Pitx2aΔN, and Pitx2aΔHD were cotransfected into HeLa cells with GFP-tagged HPV E6, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3C, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment indicated that Myc-tagged full-length Pitx2a and Pitx2aΔN (but not Pitx2aΔHD) could bind to GFP-tagged HPV E6. Therefore, deletion of the Pitx2a homeodomain abrogated its ability to bind to HPV E6 and to induce p53 accumulation, suggesting that binding to HPV E6 is likely the cause for Pitx2a to induce p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. HPV-positive cells, such as HeLa cells, use E6AP as an ubiquitin-protein ligase to ubiquitinate p53, resulting in a low level of p53 protein. However, HPV-negative cells, such as HCT116, U2OS, and C33A, use ubiquitin-protein ligase Hdm2 to ubiquitinate p53 to maintain an appropriate p53 level. Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation is not operating in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells (27Hengstermann A. Linares L.K. Ciechanover A. Whitaker N.J. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Pitx2a could regulate Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation in HPV-negative cells. GFP-tagged full-length Pitx2a, Pitx2aΔN, and Pitx2aΔHD were transfected into HCT116, U2OS, and C33A cells. p53 protein levels were examined 24 h after the transfection. Both full-length and truncated Pitx2a did not affect p53 protein levels in HCT116 (Fig. 4A), U2OS, and C33A (data not shown) cells, indicating that Pitx2a did not regulate Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation. In contrast, nutlin-3, an inhibitor of Hdm2, could significantly induce p53 accumulation in U2OS cells (Fig. 4B). To further elucidate the relationships between Pitx2a, E6AP, and E6 in the regulation of p53 degradation, we examined whether Pitx2a and its truncated form, Pitx2aΔHD, could inhibit p53 degradation induced by E6 protein in U2OS cells. Consistent with previous reports (28Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6439-6445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), expression of HPV type 18 (but not type 11) E6 proteins induced p53 degradation in U2OS cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3). As expected, E6-mediated p53 degradation was abrogated by reduction of E6AP using RNAi (Fig. 4C, lane 5), confirming E6-mediated p53 degradation was dependent on E6AP. In addition, expression of Pitx2a (but not Pitx2aΔHD) inhibited p53 degradation mediated by E6/E6AP (Fig. 4C, compare lane 8 with lane 9). These experiments further confirmed that Pitx2a could inhibit E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation. Pitx2a is a homeodomain transcription factor, and its homeodomain is essential for p53 accumulation induced by Pitx2a. We therefore asked whether the transcription activity of Pitx2a is required for p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. To answer this question, we performed an in vitro p53 degradation assay. We incubated GST-p53 and in vitro translated HPV 18 E6 in the presence or absence of Pitx2a. It is not necessary to add E6AP, because the rabbit reticulocyte lysate provides functional E6AP (29Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of Pitx2a, p53 protein levels significantly decreased after 90 min of incubation at 23 °C (compare lane 1 with lane 3). In contrast, in the presence of Pitx2a, p53 protein levels did not significantly change (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 with lane 4), suggesting that Pitx2a was able to directly inhibit E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation. This result also further confirmed that binding of Pitx2a to HPV E6 and the subsequent interference with ubiquitination and degradation of p53 by the E6·E6AP complex is the cause of p53 accumulation induced by Pitx2a in HeLa cells. Importantly, there were no transcriptional and translational events in this assay system, suggesting that inhibition of p53 degradation by Pitx2a was independent of Pitx2a transcriptional activity. The tumor suppressor function of p53 depends on its ability to activate the transcription of its downstream target genes, such as p21/cip1, GADD45, NOXA, Bax, and 14-3-3 (30Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that p53-mediated growth suppression is critically dependent on the transcriptional activation of p21/cip1 by p53 (23Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether p21 was up-regulated at the transcription level by Pitx2a. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that the p21 mRNA level significantly increased when the Pitx2a cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 1C), indicating that Pitx2a-induced p53 was most likely functional. To further confirm this result, we also examined the transcriptional activity of the accumulated p53 by using a p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid, p53-TA-Luc, in which a p53-responsive element was fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Functional p53 protein was expected to activate the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene from p53-TA-Luc. As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of Pitx2a (in the presence of doxycycline) significantly increased the luciferase activity from the p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid, p53-TA-Luc, but did not affect the luciferase activity from a control plasmid without the p53-responsive element pTA-Luc. This result suggested that Pitx2a-induced p53 is functional. These results were further confirmed by RNAi experiments. Both p53 and Pitx2a RNAi significantly reduced activation of the p53-responsive promoter by Pitx2a in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 6A). To confirm that p53 and Pitx2a RNAi could down-regulate the expression of p53 and Pitx2a, we transfected the Pitx2a cells with the respective RNAi plasmids, followed by immunoblot analysis to detect the protein levels of p53 and Pitx2a. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, p53 and Pitx2a RNAi significantly knocked down p53 and Pitx2a proteins, respectively. We then asked whether the accumulated p53 could bind to its consensus DNA binding site. p53 is a transcription factor containing a DNA binding domain, which can bind to its consensus binding site on the promoter region and regulate the transcription of its downstream target genes. We used agarose-conjugated double-stranded DNA oligos containing the p53 consensus binding site to purify p53 from Pitx2a cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline. If the accumulated p53 can bind to its consensus site, the agarose-conjugated p53 oligos should be able to enrich p53 from the cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 7, p53 protein was enriched by the agarose-conjugated double-stranded DNA oligo containing the wild-type p53 consensus binding site. In contrast, the agarose-conjugated oligo containing a mutated p53 binding site was not able to enrich p53 protein induced by Pitx2a (Fig. 7, compare lane 4 with lane 6). This result suggested that Pitx2a-induced p53 maintained its DNA binding activity. This is also consistent with our previous results that indicated that the expression of Pitx2a in HeLa cells induced the accumulation of p21, a p53 downstream target gene, as well as cell cycle arrest at G1/G0 (16Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in this article that Pitx2a, a homeodomain transcription factor, can bind to high risk HPV type 18 E6 protein and subsequently interfere with E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation, leading to p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. The homeodomain of Pitx2a is essential for both the Pitx2a-HPV E6 interaction and the induction of p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. The accumulation of p53 induced by Pitx2a is independent of Pitx2a transcription activity. In addition, Pitx2a-induced p53 is functional and maintains its DNA binding activity. HPV E6·E6AP complex formation is required for p53 degradation in cervical cancer cells (11Huibregtse J.M. Beaudenon S.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Munger K. Howley P.M. Virus Res. 2002; 89: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 14Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our results showed that Pitx2a could bind to the E6 protein and interfere with E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation in HeLa cells. Deletion of the Pitx2 homeodomain disrupted both the Pitx2a-E6 interaction and the induction of p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. We therefore speculate that there was a link between Pitx2a-E6 interaction and the inhibition of E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation, i.e. the Pitx2a-E6 interaction interferes with E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation, leading to p53 accumulation in HeLa cells. We do not know at present how the Pitx2a-E6 interaction leads to the inhibition of E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation. However, two possibilities must be considered. First, binding of Pitx2a to E6 protein can block the further interactions between HPV E6 and E6AP. Therefore, E6AP, without binding to HPV E6, will not be able to degrade p53 protein. Second, binding of Pitx2a to E6 protein can cause a conformational change of the E6·E6AP complex, which subsequently loses its ability to degrade p53. We favor the first possibility, because we were not able to detect the formation of the trimolecular complex E6·E6AP·Pitx2a (data not shown). In addition to E6AP, many interacting partners for high risk HPV E6 protein have been identified, such as p300/CBP (31Zimmermann H. Degenkolbe R. Bernard H.U. O'Connor M.J. J.

Binding of HPV E6 protein to these interacting partners results in different biological effects, such as inhibition of apoptosis (Bak), disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (Paxillin), and inhibition of β-interferon transcription (interferon regulatory factor-3). Only a low level of HPV E6 expression was present in cervical cancer cells, but this amount was sufficient to maintain the transformation phenotype. Do these E6-interacting partners compete with each other for the limited amount of HPV E6 protein in cervical cancer cells? For instance, does binding of p300/CBP to HPV E6 interfere with E6·E6AP·p53 complex formation? This question remains to be answered. At least, however, it has not been previously reported that these E6 interacting partners had an effect on E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation in HPV E6-positive cells. We have demonstrated in this article that, not only can Pitx2a bind to HPV E6 protein, but it also can inhibit E6/E6AP-mediated p53 degradation. High risk HPVs play a critical role in the development of cervical carcinoma. HPV E6 protein is sufficient to induce immortalization of a number of human normal epithelial cell types. In addition, continuous expression of HPV E6 protein is required for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype of cervical cancer cells. Degradation of p53 by E6/E6AP in HPV-positive cells is the underlying mechanism leading to cervical carcinoma associated with high risk HPVs (11Huibregtse J.M. Beaudenon S.L. Semin.

Therefore, HPV E6 is an ideal target for molecular anti-cancer strategies to cervical carcinoma. Many approaches, such as antisense oligos and ribozymes directed against HPV E6 mRNA, have been examined to block the expression of HPV E6 protein in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells (42Clawson G.A.

All of these approaches have been shown to inhibit the expression of HPV E6 mRNA and protein, leading to cell growth suppression and a reduction of tumorigenicity in vivo. In addition, blocking E6 activity by using a therapeutic peptide was shown to induce apoptosis of HPV-positive cancer cells and to inhibit E6-induced degradation of its cellular substrates, such as p53, Dlg, and the membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted family of proteins (48Butz K.

Pitx2a, a bicoid-type homeodomain transcription factor, can bind to HPV E6 protein and inhibit p53 degradation in HPV-positive HeLa cells, resulting in p53 accumulation and cell cycle arrest at G1/G0 (16Wei Q.

Loss of function of the ALL1 gene has been implicated in the development of human acute leukemia associated with abnormalities at 11q23 (50Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1778S-11783PubMed Google Scholar). Pitx2 is expressed in normal human bone marrow and leukemic cell lines with a normal ALL1 allele but is not expressed in the leukemic cell lines in which ALL1 is rearranged (8Arakawa H. Nakamura T.

Additionally, both Pitx2 mRNA and protein are up-regulated by treatment with lithium chloride and expression of constitutively active β-catenin, suggesting that the Pitx2 level is regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway (9Kioussi C.

https://openalex.org/W2171519536,"ARH is a newly discovered adaptor protein required for the efficient activity of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in selected tissues. Individuals lacking ARH have severe hypercholesterolemia due to an impaired hepatic clearance of LDL. It has been demonstrated that ARH is required for the efficient internalization of the LDL-LDLR complex and to stabilize the association of the receptor with LDL in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphocytes. However, little information is available on the role of ARH in liver cells. Here we provide evidence that ARH is codistributed with LDLR on the basolateral area in confluent HepG2-polarized cells. This distribution is not modified by the overexpression of LDLR. Conversely, the activation of the LDLR-mediated endocytosis, but not the binding of LDL to LDLR, promotes a significant colocalization of ARH with LDL-LDLR complex that peaked at 2 min at 37 degrees C. To further assess the role of ARH in LDL-LDLR complex internalization, we depleted ARH protein using the RNA interference technique. Twenty-four hours after transfection with ARH-specific RNA interference, ARH protein was depleted in HepG2 cells by more than 70%. Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the depletion of ARH caused about 80% reduction in LDL internalization. Moreover, our findings indicate that ARH is associated with other proteins of the endocytic machinery. We suggest that ARH is an endocytic sorting adaptor that actively participates in the internalization of the LDL-LDLR complex, possibly enhancing the efficiency of its packaging into the endocytic vesicles."

In previous studies, we demonstrated that Ipc1 regulates the expression of the antiphagocytic protein 1 (App1), a novel fungal factor involved in pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Ipc1 regulates App1. To this end, the APP1 promoter was fused to the firefly luciferase gene in the C. neofor-mans GAL7:IPC1 strain, in which the Ipc1 expression can be modulated, and found that the luciferase activity was indeed regulated when Ipc1 was modulated. Next, using the luciferase reporter assay in both C. neoformans wild-type and GAL7:IPC1 strains, we investigated the role of DAG and sphingolipids in the activation of the APP1 promoter and found that treatment with 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol does increase APP1 transcription, whereas treatment with phytosphingosine or ceramides does not. Two putative consensus sequences were found in the APP1 promoter for ATF and AP-2 transcription factors. Mutagenesis analysis of these sequences revealed that they play a key role in the regulation of APP1 transcription: ATF is an activator, whereas AP-2 in a negative regulator. Finally, we identified a putative Atf2 transcription factor, which is required for APP1 transcription and under the control of Ipc1-DAG pathway.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), studies of sphingolipid-mediated signaling transduction in pathogenic fungi are in their infancy. Studies in S. cerevisiae showed that Ipc1 modulates the level of phytoceramide and DAG (10Cerbon J. Falcon A. Hernandez-Luna C. Segura-Cobos D. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but whether these lipids regulate signaling in this microorganism has yet to be elucidated. Whereas in mammalian cells DAG is a well known activator of protein kinase C (PKC), DAG does not activate the fungal homolog Pkc1 in S. cerevisiae (11Watanabe M. Chen C.Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16829-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Friedli L. Payton M.A. Paravicini G. J. Biol.

Payton M.A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, if DAG regulates signaling in S. cerevisiae or C. albicans this regulation would be exerted through proteins other than Pkc1. On the other hand, C. neoformans Pkc1 contains a putative DAG-binding domain, or C1 domain, which is highly homologous to the C1 domain of DAG-dependent mammalian PKCs (14Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In recent studies, we showed that Ipc1 activates Pkc1 in C. neoformans through a DAG-dependent mechanism (14Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This activation is mediated by the C1 domain of Pkc1 and regulates the localization and function of laccase (15Heung L.J. Kaiser A.E. Luberto C. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28547-28555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), an enzyme that catalyzes melanin, which is required for the pathogenicity of C. neoformans. Additional studies revealed that Ipc1 also plays a role in the regulation of phagocytosis of C. neoformans, through the modulation of a novel fungal factor called antiphagocytic protein 1 (App1), which inhibits the attachment and ingestion of fungal cells by macrophages (16Luberto C. Martinez-Marino B. Taraskiewicz D. Bolanos B. Chitano P. Toffaletti D.L. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Balish E. Del Poeta M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1080-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ipc1 controls App1 at the mRNA level, suggesting a transcriptional or post-transcriptional activation. Therefore, we sought to examine the possibility that Ipc1 and the lipids that it modulates, such as phytoceramide or/and DAG, may regulate the transcriptional activation of fungal factor(s), such as App1. To study the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of the APP1 gene by Ipc1, the APP1 promoter was fused to the firefly luciferase gene in both C. neoformans wild-type and the GAL7:IPC1 strain, in which Ipc1 can be regulated by growing yeast cells in glucose or galactose. We find that the luciferase activity is modulated by the expression of Ipc1. Treatment with DAG activates luciferase in a dose- and time-dependent manner only when the luciferase gene is under the control of the APP1 promoter, whereas treatment with ceramide/phytoceramide or sphingosine/phytosphingosine does not affect APP1 transcription. We identified two consensus sequences in the APP1 promoter for AP-2 and ATF cis-acting elements. Deletion of the ATF consensus sequence in the APP1 promoter abolishes luciferase activity, whereas mutation of ATF abrogates the DAG-dependent activation. Deletion or mutation of AP-2 causes a significant increase of APP1 transcription, suggesting that this consensus sequence acts as a negative regulator. Finally, we identified and deleted the putative C. neoformans ATF2 gene by homologous recombination and found that loss of Atf2 abrogates luciferase activation driven by the APP1 promoter and regulated by Ipc1 or DAG. Thus, these studies suggest that APP1 transcription is under the control of the Ipc1-DAG pathway through the Atf2 transcription factor and two consensus sequences (AP-2 and ATF) present in the APP1 promoter.

The strains were routinely grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) medium.

Lis J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, C. neoformans IPC1 (WT) and GAL7IIPC1 strains were grown on YP-glucose medium in a shaker incubator for 24 h at 30 °C. Cells were washed 3 times in sterile-distilled water (SDW) and then incubated in YNB broth containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose for 24 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected at 2800 × g, washed 3 times in 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, suspended in 9.5 ml of SDW containing 0.5 ml of β-mercaptoethanol, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cell pellet was then collected at 2800 × g, suspended in 4 ml of spheroplastic solution (1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m Na citrate, pH 5.8, 0.01 m EDTA), and placed on ice for 10 min. Then, 1 ml of spheroplastic solution containing 10 mg of lysing enzyme (Sigma number L-1412) was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, 2.5 × 107 cells were harvested at 3000 × g for 6 min at room temperature and washed with TMN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 nm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Cells were suspended and kept on ice for 15 min in Sarkosyl solution (0.95 ml of SDW, 0.05 ml of 10% (w/w) N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma L-9150)). After centrifugation at 2500 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, the cells were suspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, CTP, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 1 units of RNasin). The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 8 min and terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 1 mg/ml α-amanitin and 20 μl of 50 mg/ml DNase I. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and then an equal volume of stop buffer (∼120 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 200 μg/μl proteinase K was added and the mixture incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. The labeled mRNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) (Sigma number P-3803) and precipitated with ethanol. The labeled mRNA was suspended in 100 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water and added to the hybridization chamber containing nytran membranes in which actin, IPC1, and APP1 cDNA were previously immobilized using a slot blot apparatus. Before adding the labeled mRNA, the nytran membranes were pre-hybridized for 3 h at 58 °C in hybridization solution (10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, 6× standard saline citrate (SSC)). Once the labeled mRNA was added, the nytran membranes were hybridized at 58 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the membranes were washed 3 times at 58 °C for 10 min each in 2× SSC and 1% SDS, 3 times at 68 °C for 10 min each in 2× SSC and 1% SDS, and 3 times at 68 °C for 10 min each in 0.1× SSC and 1% SDS. Membranes were then air-dried and exposed to phospho-screen at room temperature for 6 days. Each band was quantified by a phosphoimager STORM 840. Generation of C. neoformans Strains Carrying the Luciferase Gene under the Control of Wild-type or Mutated Forms of the APP1 Promoter—Plasmid pSK/APP1/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR was generated as follows: the NAT1 gene under the control of the C. neoformans actin (ACT) promoter was amplified from the pNAT1 vector (kindly provided by Dr. John Perfect, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) using primers XB-NAT-F (5′-CTAATCTAGAGCGAGGATGTGAGCTGGAGAGCGG-3′) and XB-NAT-R (5′-CGCGTCTAGAGAAGAGATGTAGAAACTAGCTTCC-3′), which contain XbaI sites (bold and underlined). The resulting fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), generating pCR-NAT1. The LUC gene was amplified using primers Luc3′,5′-GATCTTTCCGCCCTTCTT-3′, and Luc5′,5′-GCATGCCAGAGATCCTAT-3′, and plasmid pGL3 basic vector (Promega) as a template. The resulting fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into the HindIII- and BamHI-digested pCR-NAT1 vector. The resulting plasmid (pCR-NAT1/LUC) was digested with HindIII and EcoRV, yielding a fragment containing LUC:NAT1 that was subcloned into HindIII- and EcoRV-digested pSK vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pSK/LUC/NAT1, was digested with EcoRV and SacI to insert the EcoRI-blunted and SacI-restricted 3′-UTR region of the APP1 gene from the pΔapp1 plasmid (3Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. Lipids. 1999; 34: S5-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating pSK/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR. Next, a 800-bp fragment corresponding to the APP1 promoter was obtained by digesting that pΔapp1 plasmid with XhoI and EcoRI and subcloned into XhoI and SalI-blunted restricted pSKLUC/NAT1/3′UTR plasmid creating plasmid pSK/APP1/LUC/NAT1/3′/UTR, which was biolistically transformed into C. neoformans WT and GAL7:IPC1 to generate IPC1/APP1:LUC and GAL7:IPC1/APP1:LUC strains. This 800-bp APP1 sequence was chosen because it was highly predicted to be the promoter of APP1: 1) it represents the 5′-UTR sequence immediately upstream of the APP1 mRNA transcribed region (GenBank™ accession number AY965856); 2) it contains the TATA box (–72 bp from ATG) and two putative consensus sequences for transcription factors AP-2 (–236 bp from ATG) and ATF (–139 bp from ATG); and 3) it was highly predicted to be a promoter region when blasted into the BioInformatics & Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS) at the National Institutes of Health (bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/proscan/index.html). Plasmid pSK/5′UTR/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR was generated as follows: a 876-bp 5′-UTR fragment corresponding to the upstream untranslated region of the APP1 promoter was amplified from genomic DNA using primers APP15-XhoI, 5′-CATCTCGAGTGAGTACTGGATCTG-3′, and APP13-HindIII, 5′-GAAAAGCTTTCATTGCTTAACGGTATTG-3′, which contain XhoI and HindIII sites, respectively (bold and underlined). The resulting fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector, generating the pCR/5′UTR plasmid. This plasmid was digested with XhoI and HindIII and the resulting 876-bp fragment was subcloned into the XhoI- and HindIII-restricted pSK/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR plasmid. The resulting vector pSK/5′UTR/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR was transformed into the GAL7:IPC1 strain to generate the negative control GAL7:IPC1/5′UTR:LUC strain. Plasmid pSK/5′UTR/ACT/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR was generated as follows: 5′UTR of the APP1 locus was amplified from genomic DNA using primers APP15-XhoI, 5′-CATCTCGAGTGAGTACTGGATCTG-3′, and APP13-ClaI, 5′-GAAATCGATTCATTGCTTAACGGTATTG-3′, which contain XhoI and ClaI sites, respectively (bold and underlined). C. neoformans actin promoter (ACT) was amplified using primers Act5, 5′-CAAATCGATGCTGCGAGGATGTGA-3′, and Act3, 5′-GTTAAGCTTTTGGCGGAGTTTACTAAT-3′, which contain ClaI and HindIII sites, respectively (bold and underlined). These fragments were digested with the corresponding enzymes and cloned into the XhoI- and HindIII-restricted pSK/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pSK/5′UTR/ACT/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR, was transformed into the C. neoformans WT H99 strain to generate the positive control IPC1/ACT:LUC strain. Plasmid pSK/5′UTR/366/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR was generated as follows: pΔapp1/ADE plasmid (3Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. Lipids. 1999; 34: S5-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII and EcoRI, yielding a 366-bp fragment corresponding to the end of the APP1 promoter. The 366-bp fragment was blunted and subcloned into HindIII-restricted and -blunted pSK/5′UTR/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR vector. The resulting construct, pSK5′UTR/366/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR, was transformed into the C. neoformans WT H99 strain to generate the IPC1/366:LUC strain. The above plasmids were sequenced before the biolistic transformation to confirm appropriate insertion of the corresponding fragments. Stable resistant transformants were selected for further analysis after five passages onto non-selectable YPD agar medium, and genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to Southern analysis with appropriate probes to identify a double crossover event at the APP1 locus without ectopic integrations (data not shown). Plasmid pTel/366:LUC was generated as follows: the 366:LUC fragment was amplified from the pSK/APP1/LUC/NAT1/3′UTR plasmid using primers 366A, 5′-CACGATATCCAGTAAACTGTAGTTTACTGGAAC-3′, and 366B, 5′-CACGATATCTTTACCACATTTGTAGAGGTTTTAC-3′, which contain EcoRV sites (bold and underlined). The resulting fragment was subcloned in pCR2.1 TOPO vector generating plasmid pCR-366:LUC, which was digested with EcoRV. The resulting 2,366-bp fragment was subcloned into the KpnI-restricted and -blunted pTel/ACT:HYG plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. John Perfect, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), generating the pTel/366:LUC plasmid. Three deletions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Invitrogen) in the 366-bp fragment. The ATF consensus sequence (TGACGTCA) was deleted in the pCR-366:LUC plasmid using primers ATFdel1, 5′-TACTATGTAGTCACCTGTCAAAAGTCGTACT-3′, and ATFdel2, 5′-TGACAGGTGACTACATAGTAATCGCTGTAAG-3′, and the resulting Δatf:LUC fragment was cloned into pTel/ACT:HYG generating pTel/Δatf:LUC plasmid. The AP-2 consensus sequence (CCCCGCGGC) was deleted in the pCR-366:LUC plasmid using primers AP2del1, 5′-CCCCCACTATGGGGACATGTTCGCCTTGTCC-3′, and AP2del2, 5′-ACATGTCCCCATAGTGGGGGTCGCCGATTTT-3′, and the resulting Δap2:LUC fragment was cloned into pTel/ACT:HYG generating the pTel/Δap2:LUC plasmid. The ATF consensus sequence was also deleted in the pTel/Δap2:LUC plasmid, resulting in the pTel/Δatf+Δap2:LUC plasmid. Additionally, the ATF consensus sequence TGACGTCA was mutated into TGAAATCA by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using primers ATFmut1, 5′-TGTAGTCACCTGTCATGAAATCAAAAG TCGT-3′, and ATFmut2, 5′-TCATGACAGGTGACTACATAGTAATCGCT-3′, and the pCR-366:LUC plasmid as a template. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the pTel/ACT:HYG plasmid, generating pTel/matf:LUC plasmid. The AP-2 consensus sequence CCCCGCGGC was mutated into CCCCGCAAC by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using primers AP2mut1, 5′-ATGGGGACATGTCCCCGCAACTCGCCTTGTC-3′, and AP2mut2, 5′-GCGGGGACATGTCCCCATAGTGGGGGTCG-3′, and pCR-366:LUC plasmid as a template. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the pTel/ACT:HYG plasmid, generating pTel/map2:LUC plasmid. The above plasmids were sequenced prior to biolistic transformation to make sure that the desired deletions and mutations have occurred. These plasmids were transformed into the GAL7:IPC1/5′UTR:LUC strain according to Toffaletti et al. (18Toffaletti D.L. Rude T.H. Johnston S.A. Durack D.T. Perfect J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were patched onto hygromycin (HYG) plates, then three times onto YPD, and finally onto HYG plates. Transformants that did not grow on the final HYG plates were processed from the YPD plates for genomic DNA extraction according to Casadevall and Perfect (19Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Press A.S.F.M. Cryptococcus neoformans. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 381-405Google Scholar). Southern analysis of undigested DNA was performed to confirm episomal integration (data not shown). From the above transformation reactions, transformant numbers 20, 8, 24, 6, 7, and 24 were chosen and designated C. neoformans Tel/366:LUC, Tel/Δatf:LUC, Tel/Δap2:LUC, Tel/Δatf+Δap2:LUC, Tel/matf:LUC, and Tel/map2:LUC strains, respectively. Ipc1 and Luciferase Enzymatic Activities—Ipc1 activity was performed as described previously (20Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was performed according to the Promega protocol described in the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay. Proteins were extracted according to Luberto et al. (20Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Then, 20 μl of cell lysate was added to 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and the production of luciferase was immediately measured by a Reporter Microplates Luminometer (Turner Designs). Results were normalized per 1 μg of proteins. Lipid Treatments—The C. neoformans strains were grown on the appropriate medium in a shaking incubator for 24 h at 30 °C. Cell pellets were washed 2 times with SDW, resuspended in fresh medium, and incubated in the appropriate medium in a shaking incubator for 16 h at 30 °C. Next, cell pellets were washed twice with SDW, resuspended in YP medium, and counted. Next, 5 × 106 cells/ml were inoculated in 40 ml of appropriate medium containing 0, 5, 10, and 20 μm 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) for 2 h and 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. Proteins were then extracted, quantified, and luciferase activity was measured. Identification of Putative C. neoformans ATF2 Gene, Cloning, and Disruption—To identify the potential transcription factor(s) responsible for APP1 activation, we blasted the human AP-2 gene family, AP-2α (NP_003211), AP-2β (NP_003212), AP-2 β-like (NP_758438), AP-2Δ (CAI21171), AP-2γ (NP_003213), and AP-2ϵ (CAI23520) and human ATF gene family, ATF1 (P18846), ATF2 (NM_001880), ATF3 (P18847), ATF4 (P18848), ATF5 (Q9Y2D1), ATF6 (P18850), and ATF7 (P17544) into the C. neoformans H99 Duke University Genome Data base (cneo.genetics.duke.edu/blast.html). The search identified one sequence with an E value of 1e-11 corresponding to chr2-piece9 for the human Atf2 or Atf7 transcription factors, whereas we could not find any significant homology with any other ATF or AP-2 transcription factors. Thus, we focused our attention of the sequence identified in chr2-piece9, which was named putative C. neoformans ATF2. The sequence was retrieved, translated, and the amino acid sequence was aligned with human ATF2 and ATF7 genes. A putative open reading frame containing the basic region and the leucine zipper characteristic of the bZIP domain was identified. Thus, the 5′-UTR fragment corresponding to the upstream region of the ATF2 gene was amplified using primers Atf51, 5′-CAATCTAGATTTCATCACTTCTCCCCTCTCCGC-3′, and Atf52, 5′-CAAGGATCCTGAGTGATGAAAGAGGTGGTAAAG-3′, which contain XbaI and BamHI sites, respectively (bold and underlined), and C. neoformans H99 genomic DNA as a template. Next, the 3′-UTR fragment corresponding to the downstream region of the ATF2 gene was amplified using primers Atf31, 5′-CAACTCGAGTTGGTCATGGTGTGATCATTCTTC-3′, and Atf32, 5′-CAAGGTACCAAGAGAAGGGAGATTAGATCG-3′, which contain XhoI and KpnI sites, respectively (bold and underlined), and the C. neoformans H99 genomic DNA as a template. Finally, the ACT:HYG was amplified from the pTel/ACT:HYG plasmid using primers Hyg/Act1, 5′-CAAGGATCC-TGCGAGGATGTGAGCTGGAGAGCG-3′, and Hyg/Act2, 5′-CAACCTCGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTTA-3′, which contain BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively (bold and underlined). The 5′UTR, ACT: HYG, and 3′-UTR fragments were digested with XbaI + BamHI, BamHI + XhoI, and XhoI + KpnI, respectively, and cloned into XbaI-and KpnI-restricted pSK vector, yielding the pSK/5′UTR/HYG/3′UTR plasmid, which was biolistically transformed into the C. neoformans WT H99 strain and GAL7:IPC1 strain producing IPC1/APP1:LUC/Δatf2 and GAL7:IPC1/APP1:LUC/Δatf2 strains. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Ipc1 Regulates Transcription of APP1—In previous studies, we found that APP1 mRNA levels are regulated by Ipc1 modulation (16Luberto C. Martinez-Marino B. Taraskiewicz D. Bolanos B. Chitano P. Toffaletti D.L. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Balish E. Del Poeta M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1080-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether Ipc1 regulates APP1 gene expression at the transcriptional level. A nuclear run-on assay was used to measure the level of APP1 mRNA upon Ipc1 modulation. Fig. 2 shows that when Ipc1 is up-regulated (GAL7:IPC1 strain grown in galactose) the transcription of IPC1 and APP1 mRNA increases compared with the WT strain. These results suggest that up-regulation of Ipc1 increases APP1 transcription. The nuclear run-on assay was also performed in conditions in which Ipc1 was down-regulated (glucose). We found that, using this method, neither IPC1 nor APP1 mRNA transcripts decrease in the GAL7:IPC1 strain grown on glucose compared with the WT strain (data not shown), suggesting that the sensitivity of the method is not sufficient. To investigate how the APP1 transcription is regulated by Ipc1, a ∼800-bp fragment upstream of the ATG of the APP1 gene was fused to the luciferase reporter gene of the firefly Photinus pyralis in both WT and GAL7:IPC1 strains, producing IPC1/APP1:LUC and GAL7:IPC1/APP1:LUC strains. The IPC1/APP1:LUC and GAL7:IPC1/APP1:LUC strains were grown in glucose and galactose, and luciferase activity was measured. Up-regulation of Ipc1 determined a significant increase of luciferase activity in the GAL7:IPC1/APP1:LUC strain, confirming previous results with the nuclear run-on assay, in which up-regulation of Ipc1 increases APP1 transcription. Importantly, there was no significant difference in the luciferase activity between glucose and galactose cultures of the IPC1/APP1:LUC strain, suggesting that the different carbon source does not affect APP1 transcription (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, under conditions in which Ipc1 is down-regulated (GAL7:IPC1/APP1:LUC grown on glucose), luciferase activity does not decrease below the wild-type level. These results suggest that when Ipc1 is down-regulated, potential compensatory mechanism(s) may exist leading to an increase of DAG level by pathways other than that regulated by Ipc1. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that a decrease of DAG under conditions of Ipc1 down-regulation is transitory and occurring in the very early log-phase of growth (14Heung L.J. Luberto C. Plowden A. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21144-21153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is also possible that because of the leakiness of the GAL7 promoter, the effect of GAL7 down-regulation cannot be measured using these assays at a given time point. On the other hand, in previous studies we showed that APP1 mRNA levels analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR are significantly decreased when Ipc1 is down-regulated (16Luberto C. Mar"
https://openalex.org/W2032976137,"S100A1 is an EF-hand type Ca2+-binding protein with a muscle-specific expression pattern. The highest S100A1 protein levels are found in cardiomyocytes, and it is expressed already at day 8 in the heart during embryonic development. Since S100A1 is known to be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, we tested whether extracellular S100A1 plays a role in regulating the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Murine embryonic (day 16.5 postcoitum) ventricular cardiomyocytes were incubated with S100A1 (0.001–10 μm) for different time periods (20 min to 48 h). ICa density was found to be significantly increased as early as 20 min (from –10.8 ± 1 pA/pF, n = 18, to –22.9 ± 1.4 pA/pF; +112.5 ± 13%, n = 9, p < 0.001) after the addition of S100A1 (1 μm). S100A1 also enhanced ICa current density in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Fluorescence and capacitance measurements evidenced a fast translocation of rhodamine-coupled S100A1 from the extracellular space into cardiomyocytes. S100A1 treatment did not affect cAMP levels. However, protein kinase inhibitor, a blocker of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), abolished the S100A1-induced enhancement of ICa. Accordingly, measurements of PKA activity yielded a significant increase in S100A1-treated cardiomyocytes. In vitro reconstitution assays further demonstrated that S100A1 enhanced PKA activity. We conclude that the Ca2+-binding protein S100A1 augments transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via an increase of PKA activity in ventricular cardiomyocytes and hence represents an important regulator of cardiac function.

In 1965, Moore (1Moore B.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar) described a novel protein “soluble in 100% saturated ammonium sulfate solution” and therefore denoted it S100 protein. Today 21 different S100 proteins belonging to a multigene family of Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand type are known to be differentially expressed in a large number of cell types (2Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). S100A1 is found in the cytosol, displays highest expression levels in the heart (3Kato K. Kimura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 842: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and is already expressed at day 8 postcoitum in embryonic mouse hearts (4Kiewitz R. Lyons G.E. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the physiological relevance of S100 proteins in healthy tissue is still unclear, several findings point to a role of S100A1 in the diseased heart, since it is up-regulated during the course of myocardial hypertrophy (5Ehlermann P. Remppis A. Guddat O. Weimann J. Schnabel P.A. Motsch J. Heizmann C.W. Katus H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and markedly down-regulated in the left ventricle of patients with end stage heart failure (6Remppis A. Greten T. Schafer B.W. Hunziker P. Erne P. Katus H.A. Heizmann C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, S100A1 was identified as a novel regulator of cardiac function based on the observation that overexpression of S100A1 led to a significant increase of contractility in adult cardiomyocytes (7Remppis A. Most P. Loffler E. Ehlermann P. Bernotat J. Pleger S. Borries M. Reppel M. Fischer J. Koch W.J. Smith G. Katus H.A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2002; 97: I56-I62PubMed Google Scholar). This was found to be related to an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (8Most P. Bernotat J. Ehlermann P. Pleger S.T. Reppel M. Borries M. Niroomand F. Pieske B. Janssen P.M. Eschenhagen T.

The physiological relevance of S100A1 is further supported by data of Du and co-workers (10Du X.J. Cole T.J. Tenis N. Gao X.M. Kontgen F. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), who identified S100A1 as a regulator of cardiac reserve in a S100A1 mouse knock-out model. Accordingly, transgenic mice overexpressing S100A1 display enhanced myocardial contractility without developing hypertrophy (9Most P. Remppis A. Pleger S.T. Loffler E. Ehlermann P. Bernotat J.

Acklin C. Minder E. Huber P.R. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). During heart attacks, S100A1 levels displayed a bell-shaped concentration time course with a fast rise followed by a rapid decline in serum. Being present in the serum compartment, S100A1 may have paracellular effects similar to those of other members of the S100 family (12Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). In fact, S100A1 translocation into the extracellular space was detected in the intact human heart after reperfusion following prolonged ischemia (13Brett W. Mandinova A. Remppis A. Sauder U. Ruter F. Heizmann C.W. Aebi U. Zerkowski H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since S100 proteins are secreted and/or rapidly taken up by various cell types (12Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), we have examined the cellular effects of exogeneously applied S100A1 in murine embryonic and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. As S100A1 is assumed to be a crucial regulator of myocardial Ca2+ homeostasis, we were particularly interested whether S100A1 has any effect on ICa, the key trigger mechanism for sarcoplasmatic Ca2+ release and the initiation of contraction. We have employed embryonic murine and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, since adult cardiomyocytes rapidly dedifferentiate in culture (14Horackova M. Byczko Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both murine embryonic and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are easy to isolate and can be cultivated for several days without changing functional characteristics (15Rabkin S.W. Kong J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H3089-H3100PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are known to recapitulate the regulatory components of adult cardiomyocytes (16Podlowski S. Luther H.P. Morwinski R. Muller J. Wallukat G. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Zou Y. Yao A. Zhu W. Kudoh S. Hiroi Y. Shimoyama M. Uozumi H. Kohmoto O. Takahashi T. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell Preparation—Murine embryonic cardiomyocytes were obtained from superovulated mice of the HIM:OF1 strain as described (18Herr C. Smyth N. Ullrich S. Yun F. Sasse P. Hescheler J. Fleischmann B. Lasek K. Brixius K. Schwinger R.H. Fassler R. Schroder R. Noegel A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4119-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Fleischmann M. Bloch W. Kolossov E. Andressen C. Muller M. Brem G. Hescheler J. Addicks K. Fleischmann B.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Spontaneously beating neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and purified as reported earlier (20Matsushita T. Oyamada M. Kurata H. Masuda S. Takahashi A. Emmoto T. Shiraishi I. Wada Y. Oka T. Takamatsu T. Circulation. 1999; 100: II262-II268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was increased by using the selective adhesion technique (21Blondel B. Roijen I. Cheneval J.P. Experientia. 1971; 27: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out according to the guidelines provided by the University of Cologne animal welfare committee. Single Cell Ca2+ Measurements—Ca2+ measurements were performed as previously described (7Remppis A. Most P. Loffler E. Ehlermann P. Bernotat J. Pleger S. Borries M. Reppel M. Fischer J. Koch W.J. Smith G. Katus H.A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2002; 97: I56-I62PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, freshly isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fura 2-AM (5 μm) for 30 min. Cytosolic Ca2+ was determined employing a monochromator on the excitation and a CCD camera-based system (TILL Phototonics®, Planegg, Germany) on the emission side attached to an Olympus inverted microscope. Cells were paced at 1 Hz using a commercial stimulator (Phywe Systeme GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). Electrophysiology—ICa was measured with the whole-cell patch clamp technique as reported in detail earlier (22Maltsev V.A. Ji G.J. Wobus A.M. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Ji G.J. Fleischmann B.K. Bloch W. Feelisch M. Andressen C. Addicks K. Hescheler J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, for voltage-clamp recordings, the solutions contained the following: internal solution, 120 mm CsCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (CsOH); external solution, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3.6 mm CaCl2, 20 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (TEAOH). Only cells with an increase of ICa density >5% after drug application were considered responders. As reported previously (22Maltsev V.A. Ji G.J. Wobus A.M. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), ICa did not show significant run down (see also Fig. 6). As a control, heat-inactivated S100A1 (95 °C, 1 h) was used, and the effect on ICa was evaluated. Since no significant changes of ICa density in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes were observed 20 min after incubation, we employed, if not otherwise stated, unstimulated cells as control. For the analysis of inactivation, biexponential fits using a simplex optimization algorithm were applied. All measurements were performed 48 h after dissociation. S100A1 Protein—Recombinant human S100A1 protein was purified as described (24Ehlerman P. Remppis A. Most P. Bernotat J. Heizmann C.W. Katus H.A. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 737: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, after EDTA extraction of recombinant bacteria, S100A1 was purified by octyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction and HiTrapQ anion exchange chromatography. The protein concentration was determined using a commercial Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Stock concentrations ranged between ∼150 and 500 μm. Vehicle alone did not affect ICa (data not shown). Recombinant human S100A1 was labeled custom-based by Eurogentec© (Belgium) with rhodamine dye (rhod-S100A1). Unbound rhodamine dye used for control experiments was inactivated by 50 mm Tris to exclude nonspecific binding. As controls, cardiomyocytes were either not stimulated or exposed to heat-inactivated S100A1 protein for capacitance, confocal imaging, and PKA activity measurements in cell homogenates. Detection of S100A1 Translocation—Cells exposed to rhod-S100A1 were excited (1 s, 0.05 Hz) at 550 nm, employing a monochromator. The emitted fluorescence was recorded with a CCD camera. Inactivated rhodamine served as control. After the extracellular addition of rhod-S100A1 (1 μm), intra- and extracellular fluorescence intensities were measured on-line. When fluorescence intensities reached plateau levels, excessive dye was washed out with Tyrode's solution. Intracellular fluorescence intensities were estimated by subtracting background fluorescence and autofluorescence. Furthermore, intracellular accumulation of S100A1 was assessed using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM 410; ×63 Plan Neofluar objective; Zeiss) employing the following configuration: wavelength 543 nm, beam splitter FT 488/543 and LP 570. Capacitance Measurements—Endocytotic uptake of S100A1 was monitored by combining the whole-cell patch clamp technique with on-line capacitance measurements (HEKA-Pulse 8.4 software). Capacitance was determined every 5 s. To avoid interference by sudden changes of capacity, the cellular resistance (Rs) was monitored on-line (25Smith C. Neher E. J.

Cellular cAMP—Intracellular cAMP concentrations were measured using a quantitative cAMP assay system with a nonacetylation EIA procedure as described elsewhere (26Daniels C.K. Zhang L. Musser B. Vestal R.E. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1994; 31: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Controls and S100A1-treated cell homogenates (1 μm, 20 min) were analyzed for cAMP concentrations. To confirm the validity of the assay, cAMP levels were also determined in untreated and S100A1-treated cells after maximal stimulation by isoprenaline (ISO; 1 μm) (27Sako H. Sperelakis N. Yatani A.

PKA Activity—For the determination of PKA activity in purified cell homogenates of S100A1-treated and control embryonic cardiomyocytes, a nonradioactive assay kit (Promega PepTag-Assay®) was used (29Gupta I.R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Phan T. Macias-Silva M. Zhou X. Whiteside C. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. J. Biol.

Cell homogenates were prepared using a standard homogenization buffer containing a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Following incubation of homogenates and a synthetic PKA substrate (Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly)) in reaction buffer and electrophoretic separation of phosphorylated substrate, the intensities of the specific gel bands were quantified using densitometry. For controls unstimulated cell homogenates and cells stimulated with heat-inactivated S100A1 were used. To gain mechanistic insight into the molecular function of S100A1, highly purified regulatory (R) and/or catalytic (C) subunits of PKA from different suppliers (Promega and Sigma) were incubated with or without cAMP or purified recombinant S100A1 in the presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/tube as described previously (30Kosuge S. Maekawa T. Saito C. Tanaka T. Kouno I. Ohtsuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures comprised 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 3 μg of histone H1 as the substrate. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C before proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotted membranes were exposed to Fuji imaging plates, and autoradiographic signals were quantitated with a FLA-5000 Fuji-Imager® (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Substances—[γ-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). All other substances, if not otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Statistical Analysis—To evaluate statistical significance, we have performed analysis of variance with subsequent Tukey or Dunney tests. Where applicable, paired or unpaired Student's t tests were used. Values below 0.05 were considered significant. Results are given as means ± S.E. S100A1 Enhances Peak ICa Density and Cytosolic Ca2+ Transients—To investigate the effect of S100A1 on ICa, purified S100A1 protein was added to isolated murine embryonic and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes 20 min to 48 h before ICa was measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The addition of S100A1 resulted in pronounced enhancement of peak ICa density in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes as compared with controls (Fig. 1, a and b). A significant stimulatory effect of S100A1 was already detected at concentrations of 0.1 μm and higher (Fig. 1c), whereas the most robust S100A1-induced enhancement of ICa was observed using 10 μm S100A1 (–15.1 ± 1.4 pA/pF, +34.9 ± 12.5%, 48 h, n = 20, step potential 0 mV, p < 0.03) compared with controls (-11.2 ± 0.5 pA/pF, n = 45). The overall stimulatory effect, however, did not significantly differ between concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm. The amplitude of peak ICa was significantly increased as early as 20 min after the addition of S100A1 (1 μm) to –22.9 ± 1.4 pA/pF (+112.5 ± 13%, n = 9, p < 0.001; Fig. 1d) as compared with controls (–10.8 ± 1 pA/pF, n = 18). At later time points, the stimulatory effect of S100A1 on ICa current density decreased but remained significantly enhanced (–18 ± 0.9 pA/pF, +66.9 ± 8%, 48 h, n = 12, p < 0.001). Heat-inactivated S100A1 protein (1 μm) was without effect on ICa density (–8.1 ± 1.4 pA/pF, 20 min, n = 9, p > 0.05) compared with controls (–9.1 ± 1.6 pA/pF, n = 6). Parallel to our findings in murine embryonic cardiomyocytes, S100A1 (1 μm, 20 min) also induced a pronounced enhancement of ICa density (–19.7 ± 2.3 pA/pF, +47 ± 16.9%, n = 8, p < 0.02) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2, a–d); decreased but stable levels of the S100A1-mediated stimulatory effect on ICa were found after 48 h (–18.4 ± 1.5 pA/pF, +37.8 ± 11.1%, n = 9, p < 0.04) (Fig. 2c) as compared with controls (–13.4 ± 1.1 pA/pF, n = 15).FIGURE 2S100A1 increases ICa density in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. a and b, original traces and I/V curves of ICa in a control (a) and S100A1-stimulated (b) cardiomyocyte (1 μm, 2 h). c, the S100A1 effect was observed between 20 min and 48 h of exposure. d, S100A1 (1 μm, 20 min) induced a slight left shift of the threshold potential and current voltage (I/V) relationship of ICa (normalized). e, enhancement of the fast inactivation of ICa by S100A1 (1 μm, 20 min).

J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), S100A1 (1 μm, 20 min) caused a slight left shift of the threshold potential and current voltage (I/V) relationship of ICa (Fig. 2, b and d) in cardiomyocytes derived from neonatal rats. In addition, we also observed an increase of the fast inactivation component of ICa (Fig. 2e), probably due to an augmented influx of Ca2+ and ensuing increase of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (31Findlay I. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological relevance of the S100A1-mediated stimulation of ICa, intracellular Ca2+ was measured in electrically stimulated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. S100A1 (1 μm, 48 h) led to significantly augmented amplitudes of Ca2+ transients with 195.7 ± 7.2 nmol (n = 51 cells, 204 Ca2+ transients) versus 146.4 ± 6.1 nmol (n = 29 cells, 116 Ca2+ transients) in controls. This is due to a significant increase of peak Ca2+ concentrations (controls: 244 ± 6 nmol versus 278 ± 7 nmol for S100A1-treated cells, p < 0.02) and lowered resting Ca2+ levels (98 ± 5 nmol versus 82 ± 4 nmol, p < 0.02). Thus, extracellular application of S100A1 causes a prominent enhancement of both peak ICa density and cytosolic Ca2+ transients in cardiomyocytes. S100A1 Rapidly Passes the Cell Membrane—To explore the possibility that S100A1 is able to diffuse into the cell, fluorescence imaging experiments were performed using rhod-S100A1 and inactivated rhodamine as control. A rapid focal accumulation of rhod-S100A1 was observed in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3a), reaching plateau levels within 15 min (Fig. 3b, n = 14). A strong indication for the intracellular location of rhod-S100A1 was given by exclusion of the nucleus and by significantly elevated fluorescence levels after wash-out, whereas inactivated rhodamine was almost instantaneously removed by wash-out (Fig. 3b, n = 5). This finding was further corroborated using confocal laser-scanning microscopy to directly monitor intracellular accumulation of rhod-S100A1 protein (Fig. 3c). Heat-inactivated protein, however, failed to pass the cell membrane (n = 3, data not shown). To experimentally address the potential endocytotic uptake of S100A1, we performed capacitance measurements using the patch clamp technique. A time-dependent significant change of cell capacitance by –2.8 ± 0.9 pF (–6 ± 1.1%) in S100A1-treated (1 μm, n = 6) embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes compared with controls (–0.05 ± 0.2 pF, –0.4 ± 0.7%, n = 4, p < 0.03) was observed within 20 s after application of S100A1 (Fig. 3, d and e). By contrast, heat-inactivated S100A1 did not induce changes of membrane capacitance over time (+0.6 ± 0.7 pF, +1.9 ± 1.9%, n = 3, p > 0.05). Thus, S100A1, but not heat-inactivated control protein, is most likely transported within minutes via an endocytotic process into murine ventricular cardiomyocytes. This rapid intracellular accumulation of S100A1 closely correlates with the early onset of its stimulatory effect on ICa. S100A1 Does Not Alter Cellular cAMP Levels and Acts Distal of Adenylycyclase/cAMP—The finding that S100A1 increased ICa density within 20 min after the addition to the extracellular solution suggests a direct action of S100A1 on intracellular signaling mechanisms rather than transcriptional up-regulation of gene expression. As proof, ATPγS (2 mm) together with forskolin (1 μm) were applied to maximally enhance ICa in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes (32Hescheler J. Meyer R. Plant S. Krautwurst D. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Strong stimulation of ICa reaching similar densities was observed in both S100A1-treated (–29.8 ± 2.8 pA/pF, +76 ± 16.3%, n = 9, p < 0.001) and control cardiomyocytes (–27.6 ± 2.4 pA/pF, +115 ± 19%, n = 9, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, a–c). These data indicate no increase in the functional expression of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. To identify the mechanisms of the S100A1 action on ICa, its effect on intracellular signaling components was analyzed. Following β-adreno-receptor-mediated stimulation of ICa by adding submaximal concentrations (22Maltsev V.A. Ji G.J. Wobus A.M. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) of ISO (0.1 μm; Fig. 5, a and b), a similar stimulation of ICa was observed in S100A1-treated (–22 ± 3 pA/pF versus –14.3 ± 2 pA/pF, +54 ± 8%, n = 13, p < 0.04) and control (–15 ± 5.5 pA/pF versus –9.5 ± 3.9 pA/pF, +59.9 ± 6.5%, n = 8, p < 0.05) embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes. We then applied saturating concentrations of ISO (1 μm; Fig. 5c) and found significantly less (p < 0.02) enhancement of ICa in S100A1-treated cells (–15.8 ± 1.6 pA/pF versus –12 ± 1.1 pA/pF, +36.2 ± 13.7%, n = 8, p < 0.001) as compared with controls (–14 ± 1 pA/pF versus –7.6 ± 0.5 pA/pF, +84.6 ± 13.6%, n = 8, p < 0.001), indicating that S100A1 acted through the same signaling pathway. Application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol (50 μm), known to cause Gi-mediated inhibition of AC activity, led to a slight depression of ICa in both S100A1-treated (–11.3 ± 2 pA/pF versus –14 ± 3 pA/pF, –19.9 ± 1%, n = 5) and untreated cells (–6.1 ± 1 pA/pF versus –7.2 ± 1 pA/pF, –15.3 ± 4%, p > 0.05). This observation was confirmed by experiments with the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. Phosphodiesterases are known to be functionally up-regulated in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes, probably because of increased cAMP levels (23Ji G.J. Fleischmann B.K. Bloch W. Feelisch M. Andressen C. Addicks K. Hescheler J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The IBMX effect on ICa density did not significantly differ between untreated (n = 5) and S100A1-treated (n = 5) cardiomyocytes, suggesting similar cAMP levels (Fig. 5d). These findings were further substantiated by cAMP measurements in homogenates obtained from embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes, where control (279 ± 51 fmol/liter, n = 5) and S100A1-treated (274 ± 37 fmol/liter, n = 8) lysates (1 μm, 20 min) yielded almost identical values (Fig. 5e). When ISO (1μm) and IBMX (200μm) were used as positive controls to maximally enhance cAMP levels, similar increases of the cAMP concentration to 904 ± 47 fmol (control, n = 4) versus 919 ± 76 fmol (S100A1, n = 4) were found. Similar qualitative results were obtained 48 h after the addition of S100A1 (n = 6, data not shown). These findings indicate that S100A1 acts distal of the adenylylcyclase/cAMP pathway. PKA Activity—To study whether the S100A1-induced increase of ICa depends on the activation of PKA, ICa was measured in the presence of the selective PKA inhibitor PKI (10 μm), added via the patch pipette. Since S100A1-mediated augmentation of PKA activity was expected to result in an accelerated decay of ICa in the presence of PKI, the current was measured immediately after establishing the whole-cell configuration and 4 min later in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes. In S100A1-treated cardiomyocytes, a more pronounced decay (–7 ± 1.5 pA/pF versus –15.6 ± 1 pA/pF, –55.3 ± 9.5%, n = 10, p < 0.001) of ICa was observed than in controls (–9.2 ± 1.1 pA/pF versus –10.7 ± 0.8 pA/pF, –13.5 ± 10.4%, n = 9, p > 0.05), suggesting a S100A1-associated augmentation of PKA activity (Fig. 6, a–c). In a next step, embryonic cardiomyocytes were prestimulated with the cell membrane-permeable analogon of PKI and inhibitor of PKA, myristoylated PKI (1 μm, 30 min; Fig. 6d) (33Mason H.S. Latten M.J. Godoy L.D. Horowitz B. Kenyon J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, S100A1 (1 μm, 20 min) failed to stimulate ICa (–8 ± 1 pA/pF, n = 11), and accordingly ISO (1 μm) was almost without effect on ICa (–9.8 ± 1.2 pA/pF, +12.2 ± 5%, p ≤ 0.04, n = 10) compared with controls (–8.2 ± 1.3 pA/pF, n = 11) (Fig. 6d). To evaluate biochemically whether S100A1 led to a an increase of PKA activity in cardiomyocytes, we performed PKA assays on cardiomyocyte homogenates. As depicted in Fig. 7a, a marked increase of PKA-specific substrate phosphorylation was observed 20 min after S100A1 (1 μm) application (+50.3 ± 7%, n = 8) and after 48 h (+53.7 ± 7.4%, n = 4) as compared with controls. To elucidate possible mechanisms through which S100A1 enhanced PKA activity, reconstitution experiments using highly purified PKA subunits in a radioactive PKA assay with histone H1 as a substrate were performed. Fig. 7b shows that the regulatory subunit (R) was effectively inhibiting the activity of the catalytic subunit (C) (RC, left lane). Application of C alone resulted in a 7.3 ± 1.5-"

Because CXIV is almost absent in proliferating and/or dedifferentiated tissues, a functional role in maintaining cell differentiation is suspected. We demonstrate antiproliferative, quiescence- and differentiation-inducing effects of human CXIV and its recombinant fragments on mesenchymal cells. In primary human fibroblasts, in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, CXIV reduced de novo DNA synthesis by 75%, whereas cell numbers and viability remained unaltered. Cells showed no signs of apoptosis, and maximal proliferation was restored when serum was supplemented, thus indicating that CXIV induced reversible cellular quiescence. Exposure of fibroblasts to CXIV in vitro led to cellular bundles and clusters. CXIV also triggered trans-differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, as could be shown by lipid accumulation and by expression of the glucose transporter Glut4. These effects were also observed with the amino-terminal recombinant fragment Gln29-Pro154 that harbors the first fibronectin type III domain and a 39-amino-acid extension, whereas no activity was found for all other recombinant CXIV fragments. Based on these finding the development of small molecular analogs that modulate fibroblast cell growth and differentiation, e.g. in wound healing and fibrosis, seems feasible.

The extracellular matrix forms a complex molecular network that determines the specific histoarchitecture of tissues, providing cells with a scaffold and with signals that direct polarization, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Most of the structural extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagens, non-collagenous glycoproteins, and proteoglycans are multidomain proteins exerting different biological functions. CXIV 3The abbreviations used are: CXIV, collagen XIV; CI, collagen I; FCS, fetal calf serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase, FN-III, fibronectin type III; HF, human skin fibroblasts; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. belongs to the group of fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices. It is mainly found in well differentiated, collagen I (CI)-rich tissues, which suggests a role of CXIV in collagen fibril organization (1.Young B.B. Gordon M.K. Birk D.E. Dev.

Beside its specific interactions with other extracellular matrix molecules such as collagens type I and VI, CXIV displays numerous cell binding properties. The cell adhesion site for fibroblasts was identified within a stretch of 154 amino acids (Gln29-Pro154) including the first FN-III repeat (14.Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a not fully characterized amino-terminal 16-kDa fragment of CXIV isolated from rat granulation tissue was shown to be chemotactic (15.Nakagawa H. Takano K. Kuzumaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), underlining the functional potential of the amino-terminal domain. Because CXIV is almost exclusively found in differentiated tissues, we investigated its effects on proliferation and differentiation in different fibroblast populations, including preadipocytes, the latter being a well established model to study cell differentiation (16.Ntambi J.M. Young-Cheul K. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3122S-3126SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could show that human CXIV and in particular its elongated first FN-III domain comprising amino acids 29-154 are potent inducers of cellular quiescence and differentiation. Cell Lines and Reagents—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CCL-92) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (CL-173) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human fibroblasts (HF) were isolated from human foreskin tissue and used up to the eighth passage. If not noted otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Merck or Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Cell Culture—Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Standard culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 862 mg/liter l-alanyl-l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen). Cell layers were detached with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution (Biochrom). Experiments were performed in 96- and 24-well tissue culture plates with flat bottom (BD Biosciences). To ensure homogenous adherence, cells were spun down to the bottom of the plates for 10 min at 1,000 × g. 6-well tissue culture plates were obtained from NUNC (Roskilde, Denmark). Cell morphology in culture was directly examined by inverse phase contrast microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Briefly, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and all centrifugation steps were conducted at 11,000 × g for 30 min. Freshly collected human placentas were washed, homogenized, and preextracted in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium azide, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 4.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4). After the first centrifugation, insolubles were extracted in the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. For isolation of CXIV, NaCl was added to the cleared extract to a final concentration of 4.5 m. After 24 h, the resulting precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 2 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 90 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (buffer B) and incubated with DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) for 10 h. Unbound material was diluted with buffer B containing no NaCl to a final concentration of 70 mm NaCl and again treated with DEAE-cellulose for 10 h. Bound CXIV was eluted with buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl. Low molecular weight contaminants were removed by ultrafiltration with a molecular size exclusion of 300 kDa (Amicon, Witten, Germany). The final protein solution with a concentration of 200-300 μg/ml was stored in aliquots at -20 °C. CI was isolated by pepsin digestion, fractional salt precipitation in acidic and neutral buffers, followed by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography as described (19.Atkinson J.C. Ruhl M.

Purity >90% of all collagen preparations was confirmed by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE. Recombinant CXIV Fragments—Sequences spanning the coding regions of the following non-collagenous domains of CXIV were amplified from human placental cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (18.Ehnis T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20414-20419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar): Gln29-Phe115, Gln29-Pro154, Pro478-Val580, Ser336-Val895, Ile827-Lys1010, Ala1009-Lys1257, and Phe1210-Pro1462. All PCR products were cloned into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany), which introduces the DNA coding for a 26-kDa fragment of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli MN522 (Invitrogen), purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech), characterized as to their correct size and purity >90%, and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 5 mm glutathione. Immobilization of Collagens and Recombinant CXIV Fragments—CXIV and CI at different concentrations were immobilized on tissue culture plates for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Remaining binding sites were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Coating efficiencies were determined as described before (22.Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26884-26891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23.Schuppan D. Schmid M. Somasundaram R. Ackermann R. Ruehl M. Nakamura T.

Cell Proliferation as Determined by [3H]Thymidine Uptake—5 × 103 cells from preconfluent cultures were transferred to extracellular matrix protein-coated or uncoated 96-well tissue culture plates. In experiments with dissolved recombinant CXIV fragments, the standard culture medium was replaced with the appropriate assay medium 2 h after seeding. These cultures were incubated for additional 6 h before 5-10 μg/well of the respective fusion protein were added. After 20 h of incubation all cultures received 0.5 μCi/well [6-3H]thymidine with a specific activity of 5 mCi/mmol (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h. The cell culture supernatants were discarded, and cells were fixed with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. Samples were lysed and subjected to partial DNA hydrolysis with 50 μl of 200 mm NaOH, neutralized with 50 μl of 800 mm HCl, and collected onto a glass fiber filter (Skatron, Lier, Norway). [3H]Thymidine incorporated into DNA was measured for 3 min using β-scintillation (LKB Wallac Turku, Finland). Cell Number Determination by Sulforhodamine B Staining—To determine cell numbers, samples were compared with a standard curve of 6.25 × 102-2 × 104 cells of the respective cell line that were allowed to adhere for 2 h. A colorimetric assay with sulforhodamine B, specifically staining globular proteins was performed as described before (24.Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). In brief, adherent cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min and dried at room temperature before adding 0.4% sulforhodamine B in 1% acetic acid for 30 min. After a final wash with 1% acetic acid and microscopic inspection of the dried cell layer, bound sulforhodamine B was eluted (5 min) with 10 mm Tris base. Extinctions were measured using an ELISA-Reader (Dynatech Laboratories) at a wavelength of 560 nm. Quantification of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well tissue culture plate for 24 or 72 h, detached mechanically and washed with PBS. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at -20 °C for 30 min, incubated in 500 μl of PBS containing 250 mg/liter RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min and stained with 50 μg of propidium iodine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in a final volume of 1 ml. Cellular DNA content was analyzed using a FACS Calibur device and the Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences). Fragmented, S phase and M phase DNA was defined by its average size. Trans-differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—Trans-differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes was induced with slight modifications as described before (16.Ntambi J.M. Young-Cheul K. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3122S-3126SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transwell inserts (polyethylene/cellulose acetate, 0.4-μm mesh; Corning, Schiphol-Rijk, The Netherlands) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of CXIV or CI/well in 100 μl of PBS. After a wash with 200 μl of PBS, 5 × 103 3T3-L1 cells in 100 μl of culture medium were added to each transwell. To induce differentiation with soluble recombinant CXIV fragments, 3 μg of the respective GST fusion protein were added and renewed with every medium exchange. For control experiments medium was replaced by standard culture medium containing 1.7 μm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 500 μm methylxanthine at day 2 after confluence (positive control). Culture medium was completely exchanged every second day. Lipid Droplet Staining with Oil Red O—An Oil Red O solution was prepared as follows: 530 mg of Oil Red O were dissolved overnight in 150 ml of isopropanol, filtered (mixed cellulose membrane filter unit, 0.45 μm; Millipore, Molsheim, France), and 112.5 ml of bidistilled water were added. After 16 h at 4 °C the precipitate was removed by filtration before being stored in aliquots at room temperature. After 9-12 days of growth on the transwell membranes, cells were fixed (100 μl of 10% formaldehyde, 1 h), washed with bidistilled water, stained (100 μl of Oil Red O solution, 2 h), and counterstained (Meyer's hematoxylin solution, 5 min). For examination by light microscopy, membranes were excised and transferred to a slide. Digital images of the micrographs were analyzed using the Photoshop densitometry tool (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Measurement of Glucose Uptake—3T3-L1 cells grown for 9-12 days in 24-well tissue culture plates in the presence of 1.7 μm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 500 μm methylxanthine, or of immobilized CXIV (15 μg/500 μl/well) were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (18.3 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 272 mm NaCl, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin), incubated in the same buffer for 2 h, washed again, and treated with 1.7 μm insulin with or without 15 μm cytochalasin B. After 20-30 min at 37 °C, 2.5 μCi of [3-3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose with a specific activity of 5-10 mCi/mmol (Amersham Biosciences) were added in 200 μl of buffer for 15 min. Cell were washed twice with ice-cold buffer, lysed with 500 μl of 200 mm NaOH, and 3 ml of scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to measure incorporated radioactivity using a β-counter. Glut4-specific Western Blot—3T3-L1 cells were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates as described above for 5 days. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from detached cells using a subcellular extraction kit (ProteoExtract®; Merck) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated under reducing conditions with 200 mm dithiothreitol using 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted (55 min, 10 °C, 300 mA) to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane using a wet blotting device (Amersham Biosciences). Transfer efficiency was checked by reversible protein stain of the membrane (Memcode™; Pierce). After blocking unspecific binding sites with 5% skim milk powder in washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, 1 h), membranes were incubated with a polyclonal Glut4-specific antibody overnight at 4 °C (25.Al-Hasani H. Hinck C.S. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17504-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding of a horse-radish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was visualized using a non-radioactive detection system (ECL™; Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—For statistical analysis Sigma Stat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) was used. One-way analysis of variance was performed with the Tukey test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. CXIV Inhibits Fibroblast Proliferation—To test whether native CXIV affects cell proliferation, DNA synthesis of human HF and mouse 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts was determined after 24 h of culture on 3 μg/well immobilized CXIV. In comparison to culture on immobilized CI, CXIV reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation to 30 and 40%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Significant reduction of DNA synthesis was shown for 0.5-3 μg/well immobilized CXIV. The Elongated First FN-III Domain Harbors the Antiproliferative Site in CXIV—HF and 3T3 cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μg/well of the individual immobilized recombinant CXIV fragments that cover the entire non-collagenous domain NC3 of CXIV. A clear and strong antiproliferative effect was only seen with the elongated first FN-III domain Gln29-Pro154, because [3H]thymidine uptake was dramatically decreased by 75% in HF and by 91% in 3T3 cells when compared with the GST control, which itself had no effect on proliferation (Fig. 2B). All other fragments, including fragment Gln29-Phe115 that lacks the last 39 amino acid residues of the elongated first FN-III domain Gln29-Pro154, caused no or only a modest reduction of DNA synthesis, between 10 and 35% of control, except for fragment Pro478-Val580, which slightly stimulated DNA synthesis in both cell lines. Soluble Gln29-Pro154 Enhances the Antiproliferative Effect of Immobilized Native CXIV—To assess the impact of the spatial presentation of CXIV fragments Gln29-Pro154 and Pro478-Val580 on their anti- or proproliferative effects, recombinant fragments were added to HF and 3T3 cells cultured on immobilized native CI or CXIV. As found with the immobilized fragment, soluble Gln29-Pro154 strongly reduced, whereas Pro478-Val580 slightly increased DNA synthesis of both cell types (Fig. 3). In 3T3 cells the combination of immobilized CXIV and soluble Gln29-Pro154 led to an additive reduction of proliferation, whereas this effect was not observed in HF (Fig. 3, black bars). Effect of Native CXIV and Soluble CXIV Gln29-Pro154 on DNA Synthesis of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes are a well established model to study mesenchymal cell differentiation. Soluble fragment Gln29-Pro154 reduced DNA synthesis of 3T3-L1 cells by 45%, whereas immobilized Gln29-Pro154, native CXIV, and CI had no significant effect (Fig. 4A). However, 3T3-L1 cell DNA synthesis was reduced significantly on immobilized CXIV compared with the CI control in the presence of 10 versus 0.5% FCS (Fig. 4B), underlining its antiproliferative potential despite the multiple growth factors present in FCS. Antiproliferative Effects of CXIV Are Not due to Toxicity or Apoptosis and Are Fully Reversible—To eliminate the possibility that CXIV or fragment Gln29-Pro154 are toxic to cells, viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, and restimulation experiments with high FCS concentrations were performed (Fig. 5). Compared with the respective controls, cell numbers on immobilized CXIV or the recombinant CXIV fragments Gln29-Phe115 and Pro478-Val560 were not changed (Fig. 5A), whereas immobilized fragment Gln29-Pro154 slightly reduced HF cell numbers. These effects were also demonstrated for the 3T3 fibroblasts, and the results were confirmed by a fluorometric assay measuring the intracellular esterase activity by the enzymatic conversion of 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate (data not shown). Thus, the presence of CXIV does not contribute and fragment Gln29-Pro154 contributes only minimally to the reduced DNA synthesis observed for HF and 3T3 cells. DNA synthesis of HF that were precultured on immobilized CXIV or recombinant CXIV fragments under conditions of reduced serum (0.5% FCS) could be rescued by the addition of 10% FCS (Fig. 5B). This effect was independent of the concentration of CXIV or CXIV fragments used prior to the addition of 10% FCS, demonstrating that CXIV and fragment Gln29-Pro154 induced quiescence but not cell necrosis or apoptosis. In addition, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed no relevant changes in the relative amount of apoptotic 3T3 cells after culture on immobilized CXIV for 24 or 72 h (Fig. 5C). Immobilized CXIV Induces Markers of Differentiation in 3T3 Embryonic Fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—To address the question of whether the reduced proliferation was due to of the onset of cellular differentiation processes, growth patterns, lipid accumulation, and Glut4-expression were investigated after treatment with immobilized CXIV and recombinant fragment Gln29-Pro154. When grown on CI, 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts were homogenously distributed during a culture period of up to 44 h (not shown). In contrast, cells cultured on immobilized CXIV for 20-44 h progressively formed ring-shaped complexes (Fig. 6). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, immobilized CXIV and soluble fragment Gln29-Pro154 were strong inducers of lipid droplet synthesis in 23 and 11% of cells, respectively, when compared with 45% observed with the classical inducer mixture containing insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine (Fig. 7). Cells grown on non-treated surfaces, on CI, or in presence of GST alone showed no lipid droplet synthesis. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, lipid droplet synthesis is accompanied by the up-regulation of the glucose transporter Glut4. Therefore, Glut4 protein and Glut4-mediated glucose transport were investigated after the culture of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in the presence of CXIV (Fig. 8). To directly determine Glut4 protein expression after exposure to immobilized CXIV, soluble fragment Gln29-Pro154, or to the hormone mixture, 3T3-L1 cytosolic fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 8A). Untreated cells showed low base-line expression of Glut4, which was slightly up-regulated by immobilized CXIV alone and almost comparable to the hormone mixture positive control after the addition of the soluble fragment Gln29-Pro154 to CXIV-treated cells. Glucose transport was similar in control cells incubated with insulin or cytochalasin B (data not shown) confirming the absence of Glut4 expression. In cells grown on CXIV prior to the addition of 1.7 μm insulin, a distinct glucose uptake was induced that reached ∼65% of the cells pretreated with the hormone mixture serving as positive control, indicating the induction of Glut4 (Fig. 8B). The specificity of this observation was confirmed because, irrespective of pretreatment, the transport rate in the presence of insulin was reduced to 50% by 15 μm cytochalasin B, which inhibits Glut4-mediated glucose transport. In this study we investigated in vitro effects of human CXIV, an extracellular matrix molecule that is expressed in differentiated mesenchymal tissue, and recombinant CXIV fragments on fibroblast and preadipocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. We showed that immobilized native CXIV, and in particular its elongated FN-III domain Gln29-Pro154, induced quiescence and differentiation in human skin fibroblasts and mouse 3T3 cells, which was not associated with apoptosis, because proliferation could be reinduced upon the addition of 10% FCS. Although the CXIV fragment Pro478-Val580 reproducibly had a minor growth-promoting effect, all other recombinant CXIV fragments, covering the remaining 85% of the non-collagenous NC3 sequence of CXIV showed no effect. The results of these noteworthy biological effects of CXIV are in accord with published data on CXIV as a cell adhesion molecule. Thus we and others showed that the first FN-III domain and its immediate carboxyl-terminal extension (equivalent to fragment Gln29-Pro154) mediates attachment of hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells (14.Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26.Klein G. Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Brown J. Muller C.A. Timpl R.

In other reports, a 16-kDa amino-terminal fragment of rat CXIV similar to the recombinant human CXIV fragment Gln29-Pro154 used in our study was identified as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant (15.Nakagawa H. Takano K. Kuzumaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This amino-terminal domain harbors the (major) CXIV receptor binding site(s), and it interacts with heparin and the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin (17.Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26.Klein G. Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Brown J. Muller C.A. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The identified CXIV receptors are either membrane-bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans (26.Klein G. Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Brown J. Muller C.A. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and a chondroitin-dermatan sulfate variant of CD44. This CD44 variant is almost exclusively expressed on fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells (17.Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It may be possible that cell attachment and the induction of quiescence are mediated by the same receptors (either the CD44 variant or heparan sulfate proteoglycans), or at least receptors that bind to the same region of Gln29-Pro154 (17.Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18.Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Kresse H. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20414-20419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), thus making experimental investigations difficult because attachment is a main prerequisite for fibroblast survival in vitro. Our results, using immobilized CXIV and soluble Gln29-Pro154, point to a synergistic action in reconstituting a three-dimensional CXIV signal, as occurs in vivo, and result in an optimized activation of CXIV receptor(s) for induction of quiescence and differentiation. This is supported by the finding that the two-dimensional culture conditions of in vitro monolayers of human skin fibroblasts that induce tensile stress result in the down-regulation or complete absence of cellular CXIV expression, which can be restored by transfer to a three-dimensional culture system (8.Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28.Berthod F. Germain L. Guignard R. Lethias C. Garrone R. Damour O. van der Rest M. Auger F.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 737-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Growth pattern analysis revealed the formation of characteristic, ring-shaped cell complexes, which formed cell bundles after 44 h. Similar structures were described for cells in contact with quiescence-inducing basement membrane-like substrates, which are a mixture of poorly defined matrix and growth factors, including e.g. laminin-1, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (29.Sohara N. Znoyko I. Levy M.T. Trojanowska M. Reuben A. J. Hepatol. 2002; 37: 214-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30.Gaca M.D. Zhou X. Issa R. Kiriella K. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The effects seen in our experiments were solely induced by CXIV, and by its elongated FN-III domain Gln29-Pro154, and contamination of our highly purified CXIV, and in particular Gln29-Pro154 by type IV collagen or other matrix components or growth factors/inhibitors could be excluded. In addition, collagen type IV has to be immobilized to induce quiescence (29.Sohara N. Znoyko I. Levy M.T. Trojanowska M. Reuben A. J. Hepatol. 2002; 37: 214-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30.Gaca M.D. Zhou X. Issa R. Kiriella K. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), unlike to fragment Gln29-Pro154, which is active in soluble form (31.Schuppan D. Popov Y. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2002; 17: S300-S305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32.Schuppan D. Ruehl M. Somasundaram R. Hahn E.G. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 351-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Induction of quiescence is a hallmark and precondition for the onset of cellular differentiation (33.Loercher A.E. Tank E.M. Delston R.B. Harbour J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), being of high biological relevance, e.g. in wound healing or in liver fibrosis (34.She H. Xiong S. Hazra S. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We therefore looked for further evidence of CXIV-induced differentiation in fibroblasts. The differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes is a well established cell culture model for a differentiation process (16.Ntambi J.M. Young-Cheul K. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3122S-3126SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), that resembles the reversion of an activated myofibroblast to a quiescent hepatic stellate cell or fibroblast (34.She H. Xiong S. Hazra S. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, the finding that exposure of cells to native CXIV and fragment Gln29-Pro154 resulted in all features considered characteristic for adipocyte-differentiation in this cell line, e.g. lipid droplet synthesis, increased glucose transport, and Glut4 expression, provides strong evidence for the unique potential of CXIV to induce fibroblast differentiation and quiescence. The exact signal transduction pathways that emanate from CXIV and its amino-terminal domain Gln29-Pro154 to results in fibroblast quiescence and differentiation-induction remain to be defined. So far, the only CXIV receptor identified on fibroblasts is a chondroitin sulfate variant of CD44. Its signal transduction is linked to cytoskeletal rearrangement and survival (35.Marhaba R. Zoller M. J. Mol. Histol. 2004; 35: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), involving phosphoinositol-3 kinase and protein kinase B (c-Akt) signaling. This pathway is also active in 3T3-L1 cells when exposed to the insulin-containing hormone mixture used in our experiments, resulting in lipid droplet formation, Glut4 expression, and glucose uptake (36.Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Gagnon A. Dods P. Roustan-Delatour N. Chen C.S. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ up-regulation has been demonstrated to induce adipogenic transcription factors and quiescence in hepatic stellate cells, which makes it likely that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and the CXIV-induced cellular alterations share common signal transduction pathways (34.She H. Xiong S. Hazra S. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Taken together our results demonstrate that human CXIV and in particular its elongated first FN-III domain Gln29-Pro154 induce quiescence and differentiation in fibroblasts and preadipocytes. This may open the way for the development of CXIV-based low molecular weight analogs to induce fibroblast quiescence in biological processes as diverse as wound healing and liver fibrosis. We thank Renate Ackerman and Monika Schmid for their excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1991923195,"Activation of a heterotrimeric G-protein by an agonist-stimulated G-protein-coupled receptor requires the propagation of structural signals from the receptor binding interface to the guanine nucleotide binding pocket of the G-protein. To probe the molecular basis of this signaling process, we are applying high resolution NMR to track structural changes in an isotope-labeled, full-length G-protein α-subunit (Gα) chimera (ChiT) associated with G-protein βγ-subunit (Gβγ) and activated receptor (R*) interactions. Here, we show that ChiT can be functionally reconstituted with Gβγ as assessed by aluminum fluoride-dependent changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and light-activated rhodopsin-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange. We further show that 15N-ChiT can be titrated with Gβγ to form stable heterotrimers at NMR concentrations. To assess structural changes in ChiT upon heterotrimer formation, HSQC spectra of the 15N-ChiT-reconstituted heterotrimer have been acquired and compared with spectra obtained for GDP/Mg2+-bound 15N-ChiT in the presence and absence of aluminum fluoride and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS)/Mg2+-bound 15N-ChiT. As anticipated, Gβγ association with 15N-ChiT results in 1HN, 15N chemical shift changes relative to the GDP/Mg2+-bound state. Strikingly, however, most 1HN, 15N chemical shift changes associated with heterotrimer formation are the same as those observed upon formation of the GDP⋅AlF4−/Mg2+- and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound states. Based on these comparative analyses, assembly of the heterotrimer appears to induce structural changes in the switch II and carboxyl-terminal regions of Gα (“preactivation”) that may facilitate the interaction with R* and subsequent GDP/GTP exchange.

Heterotrimeric G-proteins are intracellular signaling partners for the large family of seven transmembrane helix G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; R*, the agonist-activated form of a GPCR; Gt, transducin; Gtα, the α-subunit of transducin; Gtβγ, the βγ-subunits of transducin; Gi1α, α-subunit of the inhibitory G-protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate; AlF4−, aluminum fluoride; ChiT, prodomain-released chimeric Gα; ROS, rod outer segment; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; R*, the agonist-activated form of a GPCR; Gt, transducin; Gtα, the α-subunit of transducin; Gtβγ, the βγ-subunits of transducin; Gi1α, α-subunit of the inhibitory G-protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate; AlF4−, aluminum fluoride; ChiT, prodomain-released chimeric Gα; ROS, rod outer segment; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. An agonist-activated GPCR (R*) binds to the inactive Gα(GDP)·Gβγ heterotrimer to promote GDP release and GTP uptake. The binding of GTP results in conformational changes in Gα (reviewed in Ref. 1Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), ultimately leading to the dissociation of Gβγ. Both GTP-bound Gα and Gβγ are capable of initiating signaling cascades through interactions with downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, and various phospholipases or ion channels (reviewed in Ref. 2Preininger A.M. Hamm H.E. Sci. STKE. 2004; : RE3PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα results in the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, returning Gα to its inactive GDP-bound ground state. Gα(GDP) eventually reassociates with Gβγ, thereby terminating all effector interactions. Activation of the retinal heterotrimeric G-protein transducin (Gt)by the GPCR rhodopsin represents an excellent model system to probe the molecular details of activated GPCR/G-protein interactions. Rhodopsin, the rod cell photoreceptor involved in dim light vision, is by far the best studied GPCR in terms of structure and function (3Ridge K.D. Abdulaev N.G. Sousa M. Palczewski K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Light triggers the cis → trans isomerization of the retinal chromophore to initiate structural changes in the transmembrane helices that results in the formation of the light-activated signaling state, metarhodopsin II or R*. This is accompanied by small, yet functionally significant changes in the solvent-exposed cytoplasmic loops that lead to the formation of binding and activation sites for several signaling proteins, including Gt (2Preininger A.M.

The Gα subunit (Fig. 1) is composed of two domains: a guanine nucleotide binding domain with high structural homology to the Ras family of GTPases and an all α-helical domain that, in combination with the GTPase domain, helps to form a deep pocket for binding the guanine nucleotide (reviewed in Ref. 3Ridge K.D. Abdulaev N.G. Sousa M. Palczewski K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Gα subunits contain three flexible regions designated switch I, switch II, and switch III that have been shown to adopt different conformations in the presence of GDP, GTPγS, and other nucleotide adducts and analogs (11Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 13Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form of Gα, which can be mimicked by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS, has decreased affinity for Gβγ and increased affinity for Gα effectors. The GTPase domain of Gα (Fig. 1), a variation on the nucleotide-binding fold (19Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), adopts a similar conformation to that observed in crystal structures of elongation factor Tu and Ras (20La Cour T.F. Nyborg J. Thirup S. Clark B.F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2385-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 21Tong L. de Vos A.M. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The helical domain represents an insertion between the α1 helix and the β2 strand of the core GTPase domain and folds into a six-α-helix bundle. Interactions among residues that span the two-domain interface are thought to be involved in R*-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange and subsequent G-protein subunit dissociation (22Grishina G. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15053-15060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Gα subunits also contain an extended amino-terminal region of 26-36 amino acid residues. The first 23 residues appear to be disordered in the structure of Gtα in both the GDP- and the GTPγS-bound states (11Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 13Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In contrast, structures of the Gα(GDP)·Gβγ heterotrimer indicate that this region forms an α-helix that interacts with Gβ (17Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that in addition to Gβγ binding, N-myristoylation of Gα also imparts structural rigidity to the amino terminus (23Medkova M. Preininger A.M. Yu N.J. Hubbell W.L. Hamm H.E.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) and in the corresponding structures for the α-subunit of the inhibitory G-protein, Gi1α (10Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E.

High resolution NMR methods, however, have provided insights into the structures of carboxyl-terminal Gtα peptides encompassing this region when bound to light-activated rhodopsin (25Dratz E.A.

All Gβ subunits contain seven WD (Trp-Asp) repeats that form small anti-parallel β strands (28Jawad Z. Paoli M. Structure. 2002; 10: 447-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the Gβγ dimer and Gαβγ heterotrimers show that the WD repeats fold into a four-stranded seven-bladed β-propeller, or toroid-like structure, whereas the amino terminus forms an extended α-helix (Fig. 1) (16Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 17Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Gγ folds into two α-helices (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal helix forms a coiled-coil with the α-helix of Gβ, whereas the carboxyl-terminal helix makes extensive contacts with the base of the Gβ propeller. Unlike Gα, the Gβγ dimer does not appear to change conformation upon dissociation from the heterotrimer (16Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Further, Gβγ association with Gα prevents Gβγ from activating its effectors (1Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of available structural data, many questions remain surrounding R*/G-protein interactions and, specifically, the functional role of Gβγ in facilitating Gα(GDP) binding to the activated receptor and the subsequent release and exchange of bound GDP for GTP. Previous work has demonstrated that G-protein binding to an activated GPCR requires the presence of both Gα and Gβγ subunits, suggesting both a direct and indirect role for Gβγ in enabling R* interactions (33Herrmann R. Heck M. Henklein P. Henklein P. Kleuss C. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24283-24290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, R*-catalyzed GDP release from Gα has been proposed to be mediated by Gβγ through two different mechanisms (the “lever arm” (59Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and “gear shift” (60Cherfils J. Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) models) based on available structural and biochemical data, as well as analogies to proposed mechanisms for guanine exchange factor (GEF)-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange in monomeric G-proteins. Clearly, a structural understanding of the conformational changes accompanying these processes poses many unique challenges given the inherently dynamic nature of the interactions. Thus, whereas the crystallographic studies have been instrumental in obtaining “snapshot” structures of dark state rhodopsin and have revealed guanine nucleotide-dependent structural rearrangements in the switch-I, -II, and -III regions of Gα, conformational changes in Gα that accompany R*/Gαβγ interactions remain unknown. Moreover, elucidation of the structural mechanism for R*-stimulated guanine nucleotide is severely hampered by a limited knowledge of the structures of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Gα, which are critical for a functional interaction with R*. As an initial step toward applying high resolution NMR methods to study the structure and dynamics of Gα in the heterotrimer state and in R*·Gαβγ complexes, we previously showed that a Gα chimera composed of amino acids 1-215 and 295-350 from Gtα, with an intervening sequence from Gi1α (Chi6) (29Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), can be expressed to high levels in a soluble form using a subtilisin prodomain fusion construct (proR8FKAM) and purified in a single step using an immobilized “slow cleaving” mutant form of subtilisin (30Abdulaev N.G. Zhang C. Dinh A. Ngo T. Bryan P.N. Brabazon D.M. Marino J.P. Ridge K.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 32: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mature, full-length chimera protein, which we call ChiT, exhibits a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa and has biochemical properties similar to those of Gtα isolated from bovine retina. Most importantly, milligram quantities of isotope-labeled ChiT can be purified using this expression/purification approach, enabling functional studies under solution NMR experimental conditions. In this paper, we show that ChiT can be reconstituted with Gtβγ subunits to form a functional heterotrimer that is amenable to structural analysis by high resolution NMR, thereby allowing us to probe differences in the conformation of Gα in various states as well as the structural basis for signal transfer from R* to the heterotrimeric G-protein. Surprisingly, analysis of the chemical shift patterns in the heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of the 15N-ChiT-reconstituted heterotrimer are found to be very similar to the spectra acquired for the GDP⋅AlF4−/Mg2+- and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound states of ChiT. In particular, chemical shifts for resonances associated with residues that report on changes involving switch II, α3, and the carboxyl terminus are found to respond similarly to heterotrimer reconstitution and formation of the “transition/activated” states (i.e. GDP⋅AlF4−/Mg2+- and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound forms of ChiT). The functional implications of these observations with respect to the role of G-protein βγ-subunits in “preactivating” Gα for interaction with R* and GDP/GTP exchange are discussed.

The supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 100,000 × g for 45 min was collected and loaded onto a S189 subtilisin BPN′ HiTrap NHS column (31Ruan B. Fisher K.E. Alexander P.A.

Gtβγ does not bind to the resin and is obtained from the flow-through. The column was washed with equilibration buffer, and Gtα eluted in the same buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The purified Gtα and Gtβγ subunits were concentrated and stored at -20 °C in Buffer A containing 50% glycerol (plus 50 μm GDP in the case of Gtα).

Rhodopsin concentrations were determined by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy using a λ6 spectrophotometer. Filter Binding Assay for Measuring G-protein-mediated Guanine Nucleotide Exchange—The functionality of the ChiT-reconstituted heterotrimer was examined by following the light-activated rhodopsincatalyzed uptake of [35S]GTPγS by G-protein using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (39Abdulaev N.G.

The filter-binding assay is based on the property that G-protein and its bound [35S]GTPγS are retained on nitrocellulose filters, whereas free [35S]GTPγS passes through the filters. The 500-μl assay mixtures initially contained 100 nm ROS rhodopsin solubilized and purified in Cymal-5 detergent and 4 μm Gt, Gtα reconstituted heterotrimer, or ChiT reconstituted heterotrimer in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. The samples were illuminated (>495 nm) for 1 min or allowed to remain in darkness, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μm [35S]GTPγS. The final concentrations of Cymal-5 detergent and glycerol in the assay mixture were 0.08 and 5%, respectively. After various time intervals (30 s to 5 min) at 20 °C, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and filtered through nitrocellulose with the aid of a vacuum manifold. The filters were washed four times with 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT, dried, and analyzed for 35S radioactivity by scintillation counting. NMR Spectroscopy of 15N-ChiT and 15N-ChiT-reconstituted Heterotrimer—One-dimensional 15N-filtered and 15N HSQC water flip-back, water gate experiments (41Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

Spectra were collected on 15N-ChiT samples (150-300 μm) in Buffer B. The nitrogen frequency was centered at 118 ppm, and the proton frequency was centered on H2O (∼7.5 ppm). One-dimensional spectra were collected using a sweep width of 7,200"

Here, we report the molecular identification and functional characterization of a voltage-gated chloride channel (ClC-4) and its novel splice variant (ClC-4A) from taste bud cells. ClC-4A skipped an exon near its 5′-end, incurring the loss of 60 amino acids at the N terminus. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized these two channels' transcripts and proteins to a subset of taste bud cells. Electrophysiological recordings of the heterologously expressed channels in Xenopus oocytes showed that ClC-4 and ClC-4A have opposite sensitivity to pH and unique ion selectivity. The chloride channel blockers niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid had a slight or no inhibitory effect on the conductance of ClC-4, but both blockers inhibited ClC-4A, suggesting that ClC-4A is a candidate channel for an acid-induced 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid-sensitive current. Furthermore, these two channels may play a role in bitter-, sweet-, and umami-mediated taste transmission by regulating transmitter uptake into synaptic vesicles.

Most mammals, including humans, are believed to possess at least five taste qualities: sour, salty, bitter, sweet, and umami (the latter being the taste for monosodium glutamate and certain 5′-ribonucleotides in humans while being a taste for a more diverse group of l-amino acids in several other species). Interactions between sapid molecules in food-stuffs and specific receptor cells in taste buds of the oral cavity initiate taste sensation.

Activation of these taste GPCRs presumably leads to changes in intracellular calcium activity and influx of ions through TRPM5. Opening of the TRPM5 channel is critical to the transmission of gustatory signals to the peripheral nerves. However, an increase in [Ca2+]i alone is not sufficient to trigger the full taste response because TRPM5-null animals in which phospholipase Cβ2 and IP3R3 are intact have markedly reduced behavioral and integrated nerve responses to sweet, bitter, and umami stimuli. TRPM5-mediated ion influx is very likely a major contributor to taste receptor cell membrane depolarization; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be uncovered. Sour and salty tastes apparently use several ion channel types to initiate their transduction, including amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive epithelial sodium channels (32Lin W. Finger T.E. Rossier B.C. Kinnamon S.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 405: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), acid-sensing ion channels (33Ugawa S. Minami Y. Guo W. Saishin Y. Takatsuji K. Yamamoto T.

Sato T. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and intracellular acidification (39Lyall V. Alam R.I. Phan T.H. Phan D.Q. Heck G.L. DeSimone J.A. J.

Like taste GPCR-mediated transduction, stimulation of channel receptors by ionic taste stimuli also triggers changes in membrane potential. It remains to be understood how receptor potentials encode and transmit the identity of gustatory stimuli to afferent neural fibers. Taste bud cells are epithelial cells with neuronal properties. A curious and not well understood property of these cells is their electrical excitability (41Roper S. Science. 1983; 220: 1311-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42Kashiwayanagi M. Miyake M. Kurihara K. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C82-C88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The passing of current or chemical stimulation by appropriate taste substances evokes action potentials in these cells, but not in surrounding non-gustatory lingual epithelial cells. Electrophysiological studies have characterized various voltage-gated currents, including tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents, tetraethylammonium-sensitive transient and sustained K+ currents, inward rectifier K+ currents, outward rectifier Cl– currents, and low/high voltage-activated Ca2+ currents (43Chen Y. Sun X.D. Herness S. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 820-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Behe P. DeSimone J.A. Avenet P. Lindemann B. J. Gen.

The distribution of these currents across cells within a taste bud is heterogeneous. However, little is known about these channels' molecular identities and their expression and interaction with other taste signaling molecules. Two types of action potentials have been recorded: 1) fast action potentials with shorter duration and larger inward and outward currents and 2) slow action potentials with longer duration and smaller inward and outward currents. It is unclear how these two types of action potentials may contribute to gustatory signal transmission and peripheral coding. Recently, analyses of the action potential activity of a population of taste buds in response to taste stimuli using an artificial neural network suggested that patterns of action potentials may be the source of taste quality coding (49Varkevisser B. Peterson D. Ogura T. Kinnamon S.C. Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify signaling molecules in taste bud cells and to gain insight into taste transduction and peripheral coding in the taste end organ, we have employed a single cell strategy and bioinformatics tools to isolate cell type-specific genes that are involved in defining particular physiological functions of each taste bud cell type. This approach has resulted in the identification of several key taste signaling molecules, including the taste receptor T1R3; G protein subunits Gβ1, Gβ3, and Gγ13; and the ion channel TRPM5 (7Max M. Shanker Y.G. Huang L. Rong M. Liu Z. Campagne F. Weinstein H. Damak S. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 20Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J.

Zhang H. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a voltage-gated, pH-sensitive chloride channel (ClC-4) and its novel splice variant (ClC-4A); their coexpression with other taste GPCR-mediated signal transduction components; and their unique pharmacological properties, pH sensitivities, and ion selectivity. Although the specific functions and activities of taste cell-associated chloride channels are still not well understood at this point, chloride currents have been previously recorded from taste bud cells. Some of these currents are modulated by adrenergic agonists, activated by hypoosmotic stimuli, or inhibited by the chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) (38Miyamoto T. Fujiyama R. Okada Y. Sato T. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 48Herness M.S. Sun X.D. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 50Gilbertson T.A. Chem. Senses. 2002; 27: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During mouse postnatal development, Cl– currents appear in a subset of excitable taste bud cells only after postnatal day 8, which coincides with the maturation of taste bud cells (51Ghiaroni V. Fieni F. Pietra P. Bigiani A. Chem. Senses. 2003; 28: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Molecular identification of these chloride channels is important for eventual determination of their contributions to action potential waveforms, firing properties, and ultimately to the strength of transduction. The data from existing literature combined with the characterization studies of taste ClC-4 and ClC-4A presented here suggest that these two channels may play a role in the taste stimulus-induced depolarization of membrane potential and signal transmission. Isolation of ClC-4 and Splice Variant ClC-4A cDNAs from Mouse Taste Bud Cells—Isolation of ClC-4 and ClC-4A cDNAs from taste bud cells was accomplished in two steps. 1) A 3′-end cDNA fragment was isolated from a single taste cell cDNA library by differential screening with cDNAs from gustatory and non-gustatory lingual epithelia. Construction and differential screening of single taste cell cDNA libraries were described previously (20Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Perez C.A. Huang L. Rong M. Kozak J.A. Preuss A.K. Zhang H. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Briefly, taste papillae were separated from the rest of a mouse tongue and enzymatically dissociated into individual cells. Taste bud cells were identified by their characteristic bipolar shape and transferred individually into Eppendorf tubes. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from single cells with oligo(dT) primers, tailed with dATP and terminal transferase, and amplified by PCR. The PCR products were ligated into the λZapII vector to construct single taste cell cDNA libraries. Individual phage plaques were picked, and their insert cDNAs were amplified by PCR with vector-specific primers. The amplified products were size-fractionated by electrophoresis, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and screened with 32P-labeled cDNAs prepared from non-gustatory lingual epithelium devoid of taste buds. Insert cDNAs that were not hybridized with the non-gustatory probe were presumed to be expressed selectively in taste cells, and their sequences were analyzed and searched against genome and expressed sequence tag data bases. One of the clones matched the 3′-end of human ClC-4. 2) Isolation of full-length cDNAs was carried out with mouse taste tissue cDNA. PCR primers were designed to encompass the entire mouse ClC-4 coding region (sense, 5′-AGGAGGATGATCTAGGACGCTGTC-3′; and antisense, 5′-TCTCAAAATAATGCCCATCTTATTGCT-3′). Two fragments were obtained and subcloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector. DNA sequence analysis and sequence alignment showed that the long fragment was the same as mouse ClC-4 (GenBank™ accession number XM_193014), whereas the short fragment was a splice variant of ClC-4, which we designated ClC-4A (GenBank™ accession number DQ186662). To determine whether these two isoforms are expressed in all three types of gustatory lingual papillae, a new set of PCR primers (sense, 5′-AGGAGGATGATCTAGGACGCTGTC-3′; and antisense, 5′-CATGCACCAGTGGGCCCTCTTTG-3′) was designed and synthesized to encompass the differentially spliced region, and PCRs were performed with first-strand cDNAs from circumvallate, foliate, and fungiform papillae and non-gustatory lingual epithelium. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (ClC-4, 2.2 kb) were used for in situ hybridization on fresh frozen sections (14 μm) as described (52Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody in the presence of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate was used for detection. Immunohistochemistry—Polyclonal antiserum against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated 13-amino acid peptide near the C termini of mouse, rat, and human ClC-4 and ClC-4A was raised in rabbits (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc.). Frozen sections (10 μm) of murine lingual tissue (previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose) were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% goat serum, and 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal antiserum (1:1000 dilution). The secondary antibody used was Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). To determine the type of cells expressing ClC-4/ClC-4A, double immunostaining was carried out on taste sections with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against ClC-4/ClC-4A and the mouse monoclonal antibodies against IP3R3 (1:50 dilution; BD Biosciences) and SNAP-25 (1:1000 dilution; Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, MD). The secondary antibodies used were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Fluorescent signals were viewed under a Leica confocal microscope. Heterologous Expression in Xenopus Oocytes and Electrophysiological Recordings—Murine ClC-4 and ClC-4A cDNAs and human ClC-4 (GenBank™ accession number AB019432) were subcloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO expression vector. Capped sense cRNA was synthesized from the linearized expression constructs by T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit and tailed with a poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion Inc.). The synthesized cRNA products were phenol-extracted, ethyl alcohol-precipitated, and then dissolved in nuclease-free water at ∼0.5 ng/nl for injection. Dumont stage V or VI oocytes were obtained from adult female laboratory-bred Xenopus laevis, and their follicles were removed by collagenase digestion. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 0.5 ng/nl cRNA and maintained at 18 °C for 4–6 days in modified Barth's solution supplemented with 5 mm sodium pyruvate (53Goldin A.L. Sumikawa K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.4)). To determine anionic selectivity, 80 mm Cl– was substituted with equivalent amounts of Br–, I–, or NO–3. In the study on the effect of pH on channel conductance, 5 mm HEPES (for pH 7.4) was replaced with 5 mm MES (for pH <7.0). For pharmacological analyses, inhibitors of niflumic acid (0.3 mm) or NPPB (at 0.1 mm) were dissolved in ND96 solution. Recording and current-passing micropipettes with tip resistances <5 megaohms when filled with 3 m KCl were pulled from glass capillaries (A-M Systems, Inc., Carlsborg, WA) using a horizontal puller (Sutter P-80/PC). Currents were recorded with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1200 A/DD/A system, and stored on a computer running pCLAMP 6 software (all from Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Currents were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and are shown without subtraction of leakage currents. Isolation of ClC-4 cDNAs—To identify genes that are selectively expressed in taste bud cells, we isolated individual taste bud cells and constructed single cell cDNA libraries with the λZapII vector (20Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Perez C.A. Huang L. Rong M. Kozak J.A. Preuss A.K. Zhang H. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Individual phage plaques were picked, and their insert cDNAs were amplified by PCR with vector-specific primers. The amplified products were size-fractionated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane. Southern hybridization of the nylon membranes showed that many inserts from the single cell cDNA libraries could hybridize with the radiolabeled cDNAs prepared from non-gustatory lingual epithelium devoid of taste buds. The few that were not hybridized were considered taste bud-specific (Fig. 1); insert DNAs of these clones were sequenced and bioinformatically analyzed. Among ∼200 taste bud-specific clones analyzed, one clone (GA5508) with a 906-bp insert cDNA was 83% identical to the 3′-end sequence of the human voltage-gated, pH-sensitive chloride channel ClC-4 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_001830.2). A subsequent search against the mouse genome data bases with the GA5508 insert sequence and the human ClC-4 cDNA sequence identified a corresponding mouse genomic sequence. Its putative cDNA sequence was predicted using GenScan software, encompassing partial mouse ClC-4 cDNA sequences deposited in the GenBank™ Data Bank. PCR primers were designed to cover the entire coding region of mouse ClC-4. Surprisingly, PCR amplification with taste circumvallate papilla cDNA yielded two fragments of 2.4 and 2.23 kb. DNA sequencing showed that the former is the same as the previously described mouse ClC-4 chloride channel with 747 amino acid residues (GenBank™ accession number XM_193014). However, the 2.23-kb fragment is a novel splice variant, lacking 155 bp near the 5′-end of ClC-4, including the presumed ClC-4 start codon (ATG). The amino acid sequence of the short form was deduced from the next in-frame start codon, which is probably the true start codon, there being no other start codon. A stop codon is present ∼140 bp upstream. Thus, ClC-4A putatively encodes a protein of 687 amino acid residues, lacking the N-terminal 60 amino acid residues of ClC-4. Sequence analysis indicated that the deletion of 155 bp is a result of exon skipping and that the new N terminus of the ClC-4A protein starts within a presumed helix domain of ClC-4 (helix A), which may be expected to significantly affect the channel's functions (Fig. 2). To determine whether these two isoforms are expressed in all three types of gustatory lingual papillae, a new set of PCR primers was designed and synthesized specifically for amplification of the differentially spliced region of the cDNAs. Reverse transcription-PCR detected both forms of the cDNA in all three types of taste papillae (circumvallate, foliate, and fungiform), but not in non-gustatory lingual epithelium (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Expression of the chloride channels in three types of taste papillae. Both ClC-4 and ClC-4A were detected in all three types of taste papillae (fungiform, circumvallate (Vallate), and foliate), but not in non-taste lingual epithelium (NT). PCR amplification was carried out with primers covering the differentially spliced region and first-strand cDNAs prepared from taste and non-taste tissues. The expected PCR products for ClC-4 and ClC-4A are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization of the ClC-4/ClC-4A RNA Transcripts and Proteins to Taste Bud Cells—To localize the RNA transcripts to taste bud cells, in situ hybridization was carried out with a 2.2-kb probe common to both ClC-4 and ClC-4A. The results demonstrated that the ClC-4/ClC-4A transcripts were selectively expressed in taste bud cells, but were absent from the surrounding non-gustatory lingual epithelial cells (Fig. 4). Sense probe controls showed no nonspecific hybridization to lingual tissue. To determine the expression of the ClC-4/ClC-4A proteins in taste receptor cells, we used immunohistochemistry with antiserum to a peptide near the C termini of the ClC-4/ClC-4A proteins on sections of murine lingual tissue. This antibody was able to recognize both ClC-4 and ClC-4A. The immunostaining results indicated that the ClC-4/ClC-4A proteins were present on the cytoplasmic membrane. Some spotty staining seen in cells within the body of the bud suggested that the proteins could also be present in vesicles such as endosomes and synaptic vesicles (Fig. 5). To determine the type of cells expressing ClC-4/ClC-4A, double immunostaining was carried out on taste bud-containing sections with the anti-ClC-4/ClC-4A antibody (produced from rabbit) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against IP3R3 and SNAP-25, which are cellular markers for Type II and III taste bud cells, respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscope images showed that nearly all IP3R3-expressing cells also expressed ClC-4/ClC-4A (Fig. 6). Interestingly, many, if not all, SNAP-25-expressing cells also expressed these ClC channels. Because Type II cells are taste receptor cells and because Type III cells make synapses with afferent neurons, the expression of ClC-4/ClC-4A in these two types of cells suggests that these chloride channels may play a major role in bitter, sweet, and umami taste signal transduction, modulation, and transmission. Functional Characterization of the ClC-4 and ClC-4A Channels—To characterize the function of ClC-4 and ClC-4A, we subcloned their cDNAs into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO expression vector, synthesized the capped sense cRNA with in vitro transcription, and tailed the cRNA with poly(A). The cRNA was then purified and injected into Xenopus oocytes. Membrane currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique 4–6 days after injection. Strong outward currents (which were absent in the control oocytes) were recorded in the ClC-4 cRNA-injected oocytes. The regulation of human ClC-4 activity by external pH has been reported, although the results appear contradictory to each other (54Kawasaki M. Fukuma T. Yamauchi K. Sakamoto H. Marumo F. Sasaki S.

A negative regulatory element with putative sites for δEF1 is present in the α7 proximal promoter region. To define the role of δEF1 in regulating α7 integrin expression, we overexpressed δEF1 in C2C12 myoblasts. This resulted in a major down-regulation of α7 protein expression. Promoter assays revealed that C2C12 myoblasts transfected with δEF1 showed a decrease in activity of the 2.8-kb α7 promoter fragment, indicating regulation of α7 integrin at the transcriptional level. We have identified two E-box-like sites for δEF1 in the negative regulatory region. Mutation of these sites enhanced α7 promoter activity, indicating that these sites function in repression. MYOD, an activator of α7 integrin transcription, can compete with δEF1 for binding at these sites in gel shift assay. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated a reciprocal binding of δEF1 and MYOD to this regulatory element depending on the stage of differentiation: δEF1 is preferentially bound in myoblasts to this region, whereas MYOD is bound in myotubes. The N-terminal region of δEF1 is necessary for α7 repression, and this region also binds the co-activator p300/CBP. Importantly, we found that the p300/CBP co-activator can overcome repression by δEF1, suggesting that δEF1 can titrate limiting amounts of this co-activator. These findings suggest that δEF1 has a role in suppressing integrin expression in myoblasts by displacing MYOD and competing for p300/CBP co-activator. α7 integrin levels increase dramatically as myoblasts differentiate to myotubes.

Integrins are heterodimeric molecules involved in cell-matrix binding and regulate diverse processes such as proliferation, survival, differentiation, and motility. Muscle myoblasts bind extracellular matrix proteins by using specific integrins, including the laminin-binding α7 integrin. Levels of α7 integrin increase over 50-fold during myodifferentiation. Tight regulation of α7 integrin ensures low levels of α7 inte-grin in myoblasts, which facilitates motility during embryogenesis and helps in muscle repair after injury in the adult (1Boa Z.Z.

In contrast, myotubes and myofibers have high levels of the α7 integrin essential for stable costameric and myotendinous junctions (5Miosge N. Klenczar C. Herken R. Willem M. Mayer U. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1591-1599PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to define how expression of α7 is regulated, not only for its role in myoblast movement, anchorage, and myotendinous junction formation but also because loss of α7 integrin is associated with certain types of muscular dystrophy/myopathy (6Hayashi Y.K. Chou F.L. Engvall E. Ogawa M. Matsuda C. Hirabayashi S. Yokochi K. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. Kaufman S.J. Ozawa E. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Tsukahara T. Wang J.Z. Hoffman E.P. Arahata K. Nat.

It is known that muscle-specific gene expression is regulated positively by the master regulators of the MRF family (myoD, myf5, myogenin, and MRF4) and negatively by Twist (7Zhao P. Hoffman E.P.

Although MYOD is expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts at modest levels, cells do not enter the terminal differentiation program. This failure to differentiate also reflects modulation of MYOD activity that is negatively regulated by several mechanisms, including the transcription factors mentioned above, by subcellular localization (14Vandromme M. Carnac G. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fesquet D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 613-620PubMed Google Scholar), and by association with the chromatin-regulating enzymatic activity of histone acetylase (p300/CBP) 2The abbreviations used are:CBPCREB-binding proteinCREBcyclic AMP-response element-binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseFBSfetal bovine serumRTreverse transcriptionCZFC-zinc fingerNZFN-zinc finger /deacetylase (15McKinsey T.A.

Consequently, myoblasts remain in an undifferentiated state and are prevented from premature myodifferentiation. Modulation of α7 integrin expression may also be regulated by these mechanisms during skeletal myogenesis. CREB-binding protein cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chromatin immunoprecipitation Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium electrophoretic mobility shift assay glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fetal bovine serum reverse transcription C-zinc finger N-zinc finger To understand the regulation of α7 integrin, a 2.8-kb promoter of the mouse α7 integrin promoter was cloned previously and shown to be positively regulated by myoD and myogenin but not by myf-5 or MRF4 (16Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, c-Myc, a repressor of myogenesis, was shown to negatively regulate α7 integrin promoter activity in myoblasts by directly binding to the –2.0- to –2.6-kb region of the promoter (17Xiao J. Jethanandani P. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49780-49788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). c-MYC levels are high in proliferating myoblasts but decrease during myotube formation enabling α7 integrin levels to increase during differentiation. Deletion constructs of the α7 integrin promoter have shown that an additional negative regulatory region is present in the –401- to –292-bp region of the mouse α7 integrin promoter (16Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Compared with the negative element between –2.1 and –2.8 kb, the region between –401 and –292 bp produces the dominant repression on α7 integrin promoter activity. Although this region is not responsive to c-MYC, it contains potential binding sites for δEF1, a zinc finger transcription factor with a homeodomain between the N- and C-terminal zinc fingers. δEF1 was first identified as a repressor of δ1-crystallin expression in lens (10Sekido R. Murai K. Funahashi J. Kamachi Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because δEF1 binds E-boxes, the binding elements for basic helix-loop-helix activators such as MYOD, a role for this protein in myogenesis was postulated. Confirming this prediction, δEF1 was found to negatively regulate myogenesis, and overexpression of δEF1 inhibited MYOD-induced muscle differentiation in 10T1/2 cells and repressed MYOD-dependent activation of the muscle creatine kinase enhancer (10Sekido R. Murai K. Funahashi J. Kamachi Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were observed when the human homolog ZEB was overexpressed in mouse C2C12 myoblasts, where myotube formation was blocked and expression of myosin heavy chain and α4 integrin markers of differentiation were down-regulated (18Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7961-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, although δEF1/ZEB is a repressor of muscle differentiation, its levels are not down-regulated during muscle differentiation (18Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is thought that increased levels of MYOD displace δEF1 from E-boxes and overcome δEF1-mediated repression. In this study, we investigated the regulation of α7 integrin expression by δEF1. Multiple δEF1-like binding sites are present in the proximal promoter regions that negatively regulate α7 promoter activity through interaction with δEF1. Further characterization revealed that this regulatory element also binds MYOD. Inhibition of the integrin promoter by δEF1 is dependent on myodifferentiation status. Cell Culture—C2C12 myosatellite cells were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum). For differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes, cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in growth medium and subsequently differentiated for 8 days with DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (Invitrogen), by which time most of the cells had fused into myotubes (16Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cells were maintained in Earle's minimum medium with 10% FBS. Plasmid Construction—The deletion constructs of the α7 integrin promoter p300, p400, p600, p1.2 kb, and the full-length p2.8-kb promoter have been described previously (16Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have, however, changed the numbering of the promoter region. In this paper, +1 indicates the start site of translation. The p300 construct spans –292 to +3 and p400 spans –401 to +3. By using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the AGGTG at –378 bp in the p400 construct was mutated to AACTC. The resulting construct was designated p400mut1. Additionally, the GACCTG site at –333 bp was mutated to GCCCGA and resulted in p400mut2. The PAGE-purified primers (IDT, Coralville, IA) used to generate these mutant constructs were p400-MUT(–378) forward and p400MUT(–333) forward (TABLE ONE). The p300 construct was used to generate mutations at –123 and –58 bp by using the primers p300MUT(–123) forward and p300-MUT(–58) forward. The resulting construct was p300mut1 with a mutant –123-bp site and p300mut2 with mutant –123- and –58-bp sites. The δEF1 expression vector was a kind gift from Prof. Yojiro Higashi (Osaka University, Japan). Deletion constructs of δEF1 were made by PCR amplification of the C-zinc finger region (–2426 to 3243 bp), the C-zinc finger plus the homeodomain (CZF-HD) from 1357 to 3243 bp, and the C-zinc finger, homeodomain, and N-zinc finger regions (CZF-HD-NZF) from 454 to 3243 bp. The primers used are listed in TABLE ONE. These constructs were cloned at the BamHI and KpnI sites of pcDNA3.1 A HisMyc(–). The vectors GAL4 Sp1 and the luciferase reporter vector GAL4Luc were the kind gifts from Dr. Reshma Taneja (Mount Sinai Medical School, New York).

(20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The binding reaction (20 μl) included binding buffer (13 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.13 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), 50,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe, and 3–4 μg of nuclear extract. The probes were end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out for 30 min on ice. Reactions were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For supershift assays, antibodies (1–2 μl) were added overnight to binding reactions. Antibody to δEF1 was obtained from Dr. Yojiro Higashi (Osaka University, Japan). Anti-MYOD antibody was from Novocastra (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Transient Transfections and Promoter Assays—C2C12 cells were plated at 150,000 cells/well in 6-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) and transfected 16 h later using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of DNA were transfected in duplicate wells, and total DNA transfected per well ranged from 2 to 4 μg. Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection of 80 ng of pRLβ-galactosidase as internal control. After 48 h, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 300 μl of lysis buffer supplied with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Hoffmann-La Roche). For myotubes, 200,000 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate and transfected as above. The day after transfection the medium was changed from DMEM with 10% FBS to DMEM with 2% FBS. Lysates were prepared after 96 h. Lysates from myoblasts or myotubes were collected, and either CAT or luciferase promoter assays were performed on a luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). CAT activity was determined from a standard curve using a standard CAT enzyme provided by the manufacturer and expressed as CAT activity relative to that of the empty vector, pCAT. Luciferase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system from Promega (Madison, WI) and expressed as arbitrary units. β-Galactosidase activity was determined with a kit from Tropix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All transfection experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared from C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes. In brief, cells were rinsed with several changes of cold cell rinse buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were scraped into a cell rinse buffer using a rubber policeman and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in chilled cell resus-pension buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). Protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo-ride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) were added to the buffer just before use. The cells were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing. Debris was removed by spinning at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, frozen in aliquots, and stored at –70 °C. Protein levels were quantified by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts (20–50 μg) of total proteins from each sample were loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), blotted with specific antibodies, and detected with an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Antibody to mouse δEF1 was a gift from Dr. Yojiro Higashi (Osaka University, Japan). To detect α7 integrin, polyclonal 1211 antibody against mouse α7 integrin was used (21Yao C.C. Breuss J. Pytela R. Kramer R.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1477-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-MYOD antibody (sc760) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and tubulin antibody from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). RT-PCR—C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with either empty vector or an equal amount of δEF1 expression vector using Lipofectamine Plus as mentioned above. Total RNA was prepared after 48 h using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Equal amounts of control or δEF1-transfected RNA were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Stratascript RT enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR was carried out as described previously (17Xiao J. Jethanandani P. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49780-49788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by using primers against α7 integrin (–378 F and α7 R) and GAPDH (mGAPDH F and mGAPDH R) listed in TABLE ONE. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were used for ChIP assay. A kit supplied by Upstate (Charlottesville, VA) was used following the manufacturer's protocol. C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were grown in 100-mm plates as described above. Proteins bound to DNA were fixed by the addition of formaldehyde (final 1%) to the medium. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS-Lysis buffer supplied with the kit. The DNA in the lysate (from 1 × 106 cells) was sheared to between 500 and 1000 bp by sonication using a Vibracell sonicator (Sonics Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) set to 25% output (four 10-s pulses with cooling between pulses). The lysate was further processed as per the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubation overnight with antibodies against δEF1 (from Dr. Yohiro Higashi, Osaka University, Japan), MYOD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control IgG antibody. DNA-antibody complexes were collected and processed as per the kit protocol. Eluted DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). For PCR, primers that span the δEF1 sites at –378 and –333 bp were used (–378 F and α7 R), see TABLE ONE. Thirty five cycles of PCR were performed, and the amplified products were run on a 2% agarose gel. δEF1 Is a Negative Regulator of α7 Integrin Expression—Previous studies have shown that α7 integrin remains at basal levels in myoblasts, but mRNA and protein expression are strongly elevated following myodifferentiation (17Xiao J. Jethanandani P. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49780-49788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To gain an understanding of the promoter regulatory regions that control α7 integrin levels during differentiation, several deletion constructs were analyzed for promoter activity in C2C12 myoblasts. As shown in Fig. 1A, the region from –401 to –292 bp displays significant negative regulation (compare p400 and p300). Two E-box sites are present in this region (Fig. 1B); however, we did not identify binding sites for any other known potential repressors. E-box sites are known to be involved in muscle gene activation through helix-loop-helix proteins of the MRF family (MYOD, myf-5, myogenin, and MRF). A search for E-box-binding myogenic repressors identified the δEF1 transcription factor. A consensus δEF1-binding site (CACC(T/A)GGTG) is present at –378 bp upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 1B), and a second potential binding site GACCTG is also present at –333 bp. To test if δEF1 has a role in the regulation of α7 integrin, we transfected C2C12 mouse myoblasts with an expression vector for δEF1. Myoblasts transfected with the δEF1 expression vector showed a striking decrease in α7 integrin expression at the protein level by Western blot compared with cells transfected with a control vector (Fig. 2A). Tubulin levels indicate equal protein loading. Most interestingly, MYOD levels were unchanged following δEF1 overexpression, indicating that down-regulation in α7 integrin levels is not an indirect consequence of lower MYOD levels. To examine whether δEF1-induced loss of α7 expression resulted from transcriptional down-regulation, we transfected C2C12 myoblasts with a full-length 2.8-kb mouse α7-CAT promoter construct and performed promoter activity assays. Cells were co-transfected with either an empty expression vector or with increasing concentrations of δEF1 expression vector. As seen in Fig. 2B, in the presence of increasing concentrations of δEF1, α7 promoter activity decreased progressively and plateaued with maximal inhibition near 70% with 3–4 μg of δEF1, indicating that δEF1 decreases α7 integrin expression through a transcriptional mechanism. In order to confirm repression at a transcriptional level, we also performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR for α7 integrin in C2C12 cells transfected with either empty vector or δEF1 expression vector. As seen in Fig. 2C, α7 integrin mRNA levels decrease when δEF1 is overexpressed, confirming that δEF1 exerts its effect at a transcriptional level. Mutation of Putative δEF1 Sites Results in Release of Repression—In order to determine whether the two potential δEF1-binding sites at –378 and –333 bp function in negative regulation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant binding sites and then performed CAT promoter activity assays. We used the p400(–401 to +3) construct to generate p400mut1 having a mutant –378-bp E-box as well as a construct p400mut2 with mutant E-box sites at –378 and –333 bp. C2C12 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant constructs, and promoter activity was assayed. Mutation of the –378-bp site resulted in release of repression (activity increased over 2-fold), verifying the site's function as a negative regulatory element (Fig. 3A). Mutation of the site at –333 bp resulted in only a small additional increase in promoter activity, indicating that this site may have a minor role in suppression of α7 integrin expression. These results indicate that endogenous δEF1 may be repressing the α7 promoter by binding at the –378-bp site and that the mechanism of repression by δEF1 depends on its targeting these sequences. We were interested in determining whether DNA binding by δEF1 is the only mechanism of repression. To test this, C2C12 cells were cotransfected with δEF1 and either wild-type or mutant p400 constructs. If δEF1 repression requires DNA binding, then mutation of the δEF1-binding sites should prevent repression. As seen in Fig. 3A, δEF1 was able to repress the wild-type p400 as well as the mutant p400mut2 construct, indicating that non-DNA binding mechanisms may be operative. It is also possible that additional unidentified δEF1-binding sites may be present in the p400 construct. We identified an AGGTG site located at –123 bp and a GACCTG site at –58 bp upstream of the ATG translation start site, respectively. We examined if these two sites are involved in repression by δEF1 by using a shorter promoter fragment, p300 (–292 to +3 bp), that has the –123- and –58-bp sites but lacks the two δEF1 sites at –378 and –333 bp. The site at –123 bp was mutated to give the construct p300mut1. A second construct p300mut2 contained mutations at –123 and –58 bp. C2C12 cells were transfected with the wild-type p300 or the mutant p300mut2 promoter constructs, and promoter activity was assayed. As seen in Fig. 3B, mutation of these two sites in the p300 fragment resulted in only a slight increase in promoter activity, indicating that these sites may not be important in negative regulation. We tested whether DNA binding is the exclusive mechanism of repression by transfecting C2C12 cells with δEF1 and wild-type p300 or mutant constructs. δEF1 could repress the wild-type p300 (activity decreased to ∼50%) as well as the mutant p300mut2 construct (activity decreased to ∼69%) (Fig. 3B). Because we did not identify any additional δEF1-binding sites in the p300 construct, we tested the possibility that, under conditions of overexpression, δEF1 is able to bind the mutant E-box. We found by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) that the mutant site does compete for binding δEF1, although with lower affinity than wild-type δEF1 (data not shown), and may explain the ability of δEF1 to repress the mutant p400 and p300 constructs. δEF1 may repress the p300 promoter through non-DNA binding mechanisms, but further work is needed to test this possibility. Because the two E-box sites in the p300 construct did not appear to play a major role in repression, we next assessed whether these two sites might activate the α7 integrin through E-box binding by MYOD. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with myoD and the wild-type p300 construct or mutant p300mut1 and p300mut2 constructs. We found that MYOD could activate the wild-type p300 construct (Fig. 3C); however, mutation of the –123-bp site (p300mut1) resulted in decreased activation by MYOD. Further mutation of both sites led to a complete loss of activation by MYOD (p300mut2). These results suggest that δEF1 represses the α7 promoter through the –378-bp site and that MYOD activates the promoter through E-box sites at –123 and –58 bp immediately upstream of the translation start site. MYOD is known to activate the full-length p2.8 α7 promoter (16Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Xiao J. Jethanandani P. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49780-49788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the current experiments have identified additional MYOD-binding sites in the α7 promoter. To examine if a non-DNA binding mechanism of repression might also be operative, we investigated whether δEF1 interacts with other transcription factors that bind the α7 promoter within the –401- to +3-bp region. We used a GAL4 reporter assay to test the effect of δEF1 on transactivation by Sp1, as several Sp1 sites are present in this region. As seen in Fig. 3D, δEF1 had no effect on transactivation by Sp1. This result indicates that δEF1 does not repress through an effect on Sp1. It is possible that δEF1 may target other transcription factors, such as AP1, which we have not yet tested. Identification of Potential δEF1-binding Sites; Repression Correlates with δEF1 Binding—Functional studies on the α7 promoter identified the –378-bp site as responsible for repression and the –123- and –58-bp sites as involved in activation. We wanted to analyze the binding of δEF1 and MYOD to the various E-box-like sites in this region. The consensus binding site for δEF1 is a/g/T/CACCT or the palindromic AGGTG/A/c/t; the lowercase represents a lower frequency of occurrence of the nucleotide in the δEF1 consensus binding site (23Sekido R.

Ligand residues involved in type II receptor binding are located in the two anti-parallel β strands of the TGF-β proteins, also known as the fingers. Activin-A mutants able to bind ActRII but unable to bind the activin type I receptor ALK4 define ligand residues involved in ALK4 binding and could potentially act as antagonists. Therefore, a series of FLAG-tagged activin-A/C chimeras were constructed, in each of which eight residues in the wrist loop and helix region (A/C 46–53, 54–61, 62–69, and 70–78) were replaced. Additionally, a chimera was generated in which the entire wrist region (A/C 46–78) was changed from activin-A to activin-C. The chimeras were assessed for ActRII binding, activin bioactivity, as well as antagonistic properties. All five chimeras retained high affinity for mouse ActRII. Of these, only A/C 46–78 was devoid of significant activin bioactivity in an A3 Lux reporter assay in 293T cells at concentrations up to 40 nm. A/C 46–53, 54–61, 62–69, and 70–78 showed activity comparable with wild type activin-A. When tested for the ability to antagonize ligands that signal via activin type II receptors, such as activin-A and myostatin, only the A/C 46–78 chimera showed antagonism (IC50, 1–10 nm). Additionally, A/C 46–78 decreased follicle-stimulating hormone release from the LβT2 cell line and rat anterior pituitary cells in primary culture in a concentration-dependent manner. These data indicate that activin residues in the wrist are involved in ALK4-mediated signaling. The activin antagonist A/C 46–78 may be useful for the study and modulation of activin-dependent processes.

Activins are homo- or heterodimers consisting of two β subunits, which are linked by a single covalent disulfide bond. In each monomer, two pairs of antiparallel β strands form short and long “fingers” that stretch out from the cysteine core of the dimer. The base of the fingers is formed by an α-helix together with a preceding loop and is also known as the “wrist” epitope (8Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H. Vale W. Choe S. Mol.

In human, genes encoding for four different β subunits have been identified (βA, βB, βC, and βE), which, in theory, offers a variety of different activin dimers. However, only activin-A (βAβA), activin-B (βBβB), and activin-AB (βAβB) have been proven to be biologically active (10Phillips D.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expression of activins C (βCβC), E (βEβE), AC (βAβC), AE (βAβE), CE (βCβE) (11Vejda S. Cranfield M. Peter B. Mellor S.L.

The βC subunit appears to be able to attenuate activin activity by forming a heterodimer with a βA subunit and thereby decreasing the source for the formation of biologically active activins (13Mellor S.L. Ball E.M. O'Connor A.E. Ethier J.F. Cranfield M. Schmitt J.F. Phillips D.J. Groome N.P. Risbridger G.P. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4410-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Results on the functional activity of activin-C were inconsistent. Lau et al. (14Lau A.L. Kumar T.R. Nishimori K. Bonadio J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Cell.

Chabicovsky et al. (15Chabicovsky M. Herkner K. Rossmanith W.

Activin signaling involves binding of the activin dimer to two types of cell surface transmembrane serine threonine kinase receptors (18Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). First, activin binds to its type II receptor (ActRII/ActRIIB), allowing the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of the type 1 receptor, ALK4, which then leads to intracellular phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (19Lebrun J.J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massague J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) revealed that ligand residues in the fingers' “knuckles” are involved in type II receptor binding. Especially Lys102 in activin appears to be highly critical, because when changed to Glu, the mutant completely loses its ability to bind ActRII (22Wuytens G. Verschueren K. de Winter J.P. Gajendran N. Beek L. Devos K. Bosman F. de Waele P. Andries M. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9821-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Less is known of activin residues participating in ALK4 binding. So far, knowledge can be deduced from the crystal structure of BMP2 bound to its type I receptor ALK3, which suggests that BMP2 wrist and finger residues are involved (23Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies showed that mutation of several of these residues induces a decrease in BMP2 activity. Of these, the BMP2 variants F49A, P50A (24Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and L51P (25Keller S. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) almost completely lost the ability to bind ALK3 as well as to induce alkaline phosphatase secretion from C2C12 cells, indicating that these residues are of great importance for ALK3 binding. Interruption of type I receptor binding in activin has the potential of causing antagonistic effects. Despite the fact that many residues in the BMP2 wrist are involved in ALK3 binding, mutation of corresponding activin residues has not yielded an antagonist so far. However, a point mutation in the finger region (M108A) of activin yields a ligand that binds the type II receptor but exhibits a biological activity that is 3 orders of magnitude lower than wild type. This point mutant acted as an antagonist in activin-responsive cell culture systems (26Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we focus on investigating mutations in the wrist region by introducing multiple residues of the biologically less active activin-C into the activin-A structure. The activin-A/C chimeras presented in this study were characterized with respect to their binding affinities for ActRII and follistatin, their ability to disrupt activin signaling, as well as their antagonistic properties. Antagonists of the TGF-β family members offer a potential treatment of diseases such as muscular dystrophy, liver cirrhosis, and fibrosis or may be used to improve wound healing. PCR Mutagenesis—A/C 46–53, 54–61, 62–69, and 70–78 chimeras were generated by “long PCR” (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 12 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 58 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C; and final extension, 10 min at 72 °C) using a pGem vector containing the wt activin-βA sequence with a FLAG tag inserted at the N terminus of the mature activin region as template and primers introducing base pairs encoding for the respective homologous activin-C residues. Blunt linear products were ligated overnight at 16 °C using T4 ligase (Invitrogen). To subclone chimeras from pGem into pCDNA, another PCR was performed (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and final extension, 10 min at 72 °C) using the pGem plasmids containing the DNA of the chimeras as a template, and a forward primer containing an NheI site 169 bp upstream of the N-terminal FLAG sequence (NheI pr), together with a reverse primer containing an XhoI site annealing to the C terminus of the chimeras (XhoI pr). The resulting products were cut with NheI and XhoI and then ligated overnight at 16 °C into an NheI-XhoI cut pCDNA cassette containing the remaining wt activin-A sequence. To obtain the cassette, an NheI site was introduced by silent mutation 169 bp upstream of the mature activin-A in pCDNA. The A/C 46–78 chimera was constructed by “overlapping PCR.” First, in two separate PCRs (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and final extension, 10 min at 72 °C) using pCDNA containing the sequence for either A/C 46–53 or A/C 70–78 as template together with NheI pr or XhoI pr, respectively, as well as primers introducing base pairs encoding for activin-C residues 54–69, two pieces of overlapping DNA were generated. In a second PCR (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and final extension, 10 min at 72 °C), the overlapping DNAs were combined, and NheI pr as well as XhoI pr were used as primers. The resulting product was cut with NheI and XhoI and ligated into the pCDNA cassette described above. All of the PCRs were performed using 2.5 units of Takara DNA polymerase (Takara, Madison, WI) along with 0.2 unit of Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels (Bio-Rad). To amplify the constructs, the plasmids were transformed into Top 10 competent bacteria by chemical transformation. Mini- and maxipreps as well as gel purifications were carried out using Qiagen kits. Transfection—For protein expression, plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using polyethylenimine as described (27Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e9Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were grown in 15-cm cell culture plates coated with polylysine to 70–80% confluence (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, 200 mm l-Glu). FCS-containing medium was removed, the cells were washed with serum-free medium, and 11 ml of serum-free medium was added to the cells. A solution of 36 μg of polyethylenimine and 24 μgof plasmid DNA in 1.2 ml of serum-free medium was prepared and let sit for 10 min at room temperature was then added to each cell culture dish. The cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Finally, FCS was added up to a final concentration of 10%, the media were harvested after 72 h, and the expressed proteins were purified. Western Blot—Crude medium, Anti-FLAG column eluate and HPLC fractions were checked for activin-A/C chimera expression by Western blot. The samples were run under reducing and nonreducing conditions on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) along with known amounts of wt activin as well as multi-marker (Sigma). Affinity column-purified primary antibodies raised in rabbit against activin residues 81–113 (kindly provided by Joan Vaughan, Peptide Biology Lab, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) were used in combination with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). The proteins were visualized by the addition of the alkaline phosphatase substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Silver Staining—A protein silver staining method was used for the visualization of impurities not detectable by the βA antibody. The samples were run on SDS gels, which were then dried twice for 5 min with 50% methanol, followed by a 10-min 50 mm dithiothreitol treatment and a 20-min 0.1% silver nitrate solution treatment. The excess of silver nitrate was sequestered by the addition of 25 ml of a 0.1% formaldehyde, 3% Na2CO3 solution for 30 s, which was discarded. Protein bands on the gel were then visualized by the addition of another 50 ml of the 0.1% formaldehyde, 3% Na2CO3 solution. Protein Purification—Crude media from 293T cells transfected with DNAs encoding for the activin-A/C chimeras were filtered through a 5-μm nylon filter to separate cell debris. 1 m MES buffer, pH 6.2, was added to the filtrate up to a final concentration of 50 mm, along with 0.5 ml of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose bead suspension (Sigma). To allow protein binding to the beads, the media were shaken overnight at 4 °C. Then the suspension was poured into columns (10 cm × 1 cm; Bio-Rad) equipped with a one-way stop cock, the flow-through and an additionally added 15 ml of 50 mm MES washing buffer were discarded, and activin chimeras bound to the M2 anti-FLAG agarose beads remaining in the column were eluted in five fractions of each 1 ml of glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.8. Fractions were neutralized with 100 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then subjected to HPLC purification. Chimeras were separated in a single gradient run using a C4 column (2.1× 150 mm, particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 300 Å; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) on an HP1100 HPLC machine (HP1100; Hewlett Packard). 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) as well as 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid dissolved in 90% acetonitril, 10% water (solvent B) were used as solvents. The gradient was set up as follows: min 0, 20% solvent B; min 40, 50% solvent B; min 41, 100% solvent B; min 45, 20% B; followed by a 12-min post-run with 20% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Chromatograms showed single peaks at 29.5–32.5 min for A/C 46–53, 54–61, 62–69, and 70–78. The respective fractions were collected, quantified by comparing the peak areas of the chimera with those of known activin amounts, dried down in the presence of bovine serum albumin, and redissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 200 mm glutamine to a final chimera concentration of 10 mg/ml and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Because the A/C 46–78 chimera did not come off of the column as a single protein, it was subjected to a further, isocratic HPLC sizing purification step. The fraction of the first HPLC step was dried down, redissolved in 50 μl of a 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 M sodium acetate solution, injected onto a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate at a flow rate of 0.04 ml/min. A single peak fraction at 35 min was collected and directly subjected to a desalting HPLC run using the same C4 column as it was used for the first purification step. Conditions were as follows: min 0, 0% solvent B; min 5, 20% solvent B; min 30, 50% solvent B; min 31, 100% solvent B; min 35, 0% solvent B; followed by a 10-min post-run with 0% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A single peak fraction at 24 min was collected, dried down, and redissolved as described above for the other chimeras. The proteins were stored at –80 °C. ActRII Binding—The ActRII binding assay was performed as previously described (26Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 T cells seeded into 24-well plates coated with polylysine at a density of 150,000 cells-well were transfected the next day with mouse ActRII using PerFectin (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). 48 h later, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the chimeras and wt activin in the presence of a constant amount of iodinated wt activin tracer (200,000 cpm/well, generated using the chloramine T method) for 2 h in binding buffer containing 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and MgSO4. After the incubation period, the binding buffer was removed, and the cells were washed three times with Hepes dissociation buffer were lysed with 1% SDS solution for 20 min. Radioactivity in the cell lysates was determined using a γ counter (APEX Micromedic Systems, Horsham, PA). A3Lux Assay—293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates coated with polylysine at a density of 150,000 cells/well. The next day, the cells of each well were transfected overnight with a mixture containing A3 Lux (25 ng) and β-galactosidase (25 ng) reporter plasmids, the transcription factor FAST2 (50 ng), and empty pCDNA3 vector (400 ng) using Perfectin transfection reagent. Then the cells were treated with wt activin-A and the different activin-A/C chimeras in concentrations from 0–40 nm for 16–24 h. The media were removed; the cells were lysed with ice-cold lyses buffer containing 25 mm glycylglycine, 4 nm EGTA, 15 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, as well as 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min; and the lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. To assess antagonistic properties of the A/C 46–78 chimera, the cells were treated alternatively either with 100 pm wt activin, 500 pm myostatin, or 50 pm TGF-β in the presence of increasing concentrations of the chimera for 16–24 h. Inhibition of Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) Release from LβT2 Cells—LβT2 cells were seeded into 48-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% FCS and glutamine. At 50% confluence, the cells were washed three times with Hepes dissociation buffer and then treated with increasing concentrations of the A/C 46–78 chimera (0–40 nm) in the presence of 100 pm wt activin-A. 72 h later the media were harvested, and the concentration of the secreted FSH was determined by radioimmunoassay. Inhibition of FSH Release from Rat Interior Pituitary Cells—The assay was performed as described (28Fischer W.H. Park M. Donaldson C. Wiater E. Vaughan J. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 176: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly isolated cells from male Sprague-Dawley rat interior pituitaries of several animals were combined and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well in βPJ medium supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and appropriate growth factors (29Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The next day, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the A/C 46–78 chimera (0–40 nm) with or without the addition of 100 pm wt activin-A. 72 h later the media were harvested, and the concentration of the secreted FSH was determined by radioimmunoassay. Follistatin Binding—Follistatin binding was carried out in a cell-free assay system as described (28Fischer W.H. Park M. Donaldson C. Wiater E. Vaughan J. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 176: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of follistatin 288 were incubated with increasing concentrations of the chimeras (0–40 nm) in the presence of a constant amount of radiolabeled wt activin-A along with a primary antibody against follistatin 288 raised in sheep for 90 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl. Then 100 μl of a premix containing 1% normal rabbit serum, 1% sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and 10% polyethyleneglycol was added and then incubated on ice for 30 min to precipitate the follistatin antibody-follistatin-activin-chimera complexes. Precipitates were spun down, the supernatant was removed, and the radioactivity in the pellet was determined using a γ counter (APEX Micromedic Systems). Chimera Construction—Because the majority of the BMP2 residues involved in ALK3 binding are located in the BMP2 wrist, (23Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) we focused on this region in activin as well. However, with respect to a recent finding showing that the introduction of single point mutations in the activin wrist epitope does not have any significant effect on activin activity (26Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we decided to generate activin chimeras with more severe mutations in the wrist. The biologically less active activin-C only shares 11 out 32 amino acids in the wrist with activin-A, which might contribute to its low activity and also to a lower affinity for ALK4 when compared with activin-A. Therefore, we constructed four mutants in which in each of them eight residues are changed from activin-A to activin-C (A/C 46–53, A/C 54–61, A/C 62–69, and A/C 70–78) and one chimera with the entire wrist changed from activin-A to activin-C (A/C 46–78) (Fig. 1). Activin mutants retaining high affinity for the type 2 receptor ActRII but losing the ability to signal in an activin-like manner would be potential activin antagonists and might reveal a general principle for the generation of desired antagonists of TGF-β superfamily proteins. Expression—The Western blots of single peak HPLC fractions (for details see “Materials and Methods”) of the A/C 46–53, A/C 54–61, A/C 62–69, and A/C 70–78 chimeras showed bands at ∼14 and 28 kDa, whereas the wt activin-A standard appeared at about 13 and 26 kDa when run under reduced and nonreduced conditions, respectively (Fig. 2). This indicates that the activin-A/C chimeras produced and secreted by 293T cells are, like wt activin-A, able to form dimers. The difference in size observed between wt activin and the chimeras is due to the FLAG tag introduced at the N terminus of the chimeras. As for the chimera with the entire wrist changed from activin-A to activin-C (A/C 46–78 chimera), one HPLC step on a C4 column was not sufficient for its complete purification. To obtain a pure A/C 46–78 chimera protein, the peak fraction collected at 34 min in the first HPLC run was subjected to a further sizing step followed by a desalting run as described under “Materials and Methods.” A single peak fraction eluting off of the C4 column in the desalting run at 24 min resulted in a single band when analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2). Like the four chimeras with only eight residues changed from activin-A to activin-C, the chimera A/C 46–78 is able to form a dimer as indicated by a 14-kDa band under reducing conditions and a 28-kDa band under nonreducing conditions. Silver staining of the respective HPLC fractions of all five chimeras run on an SDS gel proved only negligible contamination with proteins not detected by the primary antibody against the βA subunit, if at all (not shown). Expression levels for the chimeras ranged between 0.5 and 1 μg of purified protein/15-cm cell culture dish. ActRII Binding—To test the ability of the chimeras to bind the activin type II receptor, a binding assay was performed using 293T cells transiently transfected with mouse ActRII. Displacement curves were generated by incubating the cells with 125I-activin in the presence of increasing concentrations of wt activin-A or activin-A/C chimeras. The EC50 value of wt activin-A for ActRII was ∼200 pm, and the EC50 values of the FLAG-tagged chimeras for ActRII ranged from 262 to 545 pm (Fig. 3). Thus, the binding data indicate that the affinity of all five chimeras for ActRII is only slightly reduced when compared with wt activin-A. This result is in line with predictions made based on the crystal structures of activin bound to ActRII (8Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H. Vale W. Choe S. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1979214744,"Impairments in signal transduction, leading to the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, or migration are frequently the cause of cancer. Since the accurate spatial and temporal location of their components is crucial to ensure the correct regulation of these signaling pathways, it could be anticipated that defects in intracellular trafficking are at the base of certain neoplasias. However, the trafficking of many components of pathways frequently up-regulated in cancers, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, are largely unknown. Here, we show that the pro-transforming growth factor-α (pro-TGF-α), a prototypical EGFR ligand, is endocytosed from the cell surface via a clathrin-dependent pathway. Internalized pro-TGF-α does not progress to the lysosome; instead, it is delivered to the cell surface via recycling endosomes. To analyze the functional meaning of the internalization of pro-TGF-α, we used a deletion construct that is normally transported to the cell surface but is deficiently endocytosed. Due to this impairment, the levels of this construct at the cell surface are dramatically augmented. Consequently, the deletion construct displays a higher EGFR-activating ability, revealing a link between the trafficking of pro-TGF-α and the signaling by the EGFR and opening the possibility that defects in the trafficking of the growth factor may contribute to the development of tumors."
