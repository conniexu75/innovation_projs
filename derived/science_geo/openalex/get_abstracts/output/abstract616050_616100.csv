https://openalex.org/W2885216398,"The Dodd Frank Act was passed by the US Congress in July 2010 and included a provision-Section 1502-that aimed to break the link between conflict and minerals in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. To date there is only one rigorous quantitative analysis that investigates the impact of Dodd-Frank on local conflict events. Looking at the short-term impact (2011-2012), it finds that the policy backfired. This study builds on a larger, more representative, dataset of mining sites and extends the time horizon by three years (2013-2015). The results indicate that the policy also backfired in the longer run, especially in areas home to gold mines. For territories with the average number of gold mines, the introduction of Dodd-Frank increased the incidence of battles with 44%; looting with 51% and violence against civilians with 28%, compared to pre-Dodd Frank averages. Delving deeper into the impact of the conflict minerals legislation is important, as President Trump suspended the legislation in February 2017 for a two-year period, ordering his administration to replace it with another policy."
https://openalex.org/W2886266170,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the US. Despite multiple large-scale genetic sequencing studies, identification of predictors of patient survival remains challenging. We performed a comprehensive assessment and integrative analysis of large-scale gene expression datasets, across multiple platforms, to enable discovery of a prognostic gene signature for patient survival in pancreatic cancer. PDAC RNA-Sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was stratified into Survival+ (>2-year survival) and Survival–(<1-year survival) cohorts (n = 47). Comparisons of RNA expression profiles between survival groups and normal pancreatic tissue expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus generated an initial PDAC specific prognostic differential expression gene list. The candidate prognostic gene list was then trained on the Australian pancreatic cancer dataset from the ICGC database (n = 103), using iterative sampling based algorithms, to derive a gene signature predictive of patient survival. The gene signature was validated in 2 independent patient cohorts and against existing PDAC subtype classifications. We identified 707 candidate prognostic genes exhibiting differential expression in tumor versus normal tissue. A substantial fraction of these genes was also found to be differentially methylated between survival groups. From the candidate gene list, a 5-gene signature (ADM, ASPM, DCBLD2, E2F7, and KRT6A) was identified. Our signature demonstrated significant power to predict patient survival in two distinct patient cohorts and was independent of AJCC TNM staging. Cross-validation of our gene signature reported a better ROC AUC (≥ 0.8) when compared to existing PDAC survival signatures. Furthermore, validation of our signature through immunohistochemical analysis of patient tumor tissue and existing gene expression subtyping data in PDAC, demonstrated a correlation to the presence of vascular invasion and the aggressive squamous tumor subtype. Assessment of these genes in patient biopsies could help further inform risk-stratification and treatment decisions in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2886256969,"The role of rhizosphere microbial communities in the degradation of hydrocarbons remains poorly understood and is a field of active study. We used high throughput sequencing to explore the rhizosphere microbial diversity in the alfalfa and barley planted oil contaminated soil samples. The analysis of 16s rRNA sequences showed Proteobacteria to be the most enriched (45.9%) followed by Bacteriodetes (21.4%) and Actinobacteria (10.4%) phyla. The results also indicated differences in the microbial diversity among the oil contaminated planted soil samples. The oil contaminated planted soil samples showed a higher richness in the microbial flora when compared to that of untreated samples, as indicated by the Chao1 indices. However, the trend was different for the diversity measure, where oil contaminated barley planted soil samples showed slightly lower diversity indices. While the clustering of soil samples grouped the oil contaminated samples within and across the plant types, the clean sandy soil samples formed a separate group. The oil contaminated rhizosphere soil showed an enrichment of known oil-degrading genera, such as Alcanivorax and Aequorivita, later being specifically enriched in the contaminated soil samples planted with barley. Overall, we found a few well known oil-degrading bacterial groups to be enriched in the oil contaminated planted soil samples compared to the untreated samples. Further, phyla such as Thermi and Gemmatimonadetes showed an enrichment in the oil contaminated soil samples, indicating their potential role in hydrocarbon degradation. The findings of the current study will be useful in understanding the rhizosphere microflora responsible for oil degradation and thus can help in designing appropriate phytoremediation strategies for oil contaminated lands."
https://openalex.org/W2887319244,"Finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) is an important dry-land cereal in Asia and Africa because of its ability to provide assured harvest under extreme dry conditions and excellent nutritional properties. However, the genetic improvement of the crop is lacking in the absence of suitable genomic resources for reliable genotype-phenotype associations. Keeping this in view, a diverse global finger millet germplasm collection of 113 accessions was evaluated for 14 agro-morphological characters in two environments viz. ICAR-Vivekananda Institute of Hill Agriculture, Almora (E1) and Crop Research Centre (CRC), GBPUA&T, Pantnagar (E2), India. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis of phenotypic data separated the Indian and exotic accessions into two separate groups. Previously generated SNPs through genotyping by sequencing (GBS) were used for association mapping to identify reliable marker(s) linked to grain yield and its component traits. The marker trait associations were determined using single locus single trait (SLST), multi-locus mixed model (MLMM) and multi-trait mixed model (MTMM) approaches. SLST led to the identification of 20 marker-trait associations (MTAs) (p value<0.01 and <0.001) for 5 traits. While advanced models, MLMM and MTMM resulted in additional 36 and 53 MTAs, respectively. Nine MTAs were common out of total 109 associations in all the three mapping approaches (SLST, MLMM and MTMM). Among these nine SNPs, five SNP sequences showed homology to candidate genes of Oryza sativa (Rice) and Setaria italica (Foxtail millet), which play an important role in flowering, maturity and grain yield. In addition, 67 and 14 epistatic interactions were identified for 10 and 7 traits at E1 and E2 locations, respectively. Hence, the 109 novel SNPs associated with important agro-morphological traits, reported for the first time in this study could be precisely utilized in finger millet genetic improvement after validation."
https://openalex.org/W2885067420,"Background Perinatal and paediatric autopsy rates are at historically low levels with declining uptake due to dislike of the invasiveness of the procedure, and religious objections particularly amongst Muslim and Jewish parents. Less invasive methods of autopsy including imaging with and without tissue sampling have been shown to be feasible alternatives. We sought to investigate attitudes including religious permissibility and potential uptake amongst members of the Muslim and Jewish communities in the United Kingdom. Methods Semi-structured interviews with religious and faith-based authorities (n = 16) and bereaved parents from the Jewish community (n = 3) as well as 10 focus groups with community members (60 Muslim participants and 16 Jewish participants) were conducted. Data were analysed using thematic analysis to identify key themes. Findings Muslim and Jewish religious and faith-based authorities agreed that non-invasive autopsy with imaging was religiously permissible because it did not require incisions or interference with the body. A minimally invasive approach was less acceptable as it still required incisions to the body, although in those circumstances where it was required by law it was more acceptable than a full autopsy. During focus group discussions with community members, the majority of participants indicated they would potentially consent to a non-invasive autopsy if the body could be returned for burial within 24 hours, or if a family had experienced multiple fetal/pregnancy losses and the information gained might be useful in future pregnancies. Minimally invasive autopsy was less acceptable but around half of participants might consent if a non-invasive autopsy was not suitable, with the exception of the Jewish Haredi community who unanimously stated they would decline this alternative. Conclusions Our research suggests less invasive autopsy offers a viable alternative to many Muslim and Jewish parents in the UK who currently decline a full autopsy. The findings may be of importance to other countries with significant Muslim and/or Jewish communities as well as to other religious communities where concerns around autopsy exist. Awareness-raising amongst religious leaders and community members will be important if these methods become routinely available."
https://openalex.org/W2885936885,"Passive surveillance of malaria in health facilities remains vital for implementation of control and elimination programs. It is therefore essential understanding current age profile of clinical malaria morbidity, mortality and presentations in areas with variant infection susceptibility. This study aimed at understanding the current malaria morbidity and mortality in Western Kenya.Surveillance of clinical and asymptomatic parasitological positivity rates of all malaria suspected patients and school children were respectively determined from June 2015 to August 2016. From 2014 to 2016, register books in hospitals were referred and the confirmed malaria cases in conjunction with total number of monthly outpatient visits (OPD) counted. All registered malaria admissions were counted together with other causes of admissions. Moreover, outcome of malaria admissions in terms of discharge or death was recorded using inpatient charts within the same time frame. Prospective surveillance of severe malaria collected information on clinical features of the disease. Giemsa stained blood slides confirmed existence of malaria parasitemia. Chi-square and analysis of variance tests were used, respectively, to compute proportions and means; then a comparison was made between different age groups, periods, and study areas.During the survey of asymptomatic infections among school children, overall blood slide positivity ranged from 6.4% at the epidemic prone site to 38.3% at the hyperendemic site. During the clinical malaria survey, school age children (5-14) presented with overall the highest (45%) blood slide positivity rate among those suspected to have the infection at the epidemic prone study site. The survey of all malaria confirmed and registered cases at OPD found 17% to 27% of all consultations among <5 children and 9.9% to 20.7% of all OPD visits among the ≥5 patients were due to malaria. Moreover, survey of all registered causes of admission in hospitals found 47% of admissions were due to malaria. The disease was a major cause of admission in epidemic prone setting where 63.4% of the <5 children and 62.8% of the ≥5 patients were admitted due to malaria (p>0.05) and 40% of all malaria admissions were school age children. Malaria related death rate was highest among <5 years at the hyperendemic site, that is 60.9 death per 1000 malaria <5 admissions. Conversely, the epidemic prone setting experienced highest malaria related death among ≥15 years (18.6 death per 1000 admissions) than the < 15 years (5.7 death per 1000 admissions of the <15 years) (p< 0.001). Surveillance of severe form of the disease found that hyperpyrexia, hyperparastemia, prostration and convulsions as common presentations of severe disease.Malaria is still the major cause of hospital consultations in Western Kenya with an alarming number of severe forms of the disease among the school aged children at the epidemic prone setting. Mortalities were higher among <5 children years in high infection transmission setting and among ≥15 years in low and moderate transmission settings. Surveillance of asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria along with evaluation of current interventions in different age groups should be implemented in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W2886161841,"Background The degree to which episodic and semantic memory processes contribute to retrospective self-reports have been shown to depend on the length of reporting period. Robinson and Clore (2002) argued that when the amount of accessible detail decreases due to longer reporting periods, an episodic retrieval strategy is abandoned in favor of a semantic retrieval strategy. The current study further examines this shift between retrieval strategies by conceptually replicating the model of Robinson and Clore (2002) for both emotions and symptoms and by attempting to estimate the exact moment of the theorized shift. Method A sample of 469 adults reported the extent to which they experienced 8 states (excited, happy, calm, sad, anxious, angry, pain, stress) over 12 time frames (right now to in general). A series of curvilinear and piecewise linear multilevel growth models were used to examine the pattern of response times and response levels (i.e., rated intensity on a 1–5 scale) across the different time frames. Results Replicating previous results, both response times and response levels increased with longer time frames. In contrast to prior work, no consistent evidence was found for a change in response patterns that would suggest a shift in retrieval strategies (i.e., a flattening or decrease of the slope for longer time frames). The relationship between the time frames and response times/levels was similar for emotions and symptoms. Conclusions Although the current study showed a pronounced effect of time frame on response times and response levels, it did not replicate prior work that suggested a shift from episodic to semantic memory as time frame duration increased. This indicates that even for longer time frames individuals might attempt to retrieve episodic information to provide a response. We suggest that studies relying on self-report should use the same well-defined time frames across all self-reported measures."
https://openalex.org/W2886430848,"Sumoylation is one of the post translational modifications, which affects cellular processes in plants through conjugation of small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) to target substrate proteins. Response to various abiotic environmental stresses is one of the major cellular functions regulated by SUMO conjugation. SIZ1 is a SUMO E3 ligase, facilitating a vital step in the sumoylation pathway. In this report, it is demonstrated that over-expression of the rice gene OsSIZ1 in Arabidopsis leads to increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. For example, OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and heat stresses, and generated greater seed yields under a variety of stress conditions. Furthermore, OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants were able to exclude sodium ions more efficiently when grown in saline soils and accumulate higher potassium ions as compared to wild-type plants. Further analysis revealed that OsSIZ1-overexpressing plants expressed higher transcript levels of P5CS, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of proline, under both salt and drought stress conditions. Therefore, proline here is acting as an osmoprotectant to alleviate damages caused by drought and salt stresses. These results demonstrate that the rice gene OsSIZ1 has a great potential to be used for improving crop's tolerance to several abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2885375855,"This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association of the fat content in the diet with Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.Patients from the Diabetes research clinic at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (Brazil) were consecutively recruited. The inclusion criterion was the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The exclusion criteria were as follows: body mass index >40 kg/m2, heart failure, gastroparesis, diabetic diarrhea, dietary counseling by a registered dietitian during the previous 12 months, and inability to perform the weighed diet records (WDR). The dietary fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) consumption was estimated by 3-day WDR. Compliance with the WDR technique was assessed by comparison of protein intake estimated from the 3-day WDR and from the 24-h urinary nitrogen output performed on the third day of the WDR period. The presence of DKD was defined as urinary albumin excretion (UAE) ≥ 30 mg / 24 h or/and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Urinary albumin was measured twice and eGFR was estimated by using the CKD-EPI equation.A total of 366 patients were evaluated; of these, 33% (n = 121) had DKD. Multivariate analysis showed that the intake of linolenic acid was negatively associated with DKD (OR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.35-0.93; P = 0.024), adjusted for gender, smoking, cardiovascular disease, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blocker use, systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and HDL cholesterol. In a separate model, similar results were observed for linoleic acid, adjusting to the same co-variables (OR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99; P = 0.006).The lower intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially linolenic and linoleic acid, is associated with chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2886071806,"Sexual transmission of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) increased markedly in China during the past decade. HIV incidence is a critical indicator in HIV surveillance and we use a HIV-1 BED-capture-enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA) to examine the incidence among MSM in Beijing from 2008 to 2016. Risk factors related to recent HIV infection were also assessed.Consecutive cross-sectional surveys on MSM were conducted yearly from 2008 through 2016. Demographic and behaviors data were collected. HIV status was determined and HIV positive specimens were tested for recent infection using BED-CEIA. Specimens with ODn values≤0.8 were considered recently infected, HIV incidence rates and prevalence were then calculated. Risk factors associated with recent HIV infection were assessed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression.From 2008 to 2016, the numbers of eligible participants in the nine consecutive years ranged from 472 to 616. All the 261 eligible HIV-positive specimens were subjected to recent HIV infection testing. HIV prevalence ranged from 5.0% (3.3%-6.8%) to 10.2% (7.8%-12.7%), and incidence ranged from 1.57% (0.19%-2.95%) to 6.63% (3.65%-9.61%). MSM who never or sometimes used condoms during anal sex with men in the past 6 months (aOR = 1.515, 95%CI: 1.016-2.257, p = 0.041), or having syphilis infection (aOR = 1.561, 95%CI: 0.946-2.575, p = 0.081) were more likely to be recently infected with HIV. Being a Beijing resident (aOR = 0.409, 95%CI: 0.212-0.790, p = 0.008), or having only one male anal sex partner in the past 6 months (aOR = 0.467, 95%CI: 0.220-0.994, p = 0.048) were associated with a lower risk for recent HIV infection.The HIV incidence fluctuated among MSM in Beijing. Unprotected anal sex, having multiple sex partners, being a non-registered Beijing resident and having a syphilis infection play important roles in the recent HIV infection. Effective intervention measures for HIV and syphilis control and prevention should be continuously strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W2886347104,"The objective of this study was to determine whether generalized logistic functions (Richards model with time shift) may be used to predict emergence of winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) after its seed treatment with plant extracts from Taraxacum officinale roots under controlled environment conditions. Emergence analyses were conducted for winter rape whose seeds were treated with a plant extract and for the non-treated seeds sown to the soil at the site of earlier point application of the extract. Curves were plotted for experimental data by minimizing the square sum of differences between the experimental data and the mathematical model. To evaluate model fit, the mean squared error was divided into four factors. Computing modelling efficiency coefficients were also introduced to enable complete analysis. Results of simulation research demonstrate that the determined parameters of curves (e.g. values of growth parameters, time shift or the upper limit of population) describing the number of seedlings in the function of time stayed compliant to the interpretation with regard to the biology of the analyzed processes. The proposed mathematical description based on generalized logistic functions showed extraordinary fit (r = 0.999) to the experimental data, which makes it highly useful in predictive control of rapeseed emergence. In addition, the study enabled concluding that plant extracts application to the soil allowed achieving a higher maximal emergence rate compared to the control sample. The application of the plant extracts increased the final population of rapeseed and significantly accelerated the occurrence of the maximal emergence rate."
https://openalex.org/W2887074230,"Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of pediatric oncology related cerebral insult are vulnerable to numerous treatment-induced deficits that significantly enhance cardiovascular disease risk. Regular exercise improves endothelial function, fitness, body composition and musculoskeletal function which may reduce predisposition for cardiovascular disease. Here we assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a 24-week exercise intervention on cardiovascular, physical and metabolic outcomes in this population. Thirteen survivors (6 male, 7 female; median age 19 y (range 16–23 y) were recruited to participate in a 48-week study consisting of a 24-week control period (regular care) followed by a 24-week exercise intervention. Outcome measures were collected at entry (week 0) and following regular care (24-week) and exercise (48-week). Assessed variables included endothelial function (flow mediated dilation, FMD), blood pressure, heart rate (HR), aerobic capacity, anthropometry, body composition, muscular strength (3 repetition maximum testing), muscular endurance (repetitions/min) and physical activity levels (accelerometry). Compared to baseline, delta diameter (p = 0.008) and FMD (p = 0.029) of the brachial artery increased following exercise. Bicep-curl strength also increased following exercise compared to baseline (p = 0.019), while submaximal (6 min mark) measures of ventilation (p = 0.012), rating of perceived exertion (p = 0.012), HR (p = 0.001), absolute (p = 0.000) and relative (p = 0.000) aerobic capacity decreased. Breaks in sedentary time increased (p = 0.043) following exercise compared to regular care. Although the sample was small and heterogeneous, this study demonstrates that exercise is achievable and has positive effects on vascular function, submaximal fitness, local strength and physical activity in a population of AYA survivors of pediatric oncology related cerebral insult."
https://openalex.org/W2886552986,"Objectives To determine the risk factors for retinal microvascular impairment on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in type 2 diabetic patients without clinical diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods This retrospective and cross-sectional study enrolled 74 diabetic patients without clinically evident DR for the study group and 34 healthy subjects for the control group. OCT-A parameters were measured to determine vascular density (VD) and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses (SCP/DCP) of the retina. Clinical data were collected on sex, age, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hypertension, dyslipidemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and smoking status. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to represent the associated clinical variables with OCT-A parameters in diabetic patients. Results In comparison between the study and control groups, the VD in the SCP and DCP were significantly lower in diabetic patients compared to the controls (P = 0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The FAZ size in the SCP and DCP were significantly greater in diabetic patients compared to the controls (P = 0.035 and <0.001, respectively). In age- and sex-adjusted multiple regression analyses for the diabetic patients, dyslipidemia and hypertension were negatively associated with SCP-VD (β = -0.357, P = 0.002; β = -0.239, P = 0.039, respectively). Current smoking was correlated with lower DCP-VD (β = -0.255, P = 0.043). Greater SCP-FAZ size was associated with dyslipidemia and greater LDL-C (β = 0.254, P = 0.013; β = 0.232, P = 0.029, respectively), and greater DCP-FAZ size, with lower eGFR and greater LDL-C (β = -0.355, P = 0.004; β = 0.235, P = 0.037, respectively). Conclusions Diabetic patients without clinical DR showed lower VD and greater FAZ size in the SCP and DCP compared to healthy controls. In diabetic patients without clinical DR, dyslipidemia and/or high LDL-C were important risk factors for retinal microvascular impairment. Hypertension, current smoking and lower eGFR also contributed to microvascular impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2885032449,"Idiopathic achalasia is a relatively infrequent esophageal motor disorder for which major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are well-identified risk factors. However, no information about HLA-achalasia susceptibility in Mexicans has previously been reported. We studied a group of 91 patients diagnosed with achalasia and 234 healthy controls with Mexican admixed ancestry. HLA alleles and conserved extended haplotypes were analyzed using high-resolution HLA typing based on Sanger and next-generation sequencing technologies. Admixture estimates were determined using HLA-B and short tandem repeats. Results were analyzed by non-parametric statistical analysis and Bonferroni correction. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Patients with achalasia had 56.7% Native American genes, 24.7% European genes, 16.5% African genes and 2.0% Asian genes, which was comparable with the estimates in the controls. Significant increases in the frequencies of alleles DRB1*14:54 and DQB1*05:03 and the extended haplotypes DRB1*14:54-DQB1*05:03 and DRB1*11:01-DQB1*03:01, even after Bonferroni correction (pC<0.05), were found in the achalasia group compared to those in the controls. Concluding, the HLA class II alleles HLA-DRB1*14:54:01 and DQB1*05:03:01 and the extended haplotype are risk factors for achalasia in mixed-ancestry Mexican individuals. These results also suggest that the HLA-DRB1*14:54-DQB1*05:03 haplotype was introduced by admixture with European and/or Asian populations."
https://openalex.org/W2885084591,"Background The previous studies on basketball landing have not shown a systematic agreement between landing impacts and midsole densities. One plausible reason is that the midsole densities alone used to represent the cushioning capability of a shoe seems over simplified. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of different landing heights and shoes of different cushioning performance on tibial shock, impact loading and knee kinematics of basketball players. Methods Nineteen university team basketball players performed drop landings from different height conditions (0.45m vs. 0.61m) as well as with different shoe cushioning properties (regular, better vs. best-cushioned). For each condition, tibial acceleration, vertical ground reaction force and knee kinematics were measured with a tri-axial accelerometer, force plate and motion capture system, respectively. Heel comfort perception was indicated on the 150-mm Visual Analogue Scale. A 2 (height) x 3 (footwear) ANOVA with repeated measures was performed to determine the effects of different landing heights and shoe cushioning on the measured parameters. Results We did not find significant interactions between landing height and shoe conditions on tibial shock, impact peak, mean loading rate, maximum knee flexion angle and total ankle range of motion. However, greater tibial shock, impact peak, mean loading rates and total ankle range of motion were determined at a higher landing height (P < 0.01). Regular-cushioned shoes demonstrated significantly greater tibial shock and mean loading rate compared with better- and best-cushioned shoes (P < 0.05). The correlation analysis indicated that the heel comfort perception was fairly associated with impact peak and mean loading rate regardless of heights (P < 0.05), but not associated with tibial shock. Conclusions Determination of shoe cushioning performance, regardless of shoe midsole materials and constructions, would be capable in order to identify optimal shoe models for better protection against tibial stress fracture. Subjective comfort rating could estimate the level of impact loading in non-laboratory based situations."
https://openalex.org/W2887124176,"Background The classroom environment plays a potentially important role in shaping the emotions and behavior of adolescents. However, few studies have focused on this factor. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the classroom environment and emotional and behavioral problems among Chinese adolescents while also considering personality-and family-related factors. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in November and December, 2009. A set of questionnaires, including the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), the Family Environment Scale (FES), the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression Scale (CES-D), were distributed to participants. A total of 5,433 Chinese adolescent students (aged 9–18) and 244 classroom teachers in Liaoning Province were ultimately included in the study. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to explore the factors associated with emotional and behavioral problems. Results Multilevel analyses revealed that adolescent emotional and behavioral problems significantly varied among classrooms. Although personality and family characteristics exerted the greatest influence on adolescents’ emotions and behavior at the individual-level, interactions between classroom teachers and students increasingly affected adolescents with respect to age at the class-level. A mild positive association was found between adolescents’ mental health problems and the mental health of teachers. Conclusion This study focused on the classroom environment in order to understand Chinese adolescent mental health problems, the findings of which highlight important implications for policymakers and educators. The results underscore the importance of establishing a comfortable classroom climate by improving teacher-student interactions and meeting specific needs at different school stages, thus promoting a climate of positive mental health among Chinese adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2887795715,"In the last couple of years, the increasing application and popularization of mobile app have dramatically transformed people’s daily political lives through offering innovative mechanisms for interpersonal communication. While a majority of past studies on WeChat have mainly focused on its characteristics, only few documents have unearthed the potential effect of using such emerging social media on facilitating political discussion and increasing political efficacy. Given those, this study adopted uses and gratifications approach to explore the possible relationships between gratifications-sought, the intensity of WeChat usage on mobile phones, online political discussion, and political efficacy among college students in China. An empirical survey with 282 WeChat users reveals that WeChat as a relatively new outlet of political information, which fosters online political discussion with others about government and politics. Contrary to the expectation, the intensity of WeChat usages is not helped to strengthen or enhance individual’s level of internal or external political efficacy. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses demonstrate that information needs and recognition needs are positive predictors of internal political efficacy. Overall, these obtained findings may shed more up-to-date insights on the meaningful role of the mobile-based communication technology in promoting citizens’ democratic engagement in a developing country."
https://openalex.org/W2887639710,"Ukraine is among the top 20 highest drug-resistant tuberculosis burden countries in the world. Driving the high drug-resistant tuberculosis rates is an unchecked treatment default rate. This evaluation measures the effect of social support provided to tuberculosis patients at risk of defaulting on treatment during outpatient treatment. Five tuberculosis patient cohorts, served in three oblasts from 2011 and 2012, were constructed from medical records to compare risk factors for default, receipt of social services, and treatment outcome. Regression analyses were used to identify risk factors predictive of treatment default and to estimate the impact of the social support program on treatment default, controlling for risk, disease status, and demographics. In 2012, tuberculosis patients receiving social support in Ukraine reduced their probability of defaulting on continuation treatment by 10 percentage points compared to high-risk patients who did not receive social support in 2012 or 2011. Treatment success rates for the high-risk patients receiving social support were comparable to the low-risk cohorts and significantly improved over the high-risk comparison cohorts. Further research is recommended to quantify the costs and benefits for scaling-up social support services, evaluate social support program fidelity, identify which populations respond best to select services, and what barriers might still exist to achieve better adherence. With that information, tailoring programs to most effectively reach and serve clients in a patient-centered approach may reap substantial rewards for Ukraine."
https://openalex.org/W2886395798,"We used immunocytochemistry to determine the presence and topographical density distributions of rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the four-striped field mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) and the Namaqua rock mouse (Micaelamys namaquensis). Both species possessed duplex retinas that were rod dominated. In R. pumilio, the density of both cones and rods were high (cone to rod ratio: 1:1.23) and reflected the species’ fundamentally diurnal, but largely crepuscular lifestyle. Similarly, the ratio of cones to rods in M. namaquensis (1:12.4) reflected its nocturnal lifestyle. Similar rod density peaks were observed (R. pumilio: ~84467/mm2; M. namaquensis: ~81088/mm2), but a density gradient yielded higher values in the central (~56618/mm2) rather than in the peripheral retinal region (~32689/mm2) in R. pumilio. Two separate cone types (S-cones and M/L-cones) were identified implying dichromatic color vision in the study species. In M. namaquensis, both cone populations showed a centro-peripheral density gradient and a consistent S- to M/L-cone ratio (~1:7.8). In R. pumilio, S cones showed a centro-peripheral gradient (S- to M/L-cone ratio; central: 1:7.8; peripheral: 1:6.8) which appeared to form a visual streak, and a specialized area of M/L-cones (S- to M/L-cone ratio: 1:15) was observed inferior to the optic nerve. The number of photoreceptors per linear degree of visual angle, estimated from peak photoreceptor densities and eye size, were four cones and 15 rods per degree in M. namaquensis and 11 cones and 12 rods per degree in R. pumilio. Thus, in nocturnal M. namaquensis rods provide much finer image sampling than cones, whereas in diurnal/crepuscular R. pumilio both photoreceptor types provide fine image sampling. IpRGCs were comparably sparse in R. pumilio (total = 1012) and M. namaquensis (total = 862), but were homogeneously distributed in M. namaquensis and densest in the dorso-nasal quadrant in R. pumilio. The adaptive significance of the latter needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2886538507,"Psoriasis and depression may have common mechanisms, such as systemic inflammation, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vitamin D3 deficiency. Among men with psoriasis, this study examined whether depression severity was associated with serum concentrations of different metabolic and inflammatory markers.The study included 85 men with psoriasis (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 47 ± 14 years) and 65 men without psoriasis (mean age ± SD, 44 ± 13 years). In both groups, we measured the body mass index; blood pressure; and serum concentrations of lipids, uric acid, lipase, interleukins 6 and 18, cortisol, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory. Other variables analyzed included psoriasis duration, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, and the percentage of body surface area affected by psoriatic lesions.Compared with controls, patients with psoriasis had significantly greater depression severity, higher body mass indices, and higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol and interleukins 6 and 18; moreover, they had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations. In patients with psoriasis, depression severity correlated positively with psoriasis duration, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, the percentage of body surface area affected by psoriatic lesions, and interleukin-18 concentration. In patients with psoriasis, depression severity correlated negatively with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration, but it did not correlate significantly with the serum concentrations of interleukin 6 and cortisol.High concentrations of interleukin 18 and low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 may be associated with depression severity in men with psoriasis. Thus, further studies should examine whether effective anti-inflammatory treatments or vitamin D3 supplementation can improve depression outcomes in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2887704730,"Under natural conditions, large seeds with physical dormancy (PY) may become water permeable earlier than small ones. However, the mechanism for this difference has not been elucidated. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the traits associated with PY in seeds of Senna multijuga (Fabaceae) and to propose a mechanism for earlier dormancy-break in large than in small seeds. Two seedlots were collected and each separated into large and small seeds. Seed dry mass, water content, thickness of palisade layer in the hilar and distal regions and the ratio between palisade layer thickness (P) in the lens fissure and seed mass (M) were evaluated. Further, the correlation between seed mass and seed dimensions was investigated. Large seeds had higher dry mass and water content than small seeds. The absolute thickness of the palisade layer in the different regions did not show any trend with seed size; however, large seeds had a lower P:M ratio than small seeds. Seed mass correlated positively with all seed dimensions, providing evidence for a substantially higher volume in large seeds. Since wet, but not dry, high temperatures break PY in sensitive seeds of S. multijuga, the data support our prediction that internal pressure potential in the seed and palisade layer thickness in the water gap (lens), which is related to seed mass (i.e. P:M ratio), act together to modulate the second step (dormancy break) of the two-stage sensitivity cycling model for PY break. In which case, large seeds are predetermined to become water-permeable earlier than small ones."
https://openalex.org/W2885093433,"Plasmodium falciparum invasion into red blood cells (RBCs) is a complex process engaging proteins on the merozoite surface and those contained and sequentially released from the apical organelles (micronemes and rhoptries). Fundamental to invasion is the formation of a moving junction (MJ), a region of close apposition of the merozoite and the RBC plasma membranes, through which the merozoite draws itself before settling into a newly formed parasitophorous vacuole (PV). SURFIN4.2 was identified at the surface of the parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) but was also found apically associated with the merozoite. Using antibodies against the N-terminus of the protein we show the presence of SURFIN4.2 in the neck of the rhoptries, its secretion into the PV and shedding into the culture supernatant upon schizont rupture. Using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry we describe here a novel protein complex we have named SURGE where SURFIN4.2 forms interacts with the rhoptry neck protein 4 (RON4) and the Glutamate Rich Protein (GLURP). The N-terminal cysteine-rich–domain (CRD) of SURFIN4.2 mediates binding to the RBC membrane and its interaction with RON4 suggests its involvement in the contact between the merozoite apex and the RBC at the MJ. Supporting this suggestion, we also found that polyclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain (including the CRD) of SURFIN4.2 partially inhibit merozoite invasion. We propose that the formation of the SURGE complex participates in the establishment of parasite infection within the PV and the RBCs."

The purpose of the study was to investigate if the introduction of an outdoor active break, based on walking and running, in a middle school in Italy is feasible in terms of implementation (i.e., adherence, costs, safety) and acceptability (i.e., satisfaction, intent to continue use, perceived appropriateness). One hundred and forty students (aged 12 ± 1 years) and 20 teachers (aged 50 ± 8 years) participated in the activity for four months. The activity consisted of walking (or running) one kilometer outside the school buildings during the mid-morning. Data from questionnaires regarding the satisfaction with and the acceptability of the activity were collected. The activity was safely performed three to four days a week, without any costs to the school or to students’ parents. Students and teachers were satisfied with the activity (positive answers from 95% and 89% of each group, respectively). Moreover, the teachers reported that the program was easy to organize and did not negatively influence their teaching activities. The intervention was easily and safely implemented, and it was considered suitable for the daily routine of an Italian middle school. Further studies are needed to examine its impact on physical activity levels and academic achievement."
https://openalex.org/W2887883251,"Aim The aim of our study was to investigate factors associated with burnout of nurses and care workers in nursing homes and geriatric hospitals in Japan. The use of Buddhist priests, the major religion in Japan, was also explored. Methods Questionnaires for nurses and care workers were sent to 10 care facilities. The survey questions included basic demographic information, the Japanese Burnout Index and the Japanese version of the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care Of Dying Scale Form B. They also asked questions about use of Buddhist priests for tasks such as helping to manage the anxiety or distress of patients, families, and staff, or providing sutra chanting. Results In total, 323 questionnaires were returned, of which 260 were used for analysis. Only 18 (6.9%) answered that they had any religious beliefs, which was relatively low compared to 27% from governmental survey data. In total, however, 71% expressed a need for Buddhist priests to help with anxiety or distress among patients. A positive attitude towards providing end-of-life care was a protective factor against depersonalization. It was, however, also related to lower feelings of personal accomplishment. Conclusion Care homes and geriatric hospitals may want to consider calling more on religious resources as a support for staff and patients."
https://openalex.org/W2886216285,"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been investigated for their neuroprotective and intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effects in treating glaucoma, but the reports have been inconsistent possibly because different compounds and models have been used. Here we selected three ARBs for head-to-head comparisons of their effects on IOP and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling, which is believed to play an important role in glaucoma pathogenesis.Three ARBs (losartan, irbesartan or telmisartan) or vehicle controls were administered via chow to C57BL/6J mice for up to 7 days. Drug concentrations in the eye, brain, and plasma were evaluated by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Cohorts of mice were randomly assigned to different treatments. IOP and blood pressure were measured before and after ARB treatment. Effects of ARBs on TGFβ signaling in the retina were evaluated by phosphorylated Smad2 (pSmad2) immunohistochemistry.Physiologically relevant concentrations of losartan, irbesartan and telmisartan were detected in eye, brain and plasma after drug administration (n = 11 mice/treatment). Blood pressure was significantly reduced by all ARBs compared to vehicle-fed controls (all p-values < 0.001, n = 8-15 mice/treatment). Compared to vehicle control, IOP was significantly reduced by irbesartan (p = 0.030) and telmisartan (p = 0.019), but not by losartan (n = 14-17 mice/treatment). Constitutive pSmad2 fluorescence observed in retinal ganglion cells was significantly reduced by telmisartan (p = 0.034), but not by losartan or irbesartan (n = 3-4 mice/treatment).Administration via chow is an effective delivery method for ARBs, as evidenced by lowered blood pressure. ARBs vary in their abilities to lower IOP or reduce TGFβ signaling. Considering the significant roles of IOP and TGFβ in glaucoma pathogenesis, specific ARBs with dual effects, such as telmisartan, may be more effective than other ARBs for treating glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2885343680,"Background Trend analysis summarizes patterns over time in the data to show the direction of change and can be used to investigate uncertainties in different time points and associations with other factors. However, this approach is not widely applied to national surveys and only selected outcomes are investigated. This study demonstrates a research framework to conduct trend analysis for all variables in a national survey, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). Data and methods The CHMS cycle 1 to 4 was implemented between 2007 and 2015. The characteristics of all variables were screened and associated to the weight variables. Missing values were identified and cleaned according to the User Guide. The characteristics of all variables were extracted and used to guide data cleaning. Trend analysis examined the statistical significance of candidate predictors: the cycles, age, sex, education, household income and body mass index (BMI). R (v3.2) and RStudio (v0.98.113) were used to develop the framework. Results There were 26557 variables in 79 data files from four cycles. There were 1055 variables significantly associated with the CHMS cycles and 2154 associated with the BMI after controlling for other predictors. The trend of blood pressure was similar to those published. Conclusion Trend analysis for all variables in the CHMS is feasible and is a systematic approach to understand the data. Because of trend analysis, we have detected data errors and identified several environmental biomarkers with extreme rates of change across cycles. The impact of these biomarkers has not been well studied by Statistics Canada or others. This framework can be extended to other surveys, especially the Canadian Community Health Survey."
https://openalex.org/W2886207362,"Vaccine distribution infrastructure remains inadequate in many parts of the world, and it is estimated that up to 40-50% of all vaccine doses are wasted in certain countries. Vaccines that can maintain viability outside of the cold chain would decrease vaccine wastage and increase immunization rates in regions of the world with underdeveloped vaccine distribution infrastructure. We examined the potential of crosslinked protein nanoparticles, made from trimerized influenza hemagglutinin (3HA), to maintain immunogenicity after cold-chain-independent storage. We found that the nanoparticles could be stored for 112 days at room temperature without any loss in hemagglutinating activity or immunogenicity, and that nanoparticles could be stored at 37°C for 2 weeks without any loss in hemagglutinating activity. As vaccine development moves towards the use of recombinant subunit antigens, our results demonstrate the potential of crosslinked antigen nanoparticles as an immunogenic vehicle for bringing effective vaccines to underdeveloped regions outside of the cold chain."
https://openalex.org/W2885350355,"The aim of our study was to simulate in rats all aspects and techniques used in our new clinical program of cryopreserved alloarterial transplantation and investigate the influence of two immunosuppressive protocols with tacrolimus on acute rejection of these allografts.Cryopreserved abdominal aortic grafts were transplanted between Brown-Norway and Lewis rats. Tacrolimus (0.2 mg/kg daily) was administered from day 1 to day 30 (TAC1) or from day 7 to day 30 (TAC7), respectively. No immunosuppressed isogeneic (ISO) and allogeneic (ALO) rats combination served as control. Aortal wall infiltration by immunocompetent cells (MHC II+ cells of recipient origin) was studied on day 30 after transplantation. Flow cytometry was used for the analysis of day 30 sera for the presence of donor specific anti-MHC class I and II antibodies.The aortal allografts in both immunosuppressed groups showed regular morphology of aortal wall with no depositions of immunoglobulin G on day 30. The adventitial infiltration of non-immunosuppressed aortal allografts by MHC class II positive cells of recipient origin was significantly higher (ALO 20.7±6.7 cells, P<0.001) compared to both immunosuppressed groups (TAC1 5.9±5.5 cells, TAC7 6.1±5.1 cells). Day 30 sera from the allogeneic non-immunosuppressed animals decreased significantly the binding of fluorescence-labelled MHC class I (46.9±19.4%) and class II (65.8±11.9%) antibody to donors spleen cells compared with day 30 sera from both immunosuppressed groups (TAC1, anti-MHC class I 102.4±4.2%, p < 0.001, anti-MHC class II 102.6±6.0%), (TAC7, anti-MHC class I 79.9±3.3%, p < 0.001, anti-MHC class II 80.9±2.7%).Both immunosuppressed protocols with tacrolimus (administration from day 1 or from day 7 following transplantation) were able to suppress acute cell- and antibody-mediated rejection of cryopreserved abdominal aortic allografts processed in accordance with our new standardized clinical protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2886540974,"Previous studies indicated that progesterone can be withdrawn at the time of the first positive β-hCG test without compromising the clinical pregnancy outcome in normal ovarian responder. However, the effect of early stop of progesterone supplementation for patients with poor ovarian response (POR) has not been investigated. This study retrospectively collected data from patients with POR in 156 IVF/ICSI fresh embryo transfer (ET) cycles in single tertiary center from January 2010 to June 2016. All the patients met ESHRE consensus, the Bologna criteria, of POR and had hCG injection for luteal phase support (LPS) on day 2, 5 and 8 after ovum pick-up. The pregnant patients were divided into two groups: early stop group represented those who stopped LPS from day of positive pregnancy test; control group represented those who kept progesterone supplementation till gestational age of 9 weeks. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, parity, hormone data, number of follicles>10(mm), endometrial thickness and number of embryos transferred between the two groups. After adjustment for possible confounders with multivariate logistic regression analysis, the clinical pregnancy rates (55.0% vs. 57.1%, P = 0.35), ongoing pregnancy rates (47.0% vs. 46.4%, P = 0.66), miscarriage rates (34.0% vs. 26.7%, P = 0.66) and live-birth rates (44.0% vs. 46.4%, P = 0.41) were not statistically different between early stop group and the control group. Our study indicates that early stop of progesterone supplementation on the day of positive pregnancy test for patients of POR using hCG as LPS in fresh ET cycles does not affect pregnancy outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2886664579,"In this study, we clarified the functions of three uncharacterized enzymes, XCV2724, XCV2728, and XCV2729, in Xanthomonas euvesicatoria, the causal agent of bacterial spot of tomato and pepper. The genes corresponding to the three enzymes are homologs of hypBA1, hypBA2, and hypAA from Bifidobacterium longum and are unique to Xanthomonas spp. among plant pathogenic bacteria. Functional characterization of the recombinant enzymes expressed using microbial systems revealed that they degrade the arabinofurano-oligosaccharides present on hydroxyproline (Hyp)-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) such as extensin and solanaceous lectins in plant cell walls. These enzymes work coordinately to degrade the oligosaccharides. First, XeHypAA (XCV2728), belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) 43 family, releases L-arabinose from L-arabinofuranose (Araf)-α1,3-Araf-ß1,2-Araf-ß1,2-Araf-ß-Hyp (Ara4-Hyp), cleaving its α1,3 bond; second, XeHypBA2 (XCV2729), belonging to the GH121 family, releases the disaccharide Araf-ß1,2-Araf from Araf-ß1,2-Araf-ß1,2-Araf-ß-Hyp (Ara3-Hyp); finally, XeHypBA1 (XCV2724), belonging to GH family 127, releases L-arabinose from Araf-ß-Hyp (Ara-Hyp). In summary, the main oligosaccharide structure of Ara4-Hyp on the HRGPs is degraded to Ara3-Hyp, then to Ara-Hyp, and finally to Ara monosaccharides by the action of these three enzymes. HRGPs containing oligosaccharide substrates have been reported to contribute to plant defense, and interestingly, the promoter region of the operon (xehypBA2 and xehypAA) contains the plant-inducible promoter box for binding the regulator protein HrpX involved in pathogenicity. We then analyzed the expression level of the operon gene in hrp-inducing medium and in plants and constructed gene-deletion mutants. However, although the operon was evidently upregulated by HrpX, three single-gene deletion mutants (ΔxehypBA1, ΔxehypBA2, ΔxehypAA) and even a triple-gene deletion mutant (ΔxehypBA1-BA2-AA) remained pathogenic, and had no effect on nonhost resistance, either, indicating that these three enzymes are not involved in either pathogenicity or nonhost resistance reactions. This is the first report of enzymes in plant pathogenic bacteria that catalyze the degradation of Hyp-linked-L-arabinofuranosides in plant cell walls."

However, few data are available about the impact of AD PBMCs in the chemokine signature in a brain with AD phenotype. Therefore, this study analyzed the chemokine levels in a human blood brain barrier model. A human endothelial cell line from the immortalized cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) and a human glioblastoma U-87 MG cell line, both with no AD phenotype were used while PBMCs came from AD at mild or moderate stage and control patients. PBMCs from moderate AD patients decreased CCL2 and CCL5 levels in endothelial, and also CXCL10 in abluminal compartments and in PBMCs compared to PBMCs from mild AD patients. The CX3CL1 expression increased in endothelial and abluminal compartments with PBMCs from mild AD patients compared to controls. AD PBMCs can convert the chemokine signature towards that found in AD brain, targeting some chemokines as new biomarkers in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2886049560,"Background Better understanding of the characteristics of interventions which are attractive to nurses is required in order to implement effective hand hygiene interventions. Methods The intervention characteristics were derived from diffusion of innovation theory (DIT): relative advantage, compatibility, simplicity, trialability, and observability. To identify nurses’ preferences for the five characteristics, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted. Participants were nurses working at Taiwanese tertiary care hospitals selected through stratified sampling. In addition, the hand hygiene moment (before or after patient contact) was taken into consideration in the DCE to investigate whether nurses’ preferences for the intervention characteristics were the same at different hand hygiene moments. Results This survey was conducted between 1 October and 31 December 2014. Among 200 nurses from three Taiwanese tertiary care hospitals, significant preferences for the five intervention characteristics were observed. That is, when an intervention makes the hand hygiene activity more convenient (p<0.001), when nurses participate in the design of the intervention (p<0.001), when an intervention is explained well to nurses before implementing it (p<0.001), when the evidence of hand hygiene is provided at a trial stage to show its effectiveness (p<0.001), and when nurses’ hand hygiene performance is observable to their peers (p<0.001), nurses are more willing to wash their hands with high compliance. In addition, nurses preferred for providing evidence at a trial stage most, and well explanation about the intervention to increase simplicity was least. The rankings of the preference for the five intervention characteristics were the same at different hand hygiene moments (p = 0.453) Conclusions The findings suggest policy directions for decision makers aiming to improve overall hand hygiene compliance in healthcare facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2886931096,"The near-surface urban drainage system in Shanghai is highly complex, with hundreds of thousands of catch basins (CBs) and manhole chambers (MCs). Comparatively little is known about the breeding of mosquitoes in this vast system, especially for the locally predominant species Aedes albopictus. A cross-sectional mosquito sampling study was conducted from late July to early August of 2017 using 539 CBs and 309 MCs located in 10 communities of downtown Shanghai. We measured the water-holding status of the drainage systems and density of mosquito larvae. Mosquito species were examined on site and in the laboratory later.The CBs were characterized by a lower percentage of standing water compared to MCs (47.0% vs. 79.9%, respectively; X2 = 76.407, P<0.001), but CBs contained a higher percentage of stagnant water percent than MCs (45.2% vs. 35.3%, respectively; X2 = 11.465, P = 0.001). There were exclusively two species of mosquito larvae found in the drainage systems, Ae. albopictus and Culex pipiens complex. Compared with MCs, the structures of CBs were more conducive to larval production and yielded more larvae-positive samples (43.4% vs 14.2%, X2 = 53.136, P<0.001) and higher larval density (8.23 vs. 4.09 per dipper, t = 3.287, P = 0.001). Aedes albopictus was the predominant species in CBs, with a constituent ratio of 71.7%. Regarding structures with different features in different locations, CBs that had a vertical grate with an unsealed lid and MCs with plastic composite covers were the most favorable types for mosquito breeding, and residential neighborhoods yielded the highest number of Ae. albopictus.Aedes albopictus was the predominant species in both CBs and stormwater MCs, especially in residential neighborhoods. CBs, particularly those with vertical grates, were a major source of mosquito production in downtown Shanghai. MCs featured more running water and fewer larvae by percentage, and few larvae were found in Sewage MCs. However, due to the tremendous baseline amount, MCs were still an important breeding source of mosquitoes. We suggest that Aedes control in Shanghai should focus on CBs or other potential larvae habitats in and around residential neighborhoods. The use of permeable materials and completely sealed covers should be adopted in the construction of CBs and MCs henceforth."
https://openalex.org/W2887556572,"Dysferlin (Dysf) and mitsugumin53 (MG53) are two key proteins involved in membrane repair of muscle cells which are efficiently recruited to the sarcolemma upon lesioning. Plasma membrane localization and recruitment of a Dysf fragment to membrane lesions in zebrafish myofibers relies on the presence of a short, polybasic amino acid motif, WRRFK. Here we show that the positive charges carried by this motif are responsible for this function. In mouse MG53, we have identified a similar motif with multiple basic residues, WKKMFR. A single amino acid replacement, K279A, leads to severe aggregation of MG53 in inclusion bodies in HeLa cells. This result is due to the loss of positive charge, as shown by studying the effects of other neutral amino acids at position 279. Consequently, our data suggest that positively charged amino acid stretches play an essential role in the localization and function of Dysf and MG53."
https://openalex.org/W2885365541,"Preoperative therapy has gained wide interest in advanced gastric cancer patients due to its potential advantages of improved disease control. Selection of high risk patients based on preoperative staging is crucial to choose the candidates for neoadjuvant therapy.Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for patient consent. We searched 394 advanced gastric cancer patients (pT2-4) who underwent curative resection in 2010 without neoadjuvant therapies. Two abdominal radiologists independently reviewed the preoperative CT including tumor depth on CT (CT-tumor depth), which was categorized as follows: intramural, minimal extramural(<1mm), spiculated extramural(≥1mm) and nodular extramural infiltration. The impact of clinicoradiologic factors on disease recurrence and disease free survival (DFS) was evaluated. Recursive partitioning analysis was performed to suggest prediction models for recurrence.Of total 394 patients, 86 patients (21.8%) experienced recurrence. Spiculated (≥1mm) and nodular extramural tumor infiltration and CT size of 5-10cm were independent predictors of disease recurrence and significantly associated with worse DFS. Lymph node involvement on CT was not significantly associated with patient outcome. Among patients with same pT4a stage, the recurrence rate rises and DFS gets worse as the extramural tumor infiltration progresses (P < 0.001). The prediction model for recurrence revealed that size and CT-tumor depth were the two major discriminating factors.CT-tumor depth and size could be used as independent predictors for prognosis. Preoperative CT can be used for prognostic stratification to select high risk patients for whom neoadjuvant therapies might be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2887098389,"In recent years, bimaxillary rotation advancement (BRA) has become the method of choice for surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). As dislocation of the jaw bones affects both, airways and facial contours, surgeons are facing the challenge of finding an optimal jaw position that allows for the reestablishment of normal airway ventilation and esthetic surgical outcome. Owing to the complexity of the facial anatomy and its mechanical behavior, individual planning of surgical OSA treatment under consideration of functional and esthetic aspects presents a challenge that surgeons typically approach in a non-quantitative manner using subjective evaluation and clinical experience. This paper describes a framework for individual planning of OSA treatment using bimaxillary rotation advancement, which relies on computational modeling of hard and soft tissue mechanics. The described framework for simulation of functional and esthetic post-surgery outcome was used in 10 OSA patients. Comparison of the simulation results with post-surgery data reveals that biomechanical simulation provides a reliable estimate for post-surgery facial tissue behavior and antero-posterior airway extension, but fails to accurately describe a surprisingly large lateral stretch of the velopharyngeal region. This discrepancy is traced back to anisotropic effects of pharyngeal muscles. Possible approaches to improving the accuracy of model predictions and defining sharp criteria for optimizing combined OSA planning are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2887287785,"The presented work explores the regulatory influence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on gene expression in Trypanosoma congolense. More than 31,000 uORFs in total were identified and characterized here. We found evidence for the uORFs’ appearance in the transcriptome to be correlated with proteomic expression data, clearly indicating their repressive potential in T. congolense, which has to rely on post-transcriptional gene expression regulation due to its unique genomic organization. Our data show that uORF’s translation repressive potential does not only correlate with elemental sequence features such as length, position and quantity, but involves more subtle components, in particular the codon and amino acid profiles. This corresponds with the popular mechanistic model of a ribosome shedding initiation factors during the translation of a uORF, which can prevent reinitiation at the downstream start codon of the actual protein-coding sequence, due to the former extensive consumption of crucial translation components. We suggest that uORFs with uncommon codon and amino acid usage can slow down the translation elongation process in T. congolense, systematically deplete the limited factors, and restrict downstream reinitiation, setting up a bottleneck for subsequent translation of the protein-coding sequence. Additionally we conclude that uORFs dynamically influence the T. congolense life cycle. We found evidence that transition to epimastigote form could be supported by gain of uORFs due to alternative trans-splicing, which down-regulate housekeeping genes’ expression and render the trypanosome in a metabolically reduced state of endurance."
https://openalex.org/W2885132770,"The potential role of calcimimetics as vasculotropic agents has been suggested since the discovery that calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs) are expressed in cardiovascular tissues. However, whether this effect is CaSR-dependent or -independent is still unclear. In the present study the vascular activity of calcimimetic R-568 was investigated in mesenteric vascular beds (MVBs) isolated from Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHR) and the relative age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats. Pre-constricted MBVs were perfused with increasing concentrations of R-568 (10 nM– 30 μM) resulting in a rapid dose-dependent vasodilatation. However, in MVBs from SHR this was preceded by a small but significant vasoconstriction at lowest nanomolar concentrations used (10–300 nM). Pre-treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS, L-NAME), KCa channels (CTX), cyclo-oxygenase (INDO) and CaSR (Calhex) or the endothelium removal suggest that NO, CaSR and the endothelium itself contribute to the R-568 vasodilatory/vasoconstrictor effects observed respectively in WKY/SHR MVBs. Conversely, the vasodilatory effects resulted by highest R-568 concentration were independent of these factors. Then, the ability of lower R-568 doses (0.1–1 μM) to activate endothelial-NOS (eNOS) pathway in MVBs homogenates was evaluated. The Akt and eNOS phosphorylation levels resulted increased in WKY homogenates and Calhex significantly blocked this effect. Notably, this did not occur in the SHR. Similarly, vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) stimulation with lower R-568 doses resulted in Akt activation and increased NO production in WKY but not in SHR cells. Interestingly, in these cells this was associated with the absence of the biologically active dimeric form of the CaSR thus potentially contributing to explain the impaired vasorelaxant effect observed in response to R-568 in MVB from SHR compared to WKY. Overall, these findings provide new insight on the mechanisms of action of the calcimimetic R-568 in modulating vascular tone both in physiological and pathological conditions such as hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2885533248,"The collective behavior of ant colonies, and locomotion of individuals within a colony, both respond to changing conditions. The invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) thrives in Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and colder, wet winters. However, its foraging behavior and locomotion has rarely been studied in the winter. We examined how the foraging behavior of three distinct L. humile colonies was related to environmental conditions and the locomotion of workers during winter in northern California. We found that colonies foraged most between 10 and 15°C, regardless of the maximum daily temperature. Worker walking speed was positively associated with temperature (range 6-24°C) and negatively associated with humidity (range 25-93%RH). All colonies foraged during all day and night hours in a predictable daily cycle, with a correlation between the rate of incoming and outgoing foragers. Foraging activity was unrelated to the activity of a competing native ant species, Prenolepis imparis, which was present in low abundance, and ceased only during heavy rain when ants left foraging trails and aggregated in small sheltered areas on trees."

This issue has led to increased use of the two-minute walk test (2MWT) to assess exercise capacity. The main objective of this study is to establish reference equations for the two-minute walk distance (2MWD) in healthy Chinese adults aged 18-85 years.A total of 973 volunteers took part in the study. We obtained verbal consent from all participants before the test, and the study design was approved by the ethics committees of Wenzhou People's Hospital. The participants performed two 2MWTs using a standardized protocol, and the longer distance was used for further analysis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed using age, height and weight as independent variables and was used to establish the reference equations for the 2MWD in the male and female groups.The mean walking distance for all participants was 199.1±25.81 m. Age and height were identified as independent factors that influenced the 2MWD, and they explained 35% and 34% of the variance in distance for the male and female groups, respectively.This study resulted in determination of reference equations for predicting the 2MWD in healthy Chinese adults. These 2MWD standards will provide useful references for medical care in some settings and populations."
https://openalex.org/W2885993954,"Microbial consortia execute collaborative molecular processes with contributions from individual species, on such basis enabling optimized molecular function. Such collaboration and synergies benefit metabolic flux specifically in extreme environmental conditions as seen in acid mine drainage, with biofilms as relevant microenvironment. However, knowledge about community species composition is not sufficient for deducing presence and efficiency of composite molecular function. For this task molecular resolution of the consortium interactome is to be retrieved, with molecular biomarkers particularly suited for characterizing composite molecular processes involved in biofilm formation and maintenance. A microbial species set identified in 18 copper environmental sites provides a data matrix for deriving a cross-species molecular process model of biofilm formation composed of 191 protein coding genes contributed from 25 microbial species. Computing degree and stress centrality of biofilm molecular process nodes allows selection of network hubs and central connectors, with the top ranking molecular features proposed as biomarker candidates for characterizing biofilm homeostasis. Functional classes represented in the biomarker panel include quorum sensing, chemotaxis, motility and extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis, complemented by chaperones. Abundance of biomarker candidates identified in experimental data sets monitoring different biofilm conditions provides evidence for the selected biomarkers as sensitive and specific molecular process proxies for capturing biofilm microenvironments. Topological criteria of process networks covering an aggregate function of interest support the selection of biomarker candidates independent of specific community species composition. Such panels promise efficient screening of environmental samples for presence of microbial community composite molecular function."
https://openalex.org/W2886871249,"Demographic analyses and ecological niche modeling (ENM) are two popular tools that address species persistence in relation to environmental conditions. Classic demography provides detailed information about the mechanisms that allow a population to grow or remain stable at a local scale, while ENM infers distributions from conditions suitable for species persistence at geographic scales by relating species' occurrences with environmental variables. By integrating these two tools, we may better understand population processes that determine species persistence at a geographic scale. To test this idea, we developed a model that relates climate to demography of the cactus Opuntia rastrera using 15 years of data from one locality. Using this model we determined the geographic area where populations would have positive growth rates given its climatic conditions. The climate-dependent demographic model showed poor performance as a distribution model, but it was helpful in defining some mechanisms that determine species' distributions. For instance, high rainfall had a negative impact on the population growth rate by increasing mortality. Rainy areas to the west of the distribution of O. rastrera were identified as unsuitable both by our climate-dependent demographic model and by a popular ENM algorithm (MaxEnt), suggesting that distribution is constrained by excessive rains due to high mortality. Areas projected to be climatically suitable by MaxEnt were not related with higher population growth rates. Instead, we found a strong correlation between environmental distance to the niche centroid (center of the niche hypervolume, where optimal conditions may occur) and population growth rate, meaning that the niche centroid approach is helpful in finding high-fitness areas."
https://openalex.org/W2887485159,"Regenerative medicine is a promising approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases by replacing degenerating cells like neurons or oligodendrocytes. Targeting human neural stem cells directly in the brain is a big challenge in such a strategy. The neurofilament derived NFL-TBS.40-63 peptide has recently been introduced as a novel tool to target neural stem cells. Previous studies showed that this peptide can be internalized by rat neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo, which coincided with lower proliferation and self-renewal capacity and increase of differentiation. In this study, we analyzed the uptake and potential effects of the NFL-TBS.40-63 peptide on human neural stem cells isolated from human fetuses. We showed that the peptide inhibits proliferation and the ability to produce neurospheres in vitro, which is consistent with an increase in cell adhesion and differentiation. These results confirm that the peptide could be a promising molecule to target and manipulate human neural stem cells and thus could serve as a strategic tool for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2283899006,"Risk aversion is well-known as a general and robust characteristic of people’s decision making: people are less likely to gamble when they are unsure if they will obtain the expected value of the bet made. The “peanuts effect” is, however, an exception to this general rule. The “peanuts effect,” which states that people are more willing to gamble when playing for “peanuts” (a small outcome), has been stably observed in the context of a small monetary stake. We conducted two types of experiments to verify whether the peanuts effect still occurred when the type of stakes changed. We had two main findings. On the one hand, people tended to gamble more for a qualitatively smaller value when the stake was material in nature, meaning that the “peanuts effect” occurred with a qualitatively low stake. On the other hand, people were willing to take a risk for a qualitatively larger value when the stake was a human life: this is the opposite phenomenon of the “peanuts effect.”"
https://openalex.org/W2886091163,"The peristomial plates are skeletal components of the interbrachial frame (or mouth frame), which is located below the true mouth of ophiuroids. Whilst the peristomial plates were extensively described and used as diagnostic characters by some early workers, for the past 100 years they have been largely neglected as a taxonomic resource. In this investigation the peristomial plates of 48 species representing 21 families were examined directly, and information on a further 61 species, including representatives of another eight families, was obtained from the published literature. Observations were made with regard to fragmentation state, relative size and orientation of the peristomial plates. Although fragmentation state showed little consistency at any taxonomic level, relative size and orientation segregated a group of families comprising species with relatively small, inclined peristomial plates, viz. Ophiotrichidae, Ophiopholidae, Ophiactidae, Amphiuridae and Ophiocomidae, together with a single hemieuryalid species–Ophioplocus januarii. The distribution of peristomial plate traits was strongly correlated with that of several other character states pertaining to the interbrachial frame. This supported the proposition that two major types of interbrachial frame are present in ophiuroids (designated ‘A’ and ‘B’). Current phylogenies inferred from both morphological and molecular data imply that type B is derived and has evolved independently at least twice in the orders Amphilepidida and Ophiacanthida. This represents a remarkable example of evolutionary convergence. An analysis of the distribution of all interbrachial frame character states suggested that within the Amphilepidida paedomorphosis was probably responsible for the complete reversion of the interbrachial frame to the ancestral type A condition in two families (Ophiothamnidae and Amphilepididae) of suborder Gnathophiurina and possibly responsible for varying degrees of trait reversal in the four families of suborder Ophionereidina. Such paedomorphic events may have been associated with a secondary return to the deep-sea from shallow-sea environments."
https://openalex.org/W2886118006,"Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) training has been proposed to improve attentional skills by modulating thalamo-cortical loops that affect the sensitivity of relevant cortical areas like the somatosensory cortex. This modulation may be reflected in the electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha rhythm, and could affect the processing of subsequently applied intracutaneous electrical stimuli. Participants took part in an MBSR training and participated in two EEG sessions. EEG was measured in variants of an endogenous orienting paradigm in which attention had to be directed to the left or right forearm. After the orienting interval, the electrical stimulus was applied, equally likely on the attended or the unattended forearm. One group of participants took part in the EEG session before and after the training, while the other group took part after the training, and another time, eight weeks later. The influence of the MBSR training and spatial attention were examined with behavioral measures, lateralized alpha power within the orienting interval, and with event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by the electrical stimuli. Self-reported mindfulness was clearly affected by the training, but no influence was found on other behavioral measures. Alpha power was clearly lateralized due to spatial attention and several ERP components (N130, N180, P340) were modulated by spatial attention but no support was found for an influence of the MBSR training. Finally, analyses revealed that individual differences in training time modulated some of the observed effects, but no support was found for an influence on attentional orienting."
https://openalex.org/W2886178226,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics (content validity, internal consistency, and subscale structure) of the Hematology Information Needs Questionnaire-62 (HINQ-62), a patient reported outcome measure (PROM) for assessing the need for information among patients with hematological malignancies (HM-patients). Baseline data were used from a prospective study on the need for information which 336 newly diagnosed HM-patients had completed. In phase 1 (design phase), data from the first 135 patients were used and in phase 2 (validation phase), data from the remaining 201 HM patients were used. Content validity was analyzed by examining irrelevance of items. Items were considered irrelevant if more than 10% of the patients scored totally disagree on that item. The subscale structure of the HINQ-62 was investigated with Factor analysis (FA) (exploratory FA in phase 1 and confirmatory FA in phase 2). Cronbach’s α was computed for the different subscales and >.70 was considered as good internal consistency. None of the 62 HINQ-items were irrelevant. Exploratory FA identified five subscales: “Disease, symptoms, treatment and side-effects”, “Etiology, sleep and physical changes”, “Self-care”, “Medical tests and prognosis”, and “Psychosocial”. Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) among patients was 0.037 in phase 1 and 0.045 in phase 2. The comparative fit index (CFI)/Tucker-Lewis index -non-normed fit index among patients was 0.984/0.983 and 0.948/0.946, in phase 1 and 2 respectively. The internal consistency of the subscales was good, with Cronbach’s α 0.82–0.99. The HINQ is a valid PROM for assessing the need for information among Dutch HM-patients at diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2886358749,"Mycolic acids (MA) are major, species-specific lipid components of Mycobacteria and related genera. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it is made up of alpha-, methoxy- and keto-MA, each with specific biological functions and conformational characteristics. Antibodies in tuberculosis (TB) patient sera respond differently towards the three MA classes and were reported to cross-react with cholesterol. To understand the antigenicity and cholesterol cross-reactivity of MA, we generated three different chicken -derived phage-displayed single-chain variable fragments (scFv) that reacted similarly towards the natural mixture of MA, but the first recognized all three classes of chemically synthetic MAs, the second only the two oxygenated types of MAs and the third only methoxy MA. The cholesterol cross-reactivity was investigated after grafting each of the three scFv types onto two configurations of constant chain domains-CH1-4 and CH2-4. Weak but significant cross-reactivity with cholesterol was found only with CH2-4 versions, notably those two that were also able to recognize the trans-keto MA. The cholesteroid nature of mycobacterial mycolic acids therefore seems to be determined by the trans-keto MA subclass. The significantly weaker binding to cholesterol in comparison to MA confirms the potential TB diagnostic application of these antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2887923667,"Background There is a need to improve public’s participation in health checks for early identification of individuals at high risk of CVD for prevention. The objective of this study is to identify significant determinants associated with individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. These determinants could be used to develop effective strategies to improve CVD health check participation. Methods This was a cross sectional survey using mall intercept interviews. It was carried out in a hypermarket surrounded by housing estates with a population of varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Inclusion criteria were Malaysian nationality and age 30 years and older. The validated CVD health check questionnaire was used to assess participants’ intention and the determinants that influenced their intention to undergo CVD health checks. Results A total of 413 participants were recruited. The median age of the participants was 45 years (IQR 17 years) and 60% of them were female. Participants indicated they were likely (45.0%) or very likely (38.7%) to undergo CVD health checks while 16.2% were not sure, unlikely or very unlikely to undergo health checks. Using ordinal regression analysis, perception of benefits, drawbacks of CVD health checks, perception of external barriers and readiness to handle outcomes following CVD health checks were the significant determinants of individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. Conclusions To improve individuals’ participation in CVD health checks, we need to develop strategies to address their perception of benefits and drawbacks of CVD health checks, the perceived external barriers and their readiness to handle outcomes following CVD health checks."
