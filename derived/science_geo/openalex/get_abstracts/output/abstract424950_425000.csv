https://openalex.org/W2150319418,"Despite significant progress in our understanding of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology during recent years, much of the information is based on experiments using in vitro culture-selected stromal progenitor cells. Therefore, the natural cellular identity of MSCs remains poorly defined. Numerous studies have reported that CD44 expression is one of the characteristics of MSCs in both humans and mice; however, we here have prospectively isolated bone marrow stromal cell subsets from both human and mouse bone marrow by flow cytometry and characterized them by gene expression analysis and function assays. Our data provide functional and molecular evidence suggesting that primary mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells of bone marrow reside in the CD44(-) cell fraction in both mice and humans. The finding that these CD44(-) cells acquire CD44 expression after in vitro culture provides an explanation for the previous misconceptions concerning CD44 expression on MSCs. In addition, the other previous reported MSC markers, including CD73, CD146, CD271, and CD106/VCAM1, are also differentially expressed on those two cell types. Our microarray data revealed a distinct gene expression profile of the freshly isolated CD44(-) cells and the cultured MSCs generated from these cells. Thus, we conclude that bone marrow MSCs physiologically lack expression of CD44, highlighting the natural phenotype of MSCs and opening new possibilities to prospectively isolate MSCs from the bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W1997700476,"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 in sepsis-induced AKI. C57BL/6 TLR2−/−, TLR4−/− and MyD88−/− male mice were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Twenty four hours later, kidney tissue and blood samples were collected for analysis. The TLR2−/−, TLR4−/− and MyD88−/− mice that were subjected to CLP had preserved renal morphology, and fewer areas of hypoxia and apoptosis compared with the wild-type C57BL/6 mice (WT). MyD88−/− mice were completely protected compared with the WT mice. We also observed reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the kidneys of the knockout mice compared with those of the WT mice and subsequent inhibition of increased vascular permeability in the kidneys of the knockout mice. The WT mice had increased GR1+low cells migration compared with the knockout mice and decreased in GR1+high cells migration into the peritoneal cavity. The TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and MyD88−/− mice had lower neutrophil infiltration in the kidneys. Depletion of neutrophils in the WT mice led to protection of renal function and less inflammation in the kidneys of these mice. Innate immunity participates in polymicrobial sepsis-induced AKI, mainly through the MyD88 pathway, by leading to an increased migration of neutrophils to the kidney, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, vascular permeability, hypoxia and apoptosis of tubular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051648641,"We examined whether older adults differ from younger adults in the degree to which they favor immediate over delayed rewards during decision-making. To examine the neural correlates of age-related differences in delay discounting we acquired functional MR images while participants made decisions between smaller but sooner and larger but later monetary rewards. The behavioral results show age-related reductions in delay discounting. Less impulsive decision-making in older adults was associated with lower ventral striatal activations to immediate reward. Furthermore, older adults showed an overall higher percentage of delayed choices and reduced activity in the dorsal striatum than younger adults. This points to a reduced reward sensitivity of the dorsal striatum in older adults. Taken together, our findings indicate that less impulsive decision-making in older adults is due to a reduced sensitivity of striatal areas to reward. These age-related changes in reward sensitivity may result from transformations in dopaminergic neuromodulation with age."
https://openalex.org/W2001474494,"Based on next-generation sequencing data, we assembled the mitochondrial (mt) genome of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) into a circular molecule of 715,001 bp in length. The mt genome of P. dactylifera encodes 38 proteins, 30 tRNAs, and 3 ribosomal RNAs, which constitute a gene content of 6.5% (46,770 bp) over the full length. The rest, 93.5% of the genome sequence, is comprised of cp (chloroplast)-derived (10.3% with respect to the whole genome length) and non-coding sequences. In the non-coding regions, there are 0.33% tandem and 2.3% long repeats. Our transcriptomic data from eight tissues (root, seed, bud, fruit, green leaf, yellow leaf, female flower, and male flower) showed higher gene expression levels in male flower, root, bud, and female flower, as compared to four other tissues. We identified 120 potential SNPs among three date palm cultivars (Khalas, Fahal, and Sukry), and successfully found seven SNPs in the coding sequences. A phylogenetic analysis, based on 22 conserved genes of 15 representative plant mitochondria, showed that P. dactylifera positions at the root of all sequenced monocot mt genomes. In addition, consistent with previous discoveries, there are three co-transcribed gene clusters–18S-5S rRNA, rps3-rpl16 and nad3-rps12–in P. dactylifera, which are highly conserved among all known mitochondrial genomes of angiosperms."
https://openalex.org/W2079693923,"ABCB6, a member of the adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, has been proposed to be responsible for the mitochondrial uptake of porphyrins. Here we show that ABCB6 is a glycoprotein present in the membrane of mature erythrocytes and in exosomes released from reticulocytes during the final steps of erythroid maturation. Consistent with its presence in exosomes, endogenous ABCB6 is localized to the endo/lysosomal compartment, and is absent from the mitochondria of cells. Knock-down studies demonstrate that ABCB6 function is not required for de novo heme biosynthesis in differentiating K562 cells, excluding this ABC transporter as a key regulator of porphyrin synthesis. We confirm the mitochondrial localization of ABCB7, ABCB8 and ABCB10, suggesting that only three ABC transporters should be classified as mitochondrial proteins. Taken together, our results challenge the current paradigm linking the expression and function of ABCB6 to mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2133722713,"The major complication in the treatment of hemophilia A is the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII (FVIII). The current method for eradicating inhibitors, termed immune tolerance induction (ITI), is costly and protracted. Clinical protocols that prevent rather than treat inhibitors are not yet established. Liver-directed gene therapy hopes to achieve long-term correction of the disease while also inducing immune tolerance. We sought to investigate the use of adeno-associated viral (serotype 8) gene transfer to induce tolerance to human B domain deleted FVIII in hemophilia A mice. We administered an AAV8 vector with either human B domain deleted FVIII or a codon-optimized transgene, both under a liver-specific promoter to two strains of hemophilia A mice. Protein therapy or gene therapy was given either alone or in conjunction with anti-CD20 antibody-mediated B cell depletion. Gene therapy with a low-expressing vector resulted in sustained near-therapeutic expression. However, supplementary protein therapy revealed that gene transfer had sensitized mice to hFVIII in a high-responder strain but not in mice of a low-responding strain. This heightened response was ameliorated when gene therapy was delivered with anti-murine CD20 treatment. Transient B cell depletion prevented inhibitor formation in protein therapy, but failed to achieve a sustained hypo-responsiveness. Importantly, use of a codon-optimized hFVIII transgene resulted in sustained therapeutic expression and tolerance without a need for B cell depletion. Therefore, anti-CD20 may be beneficial in preventing vector-induced immune priming to FVIII, but higher levels of liver-restricted expression are preferred for tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1984526317,"A variety of proteins, including tenascin-C and osteopontin, have been identified as ligands for integrin α9β1. However, their affinities for integrin α9β1 are apparently much lower than those of other integrins (e.g. α3β1, α5β1, and α8β1) for their specific ligands, leaving the possibility that physiological ligands for integrin α9β1 still remain unidentified. In this study, we found that polydom (also named SVEP1) mediates cell adhesion in an integrin α9β1-dependent manner and binds directly to recombinant integrin α9β1 with an affinity that far exceeds those of the known ligands. Using a series of recombinant polydom proteins with N-terminal deletions, we mapped the integrin-binding site to the 21st complement control protein domain. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that the EDDMMEVPY sequence (amino acids 2636-2644) in the 21st complement control protein domain was involved in the binding to integrin α9β1 and that Glu(2641) was the critical acidic residue for the integrin binding. The importance of this sequence was further confirmed by integrin binding inhibition assays using synthetic peptides. Immunohistochemical analyses of mouse embryonic tissues showed that polydom colocalized with integrin α9 in the stomach, intestine, and other organs. Furthermore, in situ integrin α9β1 binding assays using frozen mouse tissues showed that polydom accounts for most, but not all, of the integrin α9β1 ligands in tissues. Taken together, the present findings indicate that polydom is a hitherto unknown ligand for integrin α9β1 that functions as a physiological ligand in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2052612645,"The androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, however, the molecular mechanisms by which the AR regulates cell proliferation in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa are incompletely understood. We report that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) expression increases and becomes nuclear or perinuclear in advanced PCa. In the TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) model of PCa, CaMKK2 expression increases with PCa progression with many cells exhibiting nuclear staining. CaMKK2 expression is higher in human castration-resistant tumor xenografts compared with androgen-responsive xenografts and is markedly higher in the AR-expressing, tumorigenic cell line LNCaP compared with cell lines that are AR-nonexpressing and/or nontumorigenic. In LNCaP cells, dihydrotestosterone induced CaMKK2 mRNA and protein expression and translocation of CaMKK2 to the nucleus. Conversely, androgen withdrawal suppressed CaMKK2 expression. Knockdown of CaMKK2 expression by RNAi reduced LNCaP cell proliferation and increased percentages of cells in G(1) phase, whereas correspondingly reducing percentages in S phase, of the cell cycle. CaMKK2 knockdown reduced expression of the AR target gene prostate-specific antigen at both mRNA and protein levels, AR transcriptional activity driven by androgen responsive elements from the prostate-specific probasin gene promoter and levels of the AR-regulated cell cycle proteins, cyclin D1 and hyperphosphorylated Rb. Our results suggest that in PCa progression, CaMKK2 and the AR are in a feedback loop in which CaMKK2 is induced by the AR to maintain AR activity, AR-dependent cell cycle control, and continued cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2090423929,"The effect of storage conditions on the microbiome and metabolite composition of human biological samples has not been thoroughly investigated as a potential source of bias. We evaluated the effect of two common storage conditions used in clinical trials on the bacterial and metabolite composition of the vaginal microbiota using pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA gene sequencing and (1)H-NMR analyses.Eight women were enrolled and four mid-vaginal swabs were collected by a physician from each woman. The samples were either processed immediately, stored at -80°C for 4 weeks or at -20°C for 1 week followed by transfer to -80°C for another 4 weeks prior to analysis. Statistical methods, including Kolmogorovo-Smirnov and Wilcoxon tests, were performed to evaluate the differences in vaginal bacterial community composition and metabolites between samples stored under different conditions. The results showed that there were no significant differences between samples processed immediately after collection or stored for varying durations. (1)H-NMR analysis of the small molecule metabolites in vaginal secretions indicated that high levels of lactic acid were associated with Lactobacillus-dominated communities. Relative abundance of lactic acid did not appear to correlate with relative abundance of individual Lactobacillus sp. in this limited sample, although lower levels of lactic acid were observed when L. gasseri was dominant, indicating differences in metabolic output of seemingly similar communities.These findings benefit large-scale, field-based microbiome and metabolomic studies of the vaginal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2017105523,"Integrins are well characterized cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix proteins. Mapping integrin-binding sites within the fibrillar collagens identified GFOGER as a high affinity site recognized by α2β1, but with lower affinity for α1β1. Here, to identify specific ligands for α1β1, we examined binding of the recombinant human α1 I domain, the rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12), and the rat glioma Rugli cell line to our collagen Toolkit II and III peptides using solid-phase and real-time label-free adhesion assays. We observed Mg(2+)-dependent binding of the α1 I domain to the peptides in the following rank order: III-7 (GLOGEN), II-28 (GFOGER), II-7 and II-8 (GLOGER), II-18 (GAOGER), III-4 (GROGER). PC12 cells showed a similar profile. Using antibody blockade, we confirmed that binding of PC12 cells to peptide III-7 was mediated by integrin α1β1. We also identified a new α1β1-binding activity within peptide II-27. The sequence GVOGEA bound weakly to PC12 cells and strongly to activated Rugli cells or to an activated α1 I domain, but not to the α2 I domain or to C2C12 cells expressing α2β1 or α11β1. Thus, GVOGEA is specific for α1β1. Although recognized by both α2β1 and α11β1, GLOGEN is a better ligand for α1β1 compared with GFOGER. Finally, using biosensor assays, we show that although GLOGEN is able to compete for the α1 I domain from collagen IV (IC(50) ∼3 μm), GFOGER is much less potent (IC(50) ∼90 μm), as shown previously. These data confirm the selectivity of GFOGER for α2β1 and establish GLOGEN as a high affinity site for α1β1."
https://openalex.org/W2079928783,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a ubiquitously expressed PTP that is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PTP1B dephosphorylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases after endocytosis, as they transit past the ER. However, PTP1B also can access some plasma membrane (PM)-bound substrates at points of cell-cell contact. To explore how PTP1B interacts with such substrates, we utilized quantitative cellular imaging approaches and mathematical modeling of protein mobility. We find that the ER network comes in close proximity to the PM at apparently specialized regions of cell-cell contact, enabling PTP1B to engage substrate(s) at these sites. Studies using PTP1B mutants show that the ER anchor plays an important role in restricting its interactions with PM substrates mainly to regions of cell-cell contact. In addition, treatment with PTP1B inhibitor leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2, a PTP1B substrate, specifically at regions of cell-cell contact. Collectively, our results identify PM-proximal sub-regions of the ER as important sites of cellular signaling regulation by PTP1B."
https://openalex.org/W2125671699,"Alpine ecosystems are important globally with high levels of endemic and rare species. Given that they will be highly impacted by climate change, understanding biotic factors that maintain diversity is critical. Silene acaulis is a common alpine nurse plant shown to positively influence the diversity and abundance of organisms–predominantly other plant species. The hypothesis that cushion or nurse plants in general are important to multiple trophic levels has been proposed but rarely tested. Alpine arthropod diversity is also largely understudied worldwide, and the plant-arthropod interactions reported are mostly negative, that is,. herbivory. Plant and arthropod diversity and abundance were sampled on S. acaulis and at paired adjacent microsites with other non-cushion forming vegetation present on Whistler Mountain, B.C., Canada to examine the relative trophic effects of cushion plants. Plant species richness and abundance but not Simpson’s diversity index was higher on cushion microsites relative to other vegetation. Arthropod richness, abundance, and diversity were all higher on cushion microsites relative to other vegetated sites. On a microclimatic scale, S. acaulis ameliorated stressful conditions for plants and invertebrates living inside it, but the highest levels of arthropod diversity were observed on cushions with tall plant growth. Hence, alpine cushion plants can be foundation species not only for other plant species but other trophic levels, and these impacts are expressed through both direct and indirect effects associated with altered environmental conditions and localized productivity. Whilst this case study tests a limited subset of the membership of alpine animal communities, it clearly demonstrates that cushion-forming plant species are an important consideration in understanding resilience to global changes for many organisms in addition to other plants."
https://openalex.org/W2140364907,"The transparency of the eye lens depends upon maintenance of the native state of the γ- and β-crystallins, which is aided by the abundant chaperones αA- and αB-crystallin. Mature onset cataract, the leading cause of blindness worldwide, involves the polymerization of covalently damaged or partially unfolded crystallins into light-scattering aggregates. A number of single amino acid substitutions and truncations of γ-crystallins result in congenital cataract in both humans and mice, though in many cases the coupling between the protein alterations and the accumulation of aggregates is poorly defined.We have studied the aggregation properties and chaperone interactions of human γD-crystallin carrying substitutions of two buried core mutants, I90F and V75D, which cause congenital cataract in mice. The in vitro aggregation pathway competing with productive refolding was not altered by either substitution. Furthermore, this aggregation pathway for both mutant proteins--originating from a partially folded intermediate--was efficiently suppressed by αB-crystallin. Thus the cataract pathology was unlikely to be associated with a direct folding defect. The native state of wild-type human γD-crystallin exhibited no tendency to aggregate under physiological conditions. However both I90F and V75D native-like proteins exhibited slow (days) aggregation to high molecular weight aggregates under physiological conditions. The perturbed conformation of I90F was recognized and bound by both αA and αB chaperones. In contrast, the aggregation derived from the perturbed state of V75D was not suppressed by either chaperone, and the aggregating species were not bound by the chaperone.The cataract phenotype of I90F in mice may be due to premature saturation of the finite α- crystallin pool. The V75D aggregation pathway and its escape from chaperone surveillance and aggregation suppression can account for the congenital cataract pathology of this mutant. Failure of chaperone recognition may be an important source of pathology for many other protein folding defects."
https://openalex.org/W2145574190,"To search for factors promoting bone fracture repair, we investigated the effects of extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) on the adhesion, spreading, and migration of osteoblasts and its specific underlying cellular mechanisms. After a single period of stimulation by 10 kV (500 impulses) of shock wave (SW), the adhesion rate was increased as compared with the vehicle control. The data from both wound healing and transwell tests confirmed an acceleration in the migration of osteoblasts by SW treatment. RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and Western blotting showed that SW rapidly increased the surface expression of α5 and β1 subunit integrins, indicating that integrin β1 acted as an early signal for ESW-induced osteoblast adhesion and migration. It has also been found that a significant elevation occurred in the expression of phosphorylated β-catenin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at the site of tyrosine 397 in response to SW stimulation after the increasing expression of the integrin β1 molecule. When siRNAs of integrin α5 and β1 subunit were added, the level of FAK phosphorylation elevated by SW declined. Interestingly, the adhesion and migration of osteoblasts were decreased when these siRNA reagents as well as the ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, were present. Further studies demonstrated that U0126 could inhibit the downstream integrin-dependent signaling pathways, such as the FAK signaling pathway, whereas it had no influence on the synthesis of integrin β1 molecule. In conclusion, these data suggest that ESW promotes the adhesion and migration of osteoblasts via integrin β1-mediated expression of phosphorylated FAK at the Tyr-397 site; in addition, ERK1/2 are also important for osteoblast adhesion, spreading, migration, and integrin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1976774484,"Nephronophthisis (NPH) is an autosomal-recessive cystic kidney disease and represents the most common genetic cause for end-stage renal disease in children and adolescents. It can be caused by the mutation of genes encoding for the nephrocystin proteins (NPHPs). All NPHPs localize to primary cilia, classifying this disease as a ""ciliopathy."" The primary cilium is a critical regulator of several cell signaling pathways. Cystogenesis in the kidney is thought to involve overactivation of canonical Wnt signaling, which is negatively regulated by the primary cilium and several NPH proteins, although the mechanism remains unclear. Jade-1 has recently been identified as a novel ubiquitin ligase targeting the canonical Wnt downstream effector β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. Here, we identify Jade-1 as a novel component of the NPHP protein complex. Jade-1 colocalizes with NPHP1 at the transition zone of primary cilia and interacts with NPHP4. Furthermore, NPHP4 stabilizes protein levels of Jade-1 and promotes the translocation of Jade-1 to the nucleus. Finally, NPHP4 and Jade-1 additively inhibit canonical Wnt signaling, and this genetic interaction is conserved in zebrafish. The stabilization and nuclear translocation of Jade-1 by NPHP4 enhances the ability of Jade-1 to negatively regulate canonical Wnt signaling. Loss of this repressor function in nephronophthisis might be an important factor promoting Wnt activation and contributing to cyst formation."
https://openalex.org/W2023906080,"Inflammation-related (AA) amyloidosis is a severe clinical disorder characterized by the systemic deposition of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA). SAA is normally associated with the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction in plasma, but under yet unclear circumstances, the apolipoprotein is converted into amyloid fibrils. AA amyloid and heparan sulfate (HS) display an intimate relationship in situ, suggesting a role for HS in the pathogenic process. This study reports that HS dissociates SAA from HDLs isolated from inflamed mouse plasma. Application of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and molecular modeling suggests that HS simultaneously binds to two apolipoproteins of HDL, SAA and ApoA-I, and thereby induce SAA dissociation. The activity requires a minimum chain length of 12-14 sugar units, proposing an explanation to previous findings that short HS fragments preclude AA amyloidosis. The results address the initial events in the pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081535217,"Oxidative stress and misfolding of the prion protein (PrP(C)) are fundamental to prion diseases. We have therefore probed the effect of oxidation on the structure and stability of PrP(C). Urea unfolding studies indicate that H(2)O(2) oxidation reduces the thermodynamic stability of PrP(C) by as much as 9 kJ/mol. (1)H-(15)N NMR studies indicate methionine oxidation perturbs key hydrophobic residues on one face of helix-C as follows: Met-205, Val-209, and Met-212 together with residues Val-160 and Tyr-156. These hydrophobic residues pack together and form the structured core of the protein, stabilizing its ternary structure. Copper-catalyzed oxidation of PrP(C) causes a more significant alteration of the structure, generating a monomeric molten globule species that retains its native helical content. Further copper-catalyzed oxidation promotes extended β-strand structures that lack a cooperative fold. This transition from the helical molten globule to β-conformation has striking similarities to a misfolding intermediate generated at low pH. PrP may therefore share a generic misfolding pathway to amyloid fibers, irrespective of the conditions promoting misfolding. Our observations support the hypothesis that oxidation of PrP destabilizes the native fold of PrP(C), facilitating the transition to PrP(Sc). This study gives a structural and thermodynamic explanation for the high levels of oxidized methionine in scrapie isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2069577578,"Prenatal hyperandrogenism is able to induce polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in rats. The aim of the present study was to establish if the levels of prenatal testosterone may determine the extent of metabolic and endocrine alterations during the adult life. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were prenatally injected with either 2 or 5 mg free testosterone (groups T2 and T5 respectively) from day 16 to day 19 day of gestation. Female offspring from T2 and T5 displayed different phenotype of PCOS during adult life. Offspring from T2 showed hyperandrogenism, ovarian cysts and ovulatory cycles whereas those from T5 displayed hyperandrogenism, ovarian cysts and anovulatory cycles. Both group showed increased circulating glucose levels after the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT; an evaluation of insulin resistance). IPGTT was higher in T5 rats and directly correlated with body weight at prepubertal age. However, the decrease in the body weight at prepubertal age was compensated during adult life. Although both groups showed enhanced ovarian steroidogenesis, it appears that the molecular mechanisms involved were different. The higher dose of testosterone enhanced the expression of both the protein that regulates cholesterol availability (the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)) and the protein expression of the transcriptional factor: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). Prenatal hyperandrogenization induced an anti-oxidant response that prevented a possible pro-oxidant status. The higher dose of testosterone induced a pro-inflammatory state in ovarian tissue mediated by increased levels of prostaglandin E (PG) and the protein expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2, the limiting enzyme of PGs synthesis). In summary, our data show that the levels of testosterone prenatally injected modulate the uterine environment and that this, in turn, would be responsible for the endocrine and metabolic abnormalities and the phenotype of PCOS during the adult life."
https://openalex.org/W2005706163,"Population regulation is fundamental to the long-term persistence of populations and their responses to harvesting, habitat modification, and exposure to toxic chemicals. In fish and other organisms with complex life histories, regulation may involve density dependence in different life-stages and vital rates. We studied density dependence in body growth and mortality through the life-cycle of laboratory populations of zebrafish Danio rerio. When feed input was held constant at population-level (leading to resource limitation), body growth was strongly density-dependent in the late juvenile and adult phases of the life-cycle. Density dependence in mortality was strong during the early juvenile phase but declined thereafter and virtually ceased prior to maturation. Provision of feed in proportion to individual requirements (easing resource limitation) removed density dependence in growth and substantially reduced density dependence in mortality, thus indicating that ‘bottom-up’ effects act on growth as well as mortality, but most strongly on growth. Both growth and mortality played an important role in population regulation, with density-dependent growth having the greater impact on population biomass while mortality had the greatest impact on numbers. We demonstrate a clear ontogenic pattern of change in density-dependent processes within populations of a very small (maximum length 5 mm) fish, maintained in constant homogeneous laboratory conditions. The patterns are consistent with those distilled from studies on wild fish populations, indicating the presence of broad ontogenic patterns in density-dependent processes that are invariant to maximum body size and hold in homogeneous laboratory, as well as complex natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W2000641316,"Thymidine biosynthesis is essential in all cells. Inhibitors of the enzymes involved in this pathway (e.g. methotrexate) are thus frequently used as cytostatics. Due to its pivotal role in mycobacterial thymidylate synthesis dUTPase, which hydrolyzes dUTP into the dTTP precursor dUMP, has been suggested as a target for new antitubercular agents. All mycobacterial genomes encode dUTPase with a mycobacteria-specific surface loop absent in the human dUTPase. Using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a fast growing model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we demonstrate that dUTPase knock-out results in lethality that can be reverted by complementation with wild-type dUTPase. Interestingly, a mutant dUTPase gene lacking the genus-specific loop was unable to complement the knock-out phenotype. We also show that deletion of the mycobacteria-specific loop has no major effect on dUTPase enzymatic properties in vitro and thus a yet to be identified loop-specific function seems to be essential within the bacterial cell context. In addition, here we demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis dUTPase is fully functional in Mycobacterium smegmatis as it rescues the lethal knock-out phenotype. Our results indicate the potential of dUTPase as a target for antitubercular drugs and identify a genus-specific surface loop on the enzyme as a selective target."
https://openalex.org/W2120583301,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is a lipid and glycan modification added to the C terminus of certain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by the activity of a multiple subunit enzyme complex known as the GPI transamidase (GPIT). Several subunits of GPIT have increased expression levels in breast carcinoma. In an effort to identify GPI-anchored proteins and understand the possible role of these proteins in breast cancer progression, we employed a combination of strategies. First, alpha toxin from Clostridium septicum was used to capture GPI-anchored proteins from human breast cancer tissues, cells, and serum for proteomic analysis. We also expressed short interfering RNAs targeting the expression of the GPAA1 and PIGT subunits of GPIT in breast cancer cell lines to identify proteins in which membrane localization is dependent on GPI anchor addition. Comparative membrane proteomics using nano-ESI-RPLC-MS/MS led to the discovery of several new potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Furthermore, we provide evidence that increased levels of GPI anchor addition in malignant breast epithelial cells promotes the dedifferentiation of malignant breast epithelial cells in part by increasing the levels of cell surface markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055990076,"The contribution of hyaluronan (HA) to the regulatory network of the hematopoietic microenvironment was studied using knock-out mice of three hyaluronan synthase genes (Has1, Has2, and Has3). The number of hematopoietic progenitors was decreased in bone marrow and increased in extramedullary sites of Prx1-Cre;Has2(flox/flox);Has1(-/-);Has3(-/-) triple knock-out (tKO) mice as compared with wild type (WT) and Has1(-/-);Has3(-/-) double knock-out (dKO) mice. In line with this observation, decreased hematopoietic activity was observed in long term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) from tKO mice, whereas the formation of the adherent layer and generation of hematopoietic cells in WT and dKO cultures was not different. 4-Methylumbelliferone (4MU) was used to pharmacologically inhibit the production of HA in LTBMC. Treatment with 4MU inhibited HA synthesis, decreased expression of HAS2 and HAS3, and eliminated hematopoiesis in LTBMC, and this effect was alleviated by the addition of exogenous HA. Exogenous HA also augmented the cell motility in LTBMC, which correlated with the HA-stimulated production of chemokines and growth factors. Conditioned media from HA-induced LTBMC enhanced the chemotaxis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) in response to SDF-1. Exposure of endothelial cells to 4MU decreased their ability to support HSPC rolling and adhesion. In addition, migration of transplanted HSPC into the marrow of 4MU-pretreated mice was lower than in untreated mice. Collectively, the results suggest that HA depletion reduces the ability of the microenvironment to support HSPC, and confirm a role for HA as a necessary regulatory element in the structure of the hematopoietic microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2064371144,"Hereditary breast cancer comprises 10% of all breast cancers. The most prevalent genes causing this pathology are BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer early onset 1 and 2), which also predispose to other cancers. Despite the outstanding relevance of genetic screening of BRCA deleterious variants in patients with a history of familial cancer, this practice is not common in Latin American public institutions. In this work we assessed mutations in the entire exonic and splice-site regions of BRCA in 39 patients with breast and ovarian cancer and with familial history of breast cancer or with clinical features suggestive for BRCA mutations by massive parallel pyrosequencing. First we evaluated the method with controls and found 41–485 reads per sequence in BRCA pathogenic mutations. Negative controls did not show deleterious variants, confirming the suitability of the approach. In patients diagnosed with cancer we found 4 novel deleterious mutations (c.2805_2808delAGAT and c.3124_3133delAGCAATATTA in BRCA1; c.2639_2640delTG and c.5114_5117delTAAA in BRCA2). The prevalence of BRCA mutations in these patients was 10.2%. Moreover, we discovered 16 variants with unknown clinical significance (11 in exons and 5 in introns); 4 were predicted as possibly pathogenic by in silico analyses, and 3 have not been described previously. This study illustrates how massive pyrosequencing technology can be applied to screen for BRCA mutations in the whole exonic and splice regions in patients with suspected BRCA-related cancers. This is the first effort to analyse the mutational status of BRCA genes on a Mexican-mestizo population by means of pyrosequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2014360361,"The polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. A number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. To examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). This modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. Selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (Tannerella forsythia with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis with Prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. Pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of F. nucleatum/periodonticum and T. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 µm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 µm. While these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for F. nucleatum and T. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in the in vivo samples. In conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. More importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for “as-yet-uncultured” phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2108963946,"The Znu system, encoded for by znuABC, can be found in multiple genera of bacteria and has been shown to be responsible for the import of zinc under low zinc conditions. Although this high-affinity uptake system is known to be important for both growth and/or pathogenesis in bacteria, it has not been functionally characterized in a plant-associated bacterium. A single homologue of this system has been identified in the plant endosymbiont, Sinorhizobium meliloti, while two homologous systems were found in the destructive citrus pathogen, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. To understand the role of these protein homologues, a complementation assay was devised allowing the individual genes that comprise the system to be assayed independently for their ability to reinstate a partially-inactivated Znu system. Results from the assays have demonstrated that although all of the genes from S. meliloti were able to restore activity, only one of the two Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus encoded gene clusters contained genes that were able to functionally complement the system. Additional analysis of the gene clusters reveals that distinct modes of regulation may also exist between the Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus and S. meliloti import systems despite the intracellular-plant niche common to both of these bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2045416664,"Modifying weights within a recurrent network to improve performance on a task has proven to be difficult. Echo-state networks in which modification is restricted to the weights of connections onto network outputs provide an easier alternative, but at the expense of modifying the typically sparse architecture of the network by including feedback from the output back into the network. We derive methods for using the values of the output weights from a trained echo-state network to set recurrent weights within the network. The result of this “transfer of learning” is a recurrent network that performs the task without requiring the output feedback present in the original network. We also discuss a hybrid version in which online learning is applied to both output and recurrent weights. Both approaches provide efficient ways of training recurrent networks to perform complex tasks. Through an analysis of the conditions required to make transfer of learning work, we define the concept of a “self-sensing” network state, and we compare and contrast this with compressed sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2039542683,"There is a high prevalence of Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs in the Eastern Cape Province (ECP) of South Africa. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors of porcine cysticercosis in select districts of the ECP. Data were collected in 2003 by interviewing 217 pig producers from the area. Blood samples were collected from 261 of their pigs, which were tested using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies to cysticercosis. Frequencies of both owner- and pig-level characteristics were determined. For pig-level analysis, all bivariable and multivariable associations were determined using the surveylogistic procedure of the SAS/STAT® software to accommodate for the intraclass correlation that exists for clusters of pigs within one owner and for clusters of owners within a district. All tests for significance were performed at the α = 0.05 level, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined. Among the respondents, 48% of their households lacked a latrine, 98% slaughtered pigs at home, and 99% indicated that meat inspection services were not available. On bivariable analysis, there was a significant association between porcine infection and district (p = 0.003), breed (p = 0.041) and the absence of a latrine (p = 0.006). On multivariable analysis, the absence of a latrine was the only variable significantly associated with porcine infection (aOR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.07, 3.35) (p = 0.028). The increased odds of porcine infection with households lacking a latrine contributes to our understanding of the transmission of this parasite in the ECP. Determining and addressing the risk factors for T. solium infection can potentially lower the very high prevalence in humans and pigs in this endemic area."
https://openalex.org/W2051802352,"CCDC6 was originally identified in chimeric genes caused by chromosomal translocation involving the RET proto-oncogene in some thryoid tumors mostly upon ionizing radiation exposure. Recognised as a pro-apoptotic phosphoprotein that negatively regulates CREB1-dependent transcription, CCDC6 is an ATM substrate that is responsive to genotoxic stress. Here we report that following genotoxic stress, loss or inactivation of CCDC6 in cancers that carry the CCDC6 fusion, accelerates the dephosphorylation of pH2AX S139, resulting in defective G2 arrest and premature mitotic entry. Moreover, we show that CCDC6 depleted cells appear to repair DNA damaged in a shorter time compared to controls, based on reporter assays in cells. High-troughput proteomic screening predicted the interaction between the CCDC6 gene product and the catalytic subunit of Serin-Threonin Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4c) recently identified as the evolutionarily conserved pH2AX S139 phosphatase that is activated upon DNA Damage. We describe the interaction between CCDC6 and PP4c and we report the modulation of PP4c enzymatic activity in CCDC6 depleted cells. We discuss the functional significance of CCDC6-PP4c interactions and hypothesize that CCDC6 may act in the DNA Damage Response by negatively modulating PP4c activity. Overall, our data suggest that in primary tumours the loss of CCDC6 function could influence genome stability and thereby contribute to carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2129880885,"Background Zoledronic acid, one of the most potent nitrogen-containing biphosphonates, has been demonstrated to have direct anti-tumor and anti-metastatic properties in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. In particular, tumor-cell apoptosis has been recognized to play an important role in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with zoledronic acid. However, the precise mechanisms remain less clear. In the present study, we investigated the specific role of large conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (BKCa) channel in zoledronic acid-induced apoptosis of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Methodology/Principal Findings The action of zoledronic acid on BKCa channel was investigated by whole-cell and cell-attached patch clamp techniques. Cell apoptosis was assessed with immunocytochemistry, analysis of fragmented DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry assays. Cell proliferation was investigated by MTT test and immunocytochemistry. In addition, such findings were further confirmed with human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells which were transfected with functional BKCa α-subunit (hSloα). Our results clearly indicated that zoledronic acid directly increased the activities of BKCa channels, and then activation of BKCa channel by zoledronic acid contributed to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The possible mechanisms were associated with the elevated level of intracellular Ca2+ and a concomitant depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Conclusions Activation of BKCa channel was here shown to be a novel molecular pathway involved in zoledronic acid-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro."

Methods The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective alongside a 6 month, clustered, randomized controlled trial involving 10 Dutch residential homes. Outcome measures included a quality of care weighted sum score, functional health (COOP WONCA) and Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALY). Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapping was used to analyze differences in costs and cost-effectiveness. Results The quality of care sum score in MIC was significantly higher than in UC. The other primary outcomes showed no significant differences between the MIC and UC. The costs of providing MIC were approximately €225 per patient. Total costs were €2,061 in the MIC group and €1,656 for the UC group (mean difference €405, 95% −13; 826). The probability that the MIC was cost-effective in comparison with UC was 0.95 or more for ceiling ratios larger than €129 regarding patient related quality of care. Cost-effectiveness planes showed that the MIC model was not cost-effective compared to UC for the other outcomes. Interpretation Clinical effect differences between the groups were small but quality of care was significantly improved in the MIC group. Short term costs for MIC were higher. Future studies should focus on longer term economic and clinical effects. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN11076857"
https://openalex.org/W2065857398,"Background Meandering main pancreatic duct (MMPD), which comprises loop type and reverse-Z type main pancreatic duct (MPD), has long been discussed its relation to pancreatitis. However, no previous study has investigated its clinical significance. We aimed to determine the non-biased prevalence and the effect of MMPD on idiopathic pancreatitis using non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) technique. Methods and Findings A cross-sectional study performed in a tertiary referral center. The study enrolled 504 subjects from the community and 30 patients with idiopathic pancreatitis (7 acute, 13 chronic, and 10 recurrent acute). All subjects underwent MR scanning and medical examination. MMPD was diagnosed when the MPD in the head of pancreas formed two or more extrema in the horizontal direction on coronal images of MR cholangiopancreatography, making a loop or a reverse-Z shaped hairpin curves and not accompanied by other pancreatic ductal anomaly. Statistical comparison was made among groups on the rate of MMPD including loop and reverse-Z subtypes, MR findings, and clinical features. The rate of MMPD was significantly higher for all idiopathic pancreatitis/idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) (20%/40%; P<0.001/0.0001; odds ratio (OR), 11.1/29.0) than in the community (2.2%) but was not higher for acute/chronic pancreatitis (14%/8%; P = 0.154/0.266). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed MMPD to be a significant factor that induces pancreatitis/RAP (P<0.0001/0.0001; OR, 4.01/26.2). Loop/reverse-Z subtypes were found more frequently in idiopathic RAP subgroup (20%/20%; P = 0.009/0.007; OR, 20.2/24.2) than in the community (1.2%/1.0%). The other clinical and radiographic features were shown not associated with the onset of pancreatitis. Conclusions MMPD is a common anatomical variant and might be a relevant factor to the onset of idiopathic RAP."
https://openalex.org/W2090927937,"Theory and empirical results suggest that the rate of loss of variation at Mhc and neutral microsatellite loci may differ because selection influences Mhc genes, and because a high proportion of rare alleles at Mhc loci may result in high rates of loss via drift. Most published studies compare Mhc and microsatellite variation in various contemporary populations to infer the effects of population size on genetic variation, even though different populations are likely to have different demographic histories that may also affect contemporary genetic variation. We directly compared loss of variation at Mhc and microsatellite loci in Peary caribou by comparing historical and contemporary samples. We observed that similar proportions of genetic variation were lost over time at each type of marker despite strong evidence for selection at Mhc genes. These results suggest that microsatellites can be used to estimate genome-wide levels of variation, but also that adaptive potential is likely to be lost following population bottlenecks. However, gene conversion and recombination at Mhc loci may act to increase variation following bottlenecks."
https://openalex.org/W2164399318,"Several beneficial effects have been demonstrated for secretogranin II (SgII) in non-cardiac tissue. As cardiac production of chromogranin A and B, two related proteins, is increased in heart failure (HF), we hypothesized that SgII could play a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology.SgII production was characterized in a post-myocardial infarction heart failure (HF) mouse model, functional properties explored in experimental models, and circulating levels measured in mice and patients with stable HF of moderate severity. SgII mRNA levels were 10.5 fold upregulated in the left ventricle (LV) of animals with myocardial infarction and HF (p<0.001 vs. sham-operated animals). SgII protein levels were also increased in the LV, but not in other organs investigated. SgII was produced in several cell types in the myocardium and cardiomyocyte synthesis of SgII was potently induced by transforming growth factor-β and norepinephrine stimulation in vitro. Processing of SgII to shorter peptides was enhanced in the failing myocardium due to increased levels of the proteases PC1/3 and PC2 and circulating SgII levels were increased in mice with HF. Examining a pathophysiological role of SgII in the initial phase of post-infarction HF, the SgII fragment secretoneurin reduced myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by 30% and rapidly increased cardiomyocyte Erk1/2 and Stat3 phosphorylation. SgII levels were also higher in patients with stable, chronic HF compared to age- and gender-matched control subjects: median 0.16 (Q1-3 0.14-0.18) vs. 0.12 (0.10-0.14) nmol/L, p<0.001.We demonstrate increased myocardial SgII production and processing in the LV in animals with myocardial infarction and HF, which could be beneficial as the SgII fragment secretoneurin protects from ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Circulating SgII levels are also increased in patients with chronic, stable HF and may represent a new cardiac biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2022386445,"The design of specific inhibitors against the Hsp90 chaperone and other enzyme relies on the detailed and correct understanding of both the thermodynamics of inhibitor binding and the structural features of the protein-inhibitor complex. Here we present a detailed thermodynamic study of binding of aryl-dihydroxyphenyl-thiadiazole inhibitor series to recombinant human Hsp90 alpha isozyme. The inhibitors are highly potent, with the intrinsic Kd approximately equal to 1 nM as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thermal shift assay (TSA). Dissection of protonation contributions yielded the intrinsic thermodynamic parameters of binding, such as enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and the heat capacity. The differences in binding thermodynamic parameters between the series of inhibitors revealed contributions of the functional groups, thus providing insight into molecular reasons for improved or diminished binding efficiency. The inhibitor binding to Hsp90 alpha primarily depended on a large favorable enthalpic contribution combined with the smaller favorable entropic contribution, thus suggesting that their binding was both enthalpically and entropically optimized. The enthalpy-entropy compensation phenomenon was highly evident when comparing the inhibitor binding enthalpies and entropies. This study illustrates how detailed thermodynamic analysis helps to understand energetic reasons for the binding efficiency and develop more potent inhibitors that could be applied for therapeutic use as Hsp90 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2035825290,"The tarnished plant bug has become increasingly resistant to organophosphates in recent years. To better understand acephate resistance mechanisms, biological, biochemical, and molecular experiments were systematically conducted with susceptible (LLS) and acephate-selected (LLR) strains. Selection of a field population with acephate significantly increased resistance ratio to 5.9-fold, coupled with a significant increase of esterase activities by 2-fold. Microarray analysis of 6,688 genes revealed 329 up- and 333 down-regulated (≥2-fold) genes in LLR. Six esterase, three P450, and one glutathione S-transferase genes were significantly up-regulated, and no such genes were down-regulated in LLR. All vitellogenin and eggshell protein genes were significantly down-regulated in LLR. Thirteen protease genes were significantly down-regulated and only 3 were up-regulated in LLR. More than twice the number of catalysis genes and more than 3.6-fold of metabolic genes were up-regulated, respectively, as compared to those down-regulated with the same molecular and biological functions. The large portion of metabolic or catalysis genes with significant up-regulations indicated a substantial increase of metabolic detoxification in LLR. Significant increase of acephate resistance, increases of esterase activities and gene expressions, and variable esterase sequences between LLS and LLR consistently demonstrated a major esterase-mediated resistance in LLR, which was functionally provable by abolishing the resistance with esterase inhibitors. In addition, significant elevation of P450 gene expression and reduced susceptibility to imidacloprid in LLR indicated a concurrent resistance risk that may impact other classes of insecticides. This study demonstrated the first association of down-regulation of reproductive- and digestive-related genes with resistance to conventional insecticides, suggesting potential fitness costs associated with resistance development. This study shed new light on the understanding of the molecular basis of insecticide resistance, and the information is highly valuable for development of chemical control guidelines and tactics to minimize resistance and cross-resistance risks."

Background: There is an oxidoreductive d-galactose pathway in filamentous fungi. Results: We identified an l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase that produces d-sorbitol and that is part of this pathway. Conclusion: This l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase is the missing link in the oxidoreductive d-galactose pathway. Significance: The alternative pathway for d-galactose catabolism in filamentous fungi is elucidated. There are several pathways for the catabolism of d-galactose. The most studied is the Leloir pathway, which exists in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. In this pathway, α-d-galactose is phosphorylated, and in the subsequent steps, converted to d-glucose-6-phosphate in a redox-neutral way (1.Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. Structure and function of enzymes of the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The genes of the Leloir pathway and their regulation have been described in yeast and filamentous fungi (2.Seiboth B. Pakdaman B.S. Hartl L. Kubicek C.P. Lactose metabolism in filamentous fungi: how to deal with an unknown substrate.Fungal Biol. Rev. 2007; 21: 42-48Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway is the oxidative pathway that is sometimes referred to as the De Ley-Doudoroff pathway and was identified in bacteria (3.De Ley J. Doudoroff M. The metabolism of d-galactose in Pseudomonas saccharophila.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 227: 745-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, d-galactose is first oxidized to d-galactonolactone, which is then hydrolyzed by a lactonase to d-galactonate followed by the removal of a water molecule by a dehydratase to form d-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-galactonate). d-threo-3-Deoxy-hexulosonate is then phosphorylated to d-threo-3-deoxy hexulosonate 6-phosphate, which is subsequently split by an aldolase, resulting in pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. In a strain of the mold Aspergillus niger, a nonphosphorylated alternative of the De Ley-Doudoroff pathway was described where the d-threo-3-deoxy-hexulosonate is split by an aldolase to pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde instead of being phosphorylated (4.Elshafei A.M. Abdel-Fatah O.M. Evidence for a non-phosphorylated route of galactose breakdown in cell-free extracts of Aspergillus niger.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another pathway for d-galactose catabolism has also been demonstrated in some filamentous fungi. It was observed that a Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) strain with a mutation in the galactokinase gene, gal1, is still able to catabolize d-galactose, indicating the existence of an alternative to the Leloir pathway. Because galactitol accumulated in this strain, it was suggested that a pathway exists in T. reesei where d-galactose is reduced in the first step (5.Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. The galactokinase of Hypocrea jecorina is essential for cellulase induction by lactose but dispensable for growth on d-galactose.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In T. reesei, an aldose reductase, XYL1, was shown to be responsible for the reduction of d-galactose to galactitol as well as for the reduction of d-xylose and l-arabinose (6.Seiboth B. Gamauf C. Pail M. Hartl L. Kubicek C.P. The d-xylose reductase of Hypocrea jecorina is the major aldose reductase in pentose and d-galactose catabolism and necessary for β-galactosidase and cellulase induction by lactose.Mol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 23622-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). XyrA had the highest activity with d-galactose and was suggested to be involved in d-galactose catabolism (8.Mojzita D. Koivistoinen O.M. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Richard P.

It was also observed in T. reesei that a double mutant with deletions in gal1 and lad1, coding for galactokinase and l-arabitol-4-dehydrogenase, respectively, was not able to catabolize d-galactose. This suggested that the l-arabitol-4-dehydrogenase that is induced on l-arabitol (9.Richard P. Londesborough J. Putkonen M. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that purified l-arabitol 4-dehydrogenase, the product of lad1, was capable of converting galactitol to l-xylo-3-hexulose. In A. niger, it was shown that a distinct galactitol dehydrogenase, LadB, exists besides the l-arabitol dehydrogenase, LadA, that produces l-xylo-3-hexulose and that it is induced on d-galactose and galactitol (8.Mojzita D.

Biotechnol. 2011; 89: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) pointed out the possibility that the l-xylo-3-hexulose is reduced to d-sorbitol in a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme related to l-xylulose reductase or by the l-xylulose reductase itself. The complete oxidoreductive d-galactose pathway would then have the intermediates d-galactose, galactitol, l-xylo-3-hexulose, d-sorbitol, and d-fructose (see Fig. 1). d-Sorbitol was shown to be an intermediate in the pathway of A. niger where the d-fructose-forming d-sorbitol dehydrogenase, sdhA, was found to be induced on d-galactose and galactitol and the sdhA deletion mutant had reduced growth on galactitol and was unable to grow on d-sorbitol (12.Koivistoinen O.M.

In T. reesei, xylitol dehydrogenase, xdh1, was proposed to be the enzyme responsible for this reaction. 4B. Seiboth, unpublished observation. Fekete et al. (13.Fekete E. Karaffa L. Sándor E.

Microbiol. 2004; 181: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested that l-sorbose is produced in Aspergillus nidulans from galactitol by l-arabitol dehydrogenase and that it could be further converted to d-sorbitol. The reaction mechanism of the galactitol to l-sorbose conversion, however, has not been proposed and currently remains elusive. Here we set out to identify the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of l-xylo-3-hexulose to d-sorbitol (l-gulitol), which is the missing link in the oxidoreductive d-galactose pathway in the molds T. reesei and A. niger.

The resulting vector was digested with EcoRV (New England Biolabs). The pyrG DNA fragment, after digestion with SmaI, was inserted between the two xhrA flanking regions. The resulting plasmid was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. The deletion cassette, 5097 bp, containing the xhrA flanking regions and the pyrG gene, was released by MluI (New England Biolabs) digestion and transformed into the A. niger ATCC 1015 ΔpyrG strain. Transformants were selected based on their ability to grow in the absence of uracil. Strains with successful deletions were verified by PCR using the primers xhrA_ORF_F and xhrA_ORF_F (Table 2).TABLE 1The transcription of the following genes was tested in A. niger using qPCRJGI: 177738 (An08g01930) lxrAJGI: 184209 (An16g01650) xhrAJGI: 40156 (An07g01830)JGI: 174212 (An02g00220)JGI: 177858 (An06g01980)JGI: 184211 (An16g06440)JGI: 56312 (An15g02280)JGI: 212729 (An09g00620)JGI: 55205 (An04g09990)JGI: 212936 (An05g01210)JGI: 52907 (An11g02460) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2PrimersxhrA-genomic_FGGCAAGACAACGGACTGAAxhrA-genomic_RAATTCCTGGTGATTCGGGTTxhrA-ORF_FATATGAATTCACAATGTCCCTCAAAGGTAAAGTCGxhrA-ORF_RATATGTCGACCTAGATATACAACATCCCACCATTxhrA-N-HIS_FATATGAATTCACAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGGTCCCTCAAAGGTAAAGTCGxhrA-5_FTATAGCTAGCAGCTGAACGCCTGATACAAAxhrA-5_RATATGATATCGATGGCTTTTGCAGATTGTTTGxhrA-3_FATATGATATCCAGAGCCGTGTTAAATAAGGAATACxhrA-3_FATTAAAGCTTACGCGTACGAAGCCGCCGAAGATAact_qPCR_FCAACATTGTCATGTCTGGTGGact_qPCR_RGGAGGAGCAATGATCTTGACxhrA_qPCR_FGATACAGATATGTACCAGGCAGxhrA_qPCR_RCTAGATATACAACATCCCACCAgalX_qPCR_FCTGTGAAATGTTTGGGAAGTCgalX_qPCR_RGTTTGTTGGTCGTTCGTAGGpyrG-del-F_nTATACCCGGGTGATTGAGGTGATTGGCGATpyrG-del-R_nTATACCCGGGTTATCACGCGACGGACATlxr4-HIS-N_FATATGAATTCACAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGGGCCCGTCCGTATGAAGGClxr4_ORF_RTAATGATATCCTACGCAATCGACATGCGCATCCTrire22771_XbaI-Ups-fwTCTAGACCATTGTCCCAGCCATCTTTrire22771_XhoI-Ups-revCTCGAGCGACTTGAGCAATCACCACTrire22771_XhoI-Dws-fwCTCGAGGATGTGTACTTGGTGGCTTGTrire22771_Acc-Dws-revGGTACCTCTCTGCTCGTTAAATCCCGdlxr4_for3GGCGGAGTTTCTATGGAGdlxr4_rev3GGGATTGATATTGTTTGC Open table in a new tab A T. reesei Δtku70 strain was used as the parental strain for transformation (14.Guangtao Z.

The cassette for deletion of the lxr4 gene (GenBankTM accession number BK008566) contained 937 bp of the promoter region, 1162 bp of the terminator region, and a fragment containing the pyr4 encoding orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase. The promoter and terminator regions were obtained by PCR from the genomic DNA of the T. reesei strain QM9414 using primers Trire22771_XbaI-Ups-fw, Trire22771_XhoI-Ups-rev, Trire22771_XhoI-Dws-fw, and Trire22771_Acc-Dws-rev (Table 2) and the proofreading DNA polymerase Phusion (Finnzymes). Both fragments were ligated into the vector pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) after digestion with XbaI and XhoI (Fermentas) for the promoter fragment and with XhoI and Acc65I (Fermentas) for the terminator fragment using ligation mix III (Takara). The SalI fragment of pyr4 served as the selection marker and was cloned via XhiI restriction between the promoter and terminator regions of lxr4 in pBluescript SK(+). The resulting plasmid (verified by restriction analysis and sequencing) was linearized using XbaI and Acc65I and transformed into the T. reesei Δtku70 strain. Transformants were selected based on their ability to grow in the absence of uridine. Strains with successful deletions were verified by PCR using the primers dlxr4_for3 and dlxr4_rev3 (Table 2). The xhrA gene, with its native promoter and terminator (2496-bp genomic fragment), was amplified from the A. niger ATCC 1015 genomic DNA using the primers xhrA-genomic_F and xhrA-genomic_R (Table 2). The PCR product was transformed into the ΔxhrA strain, and the transformants were selected on medium with galactitol as a sole carbon source. The resulting strains were tested for the presence of the xhrA gene by PCR and further analyzed for growth on selected carbon sources. For heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, the open reading frames (ORFs) of xhrA (Table 1) and lxr4 (GenBank accession number BK008566) were amplified from the cDNA of A. niger or T. reesei, respectively, grown in the presence of galactitol with the primers xhrA-H-HIS_F, xhrA-ORF_R, lxr4-HIS-N_F, and lxr4_ORF_R (Table 2). The genes were inserted into the plasmid pYX212 (Ingenius, R&D Systems, Madison, WI) between the EcoRI and SalI sites (in the case of xhrA) or the EcoRI and SmaI sites (in the case of lxr4), allowing the expression to be controlled by the TPI1 promoter. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2-1D was transformed with the pYX212 plasmids containing the xhrA and lxr4 genes as N-terminal His-tagged variants, and the transformants were selected based on their ability to grow in the absence of uracil. The expression of active reductases was tested in crude cell extracts by enzymatic activity measurements. The xhrA was also expressed without a His tag and as a gene that was codon-optimized for expression in S. cerevisiae. The gene was also expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DH3) (Invitrogen) using the pBAT4 expression vector (16.Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. T7 vectors with modified T7lac promoter for expression of proteins in Escherichia coli.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. For l-xylo-3-hexulose-reductase activity measurements in A. niger extracts, the parent strain ATCC 1015 and the ΔxhrA strains were cultivated overnight in YPG medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone; 3% gelatin). The mycelia were filtered and transferred to fresh medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, and 2% d-glucose, galactitol or l-arabinose and cultivated for 6 h. After incubation in the inducing conditions, the mycelia were isolated by filtration and washed with water, and ∼200 mg of wet mycelia was transferred into 2-ml tubes with 0.6 ml of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) and 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH = 7.5) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The cells were disrupted in two 30-s breaking sessions in the Precellys 24 instrument (Bertin Technologies). The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used in the enzyme assays. The protein concentration was analyzed using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. In the tests performed with the A. niger protein extracts, 10 mm l-xylo-3-hexulose, 0.5 mm NADPH, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 7.5) were used. The enzymatic activity was measured at room temperature by monitoring the NADPH disappearance at 340 nm in microtiter plates (Nunc) using the Varioskan spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron). For the protein extractions from S. cerevisiae and the purification of the His-tagged proteins, the same methods were used as described previously (8.Mojzita D. Koivistoinen O.M. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Richard P. Identification of the galactitol dehydrogenase, LadB, that is part of the oxidoreductive d-galactose catabolic pathway in Aspergillus niger.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2012; 49: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For LXR4 sugar reductase activities, the reactions were set up in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 7.5) with 0.5 mm NADPH and various sugar concentrations (see “Results”). For the LXR4 polyol dehydrogenase activities, the reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 8.5), 1 mm NADP+, and various concentrations of polyols (see “Results”). The degradation of NADPH or formation of NADPH was monitored as described above. The Km and Vmax were estimated from the Michaelis-Menten equation fitted to the measured data. The concentration of l-xylo-3-hexulose produced by E. coli expressing ladB was determined by NMR spectroscopy. 480 μl of D2O containing 0.05% of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP, Aldrich) was added to 120 μl of the sample, and a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum was acquired on a 600-MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped with a QCI CryoProbe (Bruker) using the one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence for presaturation of the water signal. The concentration of the l-xylo-3-hexulose was obtained by comparing the integral over a region of 4.27–4.40 ppm with the integral of TSP. The in vitro reaction with purified LXR4 for the analysis of the reaction product from d-sorbitol was carried out in 1 ml of reaction mix containing 50 μg of the purified LXR4, 100 mm d-sorbitol, and 5 mm NADP+ in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 9.0). The reaction mix was incubated at room temperature for 16 h. The control reaction was terminated immediately after the components were mixed by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min. The reactions were analyzed by HPLC as described previously (8.Mojzita D. Koivistoinen O.M. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Richard P. Identification of the galactitol dehydrogenase, LadB, that is part of the oxidoreductive d-galactose catabolic pathway in Aspergillus niger.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2012; 49: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The suggested oxidoreductive pathway for d-galactose catabolism has similarities with the eukaryotic l-arabinose pathway (Fig. 1). The reductions require NADPH, and the oxidations require NAD+. The reactions that were described are catalyzed by identical or closely related enzymes. In T. reesei, the first and second steps of both pathways are catalyzed by the same enzymes. The T. reesei XYL1 is the major enzyme for l-arabinose and d-galactose reduction (6.Seiboth B. Gamauf C. Pail M. Hartl L. Kubicek C.P. The d-xylose reductase of Hypocrea jecorina is the major aldose reductase in pentose and d-galactose catabolism and necessary for β-galactosidase and cellulase induction by lactose.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and LAD1 is the main enzyme for galactitol and l-arabitol oxidation (9.Richard P. Londesborough J. Putkonen M. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Cloning and expression of a fungal l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase gene.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40631-40637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10.Pail M.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In A. niger, close homologues of different enzymes are used; XyrA is used for d-galactose reduction, and LarA is used for l-arabinose reduction (7.Mojzita D. Penttilä M. Richard P. Identification of an l-arabinose reductase gene in Aspergillus niger and its role in l-arabinose catabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23622-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also, the second step uses close homologues of different enzymes. Galactitol is oxidized in A. niger by LadB (8.Mojzita D. Koivistoinen O.M. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Richard P. Identification of the galactitol dehydrogenase, LadB, that is part of the oxidoreductive d-galactose catabolic pathway in Aspergillus niger.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2012; 49: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and l-arabitol is oxidized in A. niger by LadA (17.de Groot M.J. van den Dool C. Wösten H.A. Levisson M. vanKuyk P.A. Ruijter G.J. de Vries R.P. Regulation of pentose catabolic pathway genes of Aspergillus niger.Food Technol. Biotechnol. 2007; 45: 134-138Google Scholar). This information suggested that a similar phenomenon may also exist for the third step. Thus, the l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase may be a homologue of the l-xylulose reductase or identical to the l-xylulose reductase. Because LxrA was identified as the l-xylulose reductase in A. niger (18.Mojzita D. Vuoristo K. Koivistoinen O.M. Penttilä M. Richard P. The “true” l-xylulose reductase of filamentous fungi identified in Aspergillus niger.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3540-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we examined whether this enzyme could also be the l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase. The LxrA was purified using the histidine tag as described previously (18.Mojzita D. Vuoristo K. Koivistoinen O.M. Penttilä M. Richard P. The “true” l-xylulose reductase of filamentous fungi identified in Aspergillus niger.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3540-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The activity was tested with l-xylo-3-hexulose and NADPH and in the reverse direction with d-sorbitol and NADP+. The enzyme had activity with these substrates, suggesting that this enzyme could be the l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase. We tested the transcription of this gene by qPCR during growth on galactitol or d-galactose. The lxrA gene was not up-regulated under these conditions, suggesting that although the LxrA has l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase activity, it is not the “true” l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase. Also, the ΔlxrA strain does not confer any growth defect in the presence of galactitol when compared with the wild type strain (data not shown). We then tested the transcription of several close homologues to lxrA on galactitol or d-galactose, which are listed in Table 1. The closest lxrA homologue (E-value = 1.45 × 10−31) JGI: 184209 (An16g01650) was found to be up-regulated on galactitol and d-galactose (Fig. 2A). We called this gene xhrA for l-xylo-3-hexulose reductase. The xhrA gene was also up-regulated on galactitol and d-galactose in a strain where ladB was deleted with the up-regulation being significantly higher (Fig. 2B). The LadB converts galactitol to l-xylo-3-hexulose, and the ladB mutant cannot grow on galactitol (8.Mojzita D. Koivistoinen O.M. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Richard P. Identification of the galactitol dehydrogenase, LadB, that is part of the oxidoreductive d-galactose catabolic pathway in Aspergillus niger.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2012; 49: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggests that galactitol, which probably accumulates in the ΔladB strain and not l-xylo-3-hexulose, is required for the induction of xhrA. A homologue of galX is located next to xhrA on the chromosome. The galX gene was identified in A. nidulans as the gene encoding a regulator that controls the d-galactose utilization, and it was shown to be up-regulated in the presence of galactitol and d-galactose (19.Christensen U. Gruben B.S. Madrid S. Mulder H. Nikolaev I. de Vries R.P. Unique regulatory mechanism for d-galactose utilization in Aspergillus nidulans.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 7084-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Likewise in A. niger, the transcription of galX was up-regulated in the presence of galactitol and d-galactose. In addition, galX transcription was further enhanced in the ΔladB strain in a similar manner as observed in the case of xhrA expression (Fig. 2, C and D). In T. reesei, several homologues of l-xylulose reductase exist. The product of the lxr1 gene tre74194 (www.jgi.doe.gov) that was described to be active with l-xylulose (20.Richard P. Putkonen M. Väänänen R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. The missing link in the fungal l-arabinose catabolic pathway, identification of the l-xylulose reductase gene.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6432-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) turned out to be a d-mannitol dehydrogenase (21.Metz B. de Vries R.P. Polak S. Seidl V. Seiboth B. The Hypocrea jecorina (syn. Trichoderma reesei) lxr1 gene encodes a d-mannitol dehydrogenase and is not involved in l-arabinose catabolism.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another candidate LXR3 (GenBank accession number BK008567), which was identified and characterized as a gene encoding the true l-xylulose reductase of T. reesei, showed only activity with l-xylulose but not with l-xylo-3-hexulose in vitro. 6B. Metz, D. Mojzita, S. Herold, C. P. Kubicek, P. Richard, and B. Seiboth, manuscript in preparation. Moreover, none of these genes are close homologues of xhrA. By searching the T. reesei genome, we identified a gene that we called lxr4 (GenBank accession number BK008566) as the closest orthologue for lxrA. To test whether the xhrA is essential for the pathway, we deleted the gene in A. niger. The resulting strain was then tested for growth on different carbon sources and compared with the ATCC 1015 parent strain (Fig. 3). The mutant showed no growth on galactitol, demonstrating that the xhrA is an essential gene for its utilization. To prove that this phenotype is only related to the deletion of the xhrA, we retransformed the xhrA to the ΔxhrA strain. In the strain expressing the xhrA in the mutant background, growth on galactitol is fully restored (data not shown). The mutant and parent strain do not grow on d-galactose. Only when small amounts of d-xylose (0.025%) are supplemented does the parent strain grow, and the ΔxhrA strain showed reduced growth. 0.025% d-xylose alone does not result in significant growth as described previously (8.Mojzita D. Koivistoinen O.M. Maaheimo H. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Richard P. Identification of the galactitol dehydrogenase, LadB, that is part of the oxidoreductive d-galactose catabolic pathway in Aspergillus niger.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2012; 49: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The growth on d-glucose and l-arabinose is not affected because the xhrA gene is not required for the metabolism of these sugars. The deletion of lxr4 in T. reesei resulted in no growth on galactitol. The phenotype of this mutant is similar to the xhrA deletion in A. niger (Fig. 3). Growth on galactitol was abolished, but growth on d-glucose and l-arabinose was not affected. Growth on d-galactose is significantly slower but not absent. This is expected because it is established that T. reesei has a functional Leloir pathway for d-galactose catabolism and that the oxidoreductive pathway only partially contributes to the d-galactose catabolism. The oxidoreductive pathway only becomes essential if the Leloir pathway is disrupted, for example, when the gene encoding the galactokinase is deleted (5.Seiboth B. Hartl L. Pail M. Fekete E. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P. The galactokinase of Hypocrea jecorina is essential for cellulase induction by lactose but dispensable for growth on d-galactose.Mol.

The xhrA of A. niger and the lxr4 of T. reesei were expressed in S. cerevisiae from a multicopy plasmid with a strong constitutive promoter. In the crude S. cerevisiae extracts, w"

Methods This study evaluated impact of obesity on outcome as well as interferon and ribavirin concentrations following standard-of-care fixed dosing with peginterferon-α2a 180 µg once weekly and ribavirin 800 mg daily among 303 HCV genotype 2/3-infected patients enrolled in the per-protocol analysis of a recently completed phase III trial (NORDynamIC). Results Patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 showed poorer outcome following 24 weeks of therapy (SVR 62% vs. 89% for BMI ≥30 vs. <30; P = 0.006) along with significantly higher steatosis grade (P = 0.002), HOMA-IR (P<0.0001), triglyceride levels (P = 0.0002), and baseline viral load (P = 0.028). Obesity was also significantly associated with lower plasma interferon concentrations on days 3, 7, and 29 (P = 0.02, P = 0.0017, and P<0.0001, respectively) and lower plasma ribavirin concentrations day 29 (P = 0.025), and lower concentration of interferon in turn was associated with a poorer first phase reduction in HCV RNA (P<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, ribavirin concentrations week 12, interferon concentrations day 29, and baseline HCV RNA levels were independent predictors of achieving SVR among patients treated for 24 weeks (n = 140). Conclusions Reduced bioavailability of interferon and ribavirin along with higher baseline viral load are dominant risk factors for treatment failure in obese patients with chronic hepatitis C."
https://openalex.org/W2051245660,"The accessory Sec systems of streptococci and staphylococci mediate the transport of a family of large, serine-rich glycoproteins to the bacterial cell surface. These systems are comprised of SecA2, SecY2, and three core accessory Sec proteins (Asp1-3). In Streptococcus gordonii, transport of the serine-rich glycoprotein GspB requires both a unique 90-residue N-terminal signal peptide and an adjacent 24-residue segment (the AST domain). We used in vivo site-specific photo-cross-linking to identify proteins that interact with the AST domain during transport. To facilitate this analysis, the entire accessory Sec system of S. gordonii was expressed in Escherichia coli. The determinants of GspB trafficking to the accessory Sec system in E. coli matched those in S. gordonii, establishing the validity of this approach. When the photo-cross-linker was placed within the AST domain, the preprotein was found to cross-link to SecA2. Importantly, no cross-linking to SecA was detected. Cross-linking of the N-terminal end of the AST domain to SecA2 occurred regardless of whether Asp1-3 were present. However, cross-linking to the C-terminal end was dependent on the Asps. The combined results indicate that full engagement of the AST domain by SecA2 is modulated by one or more of the Asps, and suggest that this process is important for initiating transport."
https://openalex.org/W1967791804,"Stroke patients recover more effectively when they are rehabilitated with bimanual movement rather than with unimanual movement; however, it remains unclear why bimanual movement is more effective for stroke recovery. Using a computational model of stroke recovery, this study suggests that bimanual movement facilitates the reorganization of a damaged motor cortex because this movement induces rotations in the preferred directions (PDs) of motor cortex neurons. Although the tuning curves of these neurons differ during unimanual and bimanual movement, changes in PD, but not changes in modulation depth, facilitate such reorganization. In addition, this reorganization was facilitated only when encoding PDs are rotated, but decoding PDs are not rotated. Bimanual movement facilitates reorganization because this movement changes neural activities through inter-hemispheric inhibition without changing cortical-spinal-muscle connections. Furthermore, stronger inter-hemispheric inhibition between motor cortices results in more effective reorganization. Thus, this study suggests that bimanual movement is effective for stroke rehabilitation because this movement rotates the encoding PDs of motor cortex neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1984101415,"From 1997 to 2004, we used radio telemetry to investigate movement and distribution patterns of 206 adult fluvial bull trout (mean, 449 mm FL) from watersheds representing a wide range of habitat conditions in northeastern Oregon and southwestern Washington, a region for which there was little previous information about this species. Migrations between spawning and wintering locations were longest for fish from the Imnaha River (median, 89 km) and three Grande Ronde River tributaries, the Wenaha (56 km) and Lostine (41 km) rivers and Lookingglass Creek (47 km). Shorter migrations were observed in the John Day (8 km), Walla Walla (20 km) and Umatilla river (22 km) systems, where relatively extensive human alterations of the riverscape have been reported. From November through May, fish displayed station-keeping behavior within a narrow range (basin medians, 0.5-6.2 km). Prespawning migrations began after snowmelt-driven peak discharge and coincided with declining flows. Most postspawning migrations began by late September. Migration rates of individuals ranged from 0.1 to 10.7 km/day. Adults migrated to spawning grounds in consecutive years and displayed strong fidelity to previous spawning areas and winter locations. In the Grande Ronde River basin, most fish displayed an unusual fluvial pattern: After exiting the spawning tributary and entering a main stem river, individuals moved upstream to wintering habitat, often a substantial distance (maximum, 49 km). Our work provides additional evidence of a strong migratory capacity in fluvial bull trout, but the short migrations we observed suggest adult fluvial migration may be restricted in basins with substantial anthropogenic habitat alteration. More research into bull trout ecology in large river habitats is needed to improve our understanding of how adults establish migration patterns, what factors influence adult spatial distribution in winter, and how managers can protect and enhance fluvial populations."
https://openalex.org/W2087150669,"Elevated CO(2) is generally detrimental to animal cells, suggesting an interaction with core processes in cell biology. We demonstrate that elevated CO(2) blunts G protein-activated cAMP signaling. The effect of CO(2) is independent of changes in intracellular and extracellular pH, independent of the mechanism used to activate the cAMP signaling pathway, and is independent of cell context. A combination of pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the effect of elevated CO(2) on cAMP levels required the activity of the IP(3) receptor. Consistent with these findings, CO(2) caused an increase in steady state cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentrations not observed in the absence of the IP(3) receptor or under nonspecific acidotic conditions. We examined the well characterized cAMP-dependent inhibition of the isoform 3 Na(+)/H(+) antiporter (NHE3) to demonstrate a functional relevance for CO(2)-mediated reductions in cellular cAMP. Consistent with the cellular biochemistry, elevated CO(2) abrogated the inhibitory effect of cAMP on NHE3 function via an IP(3) receptor-dependent mechanism."

Five α (α1–α5), three β (β1–β3), and three γ chains (γ1–γ3) have been identified, and 19 isoforms are formed by various combinations of each chain depending on the tissue and developmental stage (3.Aumailley M.

Cross-shaped laminin heterotrimers contain either an α1, α2, α3B, or α5 chain (1.Miner J.H. Laminins and their roles in mammals.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2008; 71: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These four α chains consist of three major regions: an N-terminal short arm, a coiled-coil domain, and C-terminal five tandem modules of LG domains, whereas the α3A and α4 chain lack the N-terminal short arm region. The N-terminal short arm is important for laminin self-assembly and cell adhesion, the coiled-coil domain maintains the laminin heterotrimer formation, and the LG modules mediate cell attachment to laminin through various cell surface receptors (5.Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Form and function. The laminin family of heterotrimers.Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Each laminin α chain is tissue- and/or developmental stage-specifically expressed, and the cell surface receptors for the laminin isoforms are mainly determined by the type of laminin α chains. The laminin α2 chain, which is a component of laminin-211 (α2β1γ1), laminin-221 (α2β2γ1), laminin-213 (α2β1γ3), laminin-212 (α2β1γ2), and laminin-222 (α2β2γ2), is expressed in the basement membranes surrounding skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve, brain, and capillaries (1.Miner J.H.

From the LG domains, A2G78 (GLLFYMARINHA, mouse laminin α2 chain, residues 2796–2807) is a critical active sequence for both heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and α-DG binding, whereas A2G80 (VQLRNGFPYFSY, mouse laminin α2 chain, and 2812–2823) specifically binds to α-DG (12.Suzuki N.

However, the biologically active sites in the laminin α2 chain short arm region and coiled-coil domain have not yet been systematically investigated. In the present work, we synthesized 218 overlapping peptides covering the entire laminin α2 chain short arm region and coiled-coil domain sequence and evaluated their cell attachment activity on peptide-coated plates and peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads using two different cell types. Neurite outgrowth activity of the peptides was also examined. The identified active sequences in terms of cellular receptors were further analyzed. All of the peptides were manually synthesized by the N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase method with a C-terminal amide as described previously (12.Suzuki N. Hozumi K. Urushibata S.

Identification of α-dystroglycan binding sequences in the laminin α2 chain LG4–5 module.Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 218 synthetic peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Mightysil RP-18 GP 250–10 column (Kanto Chemical Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using a gradient elution with water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purity and identity of the peptides were confirmed by analytical HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry at the Central Analysis Center, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences. The 216 peptides were dissolved in Milli-Q water and used for experiments with the exception of A2-53 and A2-55, which were insoluble and not used for experiments. Rat monoclonal antibody against human integrin α6 (GoH3) was purchased from AMAC (Westbrook, ME). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human integrin α1 (FB12), α2 (P1E6), α3 (P1B5), αv (P3G8), β1 (6S6), and α2β1 (BHA2.1) were purchased from Millipore Co. Ltd. (Billerica, MA). Human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA), C2C12 cells, a mouse myoblast cell line (CRL-1772; ATCC, Manassas, VA), and 293T cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (28.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S.

The cells were maintained at 37 °C in an humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. cDNA was synthesized using mRNA from mouse kidney by the Superscript III (Invitrogen) and amplified by the KOD plus (Toyobo Life Science, Osaka, Japan) as follows: 216–1723 nucleotides of the mouse laminin α2 chain, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCGGCGACAGTCCCAAGCG-3′ (forward 1) and 5′-CCCTCGAGAACCATCAAGCAGGGATTTC-3′ (reverse 1). A DNA sequence of the mouse laminin α2 chain LN-LEa domain (a2LN+) was inserted into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pCEP4dPur vector, which expresses the His and FLAG tag on its N terminus under BM-40 signal peptide (pCEPa2LN+) (29.Hozumi K. Suzuki N. Nielsen P.K. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Laminin α1 chain LG4 module promotes cell attachment through syndecans and cell spreading through integrin α2β1.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32929-32940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Laminin α2 chain LN-LEa domain with N-terminal tags and signal peptide were inserted into pEF4/V5-His (Invitrogen) with KpnI and NotI sites, and a mouse laminin α2 chain LN-LEa domain-expressing plasmid (pEFa2LN+; 216–1723 nucleotides) was obtained. PCR product using pCEPa2LN+ amplified by 5′-GGAATTCCACCATGAGGGCCTGGATCTTCTTTC-3′ (forward 2) and 5′-CCTCGAGACATCCCGCCAACTGAAATATC-3′ (reverse 2) was inserted to pEF4/V5-His with SpeI and EcoRV to obtain a mouse laminin α2 chain LN domain-expressing plasmid (pEFa2LN; 216–993 nucleotides). The PCR product using the previous cDNA was amplified by a forward 1 primer and 5′-CGTGAGGTTGATGTTCATGG-3′ (reverse 3) and inserted into pEF2aLN+ with EcoRI and XbaI to construct the mouse laminin α2 chain short arm region-expressing plasmid (pEFa2N; 216–4931 nucleotides). For preparation of mutant recombinant laminin α2 chain LN-LEa (rec-a2LN+), we performed site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The following amino acid residues of the laminin α2 chain LN domain were substituted with alanine (m1: Ile-122; m2: Leu-124 and Asp-125; and m3: Thr-123). The recombinant protein expression vectors were transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were maintained for 2 days, then split at a 1:6 ratio in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and incubated with 200 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 3 days for selection. The selected cells were maintained with 100 μg/ml zeocin. To prepare recombinant proteins, nearly confluent cells were cultured without serum for 3 days, and the condition medium was collected. The medium was cleared of debris by centrifugation, and Complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science) was added to decrease proteolysis. Nickel-charged agarose resins (Probond; Invitrogen) were added to the conditioned medium. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the resins were transferred to a column and washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (T-PBS), containing 10 mm imidazole (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). His-tagged recombinant proteins were eluted with T-PBS, containing 250 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl. Purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS and quantified using the BCA protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY). Purity was determined by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Wako) staining and Western blotting. The CD (J-720; JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) spectrum analysis did not show significant differences in rec-a2LN+ mutant proteins. The cell attachment assay using synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins was performed in 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 96-well plates were coated with various amounts of proteins in 50 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. Peptides were also coated on the plates by drying overnight. Then the substrate-coated wells were blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed with 0.1% BSA in DMEM. The cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and were allowed to recover for 20 min at 37 °C. After they were washed with 0.1% BSA in DMEM, the cells were plated in 0.1% BSA in DMEM at 2.0 × 104 cells/100 μl/well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 5% CO2. The medium was removed by aspiration, and the attached cells were fixed and stained with 0.2% crystal violet aqueous solution in 20% methanol for 15 min. After the wells were washed, 1% SDS solution (150 μl) was added to lyse the cells. The optical density at 570 nm was measured in a plate reader Safire (Tecan Austria GmbH Grödig, Austria) or observed under a BZ-8000 microscope before lysing by SDS (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). All of the cell attachment assays were carried out at least three times with triplicate wells for each test concentration. The synthetic peptides were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) as described previously (21.Suzuki N. Ichikawa N. Kasai S. Yamada M. Nishi N. Morioka H. Yamashita H. Kitagawa Y. Utani A. Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Syndecan binding sites in the laminin α1 chain G domain.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12625-12633Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The peptides (200 μg) were incubated with the CNBr-activated Sepharose (30 mg) in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3, containing 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.3), for 1 h at room temperature. Then the beads were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) and washed with 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 4.0), containing 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 0.5 m NaCl. The cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (1 × 105 cells/100 μl) and incubated with 3 mg/50 μl peptide bead solution for 1 h. The attached cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet aqueous solution in 20% methanol. After removal of unattached cells, the attached cells were observed under a BZ-8000. Each peptide was assayed using HDFs and C2C12 cells. Each assay was repeated at least twice. Cell attachment assays using peptide-chitosan membranes were performed on 96-well plates as described previously (30.Mochizuki M. Kadoya Y. Wakabayashi Y. Kato K. Okazaki I. Yamada M. Sato T.

After 50 μl/well of maleimidobenzoyloxy-chitosan solution was added and dried, the plates were washed with 1% NaHCO3 and then washed with PBS. For conjugation of peptides to chitosan membranes, a Cys-Gly-Gly sequence was added at the N terminus of the peptides as described previously (30.Mochizuki M. Kadoya Y. Wakabayashi Y. Kato K.

Laminin-1 peptide-conjugated chitosan membranes as a novel approach for cell engineering.FASEB J. 2003; 17: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 5 mm of peptide solution was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. Then the plates were used for the cell attachment assay as described above. For inhibition of cell attachment to peptide-coated plates and to peptide-chitosan membranes, 96-well plates were prepared as described above. The cells were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of either 10 μg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mm EDTA (Wako Pure Chemicals), 10 μg/ml various cell adhesive peptides, and 10 or 30 μg/ml of integrin antibodies. HDFs (2.0 × 104 cells/100 μl/well) were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on the peptide-coated plates for 30 min and evaluated. Each assay was repeated at least three times. Neurite outgrowth was performed in 96-well plates and assessed as described previously (32.Hozumi K. Akizuki T. Yamada Y. Hara T. Urushibata S. Katagiri F. Kikkawa Y. Nomizu M. Cell adhesive peptide screening of the mouse laminin α1 chain G domain.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 503: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were primed with 100 ng/ml of NGF (Invitrogen) for 24 h prior to the assay. The cells were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 containing 30 nm Na2SeO3, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 20 nm progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen), and 100 ng/ml NGF. The cells were added to 96-well plates at 3.0 × 103 cells/100 μl/well, incubated for 24 h, fixed with 20% formalin, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. One hundred cells in each well were viewed under a BZ-8000, and the percentage of the active cells, which had neurites that extended twice the cell diameter in length and/or longer, was determined. Analyses of neurite outgrowth were carried out in triplicate. We prepared 218 peptides from the N-terminal region of mouse laminin α2 chain (positions 24–2149) to identify biologically active sequences (Fig. 1). For the screening, the peptides were generally synthesized as 12-amino acid residues in length and overlapped with neighboring peptides by four amino acids. If the N-terminal amino acid was either glutamate or glutamic acid, one amino acid was extended at the N terminus to avoid pyroglutamine formation. Cysteine residues were deleted from the peptide design to avoid the influence of disulfide bonds on cell adhesive activity. Cysteine-flanking sequences of less than 5 amino acids and N-terminal signal peptides were omitted. The activities of peptides A2-1 to A2-24 were determined in our previous work (27.Nomizu M. Yokoyama F. Suzuki N. Okazaki I. Nishi N. Ponce M.L. Kleinman H.K. Yamamoto Y. Nakagawa S. Mayumi T. Identification of homologous biologically active sites on the N-terminal domain of laminin α chains.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15310-15317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cell attachment activity of the soluble 216 peptides was evaluated using both the coated plate method and conjugated Sepharose beads, respectively. To eliminate false positive results, we used two different assays. The coated plate method determines morphological differences and dose dependence of cell attachment, whereas the Sepharose bead conjugation method regulates the amount of peptides. AG73, which was identified as the strongest peptide for cell attachment in the mouse α1 chain LG4 module, and its scrambled peptide AG73T were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (21.Suzuki N. Ichikawa N. Kasai S. Yamada M. Nishi N. Morioka H. Yamashita H. Kitagawa Y. Utani A. Hoffman M.P. Nomizu M. Syndecan binding sites in the laminin α1 chain G domain.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12625-12633Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the coated plate method, nine peptides (A2-8, A2-31, A2-56, A2-63, A2-112, A2-122, A2-144, A2-176, and A2-185) showed strong cell attachment activity with human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), and the A2-8 peptide significantly promoted cell spreading (data not shown). These cell attachment activities were comparable with that of AG73. The A2-64 peptide promoted cell attachment, but the activity was weaker than that of AG73 (Fig. 2B). The rest of the peptides did not promote HDF attachment. We next evaluated cell attachment activity using C2C12 cells. Eight peptides (A2-8, A2-56, A2-63, A2-112, A2-122, A2-144, A2-176, and A2-185) had strong C2C12 cell attachment activity comparable with that of AG73 (supplemental Fig. S1A). Two peptides (A2-31 and A2-64) showed weak C2C12 cell attachment activity (supplemental Fig. S1B). None of the other peptides promoted C2C12 attachment. Next, we conjugated the 216 soluble peptides to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads"
https://openalex.org/W2089959971,"Sprague-Dawley rats can be classified as low or high cocaine responders (LCRs or HCRs, respectively) based on their locomotor activity induced by an acute low dose of cocaine. Upon repeated cocaine exposure, LCRs display greater locomotor sensitization, reward, and reinforcement than HCRs. Altered glutamate receptor expression in the brain reward pathway has been linked to locomotor sensitization and addiction. To determine if such changes contribute to the differential development of locomotor sensitization, we examined protein levels of total, phosphorylated, and cell surface glutamate N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors (Rs) following acute or repeated cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in LCRs, HCRs and saline controls. Three areas involved in the development and expression of locomotor sensitization were investigated: the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (dSTR). Our results revealed differences only in the dSTR, where we found that after acute cocaine, GluN2BTyr-1472 phosphorylation was significantly greater in LCRs, compared to HCRs and controls. Additionally in dSTR, after repeated cocaine, we observed significant increases in total GluA1, phosphorylated GluA1Ser-845, and cell surface GluA1 in all cocaine-treated animals vs. controls. The acute cocaine-induced increases in NMDARs in dSTR of LCRs may help to explain the more ready development of locomotor sensitization and susceptibility to addiction-like behaviors in rats that initially exhibit little or no cocaine-induced activation, whereas the AMPAR increases after repeated cocaine may relate to recruitment of more dorsal striatal circuits and maintenance of the marked cocaine-induced locomotor activation observed in all of the rats."
https://openalex.org/W2007737323,"Levels of genetic diversity can strongly influence the dynamics and evolutionary changes of natural populations. Survival and disease resistance have been linked to levels of genetic diversity in eusocial insects, yet these relationships remain untested in gregarious insects where disease transmission can be high and selection for resistance is likely to be strong.Here we use 8 microsatellite loci to examine genetic variation in 12 families of western tent caterpillars, Malacosoma californicum pluviale from four different island populations to determine the relationship of genetic variability to survival and disease resistance. In addition these genetic markers were used to elucidate the population structure of western tent caterpillars. Multiple paternity was revealed by microsatellite markers, with the number of sires estimated to range from one to three per family (mean ± SE = 1.92±0.23). Observed heterozygosity (H(O)) of families was not associated to the resistance of families to a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) (r = 0.161, F(1,12) = 0.271, P = 0.614), a major cause of mortality in high-density populations, but was positively associated with larval survival (r = 0.635, F(1,10) = 5.412, P = 0.048). Genetic differentiation among the families was high (F(ST) = 0.269, P<0.0001), and families from the same island were as differentiated as were families from other islands.We have been able to describe and characterize 8 microsatellite loci, which demonstrate patterns of variation within and between families of western tent caterpillars. We have discovered an association between larval survival and family-level heterozygosity that may be relevant to the population dynamics of this cyclic forest lepidopteran, and this will be the topic of future work."
https://openalex.org/W2158741750,"This present study aims to investigate the changes in the inflammatory markers after elective endovascular treatment of Type B aortic dissection with aneurysm, as related to different anatomical features of the dissection flap in the paravisceral perfusion. Consecutive patients with type B aortic dissections with elective endovascular stent graft repair were recruited and categorized into different groups. Serial plasma levels of cytokines (Interleukin-1β, -6, -8, -10, TNF-α), chemokines (MCP-1), and serum creatinine were monitored at pre-, peri- and post-operative stages. The length of stent graft employed in each surgery was retrieved and correlated with the change of all studied biochemical parameters. A control group of aortic dissected patients with conventional medication management was recruited for comparing the baseline biochemical parameters. In total, 22 endovascular treated and 16 aortic dissected patients with surveillance were recruited. The endovascular treated patients had comparable baseline levels as the non-surgical patients. There was no immediate or thirty day-mortality, and none of the surgical patients developed post-operative mesenteric ischaemia or clinically significant renal impairment. All surgical patients had detectable pro-inflammatory mediators, but none of the them showed any statistical significant surge in the peri-operative period except IL-1β and IL-6. Similar results were obtained when categorized into different groups. IL-1β and IL-6 showed maximal levels within hours of the endovascular procedure (range, 3.93 to 27.3 higher than baseline; p = 0.001), but returned to baseline 1 day post-operatively. The change of IL-1β and IL-6 at the stent graft deployment was statistically greater in longer stent graft (p>0.05). No significant changes were observed in the serum creatinine levels. In conclusion, elective endovascular repair of type B aortic dissection associated with insignificant changes in inflammatory mediators and creatinine. All levels fell toward basal levels post-operatively suggesting that thoracic endovascular aortic repair is rather less aggressive with insignificant inflammatory modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2083924446,"Background Amino acid adenylation domains (A domains) are critical enzymes that dictate the identity of the amino acid building blocks to be incorporated during nonribosomal peptide (NRP) biosynthesis. NRPs represent a large group of valuable natural products that are widely applied in medicine, agriculture, and biochemical research. Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 is a representative strain of the first discovered obligate marine actinomycete genus, whose genome harbors a large number of cryptic secondary metabolite gene clusters. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to investigate cryptic NRP-related metabolites in S. arenicola CNS-205, we cloned and identified the putative gene sare0718 annotated “amino acid adenylation domain”. Firstly, the general features and possible functions of sare0718 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, which suggested that Sare0718 is a soluble protein with an AMP-binding domain contained in the sequence and its cognate substrate is L-Val. Then, a GST-tagged fusion protein was expressed and purified to further explore the exact adenylation activity of Sare0718 in vitro. By a newly mentioned nonradioactive malachite green colorimetric assay, we found that L-Ala but not L-Val is the actual activated amino acid substrate and the basic kinetic parameters of Sare0718 for it are Km = 0.1164±0.0159 (mM), Vmax = 3.1484±0.1278 (µM/min), kcat = 12.5936±0.5112 (min−1). Conclusions/Significance By revealing the biochemical role of sare0718 gene, we identified an alanine-activating adenylation domain in marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola CNS-205, which would provide useful information for next isolation and function elucidation of the whole cryptic nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-related gene cluster covering Sare0718. And meanwhile, this work also enriched the biochemical data of A domain substrate specificity in newly discovered marine actinomycete NRPS system, which bioinformatics prediction will largely depend on."
