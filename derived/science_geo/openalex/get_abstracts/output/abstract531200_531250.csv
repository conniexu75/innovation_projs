Skyrmions have been observed in multiple materials but usually at impractically low temperatures. Jiang et al. used a constriction in a trilayer system to create skyrmions at room temperature (see the Perspective by von Bergmann). The authors pushed elongated magnetic domains through the constriction using an in-plane current, causing individual skyrmion bubbles to form. Science , this issue p. 283 ; see also p. 234"
https://openalex.org/W1861518448,"In the weeks following the first imported case of Ebola in the U. S. on September 29, 2014, coverage of the very limited outbreak dominated the news media, in a manner quite disproportionate to the actual threat to national public health; by the end of October, 2014, there were only four laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola in the entire nation. Public interest in these events was high, as reflected in the millions of Ebola-related Internet searches and tweets performed in the month following the first confirmed case. Use of trending Internet searches and tweets has been proposed in the past for real-time prediction of outbreaks (a field referred to as ""digital epidemiology""), but accounting for the biases of public panic has been problematic. In the case of the limited U. S. Ebola outbreak, we know that the Ebola-related searches and tweets originating the U. S. during the outbreak were due only to public interest or panic, providing an unprecedented means to determine how these dynamics affect such data, and how news media may be driving these trends.We examine daily Ebola-related Internet search and Twitter data in the U. S. during the six week period ending Oct 31, 2014. TV news coverage data were obtained from the daily number of Ebola-related news videos appearing on two major news networks. We fit the parameters of a mathematical contagion model to the data to determine if the news coverage was a significant factor in the temporal patterns in Ebola-related Internet and Twitter data.We find significant evidence of contagion, with each Ebola-related news video inspiring tens of thousands of Ebola-related tweets and Internet searches. Between 65% to 76% of the variance in all samples is described by the news media contagion model."
https://openalex.org/W613934122,"The ecological succession of microbes during cadaver decomposition has garnered interest in both basic and applied research contexts (e.g. community assembly and dynamics; forensic indicator of time since death). Yet current understanding of microbial ecology during decomposition is almost entirely based on plant litter. We know very little about microbes recycling carcass-derived organic matter despite the unique decomposition processes. Our objective was to quantify the taxonomic and functional succession of microbial populations in soils below decomposing cadavers, testing the hypotheses that a) periods of increased activity during decomposition are associated with particular taxa; and b) human-associated taxa are introduced to soils, but do not persist outside their host. We collected soils from beneath four cadavers throughout decomposition, and analyzed soil chemistry, microbial activity and bacterial community structure. As expected, decomposition resulted in pulses of soil C and nutrients (particularly ammonia) and stimulated microbial activity. There was no change in total bacterial abundances, however we observed distinct changes in both function and community composition. During active decay (7 - 12 days postmortem), respiration and biomass production rates were high: the community was dominated by Proteobacteria (increased from 15.0 to 26.1% relative abundance) and Firmicutes (increased from 1.0 to 29.0%), with reduced Acidobacteria abundances (decreased from 30.4 to 9.8%). Once decay rates slowed (10 - 23 d postmortem), respiration was elevated, but biomass production rates dropped dramatically; this community with low growth efficiency was dominated by Firmicutes (increased to 50.9%) and other anaerobic taxa. Human-associated bacteria, including the obligately anaerobic Bacteroides, were detected at high concentrations in soil throughout decomposition, up to 198 d postmortem. Our results revealed the pattern of functional and compositional succession in soil microbial communities during decomposition of human-derived organic matter, provided insight into decomposition processes, and identified putative predictor populations for time since death estimation."

However, the intrinsic factors that determine the sexual fate of vertebrate germ cells are unknown. Here, we show that foxl3, which is expressed in germ cells but not somatic cells in the gonad, is involved in sperm-egg fate decision in medaka fish. Adult XX medaka with disrupted foxl3 developed functional sperm in the expanded germinal epithelium of a histologically functional ovary. In chimeric medaka, mutant germ cells initiated spermatogenesis in female wild-type gonad. These results indicate that a germ cell-intrinsic cue for the sperm-egg fate decision is present in medaka and that spermatogenesis can proceed in a female gonadal environment."
https://openalex.org/W656997998,"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are assumed to act as endocrine disruptor chemicals. Prenatal exposure to these pollutants might influence fetal steroid hormone levels, which are thought to be related to sex-typical development and autistic traits.We examined associations of prenatal levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs with autism traits and sex-typical behaviour in childhood.We measured levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in maternal blood samples during pregnancy using gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Sex-typical behaviour was assessed at 9 years of age (n = 96) and autistic traits at 10 years of age using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS; n = 100). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to estimate the associations between prenatal exposure and outcome variables.Blood concentrations (WHO2005-TEq) of ƩPCDD/Fs ranged from 2.93-46.45 pg/g lipid base (median = 12.91 pg/g lipid base) and concentrations of ƩPCBs were in the range of 1.24-25.47 pg/g lipid base (median = 6.85 pg/g lipid base) which is within the range of German background exposure. We found significant negative associations between PCDD/F levels in maternal blood and SRS scores in the whole group (β = -6.66, p < .05), in girls (β = -10.98, p < .05) and, in one SRS subscale, in boys (β = -6.86, p < .05). For PCB levels, associations with one SRS subscale were significant for the whole study group as were associations with two subscales in girls. We did not find significant associations between PCDD/F or PCB levels and sex-typical behaviour for either sex.In an earlier part of this study, prenatal exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs was found to be associated with lower testosterone levels, therefore, our findings are consistent with the idea that autism spectrum conditions are related to fetal androgen levels. Several possible mechanisms, through which PCDD/Fs and PCBs might influence autistic behaviour, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1577363347,"The association between metabolic syndrome (MS) and bone health remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between MS and hip bone geometry (HBG), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD), and the risk of osteoporosis and incident fractures. Data of 2040 women and 1510 men participants in the third visit (1997-1999) of the Rotterdam Study (RSI-3), a prospective population based cohort, were available (mean follow-up 6.7 years). MS was defined according to the recent harmonized definition. HBG parameters were measured at the third round visit whereas FN-BMD was assessed at the third round and 5 years later. Incident fractures were identified from medical registry data. After correcting for age, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle factors and medication use, individuals with MS had lower bone width (β = -0.054, P = 0.003), lower cortical buckling ratio (β = -0.81, P = 0.003) and lower odds of having osteoporosis (odds ratio =0.56, P = 0.007) in women but not in men. Similarly, MS was associated with higher FN-BMD only in women (β = 0.028, P=0.001). In the analyses of MS components, the glucose component (unrelated to diabetes status) was positively associated with FN-BMD in both genders (β = 0.016, P = 0.01 for women and β = 0.022, P = 0.004 for men). In men, waist circumference was inversely associated with FN-BMD (β = -0.03, P = 0.004). No association was observed with fracture risk in either sex. In conclusion, women with MS had higher FN-BMD independent of BMI. The glucose component of MS was associated with high FN-BMD in both genders, highlighting the need to preserve glycemic control to prevent skeletal complications."
https://openalex.org/W1527544276,"Galectins are proteins that bind β-galactoside sugars and provide a new type of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. Galectin-1, -3 and -9 have become the focus of different research groups, but their expression and function in cervical cancer is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the phenotype of galectin-1, -3 and -9 expressing cells and the association with clinico-pathological parameters in cervical cancer. Galectin expression was scored in tumor cells, tumor epithelium infiltrating immune cells and stromal cells in squamous cervical cancer (n = 160). Correlations with clinico-pathological parameters and survival were studied according to the REMARK recommendations. We additionally investigated whether the galectins were expressed by tumor cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and T cells. Galectin-1 and -9 were both expressed by tumor cells in 11% of samples, while 84% expressed galectin-3. Strong galectin-1 expression by tumor cells was an independent predictor for poor survival (hazard ratio: 8.02, p = 0.001) and correlated with increased tumor invasion (p = 0.032) and receiving post-operative radiotherapy (p = 0.020). Weak and positive tumor cell galectin-3 expression were correlated with increased and decreased tumor invasion, respectively (p = 0.012). Tumor cell expression of galectin-9 showed a trend toward improved survival (p = 0.087). The predominant immune cell type expressing galectin-1, -3 and -9 were CD163+ macrophages. Galectin-1 and -3 were expressed by a minor population of T cells. Galectin-1 was mainly expressed by fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. To conclude, while tumor cell expression of galectin-9 seemed to represent a beneficial response, galectin-1 expression might be used as a marker for a more aggressive anti-cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W648473017,"Drought and high salinity are environmental conditions that cause adverse effects on the growth and productivity of crops. Aquaporins are small integral membrane proteins that belong to the family of the major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), with members in animals, plants and microbes, where they facilitate the transport of water and/or small neutral solutes thereby affecting water balance. In this study we characterized two aquaporin genes namely, plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP2;7) and tonoplast intrinsic protein TIP1;3 from Jatropha curcas that are localised to the plasma membrane and vacuole respectively. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines over-expressing JcPIP2;7 and JcTIP1;3 under a constitutive promoter show improved germination under high salt and mannitol compared to control seeds. These transgenic plants also show increased root length under abiotic stress conditions compared to wild type Col-0 plants. Transgenic lines exposed to drought conditions by withholding water for 20 days, were able to withstand water stress and attained normal growth after re-watering unlike control plants which could not survive. Transgenic lines also had better seed yield than control under salt stress. Importantly, seed viability of transgenic plants grown under high salt concentration was 35%-45% compared to less than 5% for control seeds obtained from plants growing under salt stress. The effect of JcPIP2;7 and JcTIP1;3 on improving germination and seed viability in drought and salinity make these important candidates for genetic manipulation of plants for growth in saline soils."
https://openalex.org/W1954283419,"Recent advances in neuroscience and engineering have led to the development of technologies that permit the control of external devices through real-time decoding of brain activity (brain-machine interfaces; BMI). Though the feeling of controlling bodily movements (sense of agency; SOA) has been well studied and a number of well-defined sensorimotor and cognitive mechanisms have been put forth, very little is known about the SOA for BMI-actions. Using an on-line BMI, and verifying that our subjects achieved a reasonable level of control, we sought to describe the SOA for BMI-mediated actions. Our results demonstrate that discrepancies between decoded neural activity and its resultant real-time sensory feedback are associated with a decrease in the SOA, similar to SOA mechanisms proposed for bodily actions. However, if the feedback discrepancy serves to correct a poorly controlled BMI-action, then the SOA can be high and can increase with increasing discrepancy, demonstrating the dominance of visual feedback on the SOA. Taken together, our results suggest that bodily and BMI-actions rely on common mechanisms of sensorimotor integration for agency judgments, but that visual feedback dominates the SOA in the absence of overt bodily movements or proprioceptive feedback, however erroneous the visual feedback may be."
https://openalex.org/W1140886252,"The objective of this study was to map the spatial distribution of aboveground carbon stock (using Regression-kriging) of arboreal plants in the Atlantic Forest, Semi-arid woodland, and Savanna Biomes in Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. The database used in this study was obtained from 163 forest fragments, totaling 4,146 plots of 1,000 m2 distributed in these Biomes. A geographical model for carbon stock estimation was parameterized as a function of Biome, latitude and altitude. This model was applied over the samples and the residuals generated were mapped based on geostatistical procedures, selecting the exponential semivariogram theoretical model for conducting ordinary Kriging. The aboveground carbon stock was found to have a greater concentration in the north of the State, where the largest contingent of native vegetation is located, mainly the Savanna Biome, with Wooded Savanna and Shrub Savanna phytophysiognomes. The largest weighted averages of carbon stock per hectare were found in the south-center region (48.6 Mg/ha) and in the southern part of the eastern region (48.4 Mg/ha) of Minas Gerais State, due to the greatest predominance of Atlantic Forest Biome forest fragments. The smallest weighted averages per hectare were found in the central (21.2 Mg/ha), northern (20.4 Mg/ha), and northwestern (20.7 Mg/ha) regions of Minas Gerais State, where Savanna Biome fragments are predominant, in the phytophysiognomes Wooded Savanna and Shrub Savanna."
https://openalex.org/W1499316538,"To integrate immigrants into their societies, European countries have adopted different types of policies, which may influence health through both material and psychosocial determinants. Recent studies have suggested poorer health outcomes for immigrants living in countries with poorly rated integration policies.To analyse mortality differences of immigrants from the same country of origin living in countries with distinct integration policy contexts.From the mortality dataset collected in the Migrant Ethnic Health Observatory (MEHO) project, we chose the Netherlands (linked data from 1996-2006), France (unlinked; 2005-2007) and Denmark (linked; 1992-2001) as representatives of the inclusive, assimilationist and exclusionist policy models, respectively, based on the Migrant Integration Policy Index. We calculated for each country sex- and age-standardized mortality rates for Turkish-, Moroccan- and local-born populations aged 20-69 years. Poisson regression was used to estimate the mortality rate ratios (MRRs) for cross-country and within-country comparisons. The analyses were further stratified by age group and cause of death.Compared with their peers in the Netherlands, Turkish-born immigrants had higher all-cause mortality in Denmark (MRR men 1.92; 95% CI 1.74-2.13 and women 2.11; 1.80-2.47) but lower in France (men 0.64; 0.59-0.69 and women 0.58; 0.51-0.67). A similar pattern emerged for Moroccan-born immigrants. The relative differences between immigrants and the local-born population were also largest in Denmark and lowest in France (e.g., Turkish-born men MRR 1.52; 95% CI 1.38-1.67 and 0.62; 0.58-0.66, respectively). These patterns were consistent across all age groups, and more marked for cardiovascular diseases.Although confounders and data comparability issues (e.g., French cross-sectional data) may affect the findings, this study suggests that different macro-level policy contexts may influence immigrants' mortality. Comparable mortality registration systems across Europe along with detailed socio-demographic information on immigrants may help to better assess this association."
https://openalex.org/W2241780181,"DNA double-strand breaks can be eliminated via non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination. Non-homologous end joining is initiated by the association of Ku with DNA ends. In contrast, homologous recombination entails nucleolytic resection of the 5′-strands, forming 3′-ssDNA tails that become coated with replication protein A (RPA). Ku restricts end access by the resection nuclease Exo1. It is unclear how partial resection might affect Ku engagement and Exo1 restriction. Here, we addressed these questions in a reconstituted system with yeast proteins. With blunt-ended DNA, Ku protected against Exo1 in a manner that required its DNA end-binding activity. Despite binding poorly to ssDNA, Ku could nonetheless engage a 5′-recessed DNA end with a 40-nucleotide (nt) ssDNA overhang, where it localized to the ssDNA-dsDNA junction and efficiently blocked resection by Exo1. Interestingly, RPA could exclude Ku from a partially resected structure with a 22-nt ssDNA tail and thus restored processing by Exo1. However, at a 40-nt tail, Ku remained stably associated at the ssDNA-dsDNA junction, and RPA simultaneously engaged the ssDNA region. We discuss a model in which the dynamic equilibrium between Ku and RPA binding to a partially resected DNA end influences the timing and efficiency of the resection process.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 4The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakHRhomologous recombinationNHEJnon-homologous end joiningRPAreplication protein Antnucleotide(s). are induced by ionizing radiation and reactive oxygen species generated by cellular metabolism and also stem from DNA replication fork collapse. Failure to correctly repair DSBs may lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements, mutagenesis, and, ultimately, cancer (1Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. DNA double-strand breaks: signaling, repair and the cancer connection.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Two pathways exist for repairing DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ, in which the DSB ends are brought together, processed if necessary, and then religated, is initiated by the binding of Ku (a heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku80 proteins) (2Chiruvella K.K. Liang Z. Wilson T.E. Repair of double-strand breaks by end joining.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a012757Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Ku is a ring-shaped molecule that threads onto and encircles the DNA (3Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J.

Ku is thought to provide a recruitment platform for the DNA ligase IV complex (consisting of the Dnl4 and Lif1 proteins in yeast). NHEJ relies on microhomology in the DSB overhangs to guide the repair process (6Moore J.K. Haber J.E.

Mutations arise during NHEJ if these overhangs contain damaged or missing bases, and chromosome rearrangements, such as translocations, ensue upon the inadvertent joining of ends from different DSBs (7Wilson T.E.

HR in yeast cells is initiated when nucleases, including Mre11 (a member of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 or MRX complex), Exo1, and Dna2, resect the 5′-strand to create long ssDNA tails, which then become coated with replication protein A (RPA) (9Mimitou E.P.

Deletion of KU70 or overexpression of EXO1 also suppresses the lethality of sae2Δ sgs1Δ cells, but deletion of DNL4 does not. Thus, suppression occurs when the Ku-imposed block of Exo1 is relieved, but not because NHEJ is inhibited (22Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S.

HR occurs mostly with a sister chromatid, and DNA end resection is down-regulated in G1 but becomes fully active in S/G2 (14Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G.

In mammalian cells, NHEJ occurs in as little as 30 min, whereas HR can take up to 7 h to complete (31Mao Z. Bozzella M. Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. Comparison of nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination in human cells.DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). NHEJ takes longer at DSBs with damaged termini (32Shibata A. Conrad S. Birraux J. Geuting V. Barton O. Ismail A. Kakarougkas A. Meek K. Taucher-Scholz G. Löbrich M. Jeggo P.A.

The presence of ssDNA also affects how a DSB is repaired. The ssDNA content may be derived from proximal single-strand breaks that occur on opposite strands and can also be generated by limited resection. DSBs with short overhangs (<4 bases) are substrates for NHEJ, whereas longer overhangs (>10 bases) promote a single-strand annealing pathway that does not require Ku and is enhanced by Rad52 (8Daley J.M. Wilson T.E. Rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks as a function of overhang length.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated how ssDNA overhang length at a DSB affects the binding of yeast Ku and RPA and how it influences Exo1 access to the DNA end. We report that, although Ku bound poorly to ssDNA, it efficiently engaged a DNA junction with a ssDNA overhang as long as 40 nucleotides (nt) and was able to restrict Exo1 access to the junction. Unlike Ku, binding of RPA to a ssDNA tail did not affect Exo1 action at an adjoining DNA terminus. Interestingly, RPA could displace Ku from a structure harboring a 22-nt overhang, leading to restoration of end processing by Exo1. We discuss these findings within the context of understanding Ku-RPA interplay at a resected DNA end germane for the timing and efficiency of further resection. For yeast Ku expression, the coding regions of YKU70 and YKU80 were PCR-amplified using templates from the yeast ORF collection (Open Biosystems) and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI and EcoRI/SpeI sites of pESC-Ura (Agilent), placing the genes under the control of the GAL1 or GAL10 promoter, respectively. A FLAG tag was introduced to the C terminus of Yku80 to facilitate detection and purification. The yku70-R456E mutation was induced by site-directed mutagenesis. Ku and mutant Ku harboring the Yku70-R456E protein were expressed in the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464 (34Van Komen S. Macris M. Sehorn M.G. Sung P.

An overnight culture in glucose-containing medium lacking uracil was diluted 1:100 into 15 liters of raffinose medium lacking uracil. Cells were cultured at 30 °C until the A660 reached 0.8, at which time galactose was added to 2% to induce Ku expression for 12 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet (∼70 g) was stored at −80 °C. Subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. After cell disruption with dry ice in a coffee grinder (Krups), 70 ml of ice-cold buffer (40 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, 200 mm KCl, and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (American Bioanalytical) at 5 μg/ml each and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. The crude cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 45 min) and then loaded onto a 5-ml DEAE-Sepharose column. After washing the column with 50 ml of K buffer (20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% IGEPAL, and 1 mm DTT) containing 100 mm KCl, Ku was eluted with a 100-ml gradient from 100 to 500 mm KCl. The peak fractions were pooled and then incubated with 0.5 ml of anti-FLAG M2 resin for 2 h. The matrix was washed once with 20 ml of K buffer containing 500 mm KCl and 2 mm each ATP and MgCl2 and then washed three additional times with 10 ml of K buffer containing 500 mm KCl. The Ku complex was eluted by incubating the matrix with 1 ml of K buffer containing 500 mm KCl and 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h. The eluate was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column (24 ml). The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon microconcentrator. The purified Ku complex (∼ 500 μg) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. The RPA complex was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to a high degree according to a previously published procedure (35Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Recombination proteins in yeast.Annu. Rev.

Similarly, a bacmid for the expression of Exo1 was generated in DH10Bac E. coli cells (Invitrogen), after which a recombinant baculovirus was made for its expression in insect cells. It was purified to a high degree as reported previously (38Adkins N.L. Niu H. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Nucleosome dynamics regulates DNA processing.Nat. Struct. Mol.

To prepare the substrates, the PSOL8515 40-mer containing 3′-biotin (Integrated DNA Technologies) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). This was then annealed to a complementary strand by slow cooling over a period of 3 h in a model PTC-200 thermocycler (Bio-Rad). Substrates were purified by 10% native PAGE in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer. The corresponding gel bands were excised, and the DNA was electroeluted. The eluate was further concentrated using an Amicon microconcentrator and stored at −20 °C. To block the biotinylated DNA end, substrates (400 nm) were incubated in a 12-μl reaction (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing 2 μm streptavidin (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 20 °C.

Ku and/or RPA was preincubated with the indicated DNA substrate for 10 min at 30 °C, and the indicated amount of Exo1 was then added, followed by a 5-min incubation at 30 °C. After deproteinizing the reaction with 0.2% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 5 min at 37 °C, it was analyzed on a native 10% polyacrylamide gel run in TBE buffer and then analyzed as described above. The reaction (10 μl) was assembled in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2. Ku was incubated with the DNA substrate for 10 min at 30 °C before adding DNase I (50 pg), followed by an additional 3-min incubation at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling in formamide loading dye, followed by analysis on a denaturing TBE-15% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel, which was dried and analyzed as described above. The human Ku complex binds with high affinity to DNA ends in a sequence-independent manner (39Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Interaction of Ku protein and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit with nucleic acids.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Within the context of DSB repair, Ku binding has been assessed with DNA containing either blunt ends or short ssDNA overhangs in the range of 4–18 nt, and the function of Ku at telomeres has been studied using DNA containing an overhang of up to 15 nt (40Wu T.J. Chiang Y.H. Lin Y.C. Tsai C.R. Yu T.Y. Sung M.T. Lee Y.H. Lin J.J. Sequential loading of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku and Cdc13p to telomeres.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The effect of appending a longer overhang on DSB engagement by Ku has not been investigated. To accomplish this goal, yeast Ku was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Importantly, purified Ku could shift a 40-nt ssDNA fragment. A smear was observed, with an additional shifted band emerging at 2.5 Ku molecules/ssDNA strand (Fig. 1B). Ku was then tested with a 40-mer duplex obtained by hybridizing the 40-nt ssDNA to its complement. Consistent with previous data (40Wu T.J. Chiang Y.H. Lin Y.C. Tsai C.R. Yu T.Y. Sung M.T. Lee Y.H.

Ku must load directly onto the chromosome end in order to mediate its telomeric functions.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7e1002233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Ku bound the duplex DNA more efficiently, with the substrate fully shifted at 1.25 Ku molecules/DNA substrate (Fig. 1C). Ku binding to the DNA duplex produced two shifted bands, reflecting engagement of both DNA ends in the duplex (Fig. 1C). Titration of Ku into a mixture of dsDNA and ssDNA showed that it bound dsDNA prior to shifting the ssDNA (Fig. 1D). Thus, although Ku is able to bind ssDNA, it preferentially engages dsDNA (42Rathmell W.K. Chu G. A DNA end-binding factor involved in double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To investigate the stability of Ku binding to ssDNA, unlabeled 40-mer dsDNA was introduced into a reaction with Ku having been preloaded onto the radiolabeled ssDNA (Fig. 1E). After a 10-min incubation, most of the bound ssDNA was released upon adding an equimolar amount of the unlabeled blunt-ended duplex (Fig. 1E, lane 4), with ∼90% release seen at a 2-fold excess of the competitor (lane 5). We verified that the reaction had reached equilibrium at this time point (data not shown). These results indicate that engagement of ssDNA by Ku is dynamic. Given that Ku has affinity for hairpin structures (43Paillard S. Strauss F. Analysis of the mechanism of interaction of simian Ku protein with DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 44Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that it might specifically associate with secondary structure in the ssDNA substrate. To test this idea, we monitored Ku binding to oligo(dT)40, which lacks secondary structure character (Fig. 2A). Indeed, Ku bound the oligo(dT)40 substrate less efficiently than did the ssDNA with random nucleotide content (compare Figs. 2A and 1B), suggesting that secondary structure can contribute to Ku binding to ssDNA. To investigate this further, a nucleoprotein complex of Ku and radiolabeled ssDNA was assembled and then challenged with unlabeled oligo(dT)40 (Fig. 2B). Importantly, oligo(dT)40, even at four times the concentration of the ssDNA, could not compete Ku off the latter (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Thus, it appears that Ku has only a low affinity for ssDNA, but the presence of secondary structure in the DNA leads to an enhancement of this affinity (43Paillard S. Strauss F. Analysis of the mechanism of interaction of simian Ku protein with DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 44Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L.

To test whether Ku can stably engage duplex DNA that harbors an adjoining ssDNA region, we generated a 40-bp substrate with one blunt end and a 5′-recessed end with a 22-nt ssDNA tail. Ku produced two shifted species with this substrate (Fig. 2C), just as it did with the substrate with two blunt ends (Fig. 1C). This observation suggested the possibility that Ku"

Genetic missense mutations in SID-1 ECD causal for deficient systemic RNAi resulted in significant reduction in its affinity for dsRNA. Furthermore, full-length proteins with these mutations decrease SID-1-mediated RNA transport efficiency, providing evidence that dsRNA binding to SID-1 ECD is related to RNA transport. To examine the functional similarity of mammalian homologs of SID-1 (SIDT1 and SIDT2), we expressed and purified mouse SIDT1 and SIDT2 ECDs.

https://openalex.org/W596673902,"Channid fishes, commonly referred to as “snakeheads”, are currently very important in Asian fishery and aquaculture due to the substantial decline in natural populations because of overexploitation. A large degree of chromosomal variation has been found in this family, mainly through the use of conventional cytogenetic investigations. In this study, we analyzed the karyotype structure and the distribution of 7 repetitive DNA sequences in several Channa species from different Thailand river basins. The aim of this study was to investigate the chromosomal differentiation among species and populations to improve upon the knowledge of its biodiversity and evolutionary history. Rearrangements, such as pericentric inversions, fusions and polyploidization, appear to be important events during the karyotypic evolution of this genus, resulting in the chromosomal diversity observed among the distinct species and even among populations of the same species. In addition, such variability is also increased by the genomic dynamism of repetitive elements, particularly by the differential distribution and accumulation of rDNA sequences on chromosomes. This marked diversity is likely linked to the lifestyle of the snakehead fishes and their population fragmentation, as already identified for other fish species. The karyotypic features highlight the biodiversity of the channid fishes and justify a taxonomic revision of the genus Channa, as well as of the Channidae family as a whole, as some nominal species may actually constitute species complexes."

We tested the impact of intensive handwashing promotion on household transmission of influenza-like illness and influenza in rural Bangladesh. Methods In 2009–10, we identified index case-patients with influenza-like illness (fever with cough or sore throat) who were the only symptomatic person in their household. Household compounds of index case-patients were randomized to control or intervention (soap and daily handwashing promotion). We conducted daily surveillance and collected oropharyngeal specimens. Secondary attack ratios (SAR) were calculated for influenza and ILI in each arm. Among controls, we investigated individual risk factors for ILI among household contacts of index case-patients. Results Among 377 index case-patients, the mean number of days between fever onset and study enrollment was 2.1 (SD 1.7) among the 184 controls and 2.6 (SD 2.9) among 193 intervention case-patients. Influenza infection was confirmed in 20% of controls and 12% of intervention index case-patients. The SAR for influenza-like illness among household contacts was 9.5% among intervention (158/1661) and 7.7% among control households (115/1498) (SAR ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.92–1.65). The SAR ratio for influenza was 2.40 (95% CI 0.68–8.47). In the control arm, susceptible contacts <2 years old (RRadj 5.51, 95% CI 3.43–8.85), those living with an index case-patient enrolled ≤24 hours after symptom onset (RRadj 1.91, 95% CI 1.18–3.10), and those who reported multiple daily interactions with the index case-patient (RRadj 1.94, 95% CI 1.71–3.26) were at increased risk of influenza-like illness. Discussion Handwashing promotion initiated after illness onset in a household member did not protect against influenza-like illness or influenza. Behavior may not have changed rapidly enough to curb transmission between household members. A reactive approach to reduce household influenza transmission through handwashing promotion may be ineffective in the context of rural Bangladesh. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00880659"

The maturation and differentiation of tissue macrophages depends upon interactions between colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and its ligands. There remains, however, a lack of consistent information on CSF1R expression in TAMs. A new monoclonal antibody, FER216, was generated to investigate CSF1R protein distribution in formalin fixed tissue samples from 24 reactive lymphoid tissues and 187 different lymphoma types. We also analysed the distribution of CSF1R+, CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages by double immunostaining, and studied the relationship between CSF1R expression and survival in an independent series of 249 cHL patients. CSF1R+ TAMs were less frequent in B-cell lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoblastic B-cell lymphoma than in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and cHL. HRS cells in cHL and, with the exception of three cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, the neoplastic cells in NHLs, lacked detectable CSF1R protein. A CSF1R+ enriched microenvironment in cHL was associated with shorter survival in an independent series of 249 cHL patients. CSF1R pathway activation was evident in the cHL and inactivation of this pathway could be a potential therapeutic target in cHL cases."
https://openalex.org/W1567040018,"Vegetation clutter is a limiting factor for bats that forage near ground level, and may determine the distribution of species and guilds. However, many studies that evaluated the effects of vegetation clutter on bats have used qualitative descriptions rather than direct measurements of vegetation density. Moreover, few studies have evaluated the effect of vegetation clutter on a regional scale. Here, we evaluate the influence of the physical obstruction of vegetation on phyllostomid-bat assemblages along a 520 km transect in continuous Amazonian forest. We sampled bats using mist nets in eight localities during 80 nights (3840 net-hours) and estimated the ground-vegetation density with digital photographs. The total number of species, number of animalivorous species, total number of frugivorous species, number of understory frugivorous species, and abundance of canopy frugivorous bats were negatively associated with vegetation clutter. The bat assemblages showed a nested structure in relation to degree of clutter, with animalivorous and understory frugivorous bats distributed throughout the vegetation-clutter gradient, while canopy frugivores were restricted to sites with more open vegetation. The species distribution along the gradient of vegetation clutter was not closely associated with wing morphology, but aspect ratio and wing load differed between frugivores and animalivores. Vegetation structure plays an important role in structuring assemblages of the bats at the regional scale by increasing beta diversity between sites. Differences in foraging strategy and diet of the guilds seem to have contributed more to the spatial distribution of bats than the wing characteristics of the species alone."
https://openalex.org/W577479973,"One of the generally recognized factors contributing to the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) is structural remodeling of the myocardium that affects both atrial cardiomyocytes as well as interstitium. The goal of this study was to characterize morphologically and functionally interstitium of atria in patients with AF or in sinus rhythm (SR) who were indicated to heart surgery. Patient population consisted of 46 subjects (19 with long-term persistent AF, and 27 in SR) undergoing coronary bypass or valve surgery. Peroperative bioptic samples of the left and the right atria were examined using immunohistochemistry to visualize and quantify collagen I, collagen III, elastin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, endothelium and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The content of interstitial elastin, collagen I, and collagen III in atrial tissue was similar in AF and SR groups. However, the right atrium was more than twofold more abundant in elastin as compared with the left atrium and similar difference was found for collagen I and III. The right atrium showed also higher VEGF expression and lower microvascular density as compared to the left atrium. No significant changes in atrial extracellular matrix fiber content, microvascular density and angiogenic signaling, attributable to AF, were found in this cohort of patients with structural heart disease. This finding suggests that interstitial fibrosis and other morphological changes in atrial tissue are rather linked to structural heart disease than to AF per se. Significant regional differences in interstitial structure between right and left atrium is a novel observation that deserves further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1957224860,"C3 exoenzyme is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) that catalyzes transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety from NAD+ to Rho GTPases. C3 has long been used to study the diverse regulatory functions of Rho GTPases. How C3 recognizes its substrate and how ADP-ribosylation proceeds are still poorly understood. Crystal structures of C3-RhoA complex reveal that C3 recognizes RhoA via the switch I, switch II, and interswitch regions. In C3-RhoA(GTP) and C3-RhoA(GDP), switch I and II adopt the GDP and GTP conformations, respectively, which explains why C3 can ADP-ribosylate both nucleotide forms. Based on structural information, we successfully changed Cdc42 to an active substrate with combined mutations in the C3-Rho GTPase interface. Moreover, the structure reflects the close relationship among Gln-183 in the QXE motif (C3), a modified Asn-41 residue (RhoA) and NC1 of NAD(H), which suggests that C3 is the prototype ART. These structures show directly for the first time that the ARTT loop is the key to target protein recognition, and they also serve to bridge the gaps among independent studies of Rho GTPases and C3.

C3 has long been used to study the diverse regulatory functions of Rho GTPases. How C3 recognizes its substrate and how ADP-ribosylation proceeds are still poorly understood. Crystal structures of C3-RhoA complex reveal that C3 recognizes RhoA via the switch I, switch II, and interswitch regions. In C3-RhoA(GTP) and C3-RhoA(GDP), switch I and II adopt the GDP and GTP conformations, respectively, which explains why C3 can ADP-ribosylate both nucleotide forms. Based on structural information, we successfully changed Cdc42 to an active substrate with combined mutations in the C3-Rho GTPase interface. Moreover, the structure reflects the close relationship among Gln-183 in the QXE motif (C3), a modified Asn-41 residue (RhoA) and NC1 of NAD(H), which suggests that C3 is the prototype ART. These structures show directly for the first time that the ARTT loop is the key to target protein recognition, and they also serve to bridge the gaps among independent studies of Rho GTPases and C3. Rho GTPases (∼20 kDa) are key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics, affecting such processes as morphogenesis, cell migration, neuronal development, and cell division and adhesion (1Heasman S.J.

The switching mechanism is thought to be mediated by conformational changes in two switch regions (I and II).

ADP-ribosylation is an important post-translational protein modification known to be catalyzed by bacterial toxins as well as eukaryotic endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs). Based on their target specificity, bacterial ARTs are traditionally classified into several types.

This C3-induced sequestration most likely blocks Rho-dependent signaling (31Aktories K. Wilde C. Vogelsgesang M. Rho-modifying C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The first structural details of a C3-like ART were obtained from C3bot1 in a NAD+-free state using x-ray crystallography (10Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A.

This finding has prompted the examination of the conformation and significance of the ARTT loop within the NAD+-bound and -free structures of C3 (33Ménétrey J. Flatau G. Stura E.A. Charbonnier J.B.

However, recognition of RhoA by the ARTT loop has never been directly verified, because the structure of a C3-like ART in complex with a protein substrate has never been determined. On the other hand, several RhoA amino acid residues involved in recognition by C3bot have been identified through mutational analysis (35Wilde C. Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. Recognition of RhoA by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The complex structure C3-RhoA is a long sought after piece of this C3 field study. How C3-like ART recognizes Rho GTPase and how the ADP-ribosylation of asparagine occurs are major issues to be addressed. Here we have reported the crystal structures of apo(NAD+-free)-C3-RhoA(GTP), NADH-C3-RhoA(GTP), and NADH-C3-RhoA(GDP). These structures provide the first direct evidence that the ARTT loop is essential for target protein recognition and not only explain the recognition between C3 and RhoA but also provide insight into the asparagine ART reaction. His-tagged C3cer (UniProt ID: Q8KNY0) was designed and subcloned into the pRham vector, after which the plasmid was transformed into DH10B cells using electroporation. Cells containing pRham-C3cer plasmid were selected on LB agar plates containing kanamycin. A single colony was inoculated into 1.5 liters of LB medium (containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 0.2% rhamnose, and 0.05% glucose) and cultured overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were later thawed, resuspended with 50 ml of buffer CA (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole), disrupted using a French press, and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 40 min. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column. After washing the column with buffer CA to remove the unbound residues, the His-tagged sample was eluted using buffer CB (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole). The His tag was then cleaved using His-tagged TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease overnight at 10 °C. The resultant mixture was concentrated, and the buffer in the mixture was exchanged for buffer CA without imidazole using an Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore). To remove the His tag and His-tagged TEV protease, the sample was run on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, after which the concentrated sample was loaded onto a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with buffer CC (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl). The C3cer fractions were collected and concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. The C-terminal 14 residues of RhoA (UniProt ID: P61586) were truncated, and Phe25 was substituted with Asn as described elsewhere (36Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z.

Truncated and mutated RhoA was subcloned into the pGEX 4T-1 vector, after which the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells using heat shock. Cells containing pGEX 4T-1-RhoA plasmid were selected on LB agar plates containing ampicillin, and a single colony was inoculated into a small volume of LB medium and precultured overnight at 37 °C. The preculture was transferred into 1.5 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. After inducing expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, the culture was incubated for an additional 22 h at 20 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were later thawed, resuspended with 50 ml of buffer RA (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT) containing complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science), passed through a French press, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare), which was then washed with buffer RA to remove the unbound residues. The GST tag was cleaved in buffer RA containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 350 units of thrombin for 18 h at room temperature on the Sepharose 4B column. The sample and the thrombin mixture were then eluted and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra filter, after which the concentrated mixture was loaded onto a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column and eluted with buffer RC (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). RhoA fractions were collected, concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. Cdc42 (UniProt ID: P60953-1) in which the C-terminal 14 residues were truncated was subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 vector, after which the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells using heat shock. Protein expression was the same as described in RhoA. RhoA and Cdc42 mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a PrimeSTAR mutagenesis basal kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein expression was the same as described for RhoA. To obtain apo-C3cer-RhoA crystals, C3cer and RhoA samples were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio before the addition of GTPγS or GDP to a final concentration of 1 mm. Crystallization was carried out using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against a reservoir solution containing 100 mm MES (pH 6.4) and 20% PEG 1500 at 4 °C. The drop was composed of equal volumes of the protein and reservoir solutions. In 4 to 6 weeks, rod-like crystals appeared in a cluster for both C3cer-RhoA(GTP) and C3cer-RhoA(GDP). NADH cannot be an ADP-ribosylation substrate of C3. To obtain crystals of the NADH-bound C3cer-RhoA(GTP or GDP) complex, a small portion of the clustered crystals was soaked in buffer containing 10 mm NADH with 30% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant for 1 h at 4 °C. The crystals were plunged into a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. Data collection for the apo- and NADH-soaked C3cer-RhoA(GDP) was performed at 100 K using an x-ray wavelength of 1.0 Å with an ADSC Quantum 210r detector system on beamlines BL-5A and AR-NW12A, respectively, at the KEK Photon Factory. The data for NADH-soaked C3cer-RhoA(GTP) were collected in-house using an x-ray wavelength of 1.54 Å with a MicroMax-007 HF generator and RAXISVII (Rigaku). A total of 360 frames of each of the data sets were collected for each crystal with 0.5° oscillations. The best data set was collected at 1.8 Å for apo-C3cer-RhoA(GTP). The datasets of NADH-C3cer-RhoA(GTP) and NADH-C3cer-RhoA(GDP) were collected at 2.5 Å, respectively. The diffraction images for all crystals were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL2000 suite (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The space group for all crystals was P32, and the asymmetric unit contained one C3cer and one RhoA(GTP or GDP).

For both NADH-bound C3cer-RhoA(GTP) and NADH-bound C3cer-RhoA(GDP), using the resolved apostructure served as the template, and the structures were determined and improved using the same methods used for the apostructure. The final model statistics for all structures are summarized in Table 1. The crystal assay was conducted as follows. Crystals of the C3-RhoA complex were washed with mother liquor twice. Biotin-NAD+ (50 μm) was then added to the mother liquor containing the C3-RhoA complex, and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 4 h. These samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was washed twice with PBS, stained with streptavidin-FITC (250 nm) overnight, washed twice with PBS again, and scanned using a Typhoon FLA9000 laser scanner (General Electric). The solution assay was conducted as follows. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, C3cer (0.3 μm) and GST-RhoA (3 μm) or C3cer (0.3 μm) and non-tagged RhoA (3 μm) were mixed together in buffer RC. In the mutational experiment (Fig. 5), C3cer (0.03 μm) and GST-RhoA (3 μm) or C3cer (0.3 μm) and GST-Cdc42 (mutants) (3 μm) were mixed together in buffer RC. Biotin-NAD+ (3.5 μm) was then added to the mixture, which was kept at 37 °C for 10 min. Thereafter, the same protocol used for the crystal assay was applied.FIGURE 5.ADP-ribosylation of RhoA and Cdc42 mutants by C3cer A, ADP-ribosylation of RhoA single point mutations.

The structure of C3cer is unknown, but its sequence shows identity with C3bot1 (38%), C3bot2 (36%), C3lim (36%), C3stau1 (29%), and C3stau2 (29%) (Fig. 1A). To investigate how C3cer recognizes RhoA, we determined the crystal structure of apo(NAD+-free)-C3cer complexed with human RhoA(GTP) at 1.8 Å resolution (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Then, by soaking the apo-C3-RhoA(GTP) crystal with NADH, we obtained the structure of NADH-bound C3-RhoA(GTP) at 2.5 Å resolution (Fig. 2B). Using the same approach with C3-RhoA(GDP), we obtained the structure of NADH-C3-RhoA(GDP) at 2.5 Å resolution (Fig. 2C). The overall structure of C3cer is similar to those of other C3 exoenzymes (i.e. a mixed α/β-fold with a β-sandwich core). Structural alignment of C3cer with C3bot1 shows that the main differences are restricted to two 310-helices in C3cer (Fig. 1A). There was no large conformational change between apo-C3-RhoA(GTP) and NADH-C3-RhoA(GTP), except in the phosphate nicotinamide (PN) loop, which is one of the RhoA binding regions. Only in the PN loop, which includes Tyr-151, does a large conformational change from the apo to the NADH structure occur.

Mice with subcutaneous Ramos xenografts were treated with different activities of 177Lu-HH1, 177Lu-DOTA-rituximab (177Lu-rituximab) and non-specific 177Lu-DOTA-IgG1 (177Lu-IgG1) and therapeutic effect and toxicity of the treatment were monitored. Significant tumor growth delay and increased survival of mice were observed in mice treated with 530 MBq/kg 177Lu-HH1 as compared with mice treated with similar activities of 177Lu-rituximab or non-specific 177Lu-IgG1, 0.9% NaCl or unlabeled HH1. All mice injected with 530 MBq/kg of 177Lu-HH1 tolerated the treatment well. In contrast, 6 out of 10 mice treated with 530 MBq/kg 177Lu-rituximab experienced severe radiation toxicity. The retention of 177Lu-rituximab in organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system was longer than for 177Lu-HH1, which explains the higher toxicity observed in mice treated with 177Lu-rituximab. In vitro internalization studies showed that 177Lu-HH1 internalizes faster and to a higher extent than 177Lu-rituximab which might be the reason for the better therapeutic effect of 177Lu-HH1."
https://openalex.org/W1201021488,"Although acupuncture is widely used to manage pain, it remains highly controversial, largely due to the lack of a clear mechanism for its benefits. Here, we investigated the role of IL-33, a novel interleukin (IL)-1 family member, and its receptor ST2 in the analgesic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on formalin-induced inflammatory pain. The results showed that 1) EA stimulation of ipsilateral Zusanli (ST 36) and Yanglingquan (GB 34) acupoints for 30 min remarkably suppressed the two phases of formalin-induced spontaneous pain; 2) subcutaneous or intrathecal administration of recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) significantly inhibited the analgesic effect of EA, whereas the ST2 antibody potentiated EA analgesia in formalin mice; 3) EA treatment decreased the up-regulation of IL-33 and ST2 protein following formalin injection; and 4) the suppression of the formalin-induced expression of spinal phosphorylated ERK and JNK induced by EA treatment was significantly attenuated following subcutaneous rIL-33 delivery, and was further decreased by the ST2 antibody. These data suggest that EA alleviates formalin-induced inflammatory pain, at least partially, by inhibiting of spinal IL-33/ST2 signaling and the downstream ERK and JNK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1512883065,"Access to clean water is a grand challenge in the 21st century. Water safety testing for pathogens currently depends on surrogate measures such as fecal indicator bacteria (e.g., E. coli). Metagenomics concerns high-throughput, culture-independent, unbiased shotgun sequencing of DNA from environmental samples that might transform water safety by detecting waterborne pathogens directly instead of their surrogates. Yet emerging innovations such as metagenomics are often fiercely contested. Innovations are subject to shaping/construction not only by technology but also social systems/values in which they are embedded, such as experts' attitudes towards new scientific evidence. We conducted a classic three-round Delphi survey, comprised of 107 questions. A multidisciplinary expert panel (n = 24) representing the continuum of discovery scientists and policymakers evaluated the emergence of metagenomics tests. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first Delphi foresight study of experts' attitudes on (1) the top 10 priority evidentiary criteria for adoption of metagenomics tests for water safety, (2) the specific issues critical to governance of metagenomics innovation trajectory where there is consensus or dissensus among experts, (3) the anticipated time lapse from discovery to practice of metagenomics tests, and (4) the role and timing of public engagement in development of metagenomics tests. The ability of a test to distinguish between harmful and benign waterborne organisms, analytical/clinical sensitivity, and reproducibility were the top three evidentiary criteria for adoption of metagenomics. Experts agree that metagenomic testing will provide novel information but there is dissensus on whether metagenomics will replace the current water safety testing methods or impact the public health end points (e.g., reduction in boil water advisories). Interestingly, experts view the publics relevant in a ""downstream capacity"" for adoption of metagenomics rather than a co-productionist role at the ""upstream"" scientific design stage of metagenomics tests. In summary, these findings offer strategic foresight to govern metagenomics innovations symmetrically: by identifying areas where acceleration (e.g., consensus areas) and deceleration/reconsideration (e.g., dissensus areas) of the innovation trajectory might be warranted. Additionally, we show how scientific evidence is subject to potential social construction by experts' value systems and the need for greater upstream public engagement on metagenomics innovations."

Recent evidence suggests that this mechanism may be implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the role of airway surface dehydration in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD remains unknown.We aimed to investigate in vivo the effect of airway surface dehydration on several CS-induced hallmarks of COPD in mice with airway-specific overexpression of the β-subunit of the epithelial Na⁺ channel (βENaC).βENaC-Tg mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to air or CS for 4 or 8 weeks. Pathological hallmarks of COPD, including goblet cell metaplasia, mucin expression, pulmonary inflammation, lymphoid follicles, emphysema and airway wall remodelling were determined and lung function was measured.Airway surface dehydration in βENaC-Tg mice aggravated CS-induced airway inflammation, mucin expression and destruction of alveolar walls and accelerated the formation of pulmonary lymphoid follicles. Moreover, lung function measurements demonstrated an increased compliance and total lung capacity and a lower resistance and hysteresis in βENaC-Tg mice, compared to WT mice. CS exposure further altered lung function measurements.We conclude that airway surface dehydration is a risk factor that aggravates CS-induced hallmarks of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W1562144731,"An intermediate spatiotemporal scale of food procurement by large herbivores is evident within annual or seasonal home ranges. It takes the form of settlement periods spanning several days or weeks during which foraging activity is confined to spatially discrete foraging arenas, separated by roaming interludes. Extended by areas occupied for other activities, these foraging arenas contribute towards generating the home range structure. We delineated and compared the foraging arenas exploited by two African large herbivores, sable antelope (a ruminant) and plains zebra (a non-ruminant), using GPS-derived movement data. We developed a novel approach to specifically delineate foraging arenas based on local change points in distance relative to adjoining clusters of locations, and compared its output with modifications of two published methods developed for home range estimation and residence time estimation respectively. We compared how these herbivore species responded to seasonal variation in food resources and how they differed in their spatial patterns of resource utilization. Sable antelope herds tended to concentrate their space use locally, while zebra herds moved more opportunistically over a wider set of foraging arenas. The amalgamated extent of the foraging arenas exploited by sable herds amounted to 12-30 km2, compared with 22-100 km2 for the zebra herds. Half-day displacement distances differed between settlement periods and roaming interludes, and zebra herds generally shifted further over 12h than sable herds. Foraging arenas of sable herds tended to be smaller than those of zebra, and were occupied for period twice as long, and hence exploited more intensively in days spent per unit area than the foraging arenas of zebra. For sable both the intensity of utilization of foraging arenas and proportion of days spent in foraging arenas relative to roaming interludes declined as food resources diminished seasonally, while zebra showed no seasonal variation in these metrics. Identifying patterns of space use at foraging arena scale helps reveal mechanisms generating the home range extent, and in turn the local population density. Thereby it helps forge links between behavioural ecology, movement ecology and population ecology."
https://openalex.org/W1506897152,"Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) is widely present in China, Japan, and Korea. Its green pine leaves have traditionally been used as a food as well as a coloring agent. After being shed, pine leaves change their color from green to brown within two years, and although the brown pine leaves are abundantly available, their value has not been closely assessed. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-photoaging properties of brown pine leaves for skin. Brown pine leaf extract (BPLE) inhibited UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression to a greater extent than pine leaf extract (PLE) in human keratinocytes and a human skin equivalent model. HPLC analysis revealed that the quantity of trans-communic acid (TCA) and dehydroabietic acid (DAA) significantly increases when the pine leaf color changes from green to brown. BPLE and TCA elicited reductions in UVB-induced MMP-1 mRNA expression and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transactivation by reducing DNA binding activity of phospho-c-Jun, c-fos and Fra-1. BPLE and TCA also inhibited UVB-induced Akt phosphorylation, but not mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), known regulators of AP-1 transactivation. We additionally found that BPLE and TCA inhibited phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the upstream kinase of Akt, in vitro. In summary, both BPLE and its active component TCA exhibit protective effects against UVB-induced skin aging. Taken together, these findings underline the potential for BPLE and TCA to be utilized as anti-wrinkling agents and cosmetic ingredients, as they suppress UVB-induced MMP-1 expression."

The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of tobacco consumption in Spain and the profile of smokers before (2006) and after (2011) the comprehensive smoking ban passed in 2010. Methods Two independent, cross-sectional, population-based surveys were carried out among the adult (≥ 18 years old) Spanish population in 2006 and 2011 through telephone interviews. Both surveys used the same methods and questionnaire. Nicotine dependence was assessed with the Fagerström Test for nicotine dependence and readiness to quit according to the stages of change. Results The prevalence of tobacco consumption showed a nonsignificant decrease from 23.4% in 2006 to 20.7% in 2011. No changes were observed in nicotine dependence or readiness to quit. In 2011, most smokers (76%) showed low nicotine dependence and were mainly in the precontemplation stage (72%). Conclusions The prevalence of smokers has slightly decreased since the introduction of the total smoking ban in Spain. No differences were found in nicotine dependence or readiness to quit."

Seventy-seven patients with 92 HCCs were observed for >6 months. Sixty-four and 13 patients belonged to Child-Pugh class A and B, respectively. The median SBRT dose was 48 Gy/4fr. Dynamic CT scans were performed in non-enhanced, arterial, portal, and venous phases. The median follow-up period was 18 months. Dynamic CT appearances were classified into 3 types: type 1, hyperdensity in all enhanced phases; type 2, hypodensity in arterial and portal phases; type 3, isodensity in all enhanced phases. Half of the type 2 or 3 appearances significantly changed to type 1, particularly in patients belonging to Child-Pugh class A. After 3-6 months, Child-Pugh class B was a significant factor in type 3 patients. Thus, dynamic CT appearances were classified into 3 patterns and significantly changed over time into the enhancement group (type 1) in most patients belonging to Child-Pugh class A. Child-Pugh class B was a significant factor in the non-enhancement group (type 3)."
https://openalex.org/W1779153434,"The complement, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems are crucial for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. To date numerous interactions and cross-talks have been identified between these cascades. In line with this, here we propose a novel, hitherto unknown interaction between the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and plasminogen of the fibrinolytic pathway. Binding of C4BP to Streptococcus pneumoniae is a known virulence mechanism of this pathogen and it was increased in the presence of plasminogen. Interestingly, the acute phase variant of C4BP lacking the β-chain and protein S binds plasminogen much stronger than the main isoform containing the β-chain and protein S. Indeed, the complement control protein (CCP) 8 domain of C4BP, which would otherwise be sterically hindered by the β-chain, primarily mediates this interaction. Moreover, the lysine-binding sites in plasminogen kringle domains facilitate the C4BP-plasminogen interaction. Furthermore, C4BP readily forms complexes with plasminogen in fluid phase and such complexes are present in human serum and plasma. Importantly, whereas the presence of plasminogen did not affect the factor I cofactor activity of C4BP, the activation of plasminogen by urokinase-type plasminogen activator to active plasmin was significantly augmented in the presence of C4BP. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel interaction between two proteins of the complement and fibrinolytic system.

Ten C57/black male mice (age range: 7-8 weeks) were imaged with high-frequency Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Angiography and ex-vivo Microcomputed tomography of the head and neck. Under general anesthesia, Ultrasound of neck veins was performed with a 20 MHz transducer; head and neck Magnetic Resonance Angiography data were collected on 9.4 T or 7 T scanners, and ex-vivo Microcomputed tomography angiography was obtained by filling the vessels with a radiopaque inert silicone rubber compound. All procedures were approved by the local ethical committee. The dorsal intracranial venous system is quite similar in mice and humans. Instead, the mouse Internal Jugular Veins are tiny vessels receiving the sigmoid sinuses and tributaries from cerebellum, occipital lobe and midbrain, while the majority of the cerebral blood, i.e. from the olfactory bulbs and fronto-parietal lobes, is apparently drained through skull base connections into the External Jugular Vein. Three main intra-extracranial anastomoses, absent in humans, are: 1) the petrosquamous sinus, draining into the posterior facial vein, 2) the veins of the olfactory bulb, draining into the superficial temporal vein through a foramen of the frontal bone 3) the cavernous sinus, draining in the External Jugular Vein through a foramen of the sphenoid bone.

Twenty-two MDS and 10 other myeloid neoplasms carrying +8 were studied. Trisomy 8 was determined in peripheral blood by conventional cytogenetics (CC) and on granulocytes, CD3+ lymphocytes and oral mucosa cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In peripheral blood CC, +8 was seen in 4/32 patients. By FISH, only one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia showed +8 in all cell samples and was interpreted as a cT8M.

We evaluated the accuracy of two devices for bedside point-of-care blood glucose measurements using arterial, fingerstick and catheter venous blood samples in ICU patients, and assessed which factors could impair their accuracy.145 patients from a 41-bed adult mixed-ICU, in a tertiary care hospital were prospectively enrolled. Fingerstick, central venous (catheter) and arterial blood (indwelling catheter) samples were simultaneously collected, once per patient. Arterial measurements obtained with Precision PCx, and arterial, fingerstick and venous measurements obtained with Accu-chek Advantage II were compared to arterial central lab measurements. Agreement between point-of-care and laboratory measurements were evaluated with Bland-Altman, and multiple linear regression models were used to investigate interference of associated factors.Mean difference between Accu-chek arterial samples versus central lab was 10.7 mg/dL (95% LA -21.3 to 42.7 mg/dL), and between Precision PCx versus central lab was 18.6 mg/dL (95% LA -12.6 to 49.5 mg/dL). Accu-chek fingerstick versus central lab arterial samples presented a similar bias (10.0 mg/dL) but a wider 95% LA (-31.8 to 51.8 mg/dL). Agreement between venous samples with arterial central lab was the poorest (mean bias 15.1 mg/dL; 95% LA -51.7 to 81.9). Hyperglycemia, low hematocrit, and acidosis were associated with larger differences between arterial and venous blood measurements with the two glucometers and central lab. Vasopressor administration was associated with increased error for fingerstick measurements.Sampling from central venous catheters should not be used for glycemic control in ICU patients. In addition, reliability of the two evaluated glucometers was insufficient. Error with Accu-chek Advantage II increases mostly with central venous samples. Hyperglycemia, lower hematocrit, acidosis, and vasopressor administration increase measurement error."

Enterobacteria were expected to be present, but no specific studies had ever confirmed this prediction. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the total coliforms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. in hyporheic water and to determine the relationship of the physical, chemical and environmental factors at different depths in a rainforest stream. To this end, thirty-six water samples were collected at three depths in sites located in the first, second and third orders in diverse substrates. The total coliforms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were evaluated in terms of their CFU/ml. In the interstitial samples, coliforms were detected in 100% of the samples. The total coliform counts had higher values at intermediate depths, while E. coli and Salmonella spp. instead had higher values at intermediate and large depths, often reaching or exceeding the values of the surface samples. Our results revealed that Salmonella spp. and the coliforms have different microhabitat preferences. Salmonella spp. and coliform species prefer deposition areas, such as lateral sides of pools, curves and bars, but they have a tendency to distribute into different depths, likely due to temperature differences. Salmonella spp. prefer compact substrata, with fewer fluids passing through and with upwelling areas with lower oxygen inflow. The coliform species showed the opposite preference. Our results suggest that bacterial variation is related to environmental factors and physical-chemical parameters within the HZ and may play a key role in the microbial diversity and distribution in these ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W811863687,"The potential role of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) accessory protein Nef in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS is still poorly understood. Nef is a molecular adapter that influences several cellular signal transduction events and membrane trafficking. In human macrophages, Nef expression induces the production of extracellular factors (e.g. pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines) and the recruitment of T cells, thus favoring their infection and its own transfer to uninfected cells via exosomes, cellular protrusions or cell-to-cell contacts. Murine cells are normally not permissive for HIV-1 but, in transgenic mice, Nef is a major disease determinant. Both in human and murine macrophages, myristoylated Nef (myr+Nef) treatment has been shown to activate NF-κB, MAP kinases and interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF-3), thereby inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, STAT-2 and STAT-3 through the production of proinflammatory factors.We report that treatment of BV-2 murine microglial cells with myr+Nef leads to STAT-1, -2 and -3 tyrosine phosphorylation and upregulates the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) with production of nitric oxide. We provide evidence that extracellular Nef regulates iNOS expression through NF-κB activation and, at least in part, interferon-β (IFNβ) release that acts in concert with Nef. All of these effects require both myristoylation and a highly conserved acidic cluster in the viral protein. Finally, we report that Nef induces the release of neurotoxic factors in the supernatants of microglial cells.These results suggest a potential role of extracellular Nef in promoting neuronal injury in the murine model. They also indicate a possible interplay between Nef and host factors in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS through the production of reactive nitrogen species in microglial cells."
https://openalex.org/W585311677,"Boolean models have been instrumental in predicting general features of gene networks and more recently also as explorative tools in specific biological applications. In this study we introduce a basic quantitative and a limited time resolution to a discrete (Boolean) framework. Quantitative resolution is improved through the employ of normalized variables in unison with an additive approach. Increased time resolution stems from the introduction of two distinct priority classes. Through the implementation of a previously published chondrocyte network and T helper cell network, we show that this addition of quantitative and time resolution broadens the scope of biological behaviour that can be captured by the models. Specifically, the quantitative resolution readily allows models to discern qualitative differences in dosage response to growth factors. The limited time resolution, in turn, can influence the reachability of attractors, delineating the likely long term system behaviour. Importantly, the information required for implementation of these features, such as the nature of an interaction, is typically obtainable from the literature. Nonetheless, a trade-off is always present between additional computational cost of this approach and the likelihood of extending the model's scope. Indeed, in some cases the inclusion of these features does not yield additional insight. This framework, incorporating increased and readily available time and semi-quantitative resolution, can help in substantiating the litmus test of dynamics for gene networks, firstly by excluding unlikely dynamics and secondly by refining falsifiable predictions on qualitative behaviour."

Owing to the complexity of the disease, its root cause still remains unclear. The existing anti-Alzheimer's drugs are unable to cure the disease while the current therapeutic options have provided only limited help in restoring moderate memory and remain ineffective at restricting the disease's progression. The striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has been shown to be involved in the internalization of the receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDR) and thus is associated with the disease. The present study was performed using machine learning algorithms, docking protocol and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop STEP inhibitors, which could be novel anti-Alzheimer's molecules.The present study deals with the generation of computational predictive models based on chemical descriptors of compounds using machine learning approaches followed by substructure fragment analysis. To perform this analysis, the 2D molecular descriptors were generated and machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Sequential Minimization Optimization) were utilized. The binding mechanisms and the molecular interactions between the predicted active compounds and the target protein were modelled using docking methods. Further, the stability of the protein-ligand complex was evaluated using MD simulation studies. The substructure fragment analysis was performed using Substructure fingerprint (SubFp), which was further explored using a predefined dictionary.The present study demonstrates that the computational methodology used can be employed to examine the biological activities of small molecules and prioritize them for experimental screening. Large unscreened chemical libraries can be screened to identify potential novel hits and accelerate the drug discovery process. Additionally, the chemical libraries can be searched for significant substructure patterns as reported in the present study, thus possibly contributing to the activity of these molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1491542345,"Recent findings have shown that photosynthesis in the skin of the seed of Posidonia oceanica enhances seedling growth. The seagrass genus Posidonia is found only in two distant parts of the world, the Mediterranean Sea and southern Australia. This fact led us to question whether the acquisition of this novel mechanism in the evolution of this seagrass was a pre-adaptation prior to geological isolation of the Mediterranean from Tethys Sea in the Eocene. Photosynthetic activity in seeds of Australian species of Posidonia is still unknown. This study shows oxygen production and respiration rates, and maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv : Fm) in seeds of two Australian Posidonia species (P. australis and P. sinuosa), and compares these with previous results for P. oceanica. Results showed relatively high oxygen production and respiratory rates in all three species but with significant differences among them, suggesting the existence of an adaptive mechanism to compensate for the relatively high oxygen demands of the seeds. In all cases maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II rates reached similar values. The existence of photosynthetic activity in the seeds of all three species implicates that it was an ability probably acquired from a common ancestor during the Late Eocene, when this adaptive strategy could have helped Posidonia species to survive in nutrient-poor temperate seas.

MP-MRI results were retrospectively assigned as overall scores using PI-RADS by two radiologists. Patients were followed and the end point was the diagnosis of PCa. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was performed to test diagnostic efficacy of MP-MRI, under results of biopsy within three months. The cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent variables for the detection of PCa.Finally, 1113 of the 1806 enrolled patients were included for analysis. The median follow-up was 56.0 months (1-137 mo). For 582 patients biopsied within three months, area under the curve for the detection of PCa with MP-MRI was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.00) in group of baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) 0.01-4.00 ng/ml (n = 31), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.95) in PSA 4.01-10.00 ng/ml (n = 142), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) in PSA >10.00 ng/ml (n = 409), respectively. In the cox model adjusted for age and baseline PSA level, for the detection rate of PCa, compared with PI-RADS 1-2 (reference), the hazard ratio was 6.43 (95% CI, 4.29-9.65) for PI-RADS 3, 18.58 (95% CI, 13.36-25.84) for PI-RADS 4-5 (p < 0.001).Prebiopsy MP-MRI with PI-RADS is demonstrated as a valuable diagnostic and predictive tool for PCa."
https://openalex.org/W1806989836,"Online votes or ratings can assist internet users in evaluating the credibility and appeal of the information which they encounter. For example, aggregator websites such as Reddit allow users to up-vote submitted content to make it more prominent, and down-vote content to make it less prominent. Here we argue that decisions over what to up- or down-vote may be guided by evolved features of human cognition. We predict that internet users should be more likely to up-vote content that others have also up-voted (social influence), content that has been submitted by particularly liked or respected users (model-based bias), content that constitutes evolutionarily salient or relevant information (content bias), and content that follows group norms and, in particular, prosocial norms. 489 respondents from the online social voting community Reddit rated the extent to which they felt different traits influenced their voting. Statistical analyses confirmed that norm-following and prosociality, as well as various content biases such as emotional content and originality, were rated as important motivators of voting. Social influence had a smaller effect than expected, while attitudes towards the submitter had little effect. This exploratory empirical investigation suggests that online voting communities can provide an important test-bed for evolutionary theories of human social information use, and that evolved features of human cognition may guide online behaviour just as it guides behaviour in the offline world."
https://openalex.org/W591637857,"TMEM16A/ANO1 is a calcium-activated chloride channel expressed in several types of epithelia and involved in various physiological processes, including proliferation and development. During mouse embryonic development, the expression of TMEM16A in the olfactory epithelium is dynamic. TMEM16A is expressed at the apical surface of the entire olfactory epithelium at embryonic day E12.5 while from E16.5 its expression is restricted to a region near the transition zone with the respiratory epithelium. To investigate whether TMEM16A plays a role in the development of the mouse olfactory epithelium, we obtained the first immunohistochemistry study comparing the morphological properties of the olfactory epithelium and nasal glands in TMEM16A-/- and TMEM16A+/+ littermate mice. A comparison between the expression of the olfactory marker protein and adenylyl cyclase III shows that genetic ablation of TMEM16A did not seem to affect the maturation of olfactory sensory neurons and their ciliary layer. As TMEM16A is expressed at the apical part of supporting cells and in their microvilli, we used ezrin and cytokeratin 8 as markers of microvilli and cell body of supporting cells, respectively, and found that morphology and development of supporting cells were similar in TMEM16A-/- and TMEM16A+/+ littermate mice. The average number of supporting cells, olfactory sensory neurons, horizontal and globose basal cells were not significantly different in the two types of mice. Moreover, we also observed that the morphology of Bowman’s glands, nasal septal glands and lateral nasal glands did not change in the absence of TMEM16A. Our results indicate that the development of mouse olfactory epithelium and nasal glands does not seem to be affected by the genetic ablation of TMEM16A."
https://openalex.org/W639401565,"Common wheat is one of the most important crops in China, which is the largest producer in the world. A set of 230 cultivars was used to identify yield-related loci by association mapping. This set was tested for seven yield-related traits, viz. plant height (PH), spike length (SL), spikelet number per spike (SNPS), kernel number per spike (KNPS), thousand-kernel weight (TKW), kernel weight per spike (KWPS), and sterile spikelet number (SSN) per plant in four environments. A total of 106 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers distributed on all 21 chromosomes were used to screen the set. Twenty-one and 19 of them were associated with KNPS and TKW, respectively. Association mapping detected 73 significant associations across 50 SSRs, and the phenotypic variation explained (R2) by the associations ranged from 1.54 to 23.93%. The associated loci were distributed on all chromosomes except 4A, 7A, and 7D. Significant and potentially new alleles were present on 8 chromosomes, namely 1A, 1D, 2A, 2D, 3D, 4B, 5B, and 6B. Further analysis showed that genetic effects of associated loci were greatly influenced by association panels, and the R2 of crucial loci were lower in modern cultivars than in the mini core collection, probably caused by strong selection in wheat breeding. In order to confirm the results of association analysis, yield-related favorable alleles Xgwm135-1A138, Xgwm337-1D186, Xgwm102-2D144, and Xgwm132-6B128 were evaluated in a double haploid (DH) population derived from Hanxuan10 xLumai14.These favorable alleles that were validated in various populations might be valuable in breeding for high-yield."
https://openalex.org/W2340969385,"Previous studies have indicated that amblyopia might affect children's attention. We recruited amblyopic children and normal children aged 9-11 years as study subjects and compared selective attention between the two groups of children. Chinese characters denoting colors were used in the Stroop task, and the event-related potential (ERP) was analyzed. The results show that the accuracy of both groups in the congruent condition was higher than the incongruent condition, and the reaction time (RT) of amblyopic children was longer. The latency of the occipital P1 in the incongruent condition was shorter than the neutral condition for both groups; the peak of the occipital P1 elicited by the incongruent stimuli in amblyopic children was higher. In both groups, the N1 peak was higher in the occipital region than frontal and central regions. The N1 latency of normal children was shorter in the congruent and neutral conditions and longer in the incongruent condition; the N1 peak of normal children was higher. The N270 latencies of normal children in the congruent and neutral conditions were shorter; the N270 peak was higher in parietal and occipital regions than frontal and central regions for both groups. The N450 latency of normal children was shorter; in both groups, the N450 average amplitude was significantly higher in the parietal region than central and frontal regions. The accuracy was the same for both groups, but the response of amblyopic children was significantly slower. The two groups showed differences in both stages of the Stroop task. Normal children showed advantages in processing speed on both stimulus and response conflict stages.Brain regions activated during the Stroop task were consistent between groups, in line with their age characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W607395145,"Most animals produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) are heteroplasmic for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in clones therefore requires the coordinated expression of genes encoded by the nuclear DNA and the two sources of mitochondria. Such interaction is rarely studied because most clones are generated using slaughterhouse oocytes of unrecorded origin. Here we traced the maternal lineages of seven diseased and five one-month-old live cloned piglets by sequencing their mtDNA. Additionally by using a 13K oligonucleotide microarray, we compared the expression profiles of nuclear and mtDNA-encoded genes that are involved in mitochondrial functions and regulation between the cloned groups and their age-matched controls (n=5 per group). We found that the oocytes used to generate the cloned piglets were of either the Large White or Duroc background, and oocyte genetic background was not related to the clones' survival. Expression profiles of mtDNA-encoded genes in clones and controls showed intermixed clustering patterns without treatment or maternal lineage-dependency. In contrast, clones and controls clustered separately for their global and nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial genes in the lungs for both the deceased and live groups. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes encoded by both nuclear and mtDNA revealed abnormal gene expression in the mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway in deceased clones. Among the nine differentially expressed genes of the OXPHOS pathway, seven were down-regulated in deceased clones compared to controls, suggesting deficiencies in mitochondrial functions. Together, these data demonstrate that the coordination of expression of mitochondrial genes encoded by nuclear and mtDNA is disrupted in the lung of diseased clones."
https://openalex.org/W626446659,"One of the most common types of urinary stones formed in humans and some other mammals is composed of calcium oxalate in ordered hydrated crystals. Many studies have reported a range of metals other than calcium in human stones, but few have looked at stones from animal models such as the dog. Therefore, we determined the elemental profile of canine calcium oxalate urinary stones and compared it to reported values from human stones. The content of 19 elements spanning 7-orders of magnitude was quantified in calcium oxalate stones from 53 dogs. The elemental profile of the canine stones was highly overlapping with human stones, indicating similar inorganic composition. Correlation and cluster analysis was then performed on the elemental profile from canine stones to evaluate associations between the elements and test for potential subgrouping based on elemental content. No correlations were observed with the most abundant metal calcium. However, magnesium and sulfur content correlated with the mineral hydration form, while phosphorous and zinc content correlated with the neuter status of the dog. Inter-elemental correlation analysis indicated strong associations between barium, phosphorous, and zinc content. Additionally, cluster analysis revealed subgroups within the stones that were also based primarily on barium, phosphorous, and zinc. These data support the use of the dog as a model to study the effects of trace metal homeostasis in urinary stone disease."
https://openalex.org/W2224585216,"Methods for identifying essential genes currently depend predominantly on biochemical experiments. However, there is demand for improved computational methods for determining gene essentiality. In this study, we used the Hurst exponent, a characteristic parameter to describe long-range correlation in DNA, and analyzed its distribution in 33 bacterial genomes. In most genomes (31 out of 33) the significance levels of the Hurst exponents of the essential genes were significantly higher than for the corresponding full-gene-set, whereas the significance levels of the Hurst exponents of the nonessential genes remained unchanged or increased only slightly. All of the Hurst exponents of essential genes followed a normal distribution, with one exception. We therefore propose that the distribution feature of Hurst exponents of essential genes can be used as a classification index for essential gene prediction in bacteria. For computer-aided design in the field of synthetic biology, this feature can build a restraint for pre- or post-design checking of bacterial essential genes. Moreover, considering the relationship between gene essentiality and evolution, the Hurst exponents could be used as a descriptive parameter related to evolutionary level, or be added to the annotation of each gene."
https://openalex.org/W2277916113,"Background Grass pollen, in particular from Lolium multiflorum is a major allergen source in temperate climate zones of Southern Brazil. The IgE sensitization profile of Brazilian grass pollen allergic patients to individual allergen molecules has not been analyzed yet. Objective To analyze the IgE sensitization profile of a Brazilian grass pollen allergic population using individual allergen molecules. Methods We analyzed sera from 78 grass pollen allergic patients for the presence of IgE antibodies specific for 103 purified micro-arrayed natural and recombinant allergens by chip technology. IgE-ELISA inhibition experiments with Lolium multiflorum, Phleum pratense extracts and a recombinant fusion protein consisting of Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5 and Phl p 6 were performed to investigate cross-reactivities. Results Within the Brazilian grass pollen allergic patients, the most frequently recognized allergens were Phl p 1 (95%), Phl p 5 (82%), Phl p 2 (76%) followed by Phl p 4 (64%), Phl p 6 (45%), Phl p 11 (18%) and Phl p 12 (18%). Most patients were sensitized only to grass pollen allergens but not to allergens from other sources. A high degree of IgE cross-reactivity between Phleum pratense, Lolium multiflorum and the recombinant timothy grass fusion protein was found. Conclusions Component-resolved analysis of sera from Brazilian grass pollen allergic patients reveals an IgE recognition profile compatible with a typical Pooideae sensitization. The high degree of cross-reactivity between Phleum pratense and Lolium multiflorum allergens suggests that diagnosis and immunotherapy can be achieved with timothy grass pollen allergens in the studied population."
https://openalex.org/W566891877,"Recurrent water level fluctuation and submergence of plants are common in riparian zones. Our study objectives were to test the independent and interactive effects of submergence level and fluctuation frequency on a globally important riparian invasive plant, Alternanthera philoxeroides. To this end, we conducted a greenhouse experiment, in which ramets of the plants, obtained from a wetland in China, were treated with four fluctuation frequencies (0, 3, 6, and 12 cycles over a 96-day experimental period) under three water levels (0, 10, and 30 cm). We found that effects of fluctuation frequency were non-significant, negative, and positive under water levels of 0, 10 and 30 cm, respectively. As fluctuation frequency increased, the effects of increasing water level decreased significantly. When water levels were high, A. philoxeroides allocated greater biomass to shoot production probably in order to elongate and escape from submergence. However, as fluctuation frequency increased, biomass investment in roots and leaves also increased, probably in order to maximize nutrient absorption and photosynthesis, respectively. These results suggest that water level fluctuation may alleviate the effects of submergence on A. philoxeroides. In addition, A. philoxeroides showed significant phenotypic plasticity, adjusting its functional traits, such as number of nodes and leaves per stem, as well as stem diameter and pith cavity diameter, according to recurrent water level fluctuation. We conclude that A. philoxeroides may perform better in shallow water zones under conditions of disturbance that include recurrent water level fluctuation. This ability to adapt to disturbance likely promotes its growth and invasion in disturbed habitats."
https://openalex.org/W836498138,"The use of solar irradiation to sterilize water prior to its consumption has resulted in the reduction of water related illnesses in waterborne disease endemic communities worldwide. Currently, research on solar water disinfection (SODIS) has been directed towards understanding the underlying mechanisms through which solar irradiation inactivates the culturability of microorganisms in water, enhancement of the disinfection process, and the health impact of SODIS water consumption. However, the immunological consequences of SODIS water consumption have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the effect that solar irradiated V. cholerae may have had on the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by the JAWS II dendritic cell line in vitro. The JAWS II dendritic cell line was stimulated with the different strains of V. cholerae that had been: (i) prepared in PBS, (ii) inactivated through a combination of heat and chemical, (iii) solar irradiated, and (iv) non-solar irradiated, in bottled water. As controls, LPS (1 μg/ml) and CTB (1 μg/ml) were used as stimulants. After 48 hours of stimulation the tissue culture media from each treatment was qualitatively and quantitatively analysed for the presence of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-15, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, RANTES, TNF-α, IL-23 and IL-27. Results showed that solar irradiated cultures of V. cholerae induced dendritic cells to secrete significant (p<0.05) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in comparison to the unstimulated dendritic cells. Furthermore, the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by the dendritic cells in response to solar irradiated cultures of V. cholerae was not as high as observed in treatments involving non-solar irradiated cultures of V. cholerae or LPS. Our results suggest that solar irradiated microorganisms are capable of inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This novel finding is key towards understanding the possible immunological consequences of consuming SODIS treated water."

Here we describe the development of an in situ pMHC-II tetramer staining method to visualize antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in tissues. This method complements other methods developed that similarly use MHC class II reagents to stain antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in situ. In this study, we used group A streptococcus (GAS) expressing a surrogate peptide (2W) to inoculate C57BL/6 mice, and used fresh nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) in optimizing the in situ staining of 2W:I-Ab specific CD4+ T cells. The results showed 2W:I-Ab tetramer-binding CD4+ T cells in GAS-2W but not GAS infected mice. This method holds promise to be broadly applicable to study the localization, abundance, and phenotype of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in undisrupted tissues."
