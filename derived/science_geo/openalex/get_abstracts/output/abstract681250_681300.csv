https://openalex.org/W3199074476,"The development of silicon anodes for lithium-ion batteries has been largely impeded by poor interfacial stability against liquid electrolytes. Here, we enabled the stable operation of a 99.9 weight % microsilicon anode by using the interface passivating properties of sulfide solid electrolytes. Bulk and surface characterization, and quantification of interfacial components, showed that such an approach eliminates continuous interfacial growth and irreversible lithium losses. Microsilicon full cells were assembled and found to achieve high areal current density, wide operating temperature range, and high areal loadings for the different cells. The promising performance can be attributed to both the desirable interfacial property between microsilicon and sulfide electrolytes and the distinctive chemomechanical behavior of the lithium-silicon alloy."
https://openalex.org/W3199275388,"Similar to conventional materials, most multicomponent high-entropy alloys (HEAs) lose ductility as they gain strength. In this study, we controllably introduced gradient nanoscaled dislocation cell structures in a stable single-phase HEA with face-centered cubic structure, thus resulting in enhanced strength without apparent loss of ductility. Upon application of strain, the sample-level structural gradient induces progressive formation of a high density of tiny stacking faults (SFs) and twins, nucleating from abundant low-angle dislocation cells. Furthermore, the SF-induced plasticity and the resultant refined structures, coupled with intensively accumulated dislocations, contribute to plasticity, increased strength, and work hardening. These findings offer a promising paradigm for tailoring properties with gradient dislocation cells at the nanoscale and advance our fundamental understanding of the intrinsic deformation behavior of HEAs."

We report a chemical-biochemical hybrid pathway for starch synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen in a cell-free system. The artificial starch anabolic pathway (ASAP), consisting of 11 core reactions, was drafted by computational pathway design, established through modular assembly and substitution, and optimized by protein engineering of three bottleneck-associated enzymes. In a chemoenzymatic system with spatial and temporal segregation, ASAP, driven by hydrogen, converts CO2 to starch at a rate of 22 nanomoles of CO2 per minute per milligram of total catalyst, an ~8.5-fold higher rate than starch synthesis in maize. This approach opens the way toward future chemo-biohybrid starch synthesis from CO2."

https://openalex.org/W3199772305,"Abstract The determination of molecular features that mediate clinically aggressive phenotypes in prostate cancer remains a major biological and clinical challenge 1,2 . Recent advances in interpretability of machine learning models as applied to biomedical problems may enable discovery and prediction in clinical cancer genomics 3–5 . Here we developed P-NET—a biologically informed deep learning model—to stratify patients with prostate cancer by treatment-resistance state and evaluate molecular drivers of treatment resistance for therapeutic targeting through complete model interpretability. We demonstrate that P-NET can predict cancer state using molecular data with a performance that is superior to other modelling approaches. Moreover, the biological interpretability within P-NET revealed established and novel molecularly altered candidates, such as MDM4 and FGFR1 , which were implicated in predicting advanced disease and validated in vitro. Broadly, biologically informed fully interpretable neural networks enable preclinical discovery and clinical prediction in prostate cancer and may have general applicability across cancer types."

Aerial schemes to distribute the components for such networks are required, and-inspired by wind-dispersed seeds6-we examined passive structures designed for controlled, unpowered flight across natural environments or city settings. Techniques in mechanically guided assembly of three-dimensional (3D) mesostructures7-9 provide access to miniature, 3D fliers optimized for such purposes, in processes that align with the most sophisticated production techniques for electronic, optoelectronic, microfluidic and microelectromechanical technologies. Here we demonstrate a range of 3D macro-, meso- and microscale fliers produced in this manner, including those that incorporate active electronic and colorimetric payloads. Analytical, computational and experimental studies of the aerodynamics of high-performance structures of this type establish a set of fundamental considerations in bio-inspired design, with a focus on 3D fliers that exhibit controlled rotational kinematics and low terminal velocities. An approach that represents these complex 3D structures as discrete numbers of blades captures the essential physics in simple, analytical scaling forms, validated by computational and experimental results. Battery-free, wireless devices and colorimetric sensors for environmental measurements provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of these unusual concepts."
https://openalex.org/W3200928356,"Cardiomyocyte (CM) replacement is very slow in adult mammalian hearts, preventing regeneration of damaged myocardium. By contrast, fetal hearts display considerable regenerative potential owing to the presence of less mature CMs that still have the ability to proliferate. In this study, we demonstrate that heart-specific expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) induces adult CMs to dedifferentiate, conferring regenerative capacity to adult hearts. Transient, CM-specific expression of OSKM extends the regenerative window for postnatal mouse hearts and induces a gene expression program in adult CMs that resembles that of fetal CMs. Extended expression of OSKM in CMs leads to cellular reprogramming and heart tumor formation. Short-term OSKM expression before and during myocardial infarction ameliorates myocardial damage and improves cardiac function, demonstrating that temporally controlled dedifferentiation and reprogramming enable cell cycle reentry of mammalian CMs and facilitate heart regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3201539595,"All structures within living cells must form at the right time and place. This includes condensates such as the nucleolus, Cajal bodies and stress granules, which form via liquid–liquid phase separation of biomolecules, particularly proteins enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)1,2. In non-living systems, the initial stages of nucleated phase separation arise when thermal fluctuations overcome an energy barrier due to surface tension. This phenomenon can be modelled by classical nucleation theory (CNT), which describes how the rate of droplet nucleation depends on the degree of supersaturation, whereas the location at which droplets appear is controlled by interfacial heterogeneities3,4. However, it remains unknown whether this framework applies in living cells, owing to the multicomponent and highly complex nature of the intracellular environment, including the presence of diverse IDRs, whose specificity of biomolecular interactions is unclear5–8. Here we show that despite this complexity, nucleation in living cells occurs through a physical process similar to that in inanimate materials, but the efficacy of nucleation sites can be tuned by their biomolecular features. By quantitatively characterizing the nucleation kinetics of endogenous and biomimetic condensates in living cells, we find that key features of condensate nucleation can be quantitatively understood through a CNT-like theoretical framework. Nucleation rates can be substantially enhanced by compatible biomolecular (IDR) seeds, and the kinetics of cellular processes can impact condensate nucleation rates and specificity of location. This quantitative framework sheds light on the intracellular nucleation landscape, and paves the way for engineering synthetic condensates precisely positioned in space and time. Experiments using endogenous and biomimetic condensates in cells show that nucleation in cells resembles the physical process in inanimate materials, but is tuned by biomolecular features."
https://openalex.org/W3199306742,"Defects may display high reactivity because the specific arrangement of atoms differs from crystalline surfaces. We demonstrate that high-temperature steam pretreatment of palladium catalysts provides a 12-fold increase in the mass-specific reaction rate for carbon-hydrogen (C–H) activation in methane oxidation compared with conventional pretreatments. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, we demonstrate that an increase in the grain boundary density through crystal twinning is achieved during the steam pretreatment and oxidation and is responsible for the increased reactivity. The grain boundaries are highly stable during reaction and show specific rates at least two orders of magnitude higher than other sites on the palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) catalysts. Theoretical calculations show that strain introduced by the defective structure can enhance C–H bond activation. Introduction of grain boundaries through laser ablation led to further rate increases."
https://openalex.org/W3200374960,"Repeats associated with phenotype The degree to which repeated sequences within a genome affect human phenotypes has been difficult to establish. Mukamel et al . examined thousands of genomes in the UK Biobank and found that some of the largest effects of common genetic variants on human phenotypes, including those with clinical relevance, arise from protein-coding repeat polymorphisms (see the Perspective by Gymrek and Goren). Mapping the effects of the size and copy number of these repeated protein domains links genetic variation to human phenotypes, including lipoprotein(a) concentration, height, and male pattern balding. Furthermore, the alleles and frequencies of these repeated sequences differ between individuals of African and European descent, resulting in differences between the populations with clinical relevance for traits including lipoprotein(a) levels, a risk factor for coronary artery disease. —LMZ"
https://openalex.org/W3199112784,"The leaf economics spectrum1,2 and the global spectrum of plant forms and functions3 revealed fundamental axes of variation in plant traits, which represent different ecological strategies that are shaped by the evolutionary development of plant species2. Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities4. However, the axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental variability4,5. Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions6 from a dataset of surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to accurately predict the full range of responses to environmental changes in carbon, water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems7,8."
https://openalex.org/W3200064846,"Topological insulator lasers are arrays of semiconductor lasers that exploit fundamental features of topology to force all emitters to act as a single coherent laser. In this study, we demonstrate a topological insulator vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) array. Each VCSEL emits vertically, but the in-plane coupling between emitters in the topological-crystalline platform facilitates coherent emission of the whole array. Our topological VCSEL array emits at a single frequency and displays interference, highlighting that the emitters are mutually coherent. Our experiments exemplify the power of topological transport of light: The light spends most of its time oscillating vertically, but the small in-plane coupling is sufficient to force the array of individual emitters to act as a single laser."
https://openalex.org/W3200060585,"The recent progress in nanotechnology1,2 and single-molecule spectroscopy3-5 paves the way for emergent cost-effective organic quantum optical technologies with potential applications in useful devices operating at ambient conditions. We harness a π-conjugated ladder-type polymer strongly coupled to a microcavity forming hybrid light-matter states, so-called exciton-polaritons, to create exciton-polariton condensates with quantum fluid properties. Obeying Bose statistics, exciton-polaritons exhibit an extreme nonlinearity when undergoing bosonic stimulation6, which we have managed to trigger at the single-photon level, thereby providing an efficient way for all-optical ultrafast control over the macroscopic condensate wavefunction. Here, we utilize stable excitons dressed with high-energy molecular vibrations, allowing for single-photon nonlinear operation at ambient conditions. This opens new horizons for practical implementations like sub-picosecond switching, amplification and all-optical logic at the fundamental quantum limit."
https://openalex.org/W3201395390,"Background Teaching work is stressful, moreover during the pandemic teachers’ stress might have been intensified by distance education as well as by limited access to social support, which functions as a buffer in experiencing stress. The aim of the research was to investigate the relation between distance education and teachers’ well-being, and their close relations and other social relations during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The research was conducted in two stages on 285 Polish primary and secondary school teachers who were recruited by means of the chain referral method. The following measures were used: The Depression Anxiety &amp; Stress Scales-21, Berlin Social Support Scales, The Relationship Satisfaction Scale and The Injustice Experience Questionnaire. Results The teachers experienced at least mild levels of stress, anxiety and depression, both during the first as well as the second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. It has been confirmed that there is a negative relation between relationship quality change and social relations quality change, and stress, anxiety and depression. The variables taken into consideration in the research have provided the explanation for the variation of stress—from 6% in the first stage of the research to 47% in the second stage; for the variation of anxiety—from 21% to 31%; and for the variation of depression—from 12% to 46%, respectively. Conclusions The research results show that due to distance work the distinction between professional work and family life might have been blurred, and as a consequence teachers’ well-being could have been worsened. The isolation put on to stop the spreading of the virus might have contributed to changes in social relations, in close relations in particular, and at the same time negatively influenced teachers’ abilities to effectively cope with the crisis situations."
https://openalex.org/W3201172649,"Over the past decades, rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations have provided large samples of UV luminous galaxies at redshift (z) greater than 6 (refs. 1-3), during the so-called epoch of reionization. While a few of these UV-identified galaxies revealed substantial dust reservoirs4-7, very heavily dust-obscured sources at these early times have remained elusive. They are limited to a rare population of extreme starburst galaxies8-12 and companions of rare quasars13,14. These studies conclude that the contribution of dust-obscured galaxies to the cosmic star formation rate density at z > 6 is sub-dominant. Recent ALMA and Spitzer observations have identified a more abundant, less extreme population of obscured galaxies at z = 3-6 (refs. 15,16). However, this population has not been confirmed in the reionization epoch so far. Here, we report the discovery of two dust-obscured star-forming galaxies at z = 6.6813 ± 0.0005 and z = 7.3521 ± 0.0005. These objects are not detected in existing rest-frame UV data and were discovered only through their far-infrared [C II] lines and dust continuum emission as companions to typical UV-luminous galaxies at the same redshift. The two galaxies exhibit lower infrared luminosities and star-formation rates than extreme starbursts, in line with typical star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 7. This population of heavily dust-obscured galaxies appears to contribute 10-25% to the z > 6 cosmic star formation rate density."
https://openalex.org/W3200786977,"One of the hallmarks of the cerebral cortex is the extreme diversity of interneurons1-3. The two largest subtypes of cortical interneurons, parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive cells, are morphologically and functionally distinct in adulthood but arise from common lineages within the medial ganglionic eminence4-11. This makes them an attractive model for studying the generation of cell diversity. Here we examine how developmental changes in transcription and chromatin structure enable these cells to acquire distinct identities in the mouse cortex. Generic interneuron features are first detected upon cell cycle exit through the opening of chromatin at distal elements. By constructing cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks, we observed that parvalbumin- and somatostatin-positive cells initiate distinct programs upon settling within the cortex. We used these networks to model the differential transcriptional requirement of a shared regulator, Mef2c, and confirmed the accuracy of our predictions through experimental loss-of-function experiments. We therefore reveal how a common molecular program diverges to enable these neuronal subtypes to acquire highly specialized properties by adulthood. Our methods provide a framework for examining the emergence of cellular diversity, as well as for quantifying and predicting the effect of candidate genes on cell-type-specific development."
https://openalex.org/W3201039003,"Mounting evidence shows that dopamine in the striatum is critically involved in reward-based reinforcement learning1,2. However, it remains unclear how dopamine reward signals influence the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, another brain network that is crucial for learning and memory3-5. Here, using cell-type-specific electrophysiological recording6, we show that dopamine signals from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra control the encoding of cue-reward association rules in layer 2a fan cells of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). When mice learned novel olfactory cue-reward associations using a pre-learned association rule, spike representations of LEC fan cells grouped newly learned rewarded cues with a pre-learned rewarded cue, but separated them from a pre-learned unrewarded cue. Optogenetic inhibition of fan cells impaired the learning of new associations while sparing the retrieval of pre-learned memory. Using fibre photometry, we found that dopamine sends novelty-induced reward expectation signals to the LEC. Inhibition of LEC dopamine signals disrupted the associative encoding of fan cells and impaired learning performance. These results suggest that LEC fan cells represent a cognitive map of abstract task rules, and that LEC dopamine facilitates the incorporation of new memories into this map."
https://openalex.org/W3201646052,"Particle accelerators are essential tools in science, hospitals and industry1-6. Yet their costs and large footprint, ranging in length from metres to several kilometres, limit their use. The recently demonstrated nanophotonics-based acceleration of charged particles can reduce the cost and size of these accelerators by orders of magnitude7-9. In this approach, a carefully designed nanostructure transfers energy from laser light to the particles in a phase-synchronous manner, accelerating them. To accelerate particles to the megaelectronvolt range and beyond, with minimal particle loss10,11, the particle beam needs to be confined over extended distances, but the necessary control of the electron beam's phase space has been elusive. Here we demonstrate complex electron phase-space control at optical frequencies in the 225-nanometre narrow channel of a silicon-based photonic nanostructure that is 77.7 micrometres long. In particular, we experimentally show alternating phase focusing10-13, a particle propagation scheme for minimal-loss transport that could, in principle, be arbitrarily long. We expect this work to enable megaelectronvolt electron-beam generation on a photonic chip, with potential for applications in radiotherapy and compact light sources9, and other forms of electron phase-space control resulting in narrow energy or zeptosecond-bunched beams14-16."
https://openalex.org/W3201010185,"Star formation in half of massive galaxies was quenched by the time the Universe was 3 billion years old1. Very low amounts of molecular gas seem to be responsible for this, at least in some cases2-7, although morphological gas stabilization, shock heating or activity associated with accretion onto a central supermassive black hole are invoked in other cases8-11. Recent studies of quenching by gas depletion have been based on upper limits that are insufficiently sensitive to determine this robustly2-7, or stacked emission with its problems of averaging8,9. Here we report 1.3 mm observations of dust emission from 6 strongly lensed galaxies where star formation has been quenched, with magnifications of up to a factor of 30. Four of the six galaxies are undetected in dust emission, with an estimated upper limit on the dust mass of 0.0001 times the stellar mass, and by proxy (assuming a Milky Way molecular gas-to-dust ratio) 0.01 times the stellar mass in molecular gas. This is two orders of magnitude less molecular gas per unit stellar mass than seen in star forming galaxies at similar redshifts12-14. It remains difficult to extrapolate from these small samples, but these observations establish that gas depletion is responsible for a cessation of star formation in some fraction of high-redshift galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W3199759881,"Abstract Modulation of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels by auxiliary subunits is central to the physiological function of channels in the brain and heart 1,2 . Native Kv4 tetrameric channels form macromolecular ternary complexes with two auxiliary β-subunits—intracellular Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) and transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase-related proteins (DPPs)—to evoke rapidly activating and inactivating A-type currents, which prevent the backpropagation of action potentials 1–5 . However, the modulatory mechanisms of Kv4 channel complexes remain largely unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Kv4.2–DPP6S–KChIP1 dodecamer complex, the Kv4.2–KChIP1 and Kv4.2–DPP6S octamer complexes, and Kv4.2 alone. The structure of the Kv4.2–KChIP1 complex reveals that the intracellular N terminus of Kv4.2 interacts with its C terminus that extends from the S6 gating helix of the neighbouring Kv4.2 subunit. KChIP1 captures both the N and the C terminus of Kv4.2. In consequence, KChIP1 would prevent N-type inactivation and stabilize the S6 conformation to modulate gating of the S6 helices within the tetramer. By contrast, unlike the reported auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated channel complexes, DPP6S interacts with the S1 and S2 helices of the Kv4.2 voltage-sensing domain, which suggests that DPP6S stabilizes the conformation of the S1–S2 helices. DPP6S may therefore accelerate the voltage-dependent movement of the S4 helices. KChIP1 and DPP6S do not directly interact with each other in the Kv4.2–KChIP1–DPP6S ternary complex. Thus, our data suggest that two distinct modes of modulation contribute in an additive manner to evoke A-type currents from the native Kv4 macromolecular complex."
https://openalex.org/W3199360243,"Distinct mechanisms to block transporters Transmembrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are crucial cellular machines that move molecules small and large across membranes. In Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane biogenesis is aided by an ABC transporter called MsbA, which flips lipopolysaccharide from the inner face of the cell membrane to the periplasmic face. Thélot et al . determined structures of two first-generation inhibitors bound to MsbA, TBT1 and G247, and found that they have distinct binding modes. Unlike most inhibitors, TBT1 triggers unproductive ATPase activity and induces a conformation similar to substrate bound. These structures will provide valuable information for the design of potential antimicrobial drugs. The authors have already identified a new lead compound from virtual screening based on the TBT1-induced conformation. —MAF"

We assessed whether opioid-free anesthesia would provide effective analgesia-antinociception monitored by analgesia index in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.Patients (ASA Ⅰ-Ⅱ, 18-65 years old, BMI <30 kg m-2) scheduled to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into two groups to receive opioid-free anesthesia (group OFA) with dexmedetomidine, sevoflurane plus thoracic paravertebral blockade or opioid-based anesthesia (group OA) with remifentanil, sevoflurane, and thoracic paravertebral blockade. The primary outcome variable was pain intensity during the operation, assessed by the depth of analgesia using the pain threshold index with the multifunction combination monitor HXD‑I. Secondary outcomes included depth of sedation monitoring by wavelet index and blood glucose concentration achieved from blood gas.One hundred patients were randomized; 3 patients were excluded due to discontinued intervention and 97 included in the final analysis. Intraoperative pain threshold index readings were not significantly different between group OFA and group OA from arriving operation room to extubation (P = 0.86), while the brain wavelet index readings in group OFA were notably lower than those in group OA from before general anesthesia induction to recovery of double lungs ventilation (P <0.001). After beginning of operation, the blood glucose levels in group OFA increased compared with baseline blood glucose values (P < 0.001). The recovery time and extubation time in group OFA were significantly longer than those in group OA (P <0.007).This study suggested that our OFA regimen achieved equally effective intraoperative pain threshold index compared to OA in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Depth of sedation was significantly deeper and blood glucose levels were higher with OFA. Study's limitations and strict inclusion criteria may limit the external validity of the study, suggesting the need of further randomized trials on the topic.

This study aimed at exploring the prevalence and risk factors of the composite index for anthropometric failure (CIAF) of under-five children in Ethiopia by incorporating the zonal (district) effects.The data was drawn from Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHSs), a population-based cross-sectional study of 29,599 under-five year children from 72 Zones in the years 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2016. Fixed effect variables related to child and maternal-household were included in the model. We adopted a generalized mixed model with CIAF as outcome variable and Zones as random effects.The prevalence of CIAF in Ethiopia was 53.78% with the highest prevalence of 61.30% in 2000 and the lowest prevalence of 46.58% in 2016. The model result revealed that being a female child, absence of comorbidity, singleton births, and the first order of birth showed significantly lower CIAF prevalence than their counterparts. Among the household characteristics, children from mothers of underweight body mass index, uneducated parents, poor household sanitation, and rural residents were more likely to be undernourished than their counterparts. Based on the best linear unbiased prediction for the zonal-level random effect, significant variations of CIAF among zones were observed.The generalized linear mixed-effects model results identified gender of the child, size of child at birth, dietary diversity, birth type, place of residence, age of the child, parental level of education, wealth index, sanitation facilities, and media exposure as main drivers of CIAF. Disparities of CIAF were observed between and within the Ethiopian administrative Zones over time."

Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to collect RCTs regarding patients with COVID-19. The retrieval time was from the inception to December 1, 2020. The CONSORT 2010 statement was used to evaluate the overall reporting quality of these RCTs. Results 53 RCTs were included. The study showed that the average reporting rate for 37 items in CONSORT checklist was 53.85% with mean overall adherence score of 13.02±3.546 (ranged: 7 to 22). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed the overall adherence score to the CONSORT guideline was associated with journal impact factor (P = 0.006), and endorsement of CONSORT statement (P = 0.014). Conclusion Although many RCTs of COVID-19 have been published in different journals, the overall reporting quality of these articles was suboptimal, it can not provide valid evidence for clinical decision-making and systematic reviews. Therefore, more journals should endorse the CONSORT statement, authors should strictly follow the relevant provisions of the CONSORT guideline when reporting articles.

In this study, we evaluated the physiological and biochemical effects of potassium sulfate (K2SO4) fertilizer and varied irrigation regimes on the economically significant oilseed crop, Brassica juncea L, under open field conditions. Two cultivars (RH-725 and RH-749) of B. juncea were used in a randomized complete block design experiment with three replicates. Irrigation regimes consisted of a control (double irrigation: once at the 50% flowering and another at 50% fruiting stages), early irrigation (at 50% flowering only), late irrigation (at 50% fruiting only) and stress (no irrigation). The K2SO4 applications were: control (K0, no fertilization); K1, 10 kg ha-1; and K2, 20 kg ha-1. We measured growth via fresh and dry plant weight, plant height, root length, and leaf area. All the growth parameters were higher in RH-749. The physiological attributes, including the membrane stability index and relative water content, were higher at the 50% flowering stage in RH-749. The amount of antioxidant enzymes (catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) was enhanced when both plants were fertilized during water stress. All of these enzymes had higher activity in RH-749. The total chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate were considerably higher in RH-749, which leaked fewer electrolytes and maintained a less destructive osmotic potential under limited water conditions. The results indicated that it is water-stress tolerant when given a high concentration of K2SO4, which alleviated the adverse effects of water stress on growth and physiology."

It adopts the Roberts edge detection and Laplacian operator for high-level stable preservation of landscape images. Simultaneously, the displayed image is stablized using edge computing algorithms. Simulation experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of digitized landscape architecture design based on mobile edge computing. Results demonstrate that the discrete elevation calculation algorithm can avoid low visual rendering in the 3D image generation process, optimize the seed point matching of edge correlation, and ensure image clarity and stability. The edge computing algorithm can fundamentally avoid the problem of image shaking. The impact of different algorithm models on the classification and accuracy of landscape images is analyzed through parameter optimization. Compared with some latest models, the proposed landscape design scheme based on edge computing has better accuracy. The average accuracy can reach more than 90%, and the Kappa coefficient remains at 86.93%. The designed garden landscape digitization platform can stably display 3D garden landscape images while avoiding the shaking of 3D images, which can provide a theoretical basis and practical value for designing and planning landscape architecture."
https://openalex.org/W3200937021,"Recent studies emphasize the importance of 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2C R) signaling in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The 5-HT2C R is the only G-protein-coupled receptor known to undergo post-transcriptional adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). 5-HT2C R has emerged as an important role in the modulation of pancreatic β cell functions. This study investigated mechanisms behind the effects of palmitic acid (PA) on insulin secretion in different overexpressed 5-HT2C R edited isoforms in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. Results showed that the expressions of 5HT2C R and ADAR2 were upregulated in the pancreatic islets of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) compared to control mice. PA treatment significantly induced the expressions of 5-HT2C R and ADAR2 in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. PA treatment significantly induced the editing of 5-HT2C R in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. There was no significant difference in cell viability between naïve cells and three overexpressed 5-HT2C R edited isoforms in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. Overexpressed 5-HT2C R edited isoforms showed reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) compared with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed cells. Moreover, 5-HT2C R edited isoforms displayed reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) activation, probably through inhibition of stromal interaction molecule 1 trafficking under PA treatment. Altogether, our results show that PA-mediated editing of 5-HT2C R modulates GSIS through alteration of ER calcium release and SOCE activation in pancreatic MIN6 β cells."
https://openalex.org/W3201597307,"Children born preterm (<37 completed weeks' gestation) have a higher risk of infection-related morbidity than those born at term. However, few large, population-based studies have investigated the risk of infection in childhood across the full spectrum of gestational age. The objectives of this study were to explore the association between gestational age at birth and infection-related hospital admissions up to the age of 10 years, how infection-related hospital admission rates change throughout childhood, and whether being born small for gestational age (SGA) modifies this relationship.Using a population-based, record-linkage cohort study design, birth registrations, birth notifications and hospital admissions were linked using a deterministic algorithm. The study population included all live, singleton births occurring in NHS hospitals in England from January 2005 to December 2006 (n = 1,018,136). The primary outcome was all infection-related inpatient hospital admissions from birth to 10 years of age, death or study end (March 2015). The secondary outcome was the type of infection-related hospital admission, grouped into broad categories. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each gestational age category (<28, 28-29, 30-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 weeks) and the models were repeated by age at admission (<1, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7-10 years). An interaction term was included in the model to test whether SGA status modified the relationship between gestational age and infection-related hospital admissions. Gestational age was strongly associated with rates of infection-related hospital admissions throughout childhood. Whilst the relationship attenuated over time, at 7-10 years of age those born before 40 weeks gestation were still significantly higher in comparison to those born at 40 weeks. Children born <28 weeks had an aRR of 6.53 (5.91-7.22) during infancy, declining to 3.16 (2.50-3.99) at ages 7-10 years, in comparison to those born at 40 weeks; whilst in children born at 38 weeks, the aRRs were 1·24 (1.21-1.27) and 1·18 (1.13-1.23), during infancy and aged 7-10 years, respectively. SGA status modified the effect of gestational age (interaction P<0.0001), with the highest rate among the children born at <28 weeks and SGA. Finally, study findings indicated that the associations with gestational age varied by subgroup of infection. Whilst upper respiratory tract infections were the most common type of infection experienced by children in this cohort, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (<28 weeks, aRR = 10.61(9.55-11.79)) and invasive bacterial infections (<28 weeks, aRR = 6.02 (4.56-7.95)) were the most strongly associated with gestational age at birth. Of LRTIs experienced, bronchiolitis (<28 weeks, aRR = 11.86 (10.20-13.80)), and pneumonia (<28 weeks, aRR = 9.49 (7.95-11.32)) were the most common causes.Gestational age at birth was strongly associated with rates of infection-related hospital admissions during childhood and even children born a few weeks early remained at higher risk at 7-10 years of age. There was variation between clinical subgroups in the strength of relationships with gestational age. Effective infection prevention strategies should include focus on reducing the number and severity of LRTIs during early childhood."

https://openalex.org/W3199059394,"A key component in understanding plant-insect interactions is the nature of host defenses. Research on defense traits among Pinus species has focused on specialized metabolites and axial resin ducts, but the role of lignin in defense within diverse systems is unclear. We investigated lignin levels in the outer bark and phloem of P. longaeva, P. balfouriana, and P. flexilis; tree species growing at high elevations in the western United States known to differ in susceptibility to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae; MPB). Pinus longaeva and P. balfouriana are attacked by MPB less frequently than P. flexilis, and MPB brood production in P. longaeva is limited. Because greater lignification of feeding tissues has been shown to provide defense against bark beetles in related genera, such as Picea, we hypothesized that P. longaeva and P. balfouriana would have greater lignin concentrations than P. flexilis. Contrary to expectations, we found that the more MPB-susceptible P. flexilis had greater phloem lignin levels than the less susceptible P. longaeva and P. balfouriana. No differences in outer bark lignin levels among the species were found. We conclude that lignification in Pinus phloem and outer bark is likely not adaptive as a physical defense against MPB."
https://openalex.org/W3199453319,"Although a significant association between periodontal disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has been reported, their cause-to-effect relationship remains controversial. This randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of advanced self-care on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-related vascular function markers flow-mediated brachial artery dilatation (FMD) and serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) level in patients with early-stage periodontal disease. The study was designed as a parallel group, 3-month follow-up, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The control group received standard care for periodontal diseases, whereas the test group additionally applied disinfectant using a custom-fabricated prescription tray for advanced self-care twice a day. Overall, 110 patients provided data for FMD and serum ADMA level. No significant improvements in FMD were observed in the control (mean increase, -0.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0-0.8; P = 0.805) or test (mean increase, -0.3%; 95% CI, -1.1-0.4; P = 0.398) group. No significant changes in serum ADMA levels were observed (mean reduction, 0.01 μmol/L; 95% CI, -0.00-0.02; P = 0.366 and mean reduction, 0.00 μmol/L; 95% CI, -0.01-0.01; P = 0.349, respectively). No significant between-group differences were found in FMD (mean difference, -0.2%; 95% CI, -1.4-0.9; p = 0.708) or serum ADMA levels (mean difference, 0.01 nmol/L; 95% CI, -0.00-0.03; p = 0.122). Significant improvements in the average probing pocket depth were observed in the control and test groups. The bleeding on probing score in the test group was significantly reduced, while that in the control group was reduced, although not significantly. Periodontal care for a 3-month duration did not provide better endothelial function although improvements of periodontal status in patients with early-stage periodontal diseases.

https://openalex.org/W3199785563,"Indiscriminate use of antibiotics to treat infections that are of viral origin contributes to unnecessary use which potentially may induce resistance in commensal bacteria. To counteract this a number of host gene transcriptional studies have been conducted to identify genes that are differently expressed during bacterial and viral infections in humans, and thus could be used as a tool to base decisions on the use of antibiotics. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the potential of a selection of genes that have been considered biomarkers in humans, to differentially diagnose bacterial from viral infections in the pig. First porcine PBMC were induced with six toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (FliC, LPS, ODN 2216, Pam3CSK4, poly I:C, R848) to mimic host gene expression induced by bacterial or viral pathogens, or exposed to heat-killed Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or a split influenza virus. Genes that were differentially expressed between bacterial and viral inducers were further evaluated on clinical material comprising eleven healthy pigs, and six pigs infected with A. pleuropneumoniae. This comprised three virally upregulated genes (IFI44L, MxA, RSAD2) and four bacterially upregulated genes (IL-1β, IL-8, FAM89A, S100PBP). All six infected pigs could be differentially diagnosed to healthy pigs using a host gene transcription assay based on the geometric average of the bacterially induced genes IL-8 and S100PBP over that of the virally induced gene MxA."
https://openalex.org/W3200612401,"Given a set of sequences comprised of time-ordered events, sequential pattern mining is useful to identify frequent subsequences from different sequences or within the same sequence. However, in sport, these techniques cannot determine the importance of particular patterns of play to good or bad outcomes, which is often of greater interest to coaches and performance analysts. In this study, we apply a recently proposed supervised sequential pattern mining algorithm called safe pattern pruning (SPP) to 490 labelled event sequences representing passages of play from one rugby team's matches in the 2018 Japan Top League season. We obtain patterns that are the most discriminative between scoring and non-scoring outcomes from both the team's and opposition teams' perspectives using SPP, and compare these with the most frequent patterns obtained with well-known unsupervised sequential pattern mining algorithms when applied to subsets of the original dataset, split on the label. From our obtained results, line breaks, successful line-outs, regained kicks in play, repeated phase-breakdown play, and failed exit plays by the opposition team were found to be the patterns that discriminated most between the team scoring and not scoring. Opposition team line breaks, errors made by the team, opposition team line-outs, and repeated phase-breakdown play by the opposition team were found to be the patterns that discriminated most between the opposition team scoring and not scoring. It was also found that, probably because of the supervised nature and pruning/safe-screening mechanisms of SPP, compared to the patterns obtained by the unsupervised methods, those obtained by SPP were more sophisticated in terms of containing a greater variety of events, and when interpreted, the SPP-obtained patterns would also be more useful for coaches and performance analysts."
https://openalex.org/W3201447655,"This first-in-human study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) equivalence between HD204 and the European Union (EU)-sourced bevacizumab, between HD204 and the United States of America (US)-sourced bevacizumab, and between EU-sourced and US-sourced bevacizumab (NCT03390673).In this randomized, double-blind, 3-way parallel group, single-dose comparative PK study, healthy male subjects were randomized to receive a single 1 mg/kg intravenous dose of HD204, EU-sourced bevacizumab or US-sourced bevacizumab. PK parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods. PK equivalence was determined using the pre-defined equivalence margin of 0.8-1.25 in terms of AUC(0-∞) for the pairwise comparisons.Baseline demographics for the 119 randomized subjects were similar across the three groups. The 90% CIs for the ratio of the geometric means of HD204 to US-sourced bevacizumab, HD204 to EU-sourced bevacizumab, and EU-sourced to US-sourced bevacizumab were all within the interval of 80% to 125% for AUC0-inf, thus demonstrating equivalency in the PK properties for all three treatment groups. Similarly, the ratio of the geometric means for AUC0-last and Cmax were all within the 80% and 125% margins, supporting the robustness of the primary findings. All other PK parameters, including the half-life (t1⁄2) clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd) and time of maximum concentration (tmax), were comparable. There was no difference between the 3 treatment arms in terms of vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events. None of the subjects treated with HD204 had positive ADA results.HD204 demonstrates equivalent pharmacokinetic profiles compared to those of both US-sourced and EU-sourced bevacizumab.

https://openalex.org/W3200336080,"Wheat is one of the high-value major crops in the world. However, wheat stem rust is considered one of the determinant threats to wheat production in Ethiopia and the world. So this study was conducted to assess the disease intensity, seasonal distribution dynamics pattern, the genetic variability of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici , and to determine the virulence spectrum in the irrigated ecology of the Awash River Basin. Totally 137 wheat farms were evaluated, from 2014/15–2019/20 in six districts representing the Upper, Middle, and Lower Awash River Basin. Farm plots were assessed, in every 5–10 km intervals, with ’X’ fashion, and data on disease incidence, severity, healthy plants were counted and recorded. Diseased samples were collected from the diseased wheat stem by Puccinia graminis physiological and genetic race analysis. The seasonal trend of stem rust disease progress showed its importance to infer the future progresses of the disease for the country’s potential production plan of irrigated wheat. The result revealed that the disease prevalence, disease incidence, and severity were significantly varied; among the different districts and seasons in the two regions. The survey results also indicated that about 71.7% of the wheat fields were affected by stem rust during the 2018/19 growing period. The disease’s overall incidence and mean severity during the same season were 49.02% and 29.27%, respectively. In 2019/20, about 63.7% of the wheat fields were affected by stem rust, disease incidence 30.97%, and severity 17.22% were lower than the previous season. In 2019/20, even though seasonal disease distribution decreased, the spatial distribution was expanding in Afambo and Dubti districts. Four, stem rust dominant races were identified (TTTTF, TKTTF TKKTF, and TTKTF) by physiological and genetic race analysis during 2018/19 and one additional race (TKPTF) in 2019/20, production year. The result indicated that the races are highly virulent and affect most Sr genes except Sr31 and Sr24. From the race analysis result, TTTTF, and TKKTF have the broadest virulence spectrum race, which affects 90% of the Sr genes. Generally, we can conclude that the spatial and seasonal distribution of the disease is expanding. Most of the races in the irrigated areas in the Basin were similar to that of rain-fed wheat production belts in Ethiopia, so care must be given, to effective management of the diseases, in both production ecologies towards controlling the spore pressure than race variability. Therefore, these findings provide inputs for wheat producers to reduce the spread and disease’ damage in the irrigated ecologies of Ethiopia. Also, it gives an insight for breeders to think about the breeding program in their crossing lines."
