Using a theoretical model, Mougi and Kondoh (p. 349 ; see the Perspective by Boyd ) show that the diversity of ecological relationship helps a biological community to be stable and thus may be key to the maintenance of biodiversity itself."

https://openalex.org/W2018041848,"Mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH1 and IDH2, have been reported in gliomas, myeloid leukemias, chondrosarcomas and thyroid cancer. We discovered IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 34 of 326 (10%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Tumor with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 had lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher 5-methylcytosine levels, as well as increased dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were associated with longer overall survival (P=0.028) and were independently associated with a longer time to tumor recurrence after intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma resection in multivariate analysis (P=0.021). IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were significantly associated with increased levels of p53 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, but no mutations in the p53 gene were found, suggesting that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 may cause a stress that leads to p53 activation. We identified 2309 genes that were significantly hypermethylated in 19 cholangiocarcinomas with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, compared with cholangiocarcinomas without these mutations. Hypermethylated CpG sites were significantly enriched in CpG shores and upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting a global regulation of transcriptional potential. Half of the hypermethylated genes overlapped with DNA hypermethylation in IDH1-mutant gliobastomas, suggesting the existence of a common set of genes whose expression may be affected by mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in different types of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2071729965,"Sex Chromosome Evolution The fly genus Drosophilia has repeatedly generated evolutionarily new sex chromosomes. To understand the changes shaping the X and Y chromosomes, Zhou and Bachtrog (p. 341 ), sequenced the genome of D. miranda , which formed neo-X and neo-Y chromosomes approximately 1 million years ago. The data illuminate the ongoing conflict between selection for male and female function on the sex chromosomes and show that Y chromosome evolution is characterized both by a loss of gene function and selection for male-specific adaptations in genes beneficial to male functions."
https://openalex.org/W1990958957,"The microRNA miR-125b is multi-faceted, with the ability to function as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the cellular context. To date, the pro-apoptotic role of miR-125b and its underlying mechanisms are unexplored. In this study, both gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that miR-125b expression not only induced spontaneous apoptosis in various cell lines derived from the liver, lung and colorectal cancers, but also sensitized cancer cells to diverse apoptotic stimuli, including nutrient starvation and chemotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-125b was a frequent event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and the miR-125b level was positively associated with the rate of apoptosis in HCC tissues. Subsequent investigations identified Mcl-1, Bcl-w and interleukin (IL)-6R as direct targets of miR-125b. Restoration of miR-125b expression not only diminished the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-w directly but also indirectly reduced the Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL levels by attenuating IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling. Consistent with these findings, introduction of miR-125b reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted the cleavage of pro-caspase-3. These data indicate that miR-125b may promote apoptosis by suppressing the anti-apoptotic molecules of the Bcl-2 family and miR-125b downregulation may facilitate tumor development by conferring upon cells the capability to survive under conditions of nutrient deprivation and chemotherapeutic treatment. Our findings highlight the importance of miR-125b in the regulation of apoptosis and suggest miR-125b as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2047339071,"Evidence from confocal microscopic reconstruction of maize anther development in fertile, mac1 (excess germ cells), and msca1 (no germ cells) flowers indicates that the male germ line is multiclonal and uses the MAC1 protein to organize the somatic niche. Furthermore, we identified redox status as a determinant of germ cell fate, defining a mechanism distinct from the animal germ cell lineage. Decreasing oxygen or H(2)O(2) increases germ cell numbers, stimulates superficial germ cell formation, and rescues germinal differentiation in msca1 flowers. Conversely, oxidizing environments inhibit germ cell specification and cause ectopic differentiation in deeper tissues. We propose that hypoxia, arising naturally within growing anther tissue, acts as a positional cue to set germ cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2078662153,"Heat shock proteins Hsp90 and Hsp70 facilitate protein folding but can also direct proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The mechanisms regulating these opposite activities involve Hsp binding to co-chaperones including CHIP and HOP at their C-termini. We demonstrated that the extreme C-termini of Hsp70 and Hsp90 contain phosphorylation sites targeted by kinases including CK1, CK2 and GSK3-β in vitro. The phosphorylation of Hsp90 and Hsp70 prevents binding to CHIP and thus enhances binding to HOP. Highly proliferative cells contain phosphorylated chaperones in complex with HOP and phospho-mimetic and non-phosphorylable Hsp mutant proteins show that phosphorylation is directly associated with increased proliferation rate. We also demonstrate that primary human cancers contain high levels of phosphorylated chaperones and show increased levels of HOP protein and mRNA. These data identify C-terminal phosphorylation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 as a switch for regulating co-chaperone binding and indicate that cancer cells possess an elevated protein folding environment by the concerted action of co-chaperone expression and chaperone modifications. In addition to identifying the pathway responsible for regulating chaperone-mediated protein folding/degradation balances in normal cells, the data provide novel mechanisms to account for the aberrant chaperone activities observed in human cancer cells and have implications for the application of anti-chaperone therapies in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2069957357,"Lysosomal Amino Acid Transporter Cystinosis is characterized by intralysosomal accumulation of free cystine, which results in age-dependent problems in the kidney, muscle, retina, and central nervous system. The disease-causing gene encodes a lysosomal cystine transporter. The most effective therapeutic agent for cystinosis, cysteamine, depletes lysosomal free cystine by converting it to cysteine and the mixed disulfide cysteine-cysteamine, which can then be exported from lysosomes as a lysine analog through a putative lysine/cationic amino acid transporter. Using an unbiased genetic screen for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with increased accumulation of apoptotic cells or autophagosomes, Liu et al. (p. 351 ) now reveal the molecular identity of a lysosomal lysine/arginine transporter that plays a role in maintaining lysosome function and amino acid homeostasis and that can explain how cysteamine alleviates a lysosomal storage disease."

Microscopically, however, the field strengths attainable by human construction act as just a small perturbation on the Coulombic forces that bind atoms into molecules. Lange et al. (p. 327 ; see the Perspective by Schmelcher ) used theoretical calculations to examine atomic behavior in environments very close to certain stars, where magnetic fields exceed those attainable on Earth by factors of 10,000 or more. The results predict a distinct type of chemical bonding in which spin-parallel hydrogen atoms or ground-state helium atoms are drawn together into pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1974777081,"Cancer progression, response to therapy and metastasis depend on tumor microenvironment. Integrins are cell-adhesion receptors that mediate interactions of cells with extracellular matrix. The αv-β-family of integrins contributes to tumorigenesis, response to therapy and cancer stem cell biology. Thus, understanding the function of specific integrins in cancer is critical for the development of therapeutic approaches targeting integrins. The study investigated the role of integrin β5 in breast carcinomas by depleting integrin β5 using RNA interference and reexpression of integrin β5. Depletion of integrin β5 in triple-negative breast carcinoma cells markedly reduced tumor take, growth and tumor angiogenesis, whereas reexpression of integrin β5 rescued this phenotype. Reduction in tumor angiogenesis is associated with lower expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A in integrin β5-depleted tumors. Tumor cells deficient in integrin β5 have lower migration and proliferative capacities. Biochemical assays revealed that integrin β5 mediates the Src-focal adhesion kinase and MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling events that operate independently, and inhibition of these pathways phenocopies integrin β5 deficiency. Breast carcinoma cells express high levels of integrin β5, whereas expression of integrin β3 is limited to stromal compartments and integrin β6 is lost in metastatic cells. Together, these findings show a critical role for integrin β5 in the tumorigenic potential of breast carcinoma cells and therapeutic targeting of integrin β5 is especially attractive for triple-negative breast carcinomas, which are refractory to most of the current therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2031964522,"A Different Spin Transistor A typical transistor consists of a source and a drain; the current that makes it to the drain is controlled by applying voltage to the third terminal, called the gate. In spin-based electronics, where spin current is used instead of charge, the source and the drain are ferromagnetic materials connected by a narrow semiconducting channel. This design, however, suffers from low efficiency. Betthausen et al. (p. 324 ; see the Perspective by Žutić and Lee ) combined homogeneous and helical magnetic fields to change the orientation of the spin on its way to the drain, preserving spin information over distances many times the spin mean free path. The transistor is “on” when the transport is adiabatic—i.e., slow enough for the spin to be able to adapt to the local magnetic field—and “off” otherwise."

Recently, elegant work from the Melchior laboratory uncovered the RanBP2 mechanism of action (12Werner A. Flotho A. Melchior F.

Interestingly, the fragment known to exert the most potent E3 ligase activity is precluded to exert any activity because of the nature of its interaction with sumoylated RanGAP-Ubc9 (12Werner A.

While multi-subunit E3 ligases have long been known in the ubiquitin field, work dealing with RanBP2/sumoylated RanGAP/Ubc9 as a multi-subunit SUMO E3 shows that all in vitro data should, in principle, be accompanied by a careful determination of the in vivo effect of an E3. In this line, Pc2 is known to have little effect on protein sumoylation in vitro, while its effect on substrates like CtBP1 are very robust in living cells (7Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D.

Whereas the functional consequences of sumoylation vary, generally resulting from altered protein-protein interactions, sumoylated proteins are involved in a wide range of processes, including DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and gene expression (1Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Concepts in sumoylation: a decade on.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 14Ulrich H.D. The SUMO system: an overview.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 497: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the largest groups of SUMO-modified proteins is that of transcription factors, whose sumoylation is usually associated with transcriptional repression (15Garcia-Dominguez M.

This repressive role has been attributed to the SUMO-mediated recruitment of HDAC proteins (18Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D.

However, in a few cases, sumoylation of gene-specific transcription factors is associated with transcriptional activation (21Guo B. Sharrocks A.D. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling initiates a dynamic interplay between sumoylation and ubiquitination to regulate the activity of the transcriptional activator PEA3.Mol.

Thus, the transcriptional outcome of sumoylation of a certain protein is not predictable. small ubiquitin-related modifier heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein large intergenic noncoding RNA. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is an evolutionarily conserved factor found in the nucleus and cytoplasm that was initially discovered as a component of hnRNP complexes (24Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Characterization and primary structure of the poly(C)-binding heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex K protein.Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is a multifaceted protein involved in different steps along mRNA metabolism (25Bomsztyk K. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. hnRNP K: one protein multiple processes.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hnRNP K cooperates with p53 in transcriptional activation of cell-cycle arrest genes such as 14-3-3σ, GADD45, and p21, in response to DNA damage (26Moumen A. Masterson P. O'Connor M.J. Jackson S.P. hnRNP K: an HDM2 target and transcriptional coactivator of p53 in response to DNA damage.Cell. 2005; 123: 1065-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-p53 axis represents the most studied DNA damage response signaling pathway, whereby p53 acts as a gatekeeper of tumor suppression (27Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5808) Google Scholar). Several stimuli known to affect DNA integrity, and thus threatening cell survival, trigger the activation of this cascade leading to the regulation of a plethora of p53 target genes (28Beckerman R. Prives C. Transcriptional regulation by p53.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000935Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 29Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the Light: The Growing Complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). The outcome of p53 activation in cells ranges from a reversible cell-cycle arrest and induction of DNA repair to more drastic responses such as cell death by apoptosis or senescence (29Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the Light: The Growing Complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). Importantly, hnRNP K is crucial for ionizing irradiation-induced cell cycle arrest and serves as a transcriptional cofactor for p53 (26Moumen A. Masterson P. O'Connor M.J. Jackson S.P. hnRNP K: an HDM2 target and transcriptional coactivator of p53 in response to DNA damage.Cell. 2005; 123: 1065-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that hnRNP K interacts with the large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA)-p21, and this interaction is required for transcriptional regulation of p53 target genes (30Huarte M. Guttman M. Feldser D. Garber M. Koziol M.J. Kenzelmann-Broz D. Khalil A.M. Zuk O. Amit I. Rabani M. Attardi L.D. Regev A. Lander E.S. Jacks T. Rinn J.L. A large intergenic noncoding RNA induced by p53 mediates global gene repression in the p53 response.Cell. 2010; 142: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). hnRNP K ubiquitylation and its role in the DNA damage response have been established (26Moumen A. Masterson P. O'Connor M.J. Jackson S.P. hnRNP K: an HDM2 target and transcriptional coactivator of p53 in response to DNA damage.Cell. 2005; 123: 1065-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and hnRNP K was also reported to be a SUMO target (31Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Sumoylation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, zinc finger proteins, and nuclear pore complex proteins: a proteomic analysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of hnRNP K in the DNA damage response is puzzling, and the mechanistic aspects that regulate its role are still poorly understood. Given current knowledge on the role of SUMO conjugation in the DNA damage response, we decided to study SUMO conjugation to hnRNP K (32Bergink S. Jentsch S. Principles of ubiquitin and SUMO modifications in DNA repair.Nature. 2009; 458: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In the present report, we confirm hnRNP K as a sumoylation substrate and map its target lysine, 422, located within the C-terminal KH3 domain. Furthermore, we characterize the polycomb protein Pc2 as the E3 ligase for hnRNP K and present evidence that SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation do not affect each other. Importantly, DNA damage, which is known to activate Pc2, stimulates hnRNP K sumoylation. Most interestingly, while DNA damage-induced hnRNP K sumoylation is enhanced by Pc2 expression, it is inhibited by the expression of the ΔSIM mutant, which has no SUMO E3 activity. To gain insight into the consequences of hnRNP K sumoylation, we analyzed p53 target gene expression as hnRNP K has been reported to be a p53 cofactor. SUMO conjugation to hnRNP K plays a key role in its cofactor activity. Intriguingly, hnRNP K-mediated transcriptional activation depends on p53. Overall, we have started to uncover a new mechanism by which DNA damage activates the p53 pathway, adding sumoylated hnRNP K downstream of Pc2 in a new DNA damage-induced, sumoylation-dependent signaling pathway. Plasmid DNA and siRNAS were transfected in HEK 293T and HCT-116 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The sequence of the Stealth siRNA (Invitrogen), which targeted the human hnRNP K 3′-UTR, was the following: 5′-UGUGAAGCAGUAUUCUGGAAAGUUU-3′. The Stealth RNAiTM siRNA Negative Control Low GC (Invitrogen) was used as a control. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the DpnI method, based on Stratagene's QuickChange specifications. The primers used to mutate Lys-422 to Arg were as follows (Arg-coding triplet underlined): 5′-GTCGGGAGCTTCGATCAGAATTGATGAGCCTTTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAAAGGCTCATCAATTCTGATCGAAGCTCCCGAC-3′. The primers used to mutate Asp-424 to Ala were as follows (Ala-coding triplet underlined): 5′-CTTCGATCAAAATTGCTGAGCCTTTAGAAGGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCCTTCTAAAGGCTCAGCAATTTTGATCGAAG-3′. Bold letters represent the mutated nucleotide. Mutations were verified by sequencing the whole hnRNP K cDNA for each mutation. GST, GST-hnRNP K, and GST-MDM2 were expressed in Escherichia coli in E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta, and GST-Ubc9 in M15(pREP4) cells by induction with 0.5 mm IPTG and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). T7-hnRNP K and T7-hnRNP K K422R were purified from transfected HEK 293T lysates exactly as described (33Cazalla D. Sanford J.R. Cáceres J.F. A rapid and efficient protocol to purify biologically active recombinant proteins from mammalian cells.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 42: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining for quantification and purity. Pull-down assays were performed as described (34Pelisch F. Gerez J. Druker J. Schor I.E. Muñoz M.J. Risso G.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16119-16124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm KF, 5% glycerol, and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche)) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatants were used immediately for pull-down assays or kept at −80 °C. Lysates were pre-cleared with 2 μg of GST coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), and cleared lysates were incubated with the indicated GST-tagged recombinant protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in lysis buffer and one in PBS, proteins were eluted by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. HEK 293T cells were transfected in 35-mm culture wells with the indicated plasmids. After 48 h, His6-SUMO conjugates were purified under denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). In the case of HCT-116 cells, they were transfected in 6-cm culture wells and 48 h later treated with doxorubicin (1 μm) for the indicated time points. Transfected cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS plus 100 mm iodoacetamide. An aliquot was taken as input and the remaining cells were lysed in 6 m guanidinium-HCl containing 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, and 10 mm iodoacetamide. Samples were sonicated to reduce the viscosity and after centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 × g, proteins in the supernatants were purified using Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) according to (35Tatham M.H. Rodriguez M.S. Xirodimas D.P. Hay R.T. Detection of protein SUMOylation in vivo.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1363-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Samples were subsequently washed with wash buffer I (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm iodoacetamide, pH 8), wash buffer II (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm iodoacetamide, pH 6.3), and wash buffer III (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm iodoacetamide, pH 6.3). Samples were eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 300 mm imidazole for 5 min at 95 °C. In vitro sumoylation reactions were performed as described (34Pelisch F. Gerez J. Druker J. Schor I.E. Muñoz M.J. Risso G. Petrillo E. Westman B.J. Lamond A.I. Arzt E. Srebrow A. The serine/arginine-rich protein SF2/ASF regulates protein sumoylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16119-16124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), using T7-hnRNP K as a substrate. The sumoylation buffer was 20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.3, 100 mm KAcO, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.2 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). hnRNP K (250 ng) was incubated with 150 ng E1, 100, 250, or 500 ng of Ubc9, and 1 μg of SUMO. Reactions were stopped by addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. One-fourth of the reaction was run in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Recombinant SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, Ubc9 (E2 enzyme), and Aos1-Uba2 (E1 heterodimer) were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. In vitro ubiquitylation reactions were preformed in 20 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT as described (26Moumen A. Masterson P. O'Connor M.J.

Purified recombinant hnRNP K (500 ng) was incubated with 200 ng of Uba1 (E1), 200 ng of UbcH5b (E2), 500 ng of MDM2, and 10 μg of ubiquitin for 2 h at 30 °C and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Uba1 (E1), UbcH5b (E2), MDM2, and ubiquitin were from Boston Biochem. Forty-eight hours after transfection, HCT-116 cells were washed with PBS and harvested in Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured as per the manufacturer's instructions. HCT-116 cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected as described above with the plasmids and/or siRNA specified in each figure and treated with 1 μm doxorubicin for 24 h where indicated. RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center) and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed using MMLV-RT (Invitrogen). cDNAs were amplified using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with SYBR green using an Eppendorf Mastercycler and analyzed with Realplex software. Primer sequences used to amplify p21 were 5′-CTGGAGACTCTCAGGGTCGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAA-3′ (reverse); and for 14-3-3σ, 5′-GCCGAACGCTATGAGGACAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCTCCACGGCGCCTT-3′ (reverse), as described (36Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A. Emerson B.M. Espinosa J.M. Gene-specific requirement for P-TEFb activity and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation within the p53 transcriptional program.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). HSPCB was used as housekeeping with the following primers, 5′-CCAAAAAGCACCTGGAGATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTCGGCCTCAGCCTTCT-3′ (reverse). Given that hnRNP K has been reported to be a SUMO target (31Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Sumoylation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, zinc finger proteins, and nuclear pore complex proteins: a proteomic analysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we performed a first search for SUMO consensus sites within hnRNP K using available software (SUMOsp 2.0 (37Ren J. Gao X. Jin C. Zhu M. Wang X. Shaw A. Wen L. Yao X. Xue Y. Systematic study of protein sumoylation: Development of a site-specific predictor of SUMOsp 2.0.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and SUMOplot], and lysine 422, within the C-terminal KH3 domain was the highest probability site (Fig. 1A). We then wanted to corroborate this finding using HEK 293T cells expressing His6-SUMO-2 and purifying SUMO conjugates by denaturing N2+ affinity chromatography. We readily detected HA-tagged (Fig. 1B) as well as endogenous (Fig. 1C) hnRNP K sumoylation. Consistently, hnRNP K interacts with the SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1D). To further confirm this interaction functionally, hnRNP K sumoylation was evaluated by an in vitro sumoylation assay with recombinant E1, E2, SUMO-2, and hnRNP K. As shown in Fig. 1E, recombinant hnRNP K is sumoylated in vitro and increasing amounts of Ubc9 lead to increased sumoylation, roughly reaching 40% of modified hnRNP K (Fig. 1F). In an attempt to map the target lysine(s) for SUMO modification, we mutated the lysine within the consensus, IKID. Mutation of this lysine to arginine (K422R mutant) completely abolished SUMO conjugation to hnRNP K both in vitro (Fig. 2A) and in living cells (Fig. 2B, left panels). To rule out other putative post-translational modifications to lysine 422, we decided to mutate the aspartic acid residue 424 to alanine (D424A), altering the SUMOylation consensus while leaving the target lysine intact. The D424A hnRNP K mutant is unable to be conjugated by SUMO (Fig. 2B, right panels). SUMO conjugation does not alter hnRNP K stability as the sumoylation-deficient mutant is expressed to the same level as the wild type protein (Fig. 2B, see “input” panels). We then decided to test whether hnRNP K sumoylation could be regulated by any of the known SUMO E3 ligases. We expressed FLAG-tagged Pc2, Topors, and PIAS1 and performed chromatography purification of His6-SUMO-2 conjugates. The polycomb protein Pc2 greatly stimulated hnRNP K sumoylation, while neither Topors nor PIAS1 could augment hnRNP K sumoylation (Fig. 2C). Consistently, hnRNP K interacts with Pc2 in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, increasing amounts of Pc2 stimulate SUMO conjugation (Fig. 2E, left panel). Moreover, in the presence of overexpressed Ubc9, a ladder of sumoylated hnRNP K isoforms becomes apparent (Fig. 2E, middle panel). The ladder represents SUMO chains attached to lysine 422 as all the bands are lost in the K422R mutant (Fig. 2E, right panel). These results show that the polycomb protein Pc2 regulates hnRNP K sumoylation and that forcing hnRNP K sumoylation to very high levels (overexpressing Ubc9 and Pc2 together) exclusively leads to the conjugation of SUMO to Lys-422. Importantly, Pc2 also enhances sumoylation of endogenous hnRNP K, as shown in Fig. 2F. Because SUMO and ubiquitin are both conjugated to the ϵ-NH2 group of lysine side chains, we tested a putative cross talk between these two post-translational modifications. As shown above, while Lys-422 is the major (and presumably unique) sumoylation site within hnRNP K, ubiquitylation remains unaffected in both the K422R and D424A mutants (Fig. 3A). The same result was observed by performing in vitro ubiquitylation assays (Fig. 3B). To further analyze a possible cross-talk between SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation, we tested the effect of overexpressing ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 or the SUMO E3 ligase Pc2. MDM2 does not affect hnRNP K sumoylation (Fig. 3C), whereas poly-ubiquitylation was augmented in accordance with previous reports (Fig. 3D). Of note, mono-ubiquitylated HA-hnRNP K is not affected by MDM2 overexpression (Fig. 3D). Additionally, MDM2 interacts with both wild type and K422R hnRNP K (Fig. 3E). Conversely, while Pc2 stimulates hnRNP K sumoylation as shown above, it does not alter hnRNP K ubiquitylation (Fig. 3F). Thus, ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation occur at distinct lysine residues and are independently regulated. Given the established role for hnRNP K in the DNA damage response, we tested the hypothesis that DNA-damaging agents leading to the activation of the p53 response could regulate hnRNP K sumoylation. The p53 pathway is activated by a plethora of stimuli including numerous DNA-damaging agents. This process has been well characterized in the human colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116, after exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, which leads to DNA double-strand breaks. hnRNP K sumoylation is stimulated by doxorubicin, etoposide, UV light, and camptothecin (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). Importantly, the effect is dependent on Lys-422 (Fig. 4B) and Asp-424 (supplemental Fig. S2) and is also observed with endogenous hnRNP K (Fig. 4C). Then, we transfected cells with His6-hnRNP K, treated them with doxorubicin, and performed a nickel pull-down followed by anti-SUMO2/3 Western blot to detect endogenous SUMO conjugated to His6-hnRNP K. Fig. 4D shows that DNA damage increases endogenous SUMO conjugation to hnRNP K. Although doxorubicin treatment does not affect hnRNP K mono-ubiquitylation at the time points tested, there is a slight decrease in poly-ubiquitylation (Fig. 4E), in agreement with published data for other DNA-damaging agents (26Moumen A. Masterson P. O'Connor M.J.

Interestingly, while we found that Pc2 functions as an hnRNP K SUMO E3 ligase, others have shown that Pc2 activity is regulated by doxorubicin: upon treatment with the DNA-damaging stimuli, Pc2 is phosphorylated by HIPK2, in turn, stimulating its E3 ligase activity (39Roscic A. Möller A. Calzado M.A. Renner F. Wimmer V.C. Gresko E. Lüdi K.S. Schmitz M.L. Phosphorylation-dependent control of Pc2 SUMO E3 ligase activity by its substrate protein HIPK2.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to test whether HIPK2 expression regulated hnRNP K sumoylation. Fig. 5A shows that HIPK2 overexpression stimulates hnRNP K sumoylation and HIPK2 and Pc2 co-expression show a synergism in augmenting hnRNP K sumoylation. We then decided to test the effect of doxorubicin in the presence of overexpressed wild type Pc2 or the SUMO E3 activity-deficient mutant Pc2 ΔSIM (13Merrill J.C. Melhuish T.A. Kagey M.H. Yang S.H.

While expression of wild type Pc2 potentiates doxorubicin-induced hnRNP K sumoylation, expression of Pc2 ΔSIM behaved like a dominant-negative, strongly inhibiting doxorubicin-triggered sumoylation (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, a similar effect was observed with HIPK2: overexpression of wild type HIPK2 enhanced hnRNP K sumoylation (in both basal and DNA damage conditions) while overexpression of the kinase in"

During two-stage mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis, CD151 reduces tumor lag time and increases incidence, multiplicity, size and progression to malignant squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), while supporting both cell survival during tumor initiation and cell proliferation during the promotion phase. In human skin SCC, CD151 expression is selectively elevated compared with other skin cancer types. CD151 support of keratinocyte survival and proliferation may depend on activation of transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription), a regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. CD151 also supports protein kinase C (PKC)α-α6β4 integrin association and PKC-dependent β4 S1424 phosphorylation, while regulating α6β4 distribution. CD151-PKCα effects on integrin β4 phosphorylation and subcellular localization are consistent with epithelial disruption to a less polarized, more invasive state. CD151 ablation, while minimally affecting normal cell and normal mouse functions, markedly sensitized mouse skin and epidermoid cells to chemicals/drugs including 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (mutagen) and camptothecin (topoisomerase inhibitor), as well as to agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, PKC, Jak2/Tyk2 and STAT3. Hence, CD151 'co-targeting' may be therapeutically beneficial. These findings not only support CD151 as a potential tumor target, but also should apply to other cancers utilizing CD151/laminin-binding integrin complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2127565190,"Carbonylation is the covalent, non-reversible modification of the side chains of cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues by lipid peroxidation end products such as 4-hydroxy- and 4-oxononenal. In adipose tissue the effects of such modifications are associated with increased oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation centered on mitochondrial energy metabolism. To address the role of protein carbonylation in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction, quantitative proteomics was employed to identify specific targets of carbonylation in GSTA4-silenced or overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GSTA4-silenced adipocytes displayed elevated carbonylation of several key mitochondrial proteins including the phosphate carrier protein, NADH dehydrogenase 1α subcomplexes 2 and 3, translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 50, and valyl-tRNA synthetase. Elevated protein carbonylation is accompanied by diminished complex I activity, impaired respiration, increased superoxide production, and a reduction in membrane potential without changes in mitochondrial number, area, or density. Silencing of the phosphate carrier or NADH dehydrogenase 1α subcomplexes 2 or 3 in 3T3-L1 cells results in decreased basal and maximal respiration. These results suggest that protein carbonylation plays a major instigating role in cytokine-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and may be linked to the development of insulin resistance in the adipocyte."

Fbxl10 was implicated in the demethylation of H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 thereby removing active chromatin marks and inhibiting gene transcription. Apart from the JmjC domain, Fbxl10 consists of a CxxC domain, a PHD domain, and an Fbox domain. By purifying the JmjC and the PHD domain of Fbxl10 and using different approaches we were able to characterize the properties of these domains in vitro. Our results suggest that Fbxl10 is rather a H3K4me3 than a H3K36me2 histone demethylase. The PHD domain exerts a dual function in binding H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 and exhibiting E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. We generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably overexpressing Fbxl10. These cells reveal an increase in cell size but no changes in proliferation, mitosis, or apoptosis. Using a microarray approach we were able to identify potentially new target genes for Fbxl10 including chemokines, the noncoding RNA Xist, and proteins involved in metabolic processes. Additionally, we found that Fbxl10 is recruited to the promoters of Ccl7, Xist, Crabp2, and RipK3. Promoter occupancy by Fbxl10 was accompanied by reduced levels of H3K4me3 but unchanged levels of H3K36me2. Furthermore, knockdown of Fbxl10 using small interfering RNA approaches showed inverse regulation of Fbxl10 target genes.

Histone modifications including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation are tightly regulated by a diverse set of site-specific enzymes (1Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8067) Google Scholar). Chromatin-modifying enzymes conferring alterations to the chromatin by placing, removing, or interpreting modifications to establish active or repressive chromatin marks have been recently referred to as writers, erasers, and readers of the histone code, respectively (2Upadhyay A.K. Cheng X. Dynamics of histone lysine methylation: structures of methyl writers and erasers.Prog. Drug Res. 2011; 67: 107-124PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yun M. Wu J. Workman J.L. Li B. Readers of histone modifications.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Gardner K.E. Allis C.D. Strahl B.D. Operating on chromatin, a colorful language where context matters.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Lysine methylation has important functions in many biological processes including heterochromatin formation, X-chromosome inactivation, and transcriptional regulation. Histone demethylases confer a hitherto unrecognized plasticity of epigenetic regulation to gene expression programs and cellular adaption in response to environmental signals. Whereas the class of FAD-dependent histone demethylases contains only two members, LSD1 and LSD2, the JmjC family of histone demethylases comprises >30 potential members in mammals (5Mosammaparast N. Shi Y. Reversal of histone methylation: biochemical and molecular mechanisms of histone demethylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 155-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). JmjC family members are able to specifically demethylate mono-, di-, and trimethylated lysines on the histone tails in a Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner. Specifically, these enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of mono-, di-, or trimethylated lysine on histone tails, giving rise to an unstable hydroxylmethyl group, which is released spontaneously as formaldehyde. JmjC proteins are described to be involved in multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes but due to the recent discovery of these enzymes, only little information is available for most of the family members. One of these members, Fbxl10, also known as Kdm2b or Jhmd1b, consists of a JmjC, a CxxC, a PHD, and a Fbox domain. Whereas the functional characterization of the demethylation domain JmjC and the DNA binding domain CxxC are well described for at least two demethylases (5Mosammaparast N. Shi Y. Reversal of histone methylation: biochemical and molecular mechanisms of histone demethylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 155-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 6Lee J.H. Voo K.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44669-44676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), PHD domains are discussed as either histone modification reader domains or as E3 ligases. PHD domains were shown to bind different methylated lysines on the histone tail of H3 functioning as reader domains (7Musselman C.A. Kutateladze T.G. PHD fingers: epigenetic effectors and potential drug targets.Mol. Interv. 2009; 9: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Due to the high similarity to RING domains which are well known E3 ligase domains, the PHD domains were recently also analyzed for E3 ligase function (7Musselman C.A. Kutateladze T.G.

Fbox domains function most likely as an anchor between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (9Frescas D. Pagano M. Deregulated proteolysis by the F-box proteins SKP2 and β-TrCP: tipping the scales of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The biological role of Fbxl10 is controversially discussed in recent reports focusing mainly on its role as a histone demethylase. Whereas He et al. demonstrate it to be an H3K36me1/2 demethylase like its ortholog Fbxl11 (10He J. Kallin E.M. Tsukada Y. Zhang Y.

Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), others characterized it as an H3K4me3 demethylase (12Frescas D. Guardavaccaro D. Bassermann F. Koyama-Nasu R. Pagano M. JHDM1B/FBXL10 is a nucleolar protein that represses transcription of ribosomal RNA genes.Nature. 2007; 450: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In a recent work by Tzatsos and co-workers the authors postulate the option of Fbxl10 being a demethylase for both modifications (13Tzatsos A. Pfau R. Kampranis S.C. Tsichlis P.N.

Whereas slight experimental differences in Fbxl10 expression and demethylase assay condition might explain different experimental results, it is still striking that similar approaches by overexpression of Fbxl10 in infected HeLa cells revealed in one study H3K36me2 and in the other study H3K4me3 as the Fbxl10 target (10He J.

Therefore, we investigated in further detail the role of the JmjC domain and the yet uncharacterized PHD domain of Fbxl10. Our data clearly indicate that Fbxl10 functions as a H3K4me3 rather than a H3K36me1/2 demethylase. However, the PHD domain recognizes both H3K4me3 and H3K36me2. Notably, the PHD domain of Fbxl10 also shows E3 ligase activity in vitro, indicating a role for Fbxl10 in addition to histone demethylation.

Using a microarray approach we were able to identify 131 new putative target genes for Fbxl10 including a set of chemokines, noncoding RNA Xist and metabolic regulators. To verify selected target genes we showed direct binding of Fbxl10 to the promoters of Ccl7, Xist, Crabp2, and RipK3 accompanied by a significant decrease in H3K4me3 whereas H3K36me2 remained unchanged.

As substrate, 1 μg of bulk histone (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) or recombinant H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) was mixed with purified JmjC domain of Fbxl10. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. We used the Tet-Off system (Clontech) for inducible gene expression. The murine Fbxl10 cDNA was cloned into pUHD10-3 with an N-terminal HA tag and a Kozak sequence.

MEF cells (Clontech) were co-transfected with the pUHD10-3 plasmid and the hygromycin resistance plasmid pTKHyg 343 (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were selected by hygromycin treatment (100 μg/ml), and cell clones were analyzed for HA-Fbxl10 expression. For immunofluorescence cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with HA antibody (1:400, 16B12; Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany), Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (1:2000; Invitrogen) and Hoechst. Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit anti-mouse (1:400; Invitrogen) was used as secondary antibody. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of staurosporine, menadione, or thapsigargin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h. Cell viability was measured 6 h after treatment by MTT assay (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (18Lim S. Janzer A. Becker A. Zimmer A. Schüle R. Buettner R. Kirfel J.

Genomic DNA was extracted from a 12-well plate by incubating cells in cell lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% sarkosyl, 1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 56 °C overnight. Pellets were washed with ethanol and resuspended in water. PCR was performed with 100 ng of DNA and recombinant Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers were 5′-atgtatcctttatgatgttcctga and 5′-catgaccatccaccaaacggcg. Proliferation was measured with the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Percentage of proliferating cells was assessed by counting the number of positive cells compared with the total number of cells on 8 visual fields 3 and 24 h after EdU treatment. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described above. Staining was done with the mitosis marker H3S10P antibody (1:400, ab5176; Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit (1:400; Invitrogen). Ratio of mitotic to total cell number was measured by counting positive cells on 8 visual fields 24 and 48 h after plating. Histone preparation was done using acidic extraction. Briefly, cells were incubated in Triton extraction buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton X-200, 2 mm PMSF, and 0.02% NaN3), washed, and incubated overnight in 0.2 n HCl. Purified histones were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Microarray experiments were performed with Affymetrix Mouse Gene St 1.0 arrays using 300 ng of total RNA. Analysis was performed according to Lim et al. (18Lim S. Janzer A. Becker A. Zimmer A. Schüle R. Buettner R. Kirfel J.

ChIP was performed with SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10–15 μg of chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of HA (ab9110; Abcam), H3K4me3 (ab1012; Abcam), or H3K36me2 (07-274, Upstate;) antibody. Equal amounts of IgG antibodies (kch-819-015; Diagenode) were used as control antibody. ChIP after knockdown of Fbxl10 was performed as described previously (19Janzer A. Lim S. Fronhoffs F. Niazy N.

Recovered DNA was analyzed by TaqMan qRT-PCR using the following loci-specific primers: Xist, 5′-tctggtcctcatttggagtacata and 5′-ggtttgacggatagtgagtgtctc; Ccl7, 5′-gattccaagatctgaatccttctg and 5′-acatgatgccttaaagtgtccag; Ccl2, 5′-gacttaaccaaaaggcatgtttct and 5′-agtagatgctgttactccccattc; Crabp2, 5′-ctccctgtcacccaaaagaa and 5′-aggtcccgtttcaccagttc; RipK3, 5′-tgccgcttagtaggcaaaat and 5′-gggtcagtttgttctctgctg; Cxcl10, 5′-tgtcacctctatgcgagatctatg and 5′-aagaggaattgcaaagctaattgt. D5 and control cells were seeded in 12-well plates in normal growth medium. After 24 h cells were washed twice with PBS, and medium was replaced by serum-reduced medium for another 24 h. Supernatant was collected and cleared from cellular debris by rotation. Cleared supernatant was then used in mouse Ccl2 ELISA Ready-SET-Go! (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Untransfected MEF cells (controls) were transfected with Fbxl10-specific siRNA (EMU092751; Sigma-Aldrich) using HiPerfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All star negative siRNA (Qiagen) was used as a control. PathScan RTK Signaling Antibody Array Kit (Cell Signaling) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For statistical analysis one-sampled t tests and Student's t tests were performed. Results were considered significant with a p value < 0.05 and marked with an asterisk. Fbxl10 is a protein of the JmjC domain family which is expressed in three different isoforms (Fig. 1A). Isoform 1 represents the full-length Fbxl10 protein containing the four main domains of the potential histone demethylase. Isoform 2 differs only slightly from isoform 1 in the 5′-UTR and coding region of the gene, still harboring all four main domains, whereas isoform 3 lacks the JmjC domain. The isoforms are known to be expressed in vivo as shown by Fukuda et al. (16Fukuda T. Tokunaga A. Sakamoto R. Yoshida N. Fbxl10/Kdm2b deficiency accelerates neural progenitor cell death and leads to exencephaly.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 46: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest because Fbxl10 research has focused mainly on its role as a histone demethylase requiring the presence of the JmjC domain. However, expression of isoform 3 suggests a potential function of the short isoform other than histone demethylation. With respect to the existing controversial data on the specificity of histone demethylation by Fbxl10, we first tested the capacity of a recombinant GST-tagged JmjC domain of Fbxl10 to demethylate H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 in vitro. Therefore, we purified the GST-tagged JmjC domain and incubated the recombinant protein and bulk histone as substrate. Changes in H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 were detected via Western blotting and compared with an input control. Incubation of the purified JmjC domain of Fbxl10 with bulk histones led to a strong reduction of the H3K4me3 signal compared with the input control. However, H3K36me2 methylation levels were not altered (Fig. 1B). To further validate the substrate specificity, we also tested a commercially available recombinant H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 as substrate. The strong decrease in H3K4me3 and the unchanged signals in H3K36me2 confirm that the JmjC domain of Fbxl10 functions as H3K4me3-specific demethylase (Fig. 1C). Recently, several reports described PHD domains beside bromo- and chromodomains as the main reader domains of histone modifications (7Musselman C.A. Kutateladze T.G. PHD fingers: epigenetic effectors and potential drug targets.Mol. Interv. 2009; 9: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To investigate the role and function of the PHD domain of Fbxl10, we purified the GST-tagged PHD domain of Fbxl10 and performed GST pulldown assays with bulk histones. We analyzed the binding of the PHD domain to histones by Western blotting using methylation state-specific antibodies. Our results shown in Fig. 2A demonstrate binding of the Fbxl10 PHD domain to H3, H3K4me3, and H3K36me2. Other modifications like H3K4me2, H3K9me2, or H3K36me1 were not enriched by the pulldown experiments, indicating specificity of binding (lane 2). To exclude binding of the histone to the GST tag, GST-only protein was used as a control (lane 3). The input control in lane 1 showed comparable amounts of the different proteins. PHD domains are closely related to RING domains (20Matthews J.M. Bhati M. Lehtomaki E. Mansfield R.E. Cubeddu L. Mackay J.P. It takes two to tango: the structure and function of LIM, RING, PHD and MYND domains.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 3681-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which are known E3 ligases (21Chasapis C.T. Spyroulias G.A. RING finger E(3) ubiquitin ligases: structure and drug discovery.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 3716-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent publications also propose E3 ligase activity for some PHD domains (8Dul B.E. Walworth N.C. The plant homeodomain fingers of fission yeast Msc1 exhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18397-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Ivanov A.V. Peng H. Yurchenko V. Yap K.L. Negorev D.G. Schultz D.C. Psulkowski E. Fredericks W.J. White D.E. Maul G.G. Sadofsky M.J. Zhou M.M. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. PHD domain-mediated E3 ligase activity directs intramolecular sumoylation of an adjacent bromodomain required for gene silencing.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fbox domain proteins are also considered to be part of E3 ligase complexes (9Frescas D. Pagano M. Deregulated proteolysis by the F-box proteins SKP2 and β-TrCP: tipping the scales of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Therefore, we subjected the PHD domain of Fbxl10 to an E3 ligase activity assay. Incubation of the purified PHD domain of Fbxl10 together with ATP, recombinant E1, recombinant E2, and ubiquitin resulted in multiple bands reflecting ubiquitination of various proteins in the preparation by the PHD domain. This expected pattern clearly indicates E3 ligase activity similar to the GST-tagged RING domain of human XIAP that we used as a positive control in the same assay (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 6). Replacement of the PHD domain by GST (lane 2) or absence of either E2 (lane 3), E1 (lane 4), or ATP (lane 5) abolished the presence of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2B). These results indicate a dual function for the PHD domain of Fbxl10, linking Fbxl10 not only to chromatin remodeling but also to ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation or signaling. To investigate the role of Fbxl10 in cell physiology we generated a stable Fbxl10-overexpressing MEF cell line. This cell line was generated by co-transfection of a pUHD10–3 plasmid containing HA-tagged Fbxl10 cDNA and a pTKHyg 343 plasmid containing a hygromycin resistance gene. Screening for HA tag expression revealed several cell clones strongly overexpressing HA-tagged Fbxl10 (data not shown). One of these clones, D5, was used for further studies. Overexpression of Fbxl10 was verified by qRT-PCR. Western blotting indeed visualized the Fbxl10 protein of the expected size (144 kDa) which was not detected in the untransfected control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, stable integration of the HA-Fbxl10-cDNA was confirmed by PCR analysis on genomic DNA using the HA tag sequence as forward primer and the Fbxl10 sequence as reverse primer (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the Fbxl10-overexpressing cell line showed a significant increase in total cellular and nuclear size compared with control cells (Fig. 4A). We next asked whether the overexpression of Fbxl10 also affects other important cellular features, including proliferation, mitotic count, and apoptosis. Contradictory reports on Fbxl10 promoting or blocking proliferation (10He J. Kallin E.M. Tsukada Y. Zhang Y.

https://openalex.org/W2077769075,"Bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), including N-palmitoylethanolamine, N-oleoylethanolamine, and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), are formed from membrane glycerophospholipids in animal tissues. The pathway is initiated by N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). Despite the physiological importance of this reaction, the enzyme responsible, N-acyltransferase, remains molecularly uncharacterized. We recently demonstrated that all five members of the HRAS-like suppressor tumor family are phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes with N-acyltransferase activity and are renamed HRASLS1-5 as phospholipase A/acyltransferase (PLA/AT)-1-5. However, it was poorly understood whether these proteins were involved in the formation of NAPE in living cells. In the present studies, we first show that COS-7 cells transiently expressing recombinant PLA/AT-1, -2, -4, or -5, and HEK293 cells stably expressing PLA/AT-2 generated significant amounts of [(14)C]NAPE and [(14)C]NAE when cells were metabolically labeled with [(14)C]ethanolamine. Second, as analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the stable expression of PLA/AT-2 in cells remarkably increased endogenous levels of NAPEs and NAEs with various N-acyl species. Third, when NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D was additionally expressed in PLA/AT-2-expressing cells, accumulating NAPE was efficiently converted to NAE. We also found that PLA/AT-2 was partly responsible for NAPE formation in HeLa cells that endogenously express PLA/AT-2. These results suggest that PLA/AT family proteins may produce NAPEs serving as precursors of bioactive NAEs in vivo."

By monitoring their extracellular and intracellular environments, bacteria assure their most appropriate response for each environment. Post-translational modification of proteins is one mechanism by which cells respond to their changing environments. Here, we report that two post-translational modifications regulate transcription of the extracytoplasmic stress-responsive promoter cpxP: (i) acetyl phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of the response regulator CpxR and (ii) acetyl coenzyme A-dependent acetylation of the α subunit of RNA polymerase. Together, these two post-translational modifications fine-tune cpxP transcription in response to changes in the intracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2080841402,"Sleep length and metabolic dysfunction are correlated, but the causal relationship between these processes is unclear. Octopamine promotes wakefulness in the fly by acting through the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the fly brain. To determine if insulin signaling mediates the effects of octopamine on sleep:wake behavior, we assayed flies in which insulin signaling activity was genetically altered. We found that increasing insulin signaling does not promote wake, nor does insulin appear to mediate the wake-promoting effects of octopamine. Octopamine also affects metabolism in invertebrate species, including, as we show here, Drosophila melanogaster. Triglycerides are decreased in mutants with compromised octopamine signaling and elevated in flies with increased activity of octopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, this effect is mediated at least partially by insulin, suggesting that effects of octopamine on metabolism are independent of its effects on sleep. We further investigated the relative contribution of metabolic and sleep phenotypes to the starvation response of flies with altered octopamine signaling. Hyperactivity (indicative of foraging) induced by starvation was elevated in octopamine receptor mutants, despite their high propensity for sleep, indicating that their metabolic state dictates their behavioral response under these conditions. Moreover, flies with increased octopamine signaling do not suppress sleep in response to starvation, even though they are normally hyper-aroused, most likely because of their high triglyceride levels. Together, these data suggest that observed correlations between sleep and metabolic phenotypes can result from shared molecular pathways rather than causality, and environmental conditions can lead to the dominance of one phenotype over the other."

The postreplicative transcripts are heterogeneous in length and overlap the entire genome, which pose obstacles for high resolution mapping. We used tag-based methods in conjunction with high throughput cDNA sequencing to determine the precise 5′-capped and 3′-polyadenylated ends of postreplicative RNAs.

Ninety RNA start sites were located just upstream of intermediate and late open reading frames, but many more appeared anomalous, occurring within coding and non-coding regions, indicating pervasive transcription initiation. We confirmed the presence of functional promoter sequences upstream of representative anomalous start sites and demonstrated that alternative start sites within open reading frames could generate truncated isoforms of proteins. In an analogous manner, poly(A) sequences allowed accurate mapping of the numerous 3′-ends of postreplicative RNAs, which were preceded by a pyrimidine-rich sequence in the DNA coding strand.

The distribution of postreplicative promoter sequences throughout the genome provides enormous transcriptional complexity, and the large number of previously unmapped RNAs may have novel functions.

The poxviruses comprise a family of enveloped DNA viruses that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells (8Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 2905-2946Google Scholar). The latter capability is dependent on the encoding by poxviruses of highly conserved enzymes and factors for expression and replication of their large genomes. A thorough understanding of poxvirus transcription will provide insights into their complex biology and may improve the design of vaccines and therapeutics based on poxvirus expression vectors. The transcriptional program of vaccinia virus (VACV), 2The abbreviations used are: VACVvaccinia virusPASpolyadenylation sitePRpostreplicativeTSStranscription start siteWRWestern Reserventnucleotide(s)NPH-IInucleoside-triphosphate phosphohydrolase II. the prototype poxvirus, is divided into early, intermediate, and late stages that are regulated in a cascade fashion by sequential synthesis of specific transcription factors, which operate in conjunction with a viral multisubunit eukaryotic-like DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 2905-2946Google Scholar). The early transcription system, including RNA polymerase, transcription factors, capping enzyme, and poly(A) polymerase, is packaged within infectious virus particles, enabling synthesis of translatable mRNAs almost immediately after entry of the virus core into the cytoplasm. The de novo synthesized products of the early genes include the enzymes and factors needed for transcription of the intermediate genes on newly replicated viral DNA templates. The products of the intermediate genes include factors that enable transcription of late genes, the products of which include the early transcription factors that are packaged in assembling virions for use in the next round of infection. Because the expression of intermediate and late genes is dependent on viral DNA replication, they are referred to as postreplicative (PR) genes. Recent experiments suggest that there are 118 early and 93 PR genes with the latter divided into 53 intermediate, 38 late, and two for which expression was not detectable by Western blotting (5Yang Z.

A common, essential feature of intermediate and late promoters is three or more consecutive A residues in the coding strand that constitute the RNA start site. Frequently, the third A overlaps the ATG of the translation initiation codon. During transcription initiation, the RNA polymerase slips, resulting in a novel 5′-poly(A) leader (15Bertholet C.

Although poxvirus genomes are much smaller than those of their hosts, they nevertheless pose daunting challenges for transcriptome analysis by conventional methods. The close spacing of open reading frames (ORFs) maximizes coding capacity but makes it difficult to map individual transcripts. This is compounded by the extensive overlapping of transcripts, especially at the PR stage, which is evidenced by length heterogeneity of RNAs (20Cooper J.A. Wittek R. Moss B.

The heterogeneous RNA length has been attributed mainly to imprecise termination of PR mRNAs and to a lesser extent to 3′-poly(A) tails and 5′-poly(A) leaders. Another factor contributing to RNA heterogeneity suggested by our previous analysis of VACV early transcripts (14Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B.

To evaluate these possibilities, it is necessary to analyze RNA 5′- and 3′-ends with high precision and to distinguish 5′-ends derived by processing from those representing true transcription start sites (TSSs). For the present study, we adapted tag-based RNA sequencing methods (14Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B.

Importantly, the poly(A) leaders allowed us to distinguish true TSSs from 5′-ends produced by cleavage and demonstrate pervasive initiation of VACV postreplicative RNAs. In addition, the polyadenylated 3′-ends were extremely heterogeneous. These data provide new insights into poxvirus transcription, imply the existence of previously unrecognized gene products, and suggest a strategy for expressing new genes from endogenous or horizontally acquired DNA sequences. HeLa S3 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium with spinner modification (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD) and 5% equine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The Western Reserve (WR) strain of VACV (American Type Culture Collection VR-1354) was used. The preparation, sucrose gradient purification, and titration of virus have been described previously (26Earl P.L. Cooper N. Wyatt L.S. Moss B. Carroll M.W. Preparation of cell cultures and vaccinia virus stocks.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; (Chapter 16, Unit 16.16)Google Scholar, 27Earl P.L. Moss B. Wyatt L.S. Carroll M.W. Generation of recombinant vaccinia viruses.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; (Chapter 16, Unit 16.17)Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells (107/ml) were infected with 20 plaque-forming units/cell VACV for 30 min and then diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml with spinner medium containing 5% serum. The cells were harvested for RNA preparation at 4 and 8 h postinfection. Recombinant virus v147-3×FLAG contains three copies of the FLAG epitope (DYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) at the C terminus of VACWR147 ORF. The virus was generated by homologous recombination in cells infected with VACVWR, transfected with DNA, and purified by three rounds of plaque isolation as described previously (27Earl P.L. Moss B. Wyatt L.S. Carroll M.W. Generation of recombinant vaccinia viruses.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; (Chapter 16, Unit 16.17)Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA for v147-3×FLAG was assembled by overlapping PCR of (i) ∼500 bp of DNA upstream of the stop codon of VACWR147 ORF, (ii) DNA encoding 3×FLAG followed by a stop codon, (iii) the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) ORF under control of the VACV late p11 promoter, and (iv) ∼500 bp of DNA downstream of VACWR147 ORF. Total RNA was isolated from VACV-infected cells using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Polyadenylated mRNA was isolated with a Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I. Generation of the Illumina cap analysis of gene expression library, sequencing, and data processing were described previously (14Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B. Genome-wide analysis of the 5′ and 3′ ends of vaccinia virus early mRNAs delineates regulatory sequences of annotated and anomalous transcripts.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 5897-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase treatment removes the 5′-phosphate of broken transcripts. Tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treatment removes the cap of intact mRNA, leaving a phosphate at the 5′-end for attaching a linker. The latter RNA was ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide (5′-ACACUCUUUCCCUACACGACGCUCUUCCGAUCUGG-3′) using T4 RNA ligase (TaKaRa, Clontech). The Dynabeads mRNA kit (Invitrogen) was used to isolate polyadenylated RNA. Random hexamer primers (with a C at their 3′-ends) attached to the Illumina adaptor (5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNNC-3′) were then used by reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) to synthesize first strand cDNA. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′. PCR products of 200–500 bp were gel-purified for Illumina GA IIx sequencing. More than 2.6 and 5.6 million reads mapping to the VACV genome were generated at 4 and 8 h, respectively. Reads with at least 5 As at their 5′-ends were extracted for further analysis. Those reads with 5′-poly(A) leaders that mapped to positions with 6 or more As on the genome were excluded from analysis. Generation of a 3′-end library by sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection was described previously (14Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B. Genome-wide analysis of the 5′ and 3′ ends of vaccinia virus early mRNAs delineates regulatory sequences of annotated and anomalous transcripts.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 5897-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was prepared from polyadenylated mRNA using the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). An anchored oligo(dT)16 primer with a GsuI restriction site was used for reverse transcription (5′-biotin-TEG-GAGAGAGAGACTGGAGT16VN-3′ where TEG is triethylene glycol; V is A, C, or G; and N is any nucleotide) was used for first strand synthesis. After steps described previously (14Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B. Genome-wide analysis of the 5′ and 3′ ends of vaccinia virus early mRNAs delineates regulatory sequences of annotated and anomalous transcripts.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 5897-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the resulting DNA was amplified using primers 5′-CCACTACGCCTCCGCTTTCCTCTCTATG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCCCGGGTTCCTCATTCT-3′ for sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection. The sequencing data were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number SRA054540. The consensus motif of VACV promoters was generated using the multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation program (28Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Fitting a mixture model by expectation maximization to discover motifs in biopolymers.Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates for Western blotting were prepared with SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase or IRDye 800 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and developed using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) or a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Cap analysis of gene expression methods were used to identify the capped 5′-ends of eukaryotic and viral mRNAs. A modified version of this procedure is depicted in Fig. 1. Total RNA was first treated to remove the 5′-phosphate on broken RNAs and prevent their subsequent sequencing. Next, the capped ends of intact RNAs were hydrolyzed to generate new 5′-phosphate ends that could be ligated to a specific oligoribonucleotide linker. Additional steps involved selection of polyadenylated RNAs, reverse transcription, PCR amplification, and deep sequencing. Although the oligoribonucleotide linker serves as a marker of the RNA 5′-ends, not all ends represent TSSs; other ends have been attributed to RNA cleavage and recapping or technical problems in the analysis (1ENCODE Project ConsortiumIdentification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project.Nature. 2007; 447: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (4118) Google Scholar, 29Hoskins R.A.

To surmount this ambiguity and identify true TSSs, we took advantage of a conserved feature of intermediate and late VACV transcription, the presence of 3 or more consecutive A residues in the non-template DNA strand at the RNA start site (16Schwer B.

Mutagenesis studies have shown that the AAA sequence is an essential element of intermediate and late promoters (10Davison A.J. Moss B. The structure of vaccinia virus late promoters.J. Mol.

Mutational analysis of the core, spacer and initiator regions of vaccinia virus intermediate class promoters.J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4710-4719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the propensity of the VACV RNA polymerase to slip on the AAA sequence during initiation of transcription results in a unique 5′-poly(A) leader containing additional A residues not encoded in the genome (15Bertholet C.

In theory, non-templated As could be added during the reverse transcription or PCR step prior to sequencing. However, slippage by reverse transcriptase was not found in a previous study (34Larsen B. Wills N.M. Nelson C. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Nonlinearity in genetic decoding: homologous DNA replicase genes use alternatives of transcriptional slippage or translational frameshifting.Proc.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a threshold of 8 consecutive Ts are needed for slippage by Taq polymerase, and even then the frequency is very low (35Shinde D. Lai Y. Sun F. Arnheim N.

Although 5′-poly(A) leaders had only been demonstrated for relatively few VACV mRNAs, the ubiquity of the AAA sequence preceding intermediate and late ORFs suggested that this is a universal feature. cDNA libraries were prepared as described in Fig. 1 from polyadenylated RNA isolated at 4 and 8 h after VACV infection at which times intermediate and late mRNAs predominate (5Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B. Simultaneous high-resolution analysis of vaccinia virus and host cell transcriptomes by deep RNA sequencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11513-11518Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The 76-nt reads allowed us to sequence through poly(A) leader sequences of about 50 nt or less. The reads that mapped to the VACV genome were filtered by excluding those that did not have at least 5 consecutive A residues at their 5′-ends (Fig. 1). We recovered 126,317 and 503,502 reads with 5 or more As at the 5′-ends that mapped to 1,714 and 2,736 sites in the VACV genome from the 4- and 8-h samples, respectively. A small number of reads that mapped to genomic regions with 6 or more consecutive As were excluded from further analysis. The 4- and 8-h TSSs were distributed throughout the length of the genome and on both DNA strands (Fig. 2). For comparison with early RNAs of which relatively few were thought to have 5′-poly(A) leaders (14Yang Z. Bruno D.P. Martens C.A. Porcella S.F. Moss B.

There was a total of 6,565 reads with 5 or more As at the TSSs, and they mapped to 145 sites located mostly near the right end of the top strand and the left end of the bottom strand (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2038917614,"Centrosome amplification is a frequent phenomenon in malignancies and may facilitate tumorigenesis by promoting chromosomal instability. On the other hand, a centrosome inactivation checkpoint comprising centrosome amplification leading to elimination of cells by mitotic catastrophe has been described in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation or cytostatic drugs. So far, the exact nature of DNA damage-induced centrosome amplification, which might be overduplication or fragmentation of existing centrosomes, has been controversial. To solve this controversy, we have established a method to distinguish between these two possibilities using A549 cells expressing photoconvertible CETN2-Dendra2. In response to various DNA-damaging treatments, centrosome amplification but not fragmentation was observed. Moreover, centrosome amplification was preceded by excessive formation of centrin-containing centriolar satellites, which were identified as de novo-generated atypical centrin dots staining positive for centriolar satellite markers but negative or only weakly positive for other established centrosomal markers, and which could be verified as centriolar satellites using immunogold electron microscopy. In line with this notion, disruption of dynein-mediated recruitment of centrosomal proteins via centriolar satellites suppressed centrosome amplification after DNA damage, and excessive formation of centriolar satellites could be inhibited by interference with Chk1, a known mediator of centrosome amplification in response to DNA damage. In conclusion, we provide a model in which a Chk1-mediated DNA damage checkpoint induces excessive formation of centriolar satellites constituting assembly platforms for centrosomal proteins, which subsequently leads to centrosome amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2010211397,"Although the human peptide-loading complex (PLC) is required for optimal major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) antigen presentation, its composition is still incompletely understood. The ratio of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and MHC I to tapasin, which is responsible for MHC I recruitment and peptide binding optimization, is particularly critical for modeling of the PLC. Here, we characterized the stoichiometry of the human PLC using both biophysical and biochemical approaches. By means of single-molecule pulldown (SiMPull), we determined a TAP/tapasin ratio of 1:2, consistent with previous studies of insect-cell microsomes, rat-human chimeric cells, and HeLa cells expressing truncated TAP subunits. We also report that the tapasin/MHC I ratio varies, with the PLC population comprising both 2:1 and 2:2 complexes, based on mutational and co-precipitation studies. The MHC I-saturated PLC may be particularly prevalent among peptide-selective alleles, such as HLA-C4. Additionally, MHC I association with the PLC increases when its peptide supply is reduced by inhibiting the proteasome or by blocking TAP-mediated peptide transport using viral inhibitors. Taken together, our results indicate that the composition of the human PLC varies under normal conditions and dynamically adapts to alterations in peptide supply that may arise during viral infection. These findings improve our understanding of the quality control of MHC I peptide loading and may aid the structural and functional modeling of the human PLC.

Its purpose is to load MHC I with a high affinity peptide, defined as of an optimal length for the MHC I binding groove, containing an allele-specific binding motif, and maximizing MHC I stability at the cell surface. Typically generated by the cytosolic proteasome and peptidases from intracellular pathogens or endogenous proteins in nucleated cells, peptides of 8–20 amino acids are readily translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Following trimming by ER-associated aminopeptidases 1 and 2 to a length of 8–10 amino acids, peptide binding to MHC I triggers its dissociation from the PLC and export to the cell surface for presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In contrast, suboptimal MHC I assembly, for example upon viral inhibition of TAP, leads to its ER retention (1Lehner P.J. Karttunen J.T. Wilkinson G.W. Cresswell P.

We also demonstrate that the composition of the MHC I-associated human PLC varies, including subpopulations with a tapasin/MHC I ratio of 2:1 or 2:2. In addition, the PLC stoichiometry appears to be dynamic, with increased MHC I binding to tapasin when the peptide supply is decreased by inhibition of the proteasome or TAP. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular composition of the PLC, providing insight into the quality control of MHC I antigen presentation both under normal conditions and during the adaptive immune response, as well as potentially facilitating modeling of the not-yet-crystallized PLC.

The 45.1.US6 cell line was additionally sorted for low surface HLA-B and -C expression using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). T2 cells expressing full-length TAP1 or 1ΔN were sorted for high GFP expression, cloned by limiting dilution, and then transduced with full-length TAP2 or 2ΔN. The resultant T2 variants were selected in complete medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml G418 and cloned by limiting dilution. In all cases, cellular phenotypes were confirmed by flow cytometry and/or immunoblotting. For surface flow cytometry, cells were sequentially labeled with primary and secondary antibody in 1% bovine calf serum in 1× PBS on ice, unless the protein of interest was fluorescently tagged with YFP and analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).

The impact of post-translational regulation of HuR and resulting cellular effects are poorly understood. In the current report, we describe a direct interaction between HuR and Cdk5 in glioma. We determined that Cdk5 specifically phosphorylates HuR at the serine 202 residue in the unique hinge region. The molecular consequences of this interaction are an altered HuR ability to bind, stabilize, and promote translation of mRNAs. At the cellular level, the anomalous HuR phosphorylation at this site evokes robust defects in centrosome duplication and cohesion as well as arrest of cell cycle progression. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence technique confirm a direct integration of HuR and Cdk5 with centrosomes. We propose that HuR stores mRNA in the centrosome and that HuR phosphorylation by Cdk5 controls de novo protein synthesis in near proximity to centrosomes and, thus, impacts centrosome function.

https://openalex.org/W2116046533,"Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway is involved in many diseases including cancer and is especially implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. The key effector protein of the canonical Wnt pathway is β-catenin, which functions with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor to activate expression of Wnt target genes. In this study, we used a new functional screen based on cell survival in the presence of cDNAs encoding proteins that activate the Wnt pathway thus identifying novel Wnt signaling components. Here we identify carboxypeptidase E (|CPE) and its splice variant, ΔN-CPE, as novel regulators of the Wnt pathway. We show that whereas ΔN-CPE activates the Wnt signal, the full-length CPE (F-CPE) protein is an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. F-CPE forms a complex with the Wnt3a ligand and the Frizzled receptor. Moreover, F-CPE disrupts disheveled-induced signalosomes that are important for transducing the Wnt signal and reduces β-catenin protein levels and activity. Taken together, our data indicate that F-CPE and ΔN-CPE regulate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway negatively and positively, respectively, and demonstrate that this screening approach can be a rapid means for isolation of novel Wnt signaling components."
https://openalex.org/W1984774324,"Tumor suppressor p53 is critical for suppressing all types of human cancers, including breast cancer. The p53 gene is somatically mutated in over half of all human cancers. The majority of the p53 mutations are missense mutations, leading to the expression of the full-length p53 mutants. Several hotspot mutations, including R175H, are frequently detected in human breast cancer. P53 cancer mutants not only lose tumor suppression activity but, more problematically, also gain new oncogenic activities. Despite correlation of the expression of p53 cancer mutants and the poor prognosis of human breast cancer patients, the roles of p53 cancer mutants in promoting breast cancer remain unclear. We used the humanized p53 cancer mutant knock-in (R175H) mice and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt-1 transgenic (mWnt-1) mice to specifically address the gain of function of R175H in promoting breast cancer. Although both R175H/R175HmWnt-1(R175HmWnt-1) and p53−/−mWnt-1 mice died from mammary tumor at the same kinetics, which was much earlier than mWnt-1 mice, most of the R175HmWnt-1 mice developed multiple mammary tumors per mouse, whereas p53−/−mWnt-1 and mWnt-1 mice mostly developed one tumor per mouse. The multiple mammary tumors arose in the same R175HmWnt-1 mouse exhibited different histological characters. Moreover, R175H gain-of-function mutant expands the mammary epithelial stem cells (MESCs) that give rise to the mammary tumors. As ATM suppresses the expansion of MESCs, the inactivation of ATM by R175H in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) could contribute to the expansion of MESCs in R175HmWnt-1 mice. These findings provide the basis for R175H to promote the initiation of breast cancer by expanding MESCs."

Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of a 52-kDa fragment containing the acyltransferase domain of Pks13. This fragment retains the ability to load atypical extender units, unusually long chain acyl-CoA with a predilection for carboxylated substrates. High resolution crystal structures were determined for the apo, palmitoylated, and carboxypalmitoylated forms. Structural conservation with type I polyketide synthases and related fatty-acid synthases also extends to the interdomain connections. Subtle changes could be identified both in the active site and in the upstream and downstream linkers in line with the organization displayed by this singular polyketide synthase. More importantly, the crystallographic analysis illustrated for the first time how a long saturated chain can fit in the core structure of an acyltransferase domain through a dedicated channel. The structures also revealed the unexpected binding of a 12-mer peptide that might provide insight into domain-domain interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1993667346,"Metastatic breast adenocarcinomas display activation signatures for signaling pathways that trigger cell motility and tissue invasion. Here, we report that the adaptor protein transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly-1 (Toca-1) is expressed in highly invasive breast cancers and regulates their metastatic phenotypes. We show that Toca-1 localizes to the filamentous actin-rich core of invadopodial protrusions actively degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM). Toca-1 colocalizes with Cortactin, and we show that this interaction is mediated by the SH3 domain of Toca-1. Stable knockdown (KD) of Toca-1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells led to a significant defect in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell migration and invasion. Toca-1 KD cells also showed significant defects in EGF- and Src-induced ECM digestion and formation of invadopodial membrane protrusions. To test the role of Toca-1 in metastasis, we achieved stable Toca-1 KD in both human and rat metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. Orthotopic tumor xenografting of control and Toca-1 KD cells in natural-killer /B-/T-cell-deficient mice revealed a significant defect in spontaneous lung metastases with Toca-1 silencing in vivo. In contrast, no defects in primary tumor growth or lung seeding following tail vein injection of Toca-1 KD cells was observed, suggesting that Toca-1 functions at an early step in the dissemination of metastatic breast tumor cells. Taken together, our results identify Toca-1 as a proinvasive protein in breast adenocarcinoma and a potential therapeutic target to limit tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2019801429,"Caspase-2 is considered an initiator caspase because its long prodomain contains a CARD domain that allows its recruitment and activation in several complexes by homotypic death domain-fold interactions. Because little is known about the function and specificity of caspase-2 and its physiological substrates, we compared the cleavage specificity profile of recombinant human caspase-2 with those of caspase-3 and -7 by analyzing cell lysates using N-terminal COmbined FRActional DIagonal Chromatography (COFRADIC). Substrate analysis of the 68 cleavage sites identified in 61 proteins revealed that the protease specificities of human caspases-2, -3, and -7 largely overlap, revealing the DEVD↓G consensus cleavage sequence. We confirmed that Asp(563) in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) is a cleavage site preferred by caspase-2 not only in COFRADIC setup but also upon co-expression in HEK 293T cells. These results demonstrate that activated human caspase-2 shares remarkably overlapping protease specificity with the prototype apoptotic executioner caspases-3 and -7, suggesting that caspase-2 could function as a proapoptotic caspase once released from the activating complex."
https://openalex.org/W2046940588,"The inner membrane of mitochondria is especially protein-rich. To direct proteins into the inner membrane, translocases mediate transport and membrane insertion of precursor proteins. Although the majority of mitochondrial proteins are imported from the cytoplasm, core subunits of respiratory chain complexes are inserted into the inner membrane from the matrix. Oxa1, a conserved membrane protein, mediates the insertion of mitochondrion-encoded precursors into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The molecular mechanism by which Oxa1 mediates insertion of membrane spans, entailing the translocation of hydrophilic domains across the inner membrane, is still unknown. We investigated if Oxa1 could act as a protein-conducting channel for precursor transport. Using a biophysical approach, we show that Oxa1 can form a pore capable of accommodating a translocating protein segment. After purification and reconstitution, Oxa1 acts as a cation-selective channel that specifically responds to mitochondrial export signals. The aqueous pore formed by Oxa1 displays highly dynamic characteristics with a restriction zone diameter between 0.6 and 2 nm, which would suffice for polypeptide translocation across the membrane. Single channel analyses revealed four discrete channels per active unit, suggesting that the Oxa1 complex forms several cooperative hydrophilic pores in the inner membrane. Hence, Oxa1 behaves as a pore-forming translocase that is regulated in a membrane potential and substrate-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2037805669,"Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis specifically in tumor cells and its efficacy has been tested in pre-clinical models by delivering it systemically as a purified ligand or via engineered stem cells (SC). However, about 50% of tumor lines are resistant to TRAIL and overcoming TRAIL resistance in aggressive tumors, such as glioblastoma-multiforme (GBM), and understanding the molecular dynamics of TRAIL-based combination therapies are critical to broadly use TRAIL as a therapeutic agent. In this study, we developed death receptor (DR)4/5-reporters that offer an imaging-based platform to identify agents that act in concert with a potent, secretable variant of TRAIL (S-TRAIL) by monitoring changes in DR4/5 expression. Utilizing these reporters, we show a differential regulation of DR4/5 when exposed to a panel of clinically relevant agents. A histone deacetylase inhibitor, MS-275, resulted in upregulation of DR4/5 in all GBM cell lines, and these changes could be followed in real time both in vitro and in vivo in mice bearing tumors and they correlated with increased TRAIL sensitivity. To further assess the dynamics of combinatorial strategies that overcome resistance of tumors to SC released S-TRAIL, we also engineered tumor cells to express live-cell caspase-reporters and SCs to express S-TRAIL. Utilizing DR4/5 and caspase reporters in parallel, we show that MS-275 sensitizes TRAIL-resistant GBM cells to stem cell (SC) delivered S-TRAIL by changing the time-to-death in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a combination of real-time reporters of TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway in evaluating the efficacy of SC-TRAIL-based therapeutics and may have implications in targeting a broad range of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2051507033,"The tumor suppressor p53 has been found to be the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers; however, the frequency of p53 mutations varies from 10 to 70% across different cancer types. This variability can partly be explained by inactivating mechanisms aside from direct genomic polymorphisms. The p53 gene encodes 12 isoforms, some of which can modulate full-length p53 activity in cancer. In this study, we characterized p53 isoform expression patterns in glioblastoma, gliosis, non-tumor brain and neural progenitor cells by SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, mass spectrometry and reverse transcription-PCR. We found that the most consistently expressed isoform in glioblastoma, Δ40p53, was uniquely expressed in regenerative processes, such as those involving neural progenitor cells and gliosis compared with tumor samples. Isoform profiling of glioblastoma tissues revealed the presence of both Δ40p53 and full-length p53, neither of which were detected in non-tumor cerebral cortex. Upon xenograft propagation of tumors, p53 levels increased. The variability of overall p53 expression and relative levels of isoforms suggest fluctuations in subpopulations of cells with greater or lesser capacity for proliferation, which can change as the tumor evolves under different growth conditions."

In contrast to other extracellular metalloproteinases of the metzincin family like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; supplemental Fig. S1) for which well established specific endogenous inhibitors have been described (e.g. TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases), the data concerning specific endogenous inhibitors of human BTPs are presently limited and controversial. In 2009, Lee et al. (17Lee H.X. Mendes F.A. Plouhinec J.L. De Robertis E.M. Enzymatic regulation of pattern. BMP4 binds CUB domains of Tolloids and inhibits proteinase activity.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that BMP-4, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, inhibits BTPs in a noncompetitive manner by binding to their CUB domains. However, this result is questioned by a previous study showing that mature BMP-1 is unable to interact with BMP-4 (18Jasuja R. Ge G. Voss N.G. Lyman-Gingerich J. Branam A.M. Pelegri F.J. Greenspan D.S. Bone morphogenetic protein 1 prodomain specifically binds and regulates signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Equally controversial is the potential role of secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) in the regulation of BTP activity. The family of sFRPs includes five members in mammals (sFRP-1 to sFRP-5) and additional members in some species of vertebrates (sizzled, crescent, and Tlc). They are characterized by the presence of two domains, a netrin-like (NTR) domain, homologous to the N-terminal domain of TIMPs and to the C-terminal domain of PCPEs, and a frizzled (Fz) domain structurally related to the extracellular Wnt binding domain of frizzled receptors. Due to this homology, sFRPs have been mainly studied for their role as antagonists of Wnt signaling. However, recent studies have shown that sFRPs are not only Wnt-binding proteins but have a wide range of biological activities (19Bovolenta P. Esteve P. Ruiz J.M. Cisneros E. Lopez-Rios J.

Rather, sizzled was shown to inhibit BMP signaling, thereby playing an important role in dorso-ventral patterning of Xenopus and zebrafish embryos (24Collavin L. Kirschner M.W.

The ventralized ogon mutant phenotype is caused by a mutation in the zebrafish homologue of Sizzled, a secreted Frizzled-related protein.Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It does this by inhibiting BTPs and thus stabilizing chordin, which is both a BMP antagonist and a BTP substrate. Further biochemical studies suggested that the Fz domain of sizzled binds and competitively inhibits non-mammalian BTPs (20Lee H.X. Ambrosio A.L. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). More recently, Xenopus crescent, which is the closest relative of sizzled, was also shown to inhibit BTPs (27Ploper D. Lee H.X. De Robertis E.M. Dorsal-ventral patterning. Crescent is a dorsally secreted Frizzled-related protein that competitively inhibits Tolloid proteases.Dev. Biol. 2011; 352: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but remains capable of interfering with Wnt signaling. These findings reveal a new role for sFRPs as inhibitors of BTPs, but because sizzled and crescent genes are not present in mammals, this raises the question of whether or not this mechanism of inhibition is conserved in this class of vertebrates. In recent years much attention has been paid to mouse sFRP-2 and its activity on Xenopus and human BTPs. Although it was shown to potently inhibit Xenopus Xlr in the initial study by Lee et al. (20Lee H.X. Ambrosio A.L. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Embryonic dorsal-ventral signaling.

Secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 is a procollagen C proteinase enhancer with a role in fibrosis associated with myocardial infarction.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) reported a few years later that, far from inhibiting human BMP-1, sFRP-2 was a specific enhancer of procollagen I cleavage and that this enhancement could promote fibrosis in a rat model of infarcted heart. In contrast, He et al. (28He W. Zhang L. Ni A. Zhang Z. Mirotsou M. Mao L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Exogenously administered secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) reduces fibrosis and improves cardiac function in a rat model of myocardial infarction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21110-21115Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed that high concentrations of sFRP-2 inhibited the cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide and of procollagen I by human BMP-1, and using a similar model, they concluded that direct injection of sFRP-2 in the infracted heart could inhibit fibrosis and improve cardiac function. Finally, a third study from von Marschall et al. (29von Marschall Z. Fisher L.W. Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is cleaved into its two natural dentin matrix products by three isoforms of bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1).Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) found that sFRP-2 had no effect on the procollagen-C-proteinase activity of BMP-1. Given the apparent conflict between the data, it appeared necessary to carefully re-evaluate whether the inhibition of BTPs is a general property of all sFRPs. In this study, we used five different substrates of human BMP-1 to check if its activity was inhibited or activated by three mammalian sFRPs (sFRP-1, sFRP-2, and sFRP-4). All tests led to the same conclusion that none of the tested sFRPs is able to enhance or inhibit BMP-1 activity in the conditions used for the activity assays. In contrast, Xenopus sizzled proved to be a selective and potent inhibitor of human BMP-1, with an inhibition constant in the low nanomolar range. Based on the sequence differences between sizzled and sFRP-1 and -2, its closest human relatives, we used site-directed mutagenesis to map the first interaction surface for sizzled and thus propose a model for the mechanism of inhibition of BMP-1. Recombinant human Wnt3a, mouse sFRP-2, human sFRP-4, and full-length human MMP-1, -8, and -13 were obtained from R&D Systems. Human sFRP-1 was either from R&D Systems or produced as described below. All other proteins were produced and expressed as described below. The cDNA for Xenopus laevis sizzled in the pCS2+ plasmid (gift from E.M. De Robertis, Los Angeles, CA) was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame with a C-terminal V5-His6 tag in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Pfx platinum polymerase (Invitrogen) was used for the PCR reaction, and the primers were as follows (the sequence used to insert a thrombin cleavage site between the sequence of sizzled and the V5-His6 tag is underlined): 5′-GAACATGTCCGGAGTCTTCCTGCT-3′ and 5′-ACTACCGCGTGGCACCAGACATTTATGATGTCTCCACCTCCTTG-3′. The cDNA for sizzled in-frame with the V5-His6 tag was then excised with KpnI/PmeI and subcloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) digested with KpnI/NaeI. The cDNA for human sFRP-1 in the pBlueScriptR plasmid (ImaGenes) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO and pCEP4 vectors using the same strategy with the following primers: 5′-GGCATGGGCATCGGGCGCAGCG-3′ and 5′-ACTACCGCGTGGCACCAGCTTAAACACGGACTGAAAGGTGGG-3′. All mutations and deletions were generated with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The coding sequences for sizzled and sFRP-1 in pCEP4 were used as templates to generate the mutants sizzled-C115S/C159S, sizzled-D92N, sizzled-F94A, sizzled-Q96A, sizzled-K26A, sizzled- S43A/E44A, and sFRP-1-R124T/P125F/Y127Q. These mutants were obtained using overlapping primers with mutated bases in the middle and melting temperatures above 78 °C. The coding sequence for sizzled- C115S/C159S in pCEP4 was also used as a template to generate individual Fz and NTR domains. 5′-Phosphorylated primers were designed to delete residues 138–281 to obtain Fz (numbering includes the signal peptide) and residues 19–137 to obtain NTR. The 5′-phosphorylated PCR products were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase (rapid DNA ligation kit, Fermentas). Similarly, the coding sequence for sFRP-1 in pCEP4 was used as a template to obtain the constructs sFRP-1-Fz (deleted residues 171–314) and sFRP-1-ΔNterm (deleted residues 32–52).

After 24 h, hygromycin B (300 μg/ml) was added to the medium, and selection was maintained for the duration of cell amplification. Protein production was performed in Cellstack culture chambers (Corning) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA) containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin.

https://openalex.org/W2032521343,"Matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding protein (MARBP) has profound influence on gene transcriptional control by tethering genes to the nuclear scaffold. MARBP SATB2 is recently known as a versatile regulator functioning in the differentiation of multiple cell types including embryonic stem cells, osteoblasts and immunocytes. Roles of SATB2 in erythroid cells and its working mechanism in orchestrating target gene expression are largely unexplored. We show here that SATB2 is expressed in erythroid cells and activates γ-globin genes by binding to MARs in their promoters and recruiting histone acetylase PCAF. Further analysis in higher-order chromatin structure shows that SATB2 affects physical proximity of human (G)γ- and (A)γ-globin promoters via self-association. We also found that SATB2 interacts with SATB1, which specifically activates ε-globin gene expression. Our results establish SATB2 as a novel γ-globin gene regulator and provide a glimpse of the differential and cooperative roles of SATB family proteins in modulating clustered genes transcription and mediating higher-order chromatin structures."
https://openalex.org/W2171595113,"TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domains mediate interactions between TLR (Toll-like) or IL-1 family receptors and signaling adapters. While homotypic TIR domain interactions mediate receptor activation they are also usurped by microbial TIR domain containing proteins for immunosuppression. Here we show the role of a dimerized TIR domain platform for the suppression as well as for the activation of MyD88 signaling pathway. Coiled-coil dimerization domain, present in many bacterial TCPs, potently augments suppression of TLR/IL-1R signaling. The addition of a strong coiled-coil dimerization domain conferred the superior inhibition against the wide spectrum of TLRs and prevented the constitutive activation by a dimeric TIR platform. We propose a molecular model of MyD88-mediated signaling based on the dimerization of TIR domains as the limiting step."

Here we demonstrate that ITK both interacts with DEF6 and phosphorylates DEF6 at tyrosine residues Tyr(210) and Tyr(222). Expression of a GFP-tagged Y210E-Y222E phosphomimic resulted in the formation of DEF6 cytoplasmic granules that co-localized with decapping enzyme 1 (DCP1), a marker of P-bodies; sites of mRNA degradation. Similarly treatment of cells with puromycin or sodium arsenite, reagents that arrest translation, also resulted in the accumulation of DEF6 in cytoplasmic granules. Bioinformatics analysis identified a glutamine-rich, heptad-repeat region; a feature of aggregating proteins, within the C-terminal region of DEF6 with the potential to promote granule formation through a phosphorylation-dependent unmasking of this region. These data suggest that in addition to its role as a GEF, DEF6 may also function in regulating mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2020375546,"The maturation and activation mechanisms of caspases are generally well understood, except for those of caspase-14, which is activated at the onset of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. We investigated the possible involvement of epidermal proteases expressed in the late stage of differentiation, and found that the chymotrypsin-like serine protease kallikrein-related peptidase-7 (KLK7) cleaved procaspase-14 at Tyr178, generating an intermediate form that consists of a large (20 kDa) and a small subunit (8 kDa). We prepared an antibody directed to this cleavage site (h14Y178 Ab), and confirmed that it recognized a 20-kDa band formed when procaspase-14 was incubated with chymotrypsin or KLK7. We then constructed a constitutively active form of the intermediate, revC14-Y178. The substrate specificity of revC14-Y178 was completely different from that of caspase-14, showing broad specificity for various caspase substrates except WEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC), the preferred substrate of active, mature caspase-14.

The C-terminal of the large subunit was identified as Asp-146. This is identical with the granzyme B-cleaved activation site, although granzyme B is not the physiological activation enzyme of caspase-14 (12Hibino T. Fujita E. Tsuji Y. Nakanishi J. Iwaki H.

A cleavage site-directed antibody, h14D146, was prepared and found to react only with active caspase-14.

To maintain epidermal barrier function and homeostasis, old and nonfunctional corneocytes should be removed promptly by shedding. This process, desquamation, is accomplished via degradation of corneodesmosomes by a proteolytic cascade of human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) (14Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. A proteolytic cascade of kallikreins in the stratum corneum.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 198-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It is thought that the cascade is initiated by activation of trypsin-like pro-KLK5, either by autoactivation or by matriptase in Netherton syndrome (15Sales K.U. Masedunskas A. Bey A.L. Rasmussen A.L. Weigert R. List K. Szabo R. Overbeek P.A. Bugge T.H. Matriptase initiates activation of epidermal pro-kallikrein and disease onset in a mouse model of Netherton syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequently KLK5 activates other trypsin-like KLKs and chymotrypsin-like KLK7 by proteolytic release of the amino-terminal propeptide. Although most of the 15 kallikreins are expressed in skin (16Komatsu N. Takata M. Otsuki N. Toyama T. Ohka R. Takehara K. Saijoh K. Expression and localization of tissue kallikrein mRNAs in human epidermis and appendages.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 542-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), KLK5 and KLK7 are highly expressed in differentiated keratinocytes (17Egelrud T. Brattsand M. Kreutzmann P. Walden M. Vitzithum K. Marx U.C. Forssmann W.G. Mägert H.J. hK5 and hK7, two serine proteinases abundant in human skin, are inhibited by LEKTI domain 6.Br. J. Dermatol. 2005; 153: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activation and maturation mechanisms of caspase-14 remain to be fully established. Cleavage of procaspase-14 occurs only at the transition stage from SG to SC. Many proteolytic enzymes could be activated at this stage. Interestingly activation of caspase-14 requires a high concentration of kosmotropic salt in vitro (13Mikolajczyk J. Scott F.L. Krajewski S. Sutherlin D.P. Salvesen G.S. Activation and substrate specificity of caspase-14.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10560-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether this condition is also required for maturation, in other words, cleavage of caspase-14 at Asp146. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of caspase-14 maturation. We show that it is completely different from those of other caspases, being regulated by KLK7 and an intermediate form of caspase-14. Human keratinocytes derived from normal foreskin (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) were cultured in Humedia KG2 supplemented with epidermal growth factor (0.1 ng/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), bovine pituitary extract (0.4%), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (50 ng/ml). All experiments were carried out on cells at the third or fourth passages. Human skin specimens were obtained, with prior informed consent, from patients who underwent plastic surgery. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Tokyo Medical University and the Shiseido Committee on Human Ethics. Tissue samples were fixed with acetone and embedded in paraffin. Pro-KLK7 cDNA was PCR cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pQE-100 vector (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) using forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCAAGATCCCTTCTCCTGCCCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAGCGATGCTTTTTCATGGTGTCA-3′. Recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and ion-exchange Mono Q chromatography with an increasing gradient of NaCl concentration up to 0.5 m. Activation of pro-KLK7 was accomplished by incubation with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin-agarose for 1 h at room temperature. Activity of KLK7 is measured using chromogenic substrate, MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-p-nitroanilide (S-2586) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and read at 405 nm. Procaspase-14 cDNA was PCR cloned into the pQE 30 vector (Qiagen), using forward primer 5′-ATGAGCAATCCGCGGTCTTTGGAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTAATCTCCACCTACTGTTTCACCGGGGT-3′. Recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose and Mono Q chromatography. Recombinant procaspase-14 was incubated with active caspase-1 to -10, trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma), chymotrypsin (tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma), or active KLK7. Procaspase-14 was incubated with 50 or 250 ng of KLK7 for 1 h. After SDS-PAGE, protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). The 20-kDa band was excised from the gel, minced into pieces of ∼1 mm3 and digested with lysyl-endopeptidase. In-gel digestion was carried out in the presence of 50% (v/v) 18 O water to incorporate differentially labeled peptides. Peptides were extracted from the gel, and MALDI-TOF/MS analysis was carried out using a BIFLEX III (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA). Cleavage site-directed antibody (h14Y178 Ab) was prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthetic hexapeptide GYIAY, which corresponds to the C-terminal end of p20, according to the method of Kouroku et al. (36Kourku Y. Urase K. Fujita E. Isahara K. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Momoi M.Y. Momoi T. Detection of activated caspase-3 by a cleavage site-directed antiserum during naturally occurring DRG neurons apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). h14Y178 Ab was purified by means of affinity chromatography on GYIAY-coupled agarose. Human caspase-14 was purified from cornified cells according to our previous work, using successive chromatographies (12Hibino T. Fujita E. Tsuji Y. Nakanishi J. Iwaki H. Katagiri C. Momoi T. Purification and characterization of active caspase-14 from human epidermis and development of the cleavage site-directed antibody.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109: 487-497PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the sequence information, a constitutively active intermediate form (revC14-Y178) was prepared by reversing the large and small subunits, ending at Tyr178 (see Fig. 3A). revC14-Y178 cDNA was inserted into the pET 15b vector at the BamHI/XhoI sites. Recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and Mono Q chromatography. Caspase-14 activity was measured using Ac-WEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) as a substrate. Fluorometric substrates were purchased from BioVision. Active caspase-1–10 were purchased from Biosciences. The assay buffer consisted of 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 0.06 m NaCl, 0.01% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, and 1.2 m sodium citrate (final concentration). revC14-Y178 (5 μg/ml, 10 μl) was preincubated in the assay buffer (80 μl) for 15 min at room temperature. After addition of 20 μl of 100 μm Ac-WEHD-AFC, the mixture was incubated for 30 min. Ac-YVAD-AFC, Ac-VDVAD-AFC, Ac-DEVD-AFC, Ac-LEVD-AFC, Ac-VEID-AFC, Ac-IETD-AFC, Ac-LEHD-AFC, and Ac-AEVD-AFC were also used to examine the enzymatic properties of the intermediate form. The activity of revC14-Y178 was measured using a 2030 Multilabel Reader ARVO X3 (Perkin Elmar, Woltham, MA) with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. Km values for hydrolysis of these chromogenic substrates were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. SDS-PAGE was carried out using a 5–20% gradient gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and incubated with appropriate antibodies. Peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare, UK) or anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Pro-KLK7 was PCR cloned using the primers, 5′-GGAATCCGGATGGCAAGATCCCTTCTCCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGCGATGCTTTTTCATGGTGTC-3′ and inserted into pCMV-HA vector at the EcoRI/XhoI site. Active KLK7 expression vectors were constructed using pH3700-pL2 vector, kindly provided by Dr. L. B. Taichman (37Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Tissue- and stratum-specific expression of the human involucrin promoter in transgenic mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), driven by the involucrin promoter. cDNA of the active form of KLK7 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCTGATTATTGATGGCGCCCCATGTGCAA-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTAGCGATGCTTTTTCATGGTGTC-3′. The PCR product was cloned at the EcoRI/NotI sites (pInv-HA-active KLK7). cDNA of revC14-Y178 was first cloned into pCMV-HA vector at the EcoRI/KpnI site, using primers 5′-GGAATTCCATGAGCAATCCGCGGTCTTTGGAA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCCTAGTAGGCGATGTATCCCTCTAC-3′(pCMV-HA-revC14-Y178). This was re-cloned into the pCMV vector at the XhoI/NotI site, using primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGAGCAATCCGCGGTCTTTGGAA-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCTAGTAGGCGATGTATCCCTCTAC-3′. These constructs were introduced into keratinocytes during the growth phase using FuGENE (Roche). As controls, pInv-HA vector was similarly transfected. Dual stainings were carried out 2 days after stimulation of differentiation in prolonged culture. Expression of the mature form and the intermediate form was detected by immunostaining with anti-HA, h14D146, and h14Y178 antibodies. To visualize nuclei, sections were immersed in 10 ng/ml of DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular Probes) for 5 min and washed 3 times with PBS. Normal skin specimens were stained similarly. In addition, tetramethylbenzidine was used for color development of some tissue sections. PLA reaction was performed using pairs of antibodies, anti-caspase-14 Ab (H99) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal anti-KLK7 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and h14Y178 Ab and anti-KLK7 Ab, on sections of normal human skin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody concentrations used were 0.5 μg/ml (H99), 1 μg/ml (h14Y178 Ab) and 1 μg/ml (anti-KLK7 Ab). We first examined the effects of other caspase family members (caspase-1 through caspase-10). None of these caspases showed any processing activity on procaspase-14 (Fig. 1A). Because maturation of caspase-14 occurs in the boundary area between SG and SC, we then tested three nonspecific proteases, i.e. trypsin, chymotrypsin (serine protease), and calpain I (cysteine protease), as representatives of those expressed in this region. Many of the KLKs are trypsin-like serine proteases, although some are chymotrypsin-like (KLK3, KLK7, and KLK9) or mixed type (KLK11 and KLK14) (18Sotiropoulou G. Pampalakis G. Diamandis E.P. Functional roles of human kallikrein-related peptidases.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32989-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Calpain I was chosen as a representative of cysteine proteases and an interactant with caspase-14 in the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) generation pathway (19Kamata Y. Taniguchi A. Yamamoto M. Nomura J. Ishihara K. Takahara H. Hibino T. Takeda A. Neutral cysteine protease bleomycin hydrolase is essential for the breakdown of deiminated filaggrin into amino acids.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12829-12836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Aspartic proteases and metalloproteases were not included, because processing at acidic pH is unlikely and the latter would not be expressed in SG. Interestingly, Western blot analysis using an antibody to the large subunit demonstrated that only chymotrypsin generated an immunoreactive band of 17 kDa that is identical with the large subunit of caspase-14 and with the band obtained with granzyme B (Fig. 1B). The large subunit was confirmed to be immunoreactive with h14D146 Ab. In contrast, trypsin and calpain degraded procaspase-14 and did not yield any immunoreactive bands. We next examined whether the chymotryptic enzyme in epidermis, KLK7, is able to generate the 17-kDa band. When procaspase-14 was incubated with a relatively low concentration of KLK7, we observed five protein bands of 20, 17, 13, 11, and 8 kDa (Fig. 2A). The 17- and 11-kDa bands may correspond to the large and small subunits of the active form of caspase-14, respectively. When a higher concentration of KLK7 was used, the 17-kDa band (p17) was predominantly produced. We were interested in the 20-kDa band (p20), because the size of the caspase-14-related fragment has not previously been observed. This protein band was digested and subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. An isolated peptide containing the C-terminal end had a molecular mass of 2804.33, which is almost identical with the theoretical mass of DSPQTIPTYTDALHVYSTVEGYIAY, 2804.99. Because KLK7 is a chymotryptic enzyme that cleaves after aromatic amino acids, we concluded that Tyr178 is the cleavage site of procaspase-14 by KLK7. Because the 8-kDa band was also produced during incubation with KLK7, this could be the corresponding small subunit of the 20-kDa band formed after the cleavage at Tyr178. The primary structure of the intermediate form is proposed to be as shown in Fig. 2B. KLK7 cleaves procaspase-14 at Tyr178 and generates an intermediate form with p20 (Met1–Tyr178) and p8 (Arg179–Gln242) subunits. Because KLK7 is a chymotryptic enzyme and its activity is restricted to cleavage after aromatic amino acids, it is unlikely that KLK7 itself can generate the mature form, because this would require cleavage at Asp146. A possible explanation is that the intermediate form may itself have caspase-like enzymatic properties. To examine this possibility, we next prepared a constitutively active intermediate form by reversing p20 (Met1–Tyr178) and p8 (Arg179–Gln242) (Fig. 3A). We named this revC14-Y178 and examined its substrate specificity using various caspase substrates. Interestingly, WEHD-AFC, the preferred substrate for caspase-14 and -1, was least well hydrolyzed by revC14-Y178 among the substrates tested (Fig. 3B). In contrast, revC14-Y178 possessed strong hydrolytic activities toward other caspase substrates including YVAD-AFC, another caspase-1 substrate, without showing any marked preference. Furthermore, high concentrations of kosmotropic ions such as citrate ions, which are essential for mature caspase-14 activity, were not required, but even suppressed revC14-Y178 activity. We determined the Km values for representative caspase substrates, VEID-AFC, DEVD-AFC, LEVD-AFC, and LEHD-AFC, as 0.172, 0.261, 0.504, and 0.847 μm, respectively. Next we examined whether the intermediate form can generate the large subunit (p17) of mature caspase-14. When procaspase-14 was incubated with revC14-Y178, we found that p17 was produced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Procaspase-14 or revC14-Y178 by itself did not generate the mature form for 18 h incubation. We also examined the effect of overexpression of this intermediate form. cDNA of revC14-Y178 was inserted to the pCMV-HA vector and expressed in cultured human keratinocytes. revC14-Y178-expressing cells with HA positivity were stained with h14D146 Ab, indicating generation of mature caspase-14 (Fig. 3D). We developed an antibody directed to the cleavage site Tyr178 (h14Y178 Ab). h14Y178 Ab recognized only the p20 subunit but showed no reactivity with procaspase-14. Using various antibodies that recognize procaspase-14 and large subunit (H99), the active (mature) form (h14D146), and the intermediate form (h14Y178), we examined the activation cascade of procaspase-14 (Fig. 4A). In this experiment, we used agarose-immobilized chymotrypsin because of its easy availability and ability to remove activated enzyme from the assay mixture. Time course analysis clearly demonstrated that generation of the 20-kDa fragment occurred first at the very early time points (detected with h14Y178 Ab), and that the 17-kDa band subsequently increased during prolonged incubation (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the intermediate form is generated at the early stage of procaspase-14 activation. Because activation of caspase-14 requires high concentrations of kosmotropic ions, we also tested the effect of kosmotropic ion on the maturation process. Chymotrypsin-treated procaspase-14 was isolated and further incubated with procaspase-14 with or without 1.2 m sodium citrate. The p20 and p17 bands were produced under both conditions (Fig. 4C). We also confirmed that p17 is recognized by h14D146 Ab, although the band was less clear in normal assay buffer than in the kosmotropic buffer, probably because mature caspase-14 is more stable in the kosmotropic buffer. We prepared an expression vector for constitutively active KLK7 and expressed it in human keratinocytes. Because caspase-14 is strongly up-regulated after confluence, we examined the processing of these forms of caspase-14 under this condition. The proform or active form of the KLK7 construct with an HA tag was introduced into keratinocytes and 2 days after confluence, cells were immunostained with anti-HA, h14Y178 Ab, or h14D146 Ab (Fig. 5). Overexpression of pro-KLK7 did not induce production of either the intermediate form or the mature form as judged with h14Y178 Ab or h14D146 Ab. In contrast, active KLK7-transfected cells revealed that HA-positive cells were h14Y178-positive, and most of the HA-positive cells also showed positive staining for h14D146. These results indicate that KLK7 generates the intermediate form and it proceeds to the mature form production in the cell level, as well. Last we investigated the localization of the intermediate form in normal human epidermis, compared with that of the proform and the mature form (Fig. 6A). h14Y178 Ab staining was confined to the cytoplasm of granular cells just below the SC. The mature form stained with h14D146 Ab was localized in the SC, whereas the staining of the proform started from the upper spinous cells, as previously reported (12Hibino T. Fujita E. Tsuji Y. Nakanishi J. Iwaki H. Katagiri C. Momoi T. Purification and characterization of active caspase-14 from human epidermis and development of the cleavage site-directed antibody.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109: 487-497PubMed Google Scholar). Transient appearance of the intermediate form just prior to corneocyte formation strongly supports the involvement of the proposed activation cascade of procaspase-14 in vivo. We also investigated dual staining for KLK7 and the intermediate form. KLK7 was co-localized with the intermediate form at the granular layer, although it showed a broad distribution in the cornified layer as well (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, PLA demonstrated a close association between procaspase-14 and KLK7, as well as between the intermediate form and KLK7 in vivo (Fig. 6C). Strongly confined and punctate signals were detected for these pairs at the boundary area between the SG and SC, where the maturation of procaspase-14 took place. Our hypothesis that differentiation-related proteases could be involved in the activation of caspase-14 prompted us to investigate the activity toward procaspase-14 of representative serine and cysteine proteases expressed in the upper epidermis. Our results indicate the occurrence of a unique maturation cascade of caspase-14, in which chymotrypsin-like enzyme KLK7 generates an intermediate form, which in turn generates the mature form. This kind of mechanism is unique among caspases, for which the activation process is usually initiated by apoptosome, death-inducing signaling complex, or inflammasome (3Lamkanfi M. Festjens N. Declercq W. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. Caspases in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 4Xu G. Shi Y. Apoptosis signaling pathways and lymphocyte homeostasis.Cell Res. 2007; 17: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We confirmed the formation of the intermediate form by raising a cleavage site-directed antibody, h14Y178 Ab. This antibody was prepared in the same manner as h14D146, an antibody specific to the active, mature form of caspase-14 (12Hibino T. Fujita E. Tsuji Y. Nakanishi J. Iwaki H. Katagiri C. Momoi T. Purification and characterization of active caspase-14 from human epidermis and development of the cleavage site-directed antibody.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109: 487-497PubMed Google Scholar). h14Y178 Ab specifically recognizes p20, the large subunit of the intermediate form, and does not react with procaspase-14. Using h14Y178 and h14D146 antibodies, we successfully followed the generation of the intermediate and mature forms from procaspase-14 after incubation with KLK7 and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, in normal human epidermis, staining for the intermediate form was clearly confined to the transitional area from SG to SC, just where localization of the mature form begins. Thus the life cycle of caspase-14 can be interpreted as follows. Synthesis of procaspase-14 is initiated at the stratum spinosum and peaks at the SG. Prepro-KLK7 is synthesized similarly, and just prior to the terminal differentiation, activated KLK7 cleaves procaspase-14 at Tyr178, transiently generating the intermediate form (p20/p8). This form in turn has the ability to generate the mature form, p17/p11 from procaspase-14 (Fig. 7). We also developed a constitutively active intermediate form, revC14-Y178, based on the strategy used in our previous study. Interestingly, revC14-Y178 showed a different substrate specificity from active caspase-14, and this seems consistent with the idea that the physiological role of the intermediate form is distinct from that of mature caspase-14 (p17/p11). It was recently reported that caspase-14 knock-out mice showed defects in filaggrin degradation and impaired barrier function as judged from higher values of trans-epidermal water loss (9Denecker G. Hoste E. Gilbert B. Hochepied T. Ovaere P. Lippens S. Van den Broecke C. Van Damme P. D'Herde K. Hachem J.P. Borgonie G. Presland R.B. Schoonjans L. Libert C. Vandekerckhove J. Gevaert K.

Filaggrin is a source of NMFs, which are essential for skin hydration and barrier function (19Kamata Y. Taniguchi A. Yamamoto M. Nomura J. Ishihara K. Takahara H. Hibino T. Takeda A.

Genetic studies have shown that loss-of-function mutations in FLG, the human gene encoding profilaggrin and filaggrin, are a major risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) (21O'Regan G.M.

Genet. 2006; 38: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). It was proposed that caspase-14 is involved in the first step of the filaggrin degradation pathway (16Komatsu N. Takata M.

Generation of NMFs could be accomplished by further digestion with calpain I, followed by digestion to free amino acids by a neutral cysteine protease, bleomycin hydrolase (19Kamata Y. Taniguchi A.

Thus, defects in the procaspase-14 maturation pathway are likely to result in down-regulation of NMF production. Many KLKs are expressed in human epidermis and some have been suggested to be involved in desquamation (24Jiang R. Shi Z. Johnson J.J. Liu Y. Stack M.S.

However, the physiological roles of KLKs are not likely to be limited to degradation of corneodesmosomes in the epidermis, as various roles have been suggested in other tissues and in cancerous conditions (18Sotiropoulou G.

Bridges between immune functions and extracellular matrix degradation.Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 321-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KLKs are synthesized as prepro forms and processed to still inactive pro forms. Although pro-KLKs are secreted into lamellar granules and further into the intercellular space of the SC (26Ishida-Yamamoto A. Kishibe M. Involvement of corneodesmosome degradation and lamellar granule transportation in the desquamation process.Med. Mol. Morphol. 2011; 44: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), this might not be the case for all the KLKs. Indeed, presence of a PI-6·KLK8 complex has been reported in the cytoplasm of differentiated keratinocyte (28Eissa A. Amodeo V. Smith C.R. Diamandis E.P. Kallikrein-related peptidase-8 (KLK8) is an active serine protease in human epidermis and sweat and is involved in a skin barrier proteolytic cascade.J. Biol.

SerpinB6 is an inhibitor of kallikrein-8 in keratinocytes.J. Biochem. 2007; 142: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pro-KLK8 is activated by the cleavage at Lys32 (28Eissa A. Amodeo V. Smith C.R. Diamandis E.P. Kallikrein-related peptidase-8 (KLK8) is an active serine protease in human epidermis and sweat and is involved in a skin barrier proteolytic cascade.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 687-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They also suggested Lys-specific enterokinase could be involved in this process, because it is expressed at the SG/SC boundary area (30Nakanishi J. Yamamoto M. Koyama J. Sato J. Hibino T. Keratinocytes synthesize enteropeptidase and multiple forms of trypsinogen during terminal differentiation.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2010; 130: 944-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This may indicate that activation of pro-KLK8 occurs in the cytoplasm and its activity needs to be regulated inside the cell. To examine the site for procaspase-14 processing, we tried DAB staining, fluorescence staining, and PLA. DAB staining with higher magnification showed more precisely that the intermediate form localized in the cytoplasm of granular cells, although KLK7 showed broader distribution up to the cornified layer. The PLA method further supported that strong positive signals between the intermediate form and KLK7 were evident at the granular layer. All of these data suggest that the intermediate form is generated at the granular layer by interaction with KLK7. Because caspase-14 is found ultrastructurally in nuclei and keratohyalin granules of the granular cells with increasing intensity toward the transitional layer (31Alibardi L. Dockal M. Reinisch C. Tschachler E. Eckhart L. Ultrastructural localization of caspase-14 in human epidermis.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), our results strongly indicate at least partial cytoplasmic localization of KLK7 in SG. In addition, we prepared cultured keratinocytes constitutively expressing active KLK7 after confluence. Expression of KLK7 in the cytoplasm was confirmed, and these cells became h14Y178-positive and h14D146-positive, indicating generation of both the intermediate form and the mature form of caspase-14, respectively. These lines of evidence suggest that KLK7 is a physiological activator of caspase-14. In some skin diseases such as AD, Netherton syndrome, and psoriasis (32Voegeli R. Rawlings A.V. Breternitz M. Doppler S. Schreier T. Fluhr J.W. Increased stratum corneum serine protease activity in acute eczematous atopic skin.Br. J.

Human tissue kallikrein expression in the stratum corneum and serum of atopic dermatitis patients.Exp. Dermatol. 2007; 16: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), KLKs including KLK7 are up-regulated in the lesional epidermis. On the other hand, quantification of total caspase-14 and active caspase-14 in AD skin in our previous work clearly showed marked decreases of procaspase-14 and active caspase-14 in extracts from both nonlesional and lesional skin (35Yamamoto M. Kamata Y. Iida T. Fukushima H. Nomura J. Saito M. Tajima M. Okubo Y. Momoi T. Tsuboi R. Hibino T. Quantification of activated and total caspase-14 with newly developed ELISA systems in normal and atopic skin.J. Dermatol. Sci. 2011; 61: 110-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Active caspase-14 levels were down-regulated to less than 1/10 of the levels in the lesional extracts. Overproduction of active KLK7 is likely to induce excessive synthesis of the intermediate form. This may result in shortage of procaspase-14 and a decrease of mature caspase-14. Indeed, our preliminary study showed a broad distribution of the intermediate form from stratum spinosum to SG and disappearance of the mature form in SC of lesional skin with AD and psoriasis. We still do not know whether the intermediate form possesses other physiological functions in addition to caspase-14 processing. Whatever the case, impairment of the caspase-14 processing pathway is expected to be associated with abnormal differentiation. Thus, in summary, we have shown here that the activation of procaspase-14 to caspase-14, which is associated with terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, is mediated by KLK7 and an intermediate form of caspase-14, and is different from the activation mechanisms of all other known members of the caspase family."

https://openalex.org/W2112442511,"IL-1β is a prominent proinflammatory cytokine that mediates degradation of extracellular matrix proteins through increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, which involves a signaling pathway in adherent cells that is restricted by focal adhesions. Currently, the mechanism by which IL-1β affects cell adhesion to matrix proteins is not defined, and it is not known whether degraded matrix proteins affect IL-1β signaling. We examined adhesion-related IL-1β signaling in fibroblasts attaching to native or MMP3-degraded fibronectin. IL-1β increased cell attachment, resistance to shear force and the numbers of focal adhesions containing activated β1 integrins. IL-1β-enhanced attachment required FAK, kindlins 1/2, and talin. MMP3-degraded fibronectin-inhibited IL-1β-enhanced cell adhesion and promoted spontaneous ERK activation that was independent of IL-1β treatment. We conclude that IL-1β enhances the adhesion of anchorage-dependent cells to MMP3-degraded fibronectin, which, in turn, is associated with deregulated cellular responses to IL-1β. These data point to a novel role of IL-1β as a proadhesive signaling molecule in inflammation that employs kindlins and talin to regulate adhesion.—Rajshankar, D., Downey, G. P., McCulloch, C. A.

https://openalex.org/W2030426329,"In a number of human cancer cells, K-RAS is frequently mutated and activated constitutively, culminating in the induction of continuous cell growth, a hallmark of cancer cells. It is still unclear, however, how the mutated K-RAS induces morphological abnormalities in cancerous tissues. To investigate the mechanism underlying the K-RAS-induced morphological changes, we utilized an auxin-dependent protein expression system, which enabled us to rapidly induce and evaluate constitutively active K-Ras in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cysts, a model for polarized epithelial structure. Cells carrying the constitutively active KRasV12 gene were morphologically indistinguishable from normal cells in two-dimensional culture. However, in a gel of extracellular matrix, KRasV12-expressing cells failed to form a spherical cyst. When KRasV12 induction was delayed until after cyst formation, some cells in the cyst wall lost polarity and were extruded into and accumulated in the luminal space. With effector-specific mutants of KRasV12 and inhibitors for MEK and PI3-kinase, we found that both the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3-kinase axes are necessary and sufficient for this phenotype. Live cell imaging with cell cycle indicators showed that KRasV12 expression promoted cell cycle progression, which was prevented by either MEK or PI3-kinase inhibitors. From these results, we provide a model wherein active-Ras induces cell cycle progression leading to apical cell extrusion through Raf and PI3-kinase in a cooperative manner. The system developed here can be applied to drug screening for various cancers originating from epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2095051709,"Previously, we demonstrated that the γC subunit of type I IL-4 receptor was required for robust tyrosine phosphorylation of the downstream adapter protein, IRS-2, correlating with the expression of genes (ArgI, Retnla, and Chi3l3) characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages. We located an I4R-like motif (IRS-2 docking sequence) in the γC cytoplasmic domain but not in the IL-13Rα1. Thus, we predicted that the γC tail directed enhanced IRS-2 phosphorylation. To test this, IL-4 signaling responses were examined in a mutant of the key I4R motif tyrosine residue (Y325F) and different γC truncation mutants (γ285, γ308, γ318, γ323, and γFULL LENGTH (FL)) co-expressed in L-cells or CHO cells with wild-type (WT) IL-4Rα. Surprisingly, IRS-1 phosphorylation was not diminished in Y325F L-cell mutants suggesting Tyr-325 was not required for the robust insulin receptor substrate response. IRS-2, STAT6, and JAK3 phosphorylation was observed in CHO cells expressing γ323 and γFL but not in γ318 and γ285 mutants. In addition, when CHO cells expressed γ318, γ323, or γFL with IL-2Rβ, IL-2 induced phospho-STAT5 only in the γ323 and γFL clones. Our data suggest that a smaller (5 amino acid) interval than previously determined is necessary for JAK3 activation/γC-mediated signaling in response to IL-4 and IL-2. Chimeric receptor chains of the γC tail fused to the IL-13Rα1 extracellular and transmembrane domain did not elicit robust IRS-2 phosphorylation in response to IL-13 suggesting that the extracellular/transmembrane domains of the IL-4/IL-13 receptor, not the cytoplasmic domains, control signaling efficiency. Understanding this pathway fully will lead to rational drug design for allergic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012602403,"Oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor are pleiotropic cytokines that belong to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family. These cytokines play a crucial role in diverse biological events like inflammation, neuroprotection, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and development. The family is grouped together based on structural similarities and their ability to activate the transmembrane receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130). The common structure among these cytokines defines the spacing and the orientation of binding sites for cell surface receptors. OSM is unique in this family as it can signal using heterodimers of gp130 with either leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) (type I) or oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) (type II). We have identified a unique helical loop on OSM between its B and C helices that is not found on other IL-6 family cytokines. This loop is located near the ""FXXK"" motif in active site III, which is essential for OSM's binding to both LIFR and OSMR. In this study, we show that the BC loop does not play a role in OSM's unique ability to bind OSMR. Shortening of the loop enhanced OSM's interaction with OSMR and LIFR as shown by kinetic and equilibrium binding analysis, suggesting the loop may hinder receptor interactions. As a consequence of improved binding, these structurally modified OSMs exhibited enhanced biological activity, including suppressed proliferation of A375 melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056821351,"Proinflammatory M1 activation of hepatic macrophages (HM) is critical in pathogenesis of hepatitis, but its mechanisms are still elusive. Our earlier work demonstrates the role of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern-independent agonist for activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB in HM via activation and interaction of p21(ras), transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in caveosomes. However, iron-induced signaling upstream of these kinases is not known. Here we show that Fe(2+) induces generation of superoxide anion (O(2)()) in endosomes, reduces protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity, and activates Src at 2∼10 min of Fe(2+) addition to rat primary HM culture. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) blocks O(2)() generation, PTP inhibition, and Src activation. Fe(2+)-induced p21(ras) activity is abrogated with the Src inhibitor PP2 and SOD. Fe(2+) stimulates Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination (polyUb) of TRAF6 in caveosomes, and a dominant negative K63R mutant of ubiquitin or SOD prevents iron-induced TRAF6 polyUb and TAK1 activation. These results demonstrate that Fe(2+)-generated O(2)() mediates p21(ras) and TAK1 activation via PTP inhibition and Lys(63)-polyUb of TRAF6 in caveosomes for proinflammatory M1 activation in HM."
https://openalex.org/W2083589055,"The lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor LPA1/Edg2 is the first identified LPA receptor. Although its wide tissue distribution and biological functions have been well studied, little is known about how LPA1 is transcriptionally regulated. In the current study, we showed that LPA1 is a physiological target of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-mediated repression. In both normal and neoplastic cells, TGFβ inhibits LPA1 promoter activity, LPA1 mRNA expression and LPA1-dependent chemotaxis and tumor cell invasion. Knockdown of the TGFβ intracellular effector Smad3 or Smad4 with lentivirally transduced short hairpin RNA relieved these inhibitory effects of TGFβ. Interestingly, the LPA1 promoter contains two potential TGFβ inhibitory elements (TIEs), each consisting of a Smad-binding site and an adjacent E2F4/5 element, structurally similar to the TIE found on the promoter of the well-defined TGFβ target gene c-myc. Deletion and point mutation analyses indicate that the distal TIE located at 401 bp from the transcription initiation site, is required for TGFβ repression of the LPA1 promoter. A DNA pull-down assay showed that the −401 TIE was capable of binding Samd3 and E2F4 in TGFβ-treated cells. TGFβ-induced binding of the Smad complex to the native −401 TIE sequence of the LPA1 gene promoter was further verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We therefore identified a novel role of TGFβ in the control of LPA1 expression and LPA1-coupled biological functions, adding LPA1 to the list of TGFβ-repressed target genes."

NAD(+) acts partially via cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and subsequent release of Ca(2+). Treatment of macrophages with the cADPR analog 3-deaza-cADPR or Ca(2+) ionophores recapitulated the effects of NAD(+) on TGF-β1, whereas the cADPR antagonist 8-Br-cADPR, Ca(2+) chelation, and antagonism of L-type Ca(2+) channels suppressed these effects. The time and dose effects of NAD(+) on TGF-β1 were complex and could be modeled both statistically and mathematically. Model-predicted levels of TGF-β1 protein and mRNA were largely confirmed experimentally but also suggested the presence of other mechanisms of regulation of TGF-β1 by NAD(+). Thus, in vitro and in silico evidence points to NAD(+) as a novel modulator of TGF-β1."
