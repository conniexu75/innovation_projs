https://openalex.org/W1981154702,"Coupling between electrons and phonons (lattice vibrations) drives the formation of the electron pairs responsible for conventional superconductivity. The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high transition temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics -velocity and scattering rate- for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity."

https://openalex.org/W1963769676,"The adult brain shows remarkable plasticity, as demonstrated by the improvement in fine sensorial discriminations after intensive practice. The behavioural aspects of such perceptual learning are well documented, especially in the visual system1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Specificity for stimulus attributes clearly implicates an early cortical site, where receptive fields retain fine selectivity for these attributes; however, the neuronal correlates of a simple visual discrimination task remained unidentified. Here we report electrophysiological correlates in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys for learning orientation identification. We link the behavioural improvement in this type of learning to an improved neuronal performance of trained compared to naive neurons. Improved long-term neuronal performance resulted from changes in the characteristics of orientation tuning of individual neurons. More particularly, the slope of the orientation tuning curve that was measured at the trained orientation increased only for the subgroup of trained neurons most likely to code the orientation identified by the monkey. No modifications of the tuning curve were observed for orientations for which the monkey had not been trained. Thus training induces a specific and efficient increase in neuronal sensitivity in V1."

https://openalex.org/W2010294065,"There has been enormous concern about the consequences of human population growth for the environment and for social and economic development. But this growth is likely to come to an end in the foreseeable future. Improving on earlier methods of probabilistic forecasting, here we show that there is around an 85 per cent chance that the world's population will stop growing before the end of the century. There is a 60 per cent probability that the world's population will not exceed 10 billion people before 2100, and around a 15 per cent probability that the world's population at the end of the century will be lower than it is today. For different regions, the date and size of the peak population will vary considerably."

Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,2Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar). Sir2p deacetylates histones in an NAD-dependent manner (reviewed in Ref. 3Moazed D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which is thought to account for both its transcriptional silencing activity at the telomeric, rDNA, and silent mating-type loci (reviewed in Ref. 1Gartenberg M.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as well as its ability to regulate lifespan in response to metabolic rates (reviewed in Ref. 2Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar). Deacetylation of histones is a known mechanism for causing chromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing; indeed, the loci regulated by Sir2p are hypoacetylated (4Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and deletion of Sir2 results in a dramatic increase in the acetylation of the histones at these sites (5Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is believed that Sir2p regulates aging in yeast by forming condensed chromatin structures at the rDNA locus. This decreases recombination rates, thereby decreasing the formation of toxic extrachromasomal rDNA circles, which shorten lifespan (reviewed in 2). Therefore, according to this hypothesis, increasing Sir2p activity or overexpressing Sir2p leads to an increased lifespan in yeast. Interestingly, lifespan can also be extended by glucose deprivation, and this is postulated to be mediated by the NAD-dependence of Sir2p. Decreasing glucose intake drops metabolic rates, resulting in the oxidation of NADH to NAD. Increasing the amount of available NAD increases Sir2p activity, thereby preventing the formation of toxic extrachromasomal rDNA circles. The critical role of NAD levels in this process is evident by the fact that mutations in an NAD biosynthetic pathway in yeast leads to a decrease in lifespan that is not rescued by mutation in the glucose-sensing pathways or overexpression of Sir2p (6Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Thus, the metabolic and oxidative state of the cell may be linked directly to transcriptional regulation of certain genes via Sir2p, which in turn may regulate lifespan.Sir2p represents the founding member of a large family of NAD-dependent deacetylases, termed the sirtuins (7Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 8Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). These enzymes are highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, with five sirtuins in yeast and seven in humans. The sirtuins contain a conserved catalytic domain of ∼275 amino acids, and mutation of the highly conserved residues in this domain abrogates enzymatic activity (7Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Although Sir2p and yeast HST1p appear to be involved directly in transcriptional silencing, the biological functions of the other sirtuins remain unknown, though recently a Sir2p homolog inCaenorhabditis elegans was shown to regulate lifespan in this organism, as well, albeit via a different mechanism (10Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Several yeast and human sirtuins are not localized to the nucleus (11Afshar G. Murnane J.P. Gene. 1999; 234: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Perrod S. Cockell M.M. Laroche T. Renauld H. Ducrest A.L. Bonnard C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Yang Y.H. Chen Y.H. Zhang C.Y. Nimmakayalu M.A. Ward D.C. Weissman S. Genomics. 2000; 69: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins may have diverse roles in the cell aside from transcriptional regulation. Indeed, one Salmonellasirtuin was found to be competent to function in the cobalamine biosynthetic pathway (14Tsang A.W. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31788-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and thus some of these enzymes may have small molecules, rather than proteins, as substrates.One approach to dissecting the biological function of sirtuins in a variety of biological systems is reverse chemical genetics. Rather than deleting or mutating the sirtuin genes in a particular system, a cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor of sirtuins can be used to block sirtuin activity. Such an inhibitor would permit fine temporal regulation of sirtuin inhibition, and thus the function of sirtuins in essential or developmental processes could be studied. Furthermore, these inhibitors should be easily transferable to model organisms or systems in which it is extremely difficult to specifically delete genes. Indeed, inhibitors of the family of histone deacetylases, HDACs,1 have greatly accelerated the characterization of the cellular function of these proteins. For example, inhibition of HDAC activity by the nanomolar inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) produces a dramatic morphological change in tumor cell lines, which subsequently was shown to be caused by an HDAC-dependent transcriptional regulation of gelsolin, an actin-binding protein (15Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, a general sirtuin inhibitor could be used to refine our understanding of yeast sirtuins and initiate investigations into the function of insect, vertebrate, and human sirtuins. Thus far, however, no cell-permeable sirtuin inhibitors have been reported. A non-hydrolyzable NAD analog (carbanicotamide adenine dinucleotide) does inhibit sirtuin activity in vitro (16Landry J. Slama J.T. Sternglanz R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but such molecules are not cell-permeable and undoubtedly inhibit other NAD-dependent enzymes, as well. Thus, these NAD analogs would not be suitable for in vivo studies.Herein we describe the identification of a class of cell-permeable small molecule inhibitors of sirtuin NAD-dependent deacetylase activity from a high throughput cell-based screen of 1600 unbiased compounds. The primary screen was for inhibitors of Sir2p-mediated silencing of a URA3 reporter gene integrated into a telomeric locus. This yeast strain can grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), but the addition of an inhibitor of Sir2p will result in expression of the URA3 gene and death in the presence of FUra. Three compounds of 1600 scored positively in this screen, and two of these possessed substructures derived from 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde. All three compounds inhibit Sir2p transcriptional silencing in vivo, in the context of different Sir2p complexes and at different chromosomal domains. These compounds inhibit yeast Sir2p, as well as human SIRT2 activity in vitro, demonstrating that they inhibit enzymatic activity directly and function as general inhibitors of sirtuins. Interestingly, 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehye and other compounds containing this moiety also inhibit Sir2p activity in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that these small molecules represent a new class of inhibitors of sirtuins. Preliminary studies with one these inhibitors (sirtinol; Sir two inhibitornapthol) suggest that sirtuins do not regulate global histone acetylation levels in mammalian cells and that they may be involved in body-axis formation during plant development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast StrainsThe genotype for the TEL::URA3 strain (UCC1001) is as follows: MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trpΔ63 his3Δ200 leu2-Δ1 TEL adh4::URA3. The genotype for the HML::URA3 strain (UCC3515) is as follows MATαura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trpΔ63 his3Δ200 leu2-Δ1 HMLα::URA3. The genotype for non-TEL::URA3 strain (UCC1003), where the URA3 reporter is inserted in an internal chromosomal domain, is as follows:MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trpΔ63 his3Δ200 leu2-Δ1 adh4::URA3. These strains were obtained from D. Gottshling (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). The genotype for the rDNA::URA3 strain is as follows:MATα his3 Δ 200 leu2-Δura3–167 rDNA::Ty1-URA3. The control strain for this is non-rDNA::URA3, where the URA3 gene is inserted into an unknown site outside of the rDNA locus, has the following genotype:: MATα his3 Δ200 leu2-Δ ura3–167 ???::Ty1-URA3. These strains were obtained from J. D. Boeke (Johns Hopkins University).Small MoleculesThe compounds that were screened were derived from two libraries. The first was purchased from ChemBridge Corporation (San Diego, CA), and the second, an Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology diversity set, consisted of compounds synthesized at the Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB; Harvard University) using diversity-oriented synthesis (17Schreiber S.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1964-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Compound A3 (8,9-dihydroxy-6H-(1)benzofuro[3,2-c]chromen-6-one) was synthesized by Hua Miao (ICCB). Compounds M15 (1-[(4-methoxy-2-nitro-phenylimino)-methyl]- naphthalene-2-ol) and Sirtinol (2-[(2-hydroxy-naphthalen-1- ylmethylene)-amino]-N-(1-phenyl-ethyl)-benzamide) were purchased directly from ChemBridge. 2-Hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline, and trichostatin A were purchased from Sigma, whereas 2-amino-N-(1-phenyl-ethyl)-benzamide was synthesized by Travis Dunn (Harvard University).In Vivo Yeast ScreenGeneral ProceduresSeveral freshly streaked colonies of the desired yeast strain were resuspended in 1 ml of YPDA medium (YPD/0.003% adenine hemisulfate) by vortexing, diluted in 50 ml of YPDA, and vortexed again. A stock solution of 15% 5-FOA in Me2SO was used to produce 0.4–0.8% 5-FOA solution for the TEL::URA3, rDNA::URA3, and HML::URA3 strains. An equivalent percentage of Me2SO was used for the untreated samples to account for cytotoxicity. A multidropper apparatus (Labsystems) was used to add yeast to clear bottom 96-well or 394-well plates in volumes of 40–100 µl. Although this density of yeast in the well was not visible initially, a wild-type strain typically saturated the bottom of the well after 24–48 h of growth at room temperature. To test the dose response on the three strains, 100 µl of the various yeast strain suspensions were transferred to a 96-well plate, and 0.5 µl of the compounds or Me2SO were added. Growth was monitored by visual inspection or by the A600 of the cultures using a Wallac spectrometer.ICCB Diversity Set Compound LibraryA collection of 400 compounds, called an ICCB diversity set of compounds, was screened for activity. These compounds were contributed by members of the Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Chemical Biology (ICCB; Harvard University), and were aliquoted into 96-well plates at dilutions between 10 and 20 mm. For this screen, 100 µl of the TEL::URA3 yeast suspensions ± 5-FOA were transferred to 96-well plates. 100 nl of 10–20 mm compound stocks were manually pin-transferred to these plates, and thus the compounds were tested at concentrations of 10–20 µm. Growth was monitored by visual inspection and scored after 1, 2, and 3 days.ChemBridge LibraryThe screens tested 1200 compounds of plates from the ICCB ChemBridge Library (plates 1–3). An automated robot pin-transferred 40 nl of compound to each well of the plates. For this screen, 40 µl of the yeast suspensions, ± 5-FOA, were transferred to 384-well plates. 40 nl of 5 mg/ml stocks of compounds were pin-transferred to the plates, and thus these were tested at a concentration of ∼10 µm. Growth was monitored by visual inspection and scored after 1, 2, and 3 days.DNA Constructs and MutagenesisThe bacterial expression construct for GST-SIRT2 (amino acids 18–340) in the pGex4T3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was generously provided by M. Finnin and N. Pavletich (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Center, New York).Protein Expression and PurificationBL21-(DE3)LysS cells were transformed with the GST-SIRT2 (amino acids 18–340)/pGex4T3 construct. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.3 in NCZYM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and induced for 5 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at room temperature. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) with a freeze-thaw cycle. 40 units of DNase I (Promega) were added to the solution and incubated for 20 min on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the incubated was clarified with 1.5 ml of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein was eluted by incubation with 10 mm glutathione (Sigma) in JLB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C and twice with 10 mm glutathione, JLB for 30 min. This solution was then dialyzed overnight against JLB and stored at −70 °C. Expression and purification of recombinant yeast Sir2 protein has been described previously (18Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of HDAC1 from HeLa CellsHeLa cells were lysed in JLB containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysis proceeded for 15 min at 4 °C, after which the cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Endogenous HDAC1 was purified from the supernatant by incubation with anti-HDAC1 antibody (Sigma) for 30 min and then precipitation with protein G beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with JLB at 4 °C and resuspended in HD buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) for the histone deacetylase assays.In Vitro Histone Deacetylation Assays1.5 µg of recombinant human GST-SIRT2 (amino acids 18–340) or 0.5 µg of recombinant yeast Sir2p were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in 50 µl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol) (9Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), with or without 50 µm NAD and acetylated HeLa histones (1000 cpm), purified by acid extraction. HDAC activity was determined by scintillation counting of the ethyl acetate-soluble [3H]acetic acid (19Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar).Antibodies and Western blot analysisAntibodies to tetra-acetylated histones H3 and H4 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and antibodies to acetylated α-tubulin were purchased from Sigma. 1.2 × 106 primary foreskin fibroblast cells were plated in 6 ml of DMEM/10% FBS media, and treated with 0.5% Me2SO, 10 µm sirtinol, 50 µmsirtinol, or 1 µm TSA for 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, harvested, and lysed in 75 µl of JLB. The protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by a Bradford assay, and a normalized amount of protein for each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot.Analysis of Cell Morphology100 × 105 HeLa cells were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips and treated with 1% Me2SO, 10 µm sirtinol, 25 µm sirtinol, or 1 µm TSA for 24 h. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and viewed with a light microscope.Analysis of Effect of E8 on Arabidopsis DevelopmentSeeds (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Lansberg erecta (Ler)) were surface-sterilized by treatment with 70% ethanol for 1 min and then 50% Clorox/0.1% Tween 20 for 8 min and washed 6 times with sterile water. The seeds were air-dried on sterile filter paper in a laminar flow hood for 3 h. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.7; Sigma) (20Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53151) Google Scholar) containing 0.8% PhytoAgar (Life Technologies, Inc.) was pipetted into 96-well, flat bottom microtiter plates. Me2SO (99.9%; EM Science) or sirtinol solutions in Me2SO were pipetted into the warm, liquid agar and thoroughly mixed. The agar was allowed to set for 30 min prior to manually arraying the seeds into each well with a moistened, sterile pipette tip (4–6 seeds per well). Plates were sealed and incubated for 3 days in the dark at 5 °C to break dormancy (stratification). Plates were incubated thereafter at 25 °C under continuous white fluorescent light, and seedling development was measured in terms of days of growth after transfer to 25 °C.For unstained whole-mount preparations, plants were placed in FluorSave reagent (CalBiochem) on glass slides and sealed with a coverslip. For staining of the vasculature, plants were fixed in acetic acid:95% ethanol (3:1) for 1 h, incubated in 25% formaldehyde for 2 h, dehydrated for 1 h in 95% ethanol, stained for 1 min in 1% safranin-O (Sigma) in 95% ethanol, hydrated through an ethanol series to water, and mounted on slides with FluorSave (21Carland F.M.

The assay was aimed to uncover cell-permeable inhibitors of yeast and human sirtuins; indeed it led to the identification of a class of molecules that specifically inhibit yeast Sir2p and human SIRT2. The initial screen identified inhibitors of Sir2p silencing activity in yeast, and this was followed by several subsequent secondary assays. First, the three compounds identified in the primary screen were tested for their ability to inhibit Sir2p transcriptional silencing in the context of different Sir2p complexes and at different chromosomal domains. All three compounds scored positively in this assay, suggesting that they directly inhibited Sir2p transcriptional silencing activity. Second, these compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit yeast Sir2p and human SIRT2 activityin vitro. Two of the three (A3 and sirtinol) are inhibitors of both enzymes, with IC50 values ranging from 40 to 70 µm. Third, these two compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit HDAC1 histone deacetylase activity in vitro. Although sirtinol had no effect on HDAC1 activity, A3 does weakly inhibit it, suggesting that it may not specifically inhibit sirtuin deacetylase activity. Thus, sirtinol is the first reported cell-permeable inhibitor of the sirtuin class of deacetylases. Furthermore, because it is competent to inhibit sirtuin enzymes from two different species, it is likely to be a general sirtuin inhibitor and thus transferable between a number of systems.Screening MethodologyThis yeast-based reporter gene assay provides a platform for screening for small molecule modulators of Sir2p and possibly of other transcriptional regulators. The screen is high throughput, requires minimal labor, is easy to score for positives, and does not require specialized equipment. Furthermore, the screen gave remarkably specific results, as is evident by the fact that all three hits functioned in secondary assays. It is interesting to note that though the screen was for inhibitors of yeast Sir2p, both A3 and sirtinol were more potent inhibitors of human SIRT2, thus further demonstrating the versatility of this screening methodology. Finally, because it is a cell-based screen, it is selective for compounds that are cell-permeable and therefore more useful in vivo.Identification of a Class of Sirtuin InhibitorsTwo of the compounds (sirtinol and M15) identified in the primary screen were derived by coupling 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde to an amine. 2-Hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde alone also inhibited human SIRT2 activity, though not as well as sirtinol. Subsequent testing of other 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde derivatives from the ChemBridge library revealed that a subset of these inhibited SIRT2 in vitrodeacetylase activity at approximate IC50 values of 50–70 µm, as well (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the naphthaldehyde group makes important contacts with the enzyme active site and is primarily responsible for the inhibitory activity of these molecules. It may be possible to produce more potent inhibitors by making analogs of these 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde derivatives. An even more exciting possibility is that it will be possible to generate specific inhibitors of the different sirtuin homologs by modifying this basic structure.Preliminary Studies of Effects of Sirtinol TreatmentThis general inhibitor of sirtuin enzymes can be applied to the study of the biological function of sirtuins in a variety of systems and species. Thus far, the in vivo function of sirtuins has only been well understood in yeast, and even in this case there are several sirtuins that have not been characterized. Unfortunately, because of the lack of characterization of sirtuins in mammals, there is no direct method to test sirtinol for its ability to inhibit sirtuins in human cells. Attempts to create an artificial system in which a reporter gene was repressed by the catalytic domain SIRT2 were unsuccessful, perhaps because SIRT2 does not function in transcriptional regulation, or the recombinant protein was unable to recruit essential associated proteins. However, given that sirtinol can penetrate the yeast cell, it is expected that it can enter human cells, as well. Furthermore, because sirtinol inhibits both yeast Sir2p and human SIRT2 in vitro, it may be competent to inhibit all sirtuin enzymes, given the high degree of conservation of the catalytic domains. Unlike TSA, treatment of human primary fibroblasts with sirtinol did not cause global changes in acetylation of histones and tubulin, nor did it induce a morphological changes in the HeLa tumor cell line. This provides further evidence that sirtinol is selective for sirtuin deacetylases and does not affect HDACs and suggests that sirtuins perform very different functions than HDACs in vivo.Preliminary work with sirtinol on Arabidopsis, which contain at least two sirtuins (GenBankTM accession numbers 2656026 and 9955507), suggests that these proteins play a critical role in apical-basal body axis development and vascularization. Seedlings grown in sirtinol have thick, short hypocotyls and no primary roots, and the vein system was abnormal in the cotelydons. This morphology is very similar to that observed inMONOPTEROS mutants (24Hardtke C.S. Berleth T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 25Przemeck G.K. Mattsson J. Hardtke C.S. Sung Z.R. Berleth T. Planta. 1996; 200: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The MONOPTEROSprotein is a member of a family of transcriptional regulators, several of which have been shown to regulate expression of auxin-responsive genes (24Hardtke C.S. Berleth T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 26Guilfoyle T. Hagen G. Ulmasov T. Murfett J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Auxin is a plant hormone that is involved in vascularization and elongation of the hypocotyl and primary root. Inhibition of auxin transport through the plant by certain compounds results in seedlings with shortened hypocotyls and roots or lacking in the primary root structure altogether (27Jensen P.J. Hangarter R.P. Estelle M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Sieburth L.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, seedlings treated with these auxin transport inhibitors still possess normal vein development in the cotyledons but not in the first true leaves (28Sieburth L.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutation of MONOPTEROS and the phenotype produced by treatment with sirtinol do not match exactly that observed by auxin transport inhibition but do suggest that these operate on a related or the same pathway. At this stage, it is unclear whether the observed phenotype is due solely to the inhibition of sirtuin activity, though it does provide an interesting avenue to explore with respect to the transcriptional regulation of basal-apical body axis formation in plants. Sirtuins may control the synthesis of auxin or auxin-transporting proteins, or they may regulate the cellular transcriptional response to auxin.Future DirectionsReverse chemical genetics using small molecule modulators of proteins can be used to probe the cellular functions of proteins in different systems. Such inhibitors can be used in a temporally defined manner and are applicable in a variety of experimental systems. Fine temporal control has not been possible with even the best characterized sirtuin, yeast Sir2p, because no temperature-sensitive alleles have been reported. Thus, inhibitors of sirtuins will allow us to refine our understanding of, for example, yeast Sir2p, by comparing the immediate effects of a loss of Sir2p function with those steady-state cellular changes observed in yeast strains in which Sir2 has been deleted. A particularly powerful approach for assessing the resulting effect of sirtuin inhibition, by analogy to studies of HDACs, is global transcriptional profiling (29Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these small molecules can be used to initiate studies of sirtuin function in a wide variety of experimental systems, ranging from yeast to human cell cultures, to organisms such as zebrafish and Arabidopsis.Sirtuin proteins in yeast and bacteria have diverse biological functions, including the regulation of transcription, aging, the control of the cell cycle, DNA-damage repair, and metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 1Gartenberg M.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (14Tsang A.W. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31788-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). With seven human sirtuins (8Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), it is expected that the roles of these proteins in mammalian cells are equally diverse, but thus far these proteins have not been characterized."

https://openalex.org/W3099533788,"Liquid silica is the archetypal glass former, and compounds based on silica are ubiquitous as natural and man-made amorphous materials. Liquid silica is also the extreme case of a 'strong' liquid, in that the variation of viscosity with temperature closely follows the Arrhenius law as the liquid is cooled toward its glass transition temperature. In contrast, most liquids are to some degree 'fragile', showing significantly faster increases in their viscosity as the glass transition temperature is approached. Recent studies have demonstrated the controlling influence of the potential energy hypersurface (or 'energy landscape') of the liquid on the transport properties near the glass transition. But the origin of strong liquid behaviour in terms of the energy landscape has not yet been resolved. Here we study the static and dynamic properties of liquid silica over a wide range of temperature and density using computer simulations. The results reveal a change in the energy landscape with decreasing temperature, which underlies a transition from a fragile liquid at high temperature to a strong liquid at low temperature. We also show that a specific heat anomaly is associated with this fragile-to-strong transition, and suggest that this anomaly is related to the polyamorphic behaviour of amorphous solid silica."

These complexes are functionally active when isolated as individual complexes. However, there is increasing evidence that complex V exists as a dimer in mitochondrial membranes and that the respiratory chain is a network of respiratory chain supercomplexes (1Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The respiratory chain supercomplexes from bovine heart mitochondria, which were isolated with high yield using blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), contained complex I in monomeric form, complex III in dimeric form, and a variable copy number of complex IV. Associations of complexes II and V with other complexes of the system of oxidative phosphorylation could not be identified under the conditions of BN-PAGE so far. On the basis of a commonly used ratio for oxidative phosphorylation complexes I:II:III:IV:V of 1:2:3:6–7:3–5, which was published by Hatefi (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 1985, and a recent finding that complex I is almost quantitatively associated with complex III (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), a model for a network of mammalian respiratory chain complexes has been presented. According to this model, the respiratory chain exists as a mixture of two supercomplexes in a 2:1 ratio: a large supercomplex comprises complexes I, III, and IV; and a smaller supercomplex comprises complexes III and IV as well but is lacking complex I. However, the recovery of complex I after BN- and SDS-PAGE in a second dimension has not been tested in the previous work (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), and the ratio of OXPHOS complexes is not exactly known. An often-cited review of the ratio of OXPHOS complexes by Capaldiet al. (5Capaldi R.A. Gonzalez D.H. Zhang Y.Z. Yanamura W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) gives concentration ranges of complexes per milligram of protein. Markedly differing complex I:II:III:IV:V ratios can be calculated from these data depending on the technique used for complex I determinations. A ratio of 1:1.5:1.9–4.1:4.6–7.7:4–4.2 is calculated when complex I is quantified using FMN contents. These compositional data were rounded off to a 1:2:3:6:x ratio. However, a 1:3:3.8–8.2:9.2–15.2:8–8.4 ratio is calculated on the basis of original data sets using immunologic techniques to quantify complex I (5Capaldi R.A. Gonzalez D.H. Zhang Y.Z. Yanamura W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Smith S. Cottingham I.R. Ragan C.I. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Different materials were used in the cited studies, such as bovine and rat mitochondria, Keilin-Hartree particles, and sonic particles, which may be a major reason for the large variations in the contents and ratios of the complexes. The commonly used ratio of OXPHOS complexes in bovine sonic particles, which was published in a review article by Hatefi (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was based on the content of FMN (complex I), covalently bound FAD (complex II), cytochrome c1 (complex III), cytochromeaa3 (complex IV), and F1 (complex V) and adjusted to the nearest integer relative to complex I. Unfortunately, no S.D.s or ranges are given, except for complexes IV and V. The use of the FMN content in sonic particles as a single measure to quantify complex I seems critical. Complex I might have been overestimated if the sample contained FMN from another flavoprotein, and all ratios would need correction by a factor of 2 if complex I contained a second FMN, as postulated by Albracht and Hedderich (7Albracht S.P.J. Hedderich R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 24275: 1-6Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Vinogradov and King (8Vinogradov A.D. King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) used Keilin-Hartree preparations to determine cytochromes, acid-extractable FMN and FAD, and acid-nonextractable flavin. Assuming that all acid-extractable FMN is bound to complex I (one FMN per complex I), and all acid-nonextractable flavin is part of complex II (one FAD per complex II), a ratio of complexes I:II:III:IV of 1:1.3:<2.7:5.6 can be calculated from their data. The value for complex III is uncertain, because no correction for interfering cytochrome b of complex II was made. Assuming that, in contrast to sonic particles, 20% of total FMN of Keilin-Hartree particles is not part of complex I gives a complex I:II:III:IV ratio of 1:1.6:<3.4:7, which is close to the commonly used ratio. Again the critical FMN content is the only measure to quantify complex I, and novel approaches not relying on the assumptions concerning FMN and FAD contents seem to be required to obtain reliable ratios of OXPHOS complexes. Knowing the accurate ratios of respiratory chain complexes is essential for the correct interpretation of kinetic and spectroscopic data obtained with native mitochondrial membranes, because the type and number of supercomplexes and the fraction of free individual complexes will define the overall throughput rates of the respiratory chain. Knowing the accurate ratios and the structural organization of the building blocks of the respiratory chain is also essential to evaluate the importance of substrate channeling versus pool function of quinone and cytochrome c (see “Discussion”). Therefore, we reassessed the stoichiometry of the respiratory chain complexes, in particular the complex I:III ratio, by using three novel and independent approaches. Imidazole was obtained from Fluka; dodecylmaltoside was from Biomol; and decylquinazolinamine was a kind gift from Aventis Crop Science (Frankfurt, Germany). Inhibitors and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Bovine heart mitochondria were prepared according to the method of Smith (9Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Complex I, which contains one FMN per monomer, was prepared as described by Okun et al. (10Okun J.G. Lümmen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The FMN content was 0.99 nmol of FMN/mg of protein. Complex III, which contains two heme b per monomer or one cytochrome c1 per monomer, was isolated according to the method of Schäggeret al. (11Schägger H. Link Th.A. Engel D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The cytochrome b content of the preparation used was 3.5 nmol/mg. Complex IV was prepared according to the method of Brandt et al. (12Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The preparation used had a cytochrome a content of 9.8 nmol/mg of protein. Complex V was prepared as described elsewhere. 2H. Schägger, unpublished procedures. Difference spectra of dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized samples were recorded in the range of 650–500 nm using a Shimadzu UV 300 spectrophotometer. The following absorption coefficients were used: cytochrome b of complex II, ε561–575 nm = 26 mm−1cm−1; cytochromesbL and bH of complex III, ε562–575 nm = 2 × 28.5 mm−1cm−1; and cytochromea + a3 of complex IV, ε603–630 nm = 24 mm−1cm−1. NADH:ubiquinol reductase activity of complex I was measured at pH 8, 30 °C, as decylquinazolinamine-sensitive oxidation of NADH (200 μm,340–400 nm; ε = 3.4 mm−1cm−1) using 75 μm decylbenzoquinone as electron acceptor. Succinate:dichloroindophenol reductase activity of complex II was measured at pH 7, 30 °C, as thenoyltrifluoroacetone-sensitive reduction of dichloroindophenol (0.002%, 610–750 nm; ε = 20.5 mm−1cm−1) using 50 mmsuccinate as a substrate. Ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase activity of complex III and cytochrome c oxidase activity of complex IV were measured at 25 °C, pH 7.2, by the antimycin-sensitive reduction and cyanide-sensitive oxidation of cytochrome c, respectively (70 μm cytochromec, 550–540 nm; ε = 19.1 mm−1cm−1). Decylbenzoquinol (75 μm) was used as substrate for cytochrome creductase. Oligomycin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis of complex V was measured at 25 °C using an assay coupled to the oxidation of NADH. Shortly before the test, 0.25 mm NADH, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 2.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 units/ml pyruvate kinase were added to the test buffer (250 mmsucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaCN, and 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). Tricine-SDS-PAGE, BN-PAGE, and two-dimensional PAGE (BN-PAGE/SDS-PAGE; Ref. 13Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), three-dimensional PAGE (BN-PAGE/modified BN-PAGE/SDS-PAGE; ref. 2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), Coomassie blue staining, and densitometric protein quantification (14Schägger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were performed as described. The spectrophotometric-enzymatic assay described here for determining the molar ratio of complexes II, III, and IV made use of a differential solubilization of complexes II and III and parallel assays of spectra and catalytic activities in the samples before and after ultracentrifugation. Bovine heart mitochondria were suspended in 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, pH 7, and partially solubilized by adding Triton X-100 (Triton X-100:protein ratios from 1.0 to 1.4 g/g; final protein concentration, 8.8 mg/ml). Half of each sample was saved as a reference. The second half was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Succinate:dichloroindophenol reductase activity of complex II was recovered quantitatively in all supernatants, but decylbenzoquinol:cytochrome c reductase activity of complex III was only 2.3% using a Triton X-100:protein ratio of 1 g/g and 10% using 1.4 g/g. Fractions of 19 and 24.3%, respectively, of the total cytochrome b absorption of bovine heart mitochondria (dithionite-ferricyanide, 562–575 nm) were found in the supernatants (Fig. 1, A and B). Knowing the percentages of complexes II and III recovered in the supernatants and the extinction coefficients for the b-type cytochromes of isolated complexes II and III, the contribution of complex II to the total heme b absorption in bovine heart mitochondria was calculated as 17.1 and 15.9% from these two experiments (16.6 ± 0.6% from five different experiments), and the ratio of complex II:III was determined as 1:2.3 ± 0.1. Complex III and IV concentrations were calculated from dithionite minus ferricyanide redox spectra (Fig. 1A). After subtracting 16.6% of the total heme b absorption attributable to complex II, a complex III:IV ratio of 1:2.2 ± 0.2 (n = 8) was calculated. The overall ratio of complexes II:III:IV determined by this approach was 1.3 ± 0.1:3:6.6 ± 0.6 (normalized to complex III = 3). These ratios refer to monomeric complexes independent of their physiological oligomerization states. A first electrophoretic-densitometric approach to measure the stoichiomety of OXPHOS complexes made use of a near quantitative solubilization of all OXPHOS complexes from bovine heart mitochondria by dodecylmaltoside, followed by separation of the complexes by BN-PAGE, separation of the subunits by SDS-PAGE in a second dimension, and densitometric quantification of selected subunits after Coomassie blue staining. Near quantitative solubilization and recovery of the complexes after BN-PAGE was a prerequisite for this approach, and the staining indices of individual subunits of complexes had to be determined. Bovine heart mitochondria were solubilized under conditions usually used for BN-PAGE but on a larger scale. Sedimented mitochondria (20 mg of protein) were suspended in 2 ml of 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7, and solubilized by addition of dodecylmaltoside (DDM:protein ratio, 1.6 g/g). Half was kept as a reference. The second half was centrifuged 30 min at 100,000 × g. Dithionite minus ferricyanide difference spectra and catalytic activities were measured using the sample before centrifugation and the supernatant after centrifugation. The recovery of all complexes was between 95 and 100%. Bovine heart mitochondria were solubilized for BN-PAGE as described above using a DDM:protein ratio of 1.6 g/g. An aliquot of the supernatant was used for BN-PAGE (70 μg of total protein applied to a 2-cm sample well). After BN-PAGE, the two bands of complexes I and V were excised, as indicated in Fig. 2A and placed on top of an 8% acrylamide Tricine-SDS gel (Fig.2B). Another 70-μg aliquot of the supernatant after ultracentrifugation was supplemented with SDS and directly loaded onto the same 8% acrylamide gel as a 100% reference. After electrophoretic separation and Coomassie blue staining, the staining intensities of the 75-kDa band of isolated complex I and of the α subunit of isolated complex V were densitometrically compared with the corresponding bands of the reference lane (Fig. 2B). The recoveries from the BN gel were 92 ± 8% for complex I and 81 ± 11% for complex V (n = 5). The 75-kDa band was identified immunologically as the upper band of a doublet (data not shown). Potential contaminations of this band by proteins of similar size seem to be negligible, because this would lower the apparent recovery from BN gels, and the measured near quantitative recovery would not be attained. The α subunit, but not the β subunit, was used to quantify the recovery of complex V, because the apparent recovery using the α subunit was ∼10% higher, indicating less contamination. Recoveries of complexes III and IV have been analyzed by using a different approach. Before the sample was applied to BN-PAGE, complexes III and IV were quantified spectrophotometrically. After BN-PAGE, the two bands were excised and resolved by SDS-PAGE using defined amounts of chromatographically purified complexes III and IV as standards in the same gel. The yield of complex III was ∼95% with complex III and >80% with complex IV, which gives rise to streaking bands during BN-PAGE (14Schägger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Defined amounts of isolated complexes I–V, usually in the 5–60-pmol range, were applied to SDS gels, and the subunits were quantified after Coomassie blue staining using a laser densitometer. One example of an SDS gel used for determination of staining indices is shown in Fig.3. The staining intensities (arbitrary units) of the subunits listed in Table I were normalized to 1 pmol and 1 kDa and finally normalized to the core I and II subunits of complex III, which were used as standards in each gel.Table INormalized Coomassie blue-staining indices of subunits of OXPHOS complexesComplexSubunitMassStaining index (n = 7)kDaI75 kDa771.02 ± 0.1551 + 49 kDa981.19 ± 0.2842 + 39 kDa761.37 ± 0.21IIICore protein 1490.92 ± 0.08Core protein 2471.08 ± 0.0913.4 kDa13.41.70 ± 0.157.3 kDa7.31.44 ± 0.13IVCox subunit 1570.54 ± 0.05Cox subunit 2260.76 ± 0.07Vα subunit550.94 ± 0.07β subunit520.91 ± 0.07γ subunit301.43 ± 0.12Subunit b251.24 ± 0.10Coomassie blue-staining intensities (arbitrary units) of individual subunits were normalized to 1 kDa and 1 pmol of the complex.

Open table in a new tab Coomassie blue-staining intensities (arbitrary units) of individual subunits were normalized to 1 kDa and 1 pmol of the complex. Finally the staining indices were normalized to the staining of core proteins I and II of complex III, which were used as standards in each gel. One of the two-dimensional gels used for determination of the ratios of complexes in bovine heart mitochondria is shown in Fig.4A. A complex I:III:IV:V ratio (normalized to complex III = 3) of 1.2 ± 0.1:3:5.9 ± 0.6:3.1 ± 0.1 (n = 4) was determined this way. Taking into account the low recovery of complexes IV and V after BN-PAGE, which is ∼10–15% lower than with complexes I and III, the complex I:III:IV:V ratio is 1.1–1.3:3:5.9–7.5:3.3–3.7. This electrophoretic approach using staining indices for individual subunits (Table I) was also applied to bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The ratio of complexes I:III:IV:V was found to be almost identical to the ratio determined for mitochondria (data not shown). A second electrophoretic-densitometric approach started with the solubilization procedure described above, but digitonin was used instead of dodecylmaltoside (digitonin:protein ratio, 4–8 g/g) to retain respiratory chain supercomplexes. The recoveries of complexes in the supernatant after centrifugation using ezymatic assays were 86 ± 1% for complex I, 100% for complex II, 87 ± 4% for complex III, 91 ± 5% for complex IV, and 86 ± 3% for complex V, which compares well with the solubilization by dodecylmaltoside. BN-PAGE was then used to separate the supercomplexes and individual OXPHOS complexes, and a second-dimension SDS-PAGE followed to resolve the subunits (Fig. 4B). Some of the Coomassie blue-stained subunits were selected for densitometric quantification,e.g. the 75-, 51 + 49-, and 42 + 39-kDa bands of complex I and the core proteins 1 and 2 of complex III. The identity of these bands was verified by amino-terminal protein sequencing. The total staining intensities of each of these specific subunits in supercomplexes and free complexes was summed (Fig. 4B) and compared with the signal intensities in a reference two-dimensional gel from a dodecylmaltoside-solubilized sample (Fig. 4A). The recoveries of digitonin-solubilized complexes compared with those of dodecylmaltoside-solubilized complexes were 103 ± 24% for complex I, 100 ± 12% for complex II, 104 ± 23% for complex III, >87% for free complex IV (complex IV bound to supercomplexes could not be reliably quantified), and 95 ± 13% for complex V (n = 5). This indicated also that the recovery of digitonin-solubilized complexes was near quantitative, and it was possible to determine the ratio of complexes I and III in a way that was independent of the staining indices of individual subunits. Using two-dimensional gels of digitonin-solubilized mitochondrial complexes, we found that 86 ± 1.5% of total complex I and 60 ± 9.5% of total complex III (n = 4) were bound to supercomplexes, whereas 14 ± 1.5% and 40 ± 9.5%, respectively, existed as free individual complexes I and III. All supercomplexes contain a complex I monomer, which binds to a complex III dimer, and a variable complex IV copy number, as illustrated in Fig. 5. This means that 86% of total complex I and 60% of total complex III are fixed in a 1:2 ratio; 100% complex I monomer would then fix 70% of total complex III and leave 30% in free form. Therefore, the complex I:III ratio determined this way is ∼0.8–1.2:3. A third electrophoretic-densitometric approach to determine the complex I:III ratio started with the solubilization procedures using digitonin and dodecylmaltoside as described above, but after first-dimension BN-PAGE, a second modified BN-PAGE followed using low detergent in the cathode buffer. The rationale behind this approach was to improve reliability of the quantification, because the core protein I subunit of complex III and the 51 + 49-kDa band of complex I were rather close in the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 4B). In two-dimensional native gels, which are native in both dimensions (BN-PAGE/modified BN-PAGE), all complexes that exist as individual complexes in first BN-PAGE are found on a diagonal in the second-dimension gel. This is shown in Fig.6A, in which dodecylmaltoside was used for solubilization and separation of isolated complexes. However, solubilization by digitonin led to separated supercomplexes in the first-dimension BN-PAGE, which dissociated into the individual complexes in the second-dimension BN-PAGE and therefore were found below this diagonal (Fig. 6B). Horizontal lines of individual complexes, e.g. complexes I and III, emerged, which were excised and put on top of third-dimension SDS gels (Fig. 6,C and E). Gel pieces containing complexes I and III from DDM-solubilized samples (Fig. 6A) were applied to the same gels and were used as references for quantitative recovery. Using this approach, it was possible to use any subunit of a complex for densitometric quantification except those that were detergent-labile and dissociated easily, such as the iron-sulfur protein of complex III. Also excluded were those subunits that were not clearly separated from contaminating proteins, e.g. the 51 + 49-kDa band of complex I, which was too close to the β subunit of complex V (Fig. 6C). Using digitonin-solubilized mitochondria and the three-dimensional approach, we measured that 84 ± 1.2% of total complex I and 58 ± 3.2% of total complex III (n = 4) were fixed in supercomplexes, whereas 16 ± 1.2% and 42 ± 3.2%, respectively, were present in free form; 100% complex I monomer would then fix 69% of total complex III and leave 31% in free form. The complex I:III ratio determined this way was 1.0–1.1:3.

Open table in a new tab The ratios were normalized to complex III = 3. The focus of this work was to determine the accurate complex I:III ratio in bovine heart mitochondria by novel and independent approaches to obtain a safe basis for a recent structural model of the mammalian respirasome (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar) and its mechanistic implications. A 1:3 ratio of complex I:III, which is mostly used, has been determined by using optical spectroscopy after extraction of FMN and heme from sonic particles (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent data suggested that complex I might have been overestimated because of contaminating FMN, because a 1:10 ratio of complex I:IV corresponding to a 1:4.3–5 ratio of complexes I:III was determined by fluorescent quench techniques (10Okun J.G. Lümmen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Both assays were based on the assumption that membrane-integrated complex I binds one FMN molecule, as does isolated complex I (10Okun J.G. Lümmen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In contrast to this assumption, a second FMN, which can be lost from complex I during isolation, was postulated to explain EPR spectra of complex I (7Albracht S.P.J. Hedderich R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 24275: 1-6Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This could explain why Smith et al. (6Smith S. Cottingham I.R. Ragan C.I. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) determined an FMN content of 0.157 nmol/mg of bovine sonic particles, whereas immunological assays indicated a complex I content of 0.066–0.075. If the assumption of two molecules of FMN per complex I were correct, almost all previously published data on mitochondrial complex I contents would need correction by a factor of 2. We used three novel electrophoretic-densitometric approaches to determine the complex I:III ratio. Isolated complex I containing one FMN was used for determining the Coomassie blue-staining ratios of subunits according to method 2, whereas methods 3A and 3B were independent of the FMN content of complex I. The result, an average complex I:III ratio of 1.1 ± 0.2:3, is close to the 1:3 ratio published by Hatefi (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is more than a simple confirmation by using independent techniques. Because the result obtained in this work is close to the ratio after FMN extraction from sonic particles, we conclude that there is no evidence for a second FMN of complex I, as suggested by Albracht and Hedderich (7Albracht S.P.J. Hedderich R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 24275: 1-6Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Smith et al.(6Smith S. Cottingham I.R. Ragan C.I. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Also, contaminating FMN seems not to be a problem with the extraction of sonic particles. We conclude that membrane-integrated complex I contains one FMN, like isolated complex I, and that FMN is not bound in significant amounts to a mitochondrial membrane protein other than complex I. Knowing the accurate stoichiometry of oxidative phosphorylation complexes is necessary to develop plausible structural models of the mammalian “respirasome” with testable mechanistic implications. Complex I-III interactions are rather stable, and only 14–16% of total complex I was found in free form in the presence of digitonin. So it seems likely that all complex I is bound to complex III in the absence of digitonin, but approximately one-third of total complex III is not bound to complex I at the measured 1.1 ± 0.2:3 ratio of complexes I:III. This ratio is compatible with a model of the respirasome consisting of large and small supercomplexes in a 2:1 ratio (Ref. 2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar and Fig. 7). Stable binding of complex I to complex III opens the possibility for quinone substrate channeling, which would make a reaction independent of the bulk properties of a substrate pool. A quinone pool function has been shown in mammalian mitochondria (15Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but the question arises of how important the quinone pool function for the electron transfer between complexes I and III would be. Assuming that binding of complex I to complex III does not alter the access to the quinone pool, complex II and other FAD-dependent dehydrogenases such glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase and electron-transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenase would have access to all complex III, including also the fraction of complex III that is integrated into the large supercomplexes. However, if binding of complex I to complex III segregates them from the quinone pool, complex II and other FAD-dependent dehydrogenases would only have access to the smaller supercomplex. NADH and FADH2 respiration should then involve distinct subsets of complexes III and IV. Using this as a working hypothesis, we have now started new studies on the importance of quinone pool function versus substrate channeling for specific NADH and FADH2 oxidation pathways. A second major objective of this work was to obtain accurate stoichiometric data for complex II. Hatefi (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) measured acid-extractable FMN and acid-nonextractable FAD to determine the complex I:II ratio and found a complex I:II ratio of 1:2 for bovine sonic particles. We used an FMN- and a FAD-independent spectrophotometric-enzymatic approach. The ratio of complexes II:III usually is difficult to determine by spectrophotometric approaches, because the two complexes contain b-type cytochromes with similar spectra. However, we made use of the special solubilization properties of Triton X-100 with bovine mitochondrial membranes. Triton X-100 can solubilize complexes II and V selectively using low Triton X-100:protein ratios, because complex I-III-IV interactions are retained under these conditions, and the supercomplexes seem to be further linked together to form an extensive network of supercomplexes (2Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Selective solubilization of complex II, combined with spectral and enzymatic quantifications, alleviated experimental problems considerably and minimized the experimental error for the determination of the complex II:III ratio (1.3 ± 0.1:3). The result is not compatible with the commonly used 2:3 ratio given by Hatefi (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex II is clearly substoichiometric to complex III, but the ratio of monomeric complex II to dimeric complex III is close to 1:1. We cannot exclude that there might exist a specific association of the two complexes, although such an assembly could not be detected by BN-PAGE. The ratio of FAD and cytochrome c1 in isolated succinate cytochrome c reductase is different: It is 1:1;i.e. two copies of complex II are bound to one complex III dimer (16Tisdale H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 213-225Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We determined a complex III:IV ratio of 3:5.9–7.5 using a spectrophotometric approach and an independent electrophoretic-densitometric approach. This result confirmed previous analyses (4Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Azzone G.F. Colonna R. Ziche B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 45-50Google Scholar). Bertina et al. (18Bertina R.M. Schrier P.I. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) quantified, the binding of inhibitors to complexes III and V in rat heart and liver mitochondria. The binding of anti-mycin to heart complex III (0.26 μmol/g) was almost identical to the binding of oligomycin and aurovertin (0.27 μmol/g each). This indicated a 1:1 ratio of complexes III and V, which essentially matches the 3:3.3–3.7 ratio that we found using an independent electrophoretic-densitometric approach. Almost identical results have also been obtained using immunological techniques for determining the F1 content in sonic particles (19Penin F. Deléage G. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochem. Biphys. Acta. 1986; 852: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). F1contents were in the range from 0.38–0.45 nmol/mg, which is equivalent to a complex III:IV ratio of 1:1–1.1.

Here we show that CID, the Drosophila homologue of the CENP-A centromere-specific H3-like proteins, colocalizes with molecular-genetically defined functional centromeres in minichromosomes. Injection of CID antibodies into early embryos, as well as RNA interference in tissue-culture cells, showed that CID is required for several mitotic processes. Deconvolution fluorescence microscopy showed that CID chromatin is physically separate from proteins involved in sister cohesion (MEI-S332), centric condensation (PROD), kinetochore function (ROD, ZW10 and BUB1) and heterochromatin structure (HP1). CID localization is unaffected by mutations in mei-S332, Su(var)2-5 (HP1), prod or polo. Furthermore, the localization of POLO, CENP-meta, ROD, BUB1 and MEI-S332, but not PROD or HP1, depends on the presence of functional CID. We conclude that the centromere and flanking heterochromatin are physically and functionally separable protein domains that are required for different inheritance functions, and that CID is required for normal kinetochore formation and function, as well as cell-cycle progression."

Visible absorbance spectra showed a red shift of the cytochrome f α-band and the Qy chlorophylla band in the cyanobacterial complex and an absorbance band in the flavin 450–480-nm region of the chloroplast complex. An additional high molecular weight (Mr ∼ 35,000) polypeptide in the chloroplast complex was seen in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at a stoichiometry of ∼0.9 (cytochrome f)−1. The extra polypeptide did not stain for heme and was much more accessible to protease than cytochrome f. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of CNBr fragments of the 35-kDa polypeptide was diagnostic for ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR), as were antibody reactivity to FNR and diaphorase activity. The absence of FNR in the cyanobacterial complex did not impair decyl-plastoquinol-ferricyanide activity. The activity of the FNR in the chloroplastb6f complex was also shown by NADPH reduction, in the presence of added ferredoxin, of 0.8 heme equivalents of the cytochrome b6 subunit. It was inferred that the b6f complex with bound FNR, one equivalent per monomer, provides the membrane protein connection to the main electron transfer chain for ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron transport."

Phosphorylation is carried out by four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes. Specificity of the four mammalian PDKs toward the three phosphorylation sites of E1 was investigated using the recombinant E1 mutant proteins with only one functional phosphorylation site present. All four PDKs phosphorylated site 1 and site 2, however, with different rates in phosphate buffer (for site 1, PDK2 > PDK4≈PDK1 > PDK3; for site 2, PDK3 > PDK4 > PDK2 > PDK1). Site 3 was phosphorylated by PDK1 only. The maximum activation by dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase was demonstrated by PDK3. In the free form, all PDKs phosphorylated site 1, and PDK4 had the highest activity toward site 2. The activity of the four PDKs was stimulated to a different extent by the reduction and acetylation state of the lipoyl moieties of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase with the maximum stimulation of PDK2. Substitution of the site 1 serine with glutamate, which mimics phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of E1, did not affect phosphorylation of site 2 by four PDKs and of site 3 by PDK1.

PDC is composed of multiple copies (per complex) of three catalytic components, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3); a binding protein, referred to as E3-binding protein (E3BP); and two regulatory enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and phospho-pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (1Reed L.J.

E1 is a thiamine pyrophosphate-requiring α2β2heterotetramer with two active sites that interact with each other during catalysis (3Butler J.R. Pettit R.H. Davis P.F. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

There are three specific serine residues in the α subunit of E1 that are subject to ATP-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation by PDK (5Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H.

Although PDKs phosphorylate specific serine residues of the E1α subunit, they show very little amino acid sequence similarity with eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases. PDKs were suggested to belong to the ATPase/kinase superfamily (composed of bacterial histidine protein kinase, DNA gyrases, and molecular chaperone Hsp90) based on similarity of their catalytic domains (12Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).PDKs are bound to the PDC core through the lipoyl domains of E2, and this interaction is important for their efficient catalytic function (13Yang D. Gong X. Yakhnin A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14130-14137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PDK activity is enhanced through changes in the status of the lipoyl domains from oxidized to reduced and acetylated forms, which in turn depend on the NADH/NAD+ and acetyl-CoA/CoA ratios (14Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 653-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mammalian PDK isoenzymes differ in their catalytic activity, responsiveness to the modulators such as NADH and acetyl-CoA, and tissue-specific expression (15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). PDK1 is present mostly in heart, whereas PDK2 is found in most tissues. PDK3 is predominantly expressed in testis, whereas heart and skeletal muscle have the highest amount of PDK4 (6Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28989-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).The E1 component has six potential phosphorylation sites (3 sites per α subunit) namely, site 1 (Ser-264), site 2 (Ser-271), and site 3 (Ser-203) (5Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The rates of phosphorylation of the three sites in mammalian E1 were shown to be different (4.6-fold higher for site 1 than for site 2 and 16-fold higher for site 1 than for site 3) with PDK preparations (containing more than one isoenzyme) purified from mammalian tissues (16Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We showed recently that the mechanism of inactivation appears to be different for phosphorylation of each of the three sites, i.e. phosphorylation of site 1 affects E1 interaction with its substrates, especially lipoyl moieties of E2, whereas phosphorylation of site 3 interferes with thiamine pyrophosphate binding (17Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5731-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of any one site nearly completely renders E1 (and hence PDC) inactive, the presence of the three phosphorylation sites in E1 remains an enigma. It has been suggested that hyperphosphorylation of E1 may play a role in regulation of PDC in certain pathological conditions (18Randle P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Wu P. Inskeep K. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The existence of the four isoenzymes in mammalian tissues raises an intriguing question about their specificity toward the three phosphorylation sites of mammalian E1. The availability of recombinant human mutant E1s with only one functional phosphorylation site, as well as E1-S264A and E1-S264E, has provided us the unique opportunity to examine the specificity of PDK isoenzymes toward each phosphorylation site. Our findings show that four PDK isoenzymes have different specificity toward the three phosphorylation sites. Site 3 was phosphorylated by PDK1 only. In contrast, the stimulation of PDKs by reduction and acetylation of the lipoyl moieties of E2 is not site-specific. Presence of glutamate at site 1 as a phosphorylation mimic did not interfere with phosphorylation of sites 2 and 3 by PDKs.DISCUSSIONThe importance of regulation of PDC activity in metabolism of carbohydrates and some amino acids is evident from the complexity of its regulation by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. The heterotetrameric (α2β2) E1 has three phosphorylation sites per α subunit, and of the six potential sites available, phosphorylation of any one site results in near complete inactivation of E1. Recent studies have shown that the rates of phosphorylation are site-specific and that phosphorylation of each of the three sites affects the active site in a site-specific manner for its ability to bind thiamine pyrophosphate and substrates (16Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5731-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific expression of multiple isoenzymes of PDK add yet another complexity to regulation of E1 (and hence PDC). PDK1 is expressed predominantly in heart, PDK2 is the most abundant isoenzyme present in several tissues such as liver, heart, skeletal muscle, etc. with lower amounts in spleen and lung, PDK3 is expressed mostly in the testis and lung, and PDK4 is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate for the first time (i) the specificity of the four PDK isoenzymes toward the three phosphorylation sites of E1, (ii) the presence of significant level of PDK activity toward free E1 (PDK1, PDK2, and PDK4 toward site 1, PDK4 toward site 2, and PDK1 only toward site 3), and (iii) a lack of influence of site 1 on phosphorylation of the other two sites by PDK isoenzymes. Hence, site specificity for phosphorylation of four PDK isoenzymes with unique tissue distribution and differential regulation provides an added feature for tissue-specific regulation of PDC in normal and pathological conditions.Activities of four PDK isoenzymes were measured previously using wild-type E1 (with all three sites functional) in Tris buffer (15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Recently, activities of PDK2 and PDK3 were compared using wild-type E1 in three different buffer systems (phosphate buffer, MOPS-K+ buffer, and Tris buffer) (22Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined activities of PDK isoenzymes for phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3 individually in human E1. PDK activities were determined in two buffer systems for E1 sites 1, 2, and 3 individually. PDKs displayed different maximal specific activities for E1s with sites 1, 2, and 3 reconstituted in PDC depending on the buffer system used. In phosphate buffer, activities were as follows: PDK2 > PDK4≈PDK1 > PDK3 for site 1 and PDK3 > PDK4 > PDK2 > PDK1 for site 2 (Table I). In MOPS-K+ buffer activities were as follows: PDK1≈PDK3≈PDK2 > PDK4 for site 1 and PDK3 ≫ PDK1 > PDK4 > PDK2 for site 2 (Table I). These data indicate the sensitivity of the PDKs to the slight changes in their microenvironment. Site 3 was phosphorylated only by PDK1 in both buffer systems, and the activities of the other three PDKs toward site 3 were undetectable under our experimental conditions (see Fig. 1 and TableI). PDK1 differs from PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4 by the length of its amino acid sequence (and hence possibly in structure). Human precursor PDK amino acid sequences are composed of 436 residues for PDK1, 407 for PDK2, 406 for PDK3, and 411 for PDK4 (7Rowles J. Scherer S.W. Xi T. Majer M. Nickle D.C. Rommens J.M.

Matured PDK1 has the largest molecular mass among the four PDKs and corresponds to the 48-kDa subunit identified in the PDK preparations purified from bovine and porcine tissues (25Stepp L.R.

Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas matured PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4 have similar molecular masses and correspond to the 45-kDa subunit.The stimulation of PDK activities with the reduction and acetylation of the lipoyl moieties of E2 was isoenzyme-specific but not site-specific and was dependent on the buffer system employed. The maximal stimulation was observed for PDK2 in both phosphate buffer and MOPS-K+ buffer (Tables I and III). However, the extent of stimulation was not much different for different phosphorylation sites as substrates. Reduction or acetylation of the lipoyl moieties was suggested to induce conformational changes that generated a more active PDK state (14Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 653-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Earlier it was shown that stimulation of PDK purified from mammalian tissues by reduction and acetylation of lipoyl moieties of E2 required physiological concentrations of potassium salts (26Pettit F.H. Pelley J.W. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, increasing K+ concentration inhibited bovine PDK activity (27Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reduction in activities of all four PDKs observed in our study with MOPS-K+ buffer compared with phosphate buffer is consistent with an earlier study (22Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Although PDK is found to be present in limiting amounts in PDC (1–2 PDK molecules per complex), it was proposed to phosphorylate several molecules of E1 in PDC by moving on the surface of E2 core through interactions with the lipoyl domains (13Yang D. Gong X. Yakhnin A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14130-14137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In our experiments PDK isoenzymes displayed cooperative interaction with its substrate E1 (apparent S0.5 values were determined instead of apparentKm values). If we calculate the E1 concentration under our experimental conditions in phosphate buffer at which the amount of PDK is only one molecule per PDC, the calculated value for E1 concentration of 0.33 μm would be close to the observed apparent S0.5 values for E1 for PDK1, PDK2, and PDK4 toward site 1 and PDK4 for site 2. The presence of the substrates in the range of Km values under physiological conditions provides a higher degree of sensitivity for regulation. In the mitochondria the ratio of PDK isoenzyme activities will depend upon the following: (i) the relative amount of each PDK isoenzyme expressed, (ii) the activity of each PDK isoenzyme at the concentrations of E1 and ATP present, (iii) the level of reduced and acetylated lipoyl moieties of E2, and (iv) the concentration of pyruvate that has been shown to be inhibitory to PDKs (28Pratt M.L. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7191-7196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PDKs are known to be activated by binding to E2 (13Yang D. Gong X. Yakhnin A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14130-14137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The activation of PDK by E2 was explained by enhancement of the catalytic efficiency of PDK and colocalization of PDK and E1 bound to the subunit-binding domain of E2 (22Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When saturating concentrations of E1 and ATP were used, activities of PDK1 and PDK4 toward site 1 of E1 by itself and E1 reconstituted in PDC were almost identical (Tables I and III). In contrast PDK3 was maximally activated by E2. Previously highly purified PDK preparations (mixtures of isoenzymes) purified from bovine tissues and recombinant PDK2 were found to phosphorylate only site 1 of wild-type E1 in the absence of E2 (5Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The results presented here show clearly that site 2 is also phosphorylated by all four PDK isoenzymes, and site 3 is phosphorylated by PDK1 only in the absence or presence of E2-E3BP, and the level of E2-mediated activation is higher for phosphorylation of site 2 by all PDK isoenzymes and for phosphorylation of site 3 by PDK1 only. Interestingly, activity of PDK4 toward site 2 of E1 in the absence of E2-E3BP was much higher (from 4.3 to 9.2-fold) than activities of other three PDK isoenzymes (Table I). Recent evidence showed the presence of a large amount of free branched-chain α-keto acid-dehydrogenase kinase in rat liver mitochondria (29Obayashi M. Sato Y. Harris R.A. Shimomura Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Earlier it was found that the protein found in rat heart and liver mitochondrial extracts was able to increase phosphorylation of PDC. This protein was identified later as free PDK (30Jones B.S. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PDK4 has higher expression in heart and skeletal muscle compared with other tissues, whereas PDK2 is present in large amounts in different tissues including heart, liver, and kidney (15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The amounts of PDK4 in rat heart are increased during starvation and diabetes (4-fold), hyperthyroidism (3.5-fold), and high fat feeding (3.2-fold) (31Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Sugden M.C. Langdown M.L. Harris R.A. Holness M.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 731-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, starvation resulted in the increased expression of PDK2 and PDK4 in liver, kidney, and lactating mammary gland but not in brain or adipose tissue (33Wu P. Blair P.V. Sato J. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This increase in PDK4 (and PDK2) may not correlate with the increases, if any, in the amounts of PDC molecules present in the mitochondria, resulting in the presence of more PDK4 (and PDK2) in the free form. The increase in hyperphosphorylation (multiple sites phosphorylation) of E1 on sites 1 and 2 (and hence PDC) not only by PDKs bound to PDC but also by free PDK4 (and possibly by PDK2) is supported by an increased expression of PDK4 in pathological studies.E1 was shown to be phosphorylated only on half of its potentially available phosphorylation sites. This seems to be true for all four PDKs. PDK1 phosphorylated about three sites (of six potential sites) and PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4 phosphorylated no more than two sites (of four potential sites) (Fig. 1A). The three phosphorylation sites of E1 are located not far from each other, especially site 1 (Ser-264) and site 2 (Ser-271), and they were suggested to affect E1 activity by different mechanisms (17Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5731-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was of interest to find out whether phosphorylation of one site affected phosphorylation of the other sites. The results presented here indicate that all four PDK isoenzymes had similar activities both in basal and stimulated conditions toward mutant E1s with serine at site 1 replaced with alanine or glutamate (Table IV). The lack of inhibition of site 1 modification on phosphorylation of the other two sites would allow hyperphosphorylation of E1 to proceed, which is important under some pathophysiological conditions, such as diabetes and starvation (18Randle P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Concluding RemarksThe present study demonstrates another aspect involved in the regulation of PDC activity in the mitochondria. Not only do PDK isoenzymes have different specific activities toward E1, but also their activities depend upon the individual phosphorylation site of E1 being modified. With the changes of the ratio of different isoenzymes, depending on the tissue and the metabolic state of the cell, PDC activity would be modulated by the extent of site(s) being phosphorylated. The number of sites phosphorylated could be increased by the presence of free PDKs capable of phosphorylation of three sites of E1 as indicated by this study. We have reported previously that each phosphorylation site is dephosphorylated with the similar rate, but dephosphorylation (and hence activation, as phosphorylation of each site causes inactivation) of all the three sites will require a longer time (16Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), resulting in PDC inhibition for an extended period in the cell. The mammalian multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)1, which plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism, catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvic acid with formation of CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH. PDC is composed of multiple copies (per complex) of three catalytic components, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3); a binding protein, referred to as E3-binding protein (E3BP); and two regulatory enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and phospho-pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (1Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-46Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 2Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). E1 is a thiamine pyrophosphate-requiring α2β2heterotetramer with two active sites that interact with each other during catalysis (3Butler J.R. Pettit R.H. Davis P.F. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There are three specific serine residues in the α subunit of E1 that are subject to ATP-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation by PDK (5Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Phospho-pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase dephosphorylates these three serine residues and reactivates PDC (1Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-46Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar). PDK exists as the multiple isoenzymes in several organisms, four isoenzymes of PDK in humans (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, PDK4), three in rodents (PDK1, PDK2, PDK4 (PDK3 was not cloned, but its existence is not excluded)), two in plants (two in Zea mays and one inArabidopsis thaliana), one in nematodes (Ascaris suum and Caenorhabditis elegans), and one in fruit fly (6Gudi R.

Although PDKs phosphorylate specific serine residues of the E1α subunit, they show very little amino acid sequence similarity with eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases. PDKs were suggested to belong to the ATPase/kinase superfamily (composed of bacterial histidine protein kinase, DNA gyrases, and molecular chaperone Hsp90) based on similarity of their catalytic domains (12Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PDKs are bound to the PDC core through the lipoyl domains of E2, and this interaction is important for their efficient catalytic function (13Yang D. Gong X. Yakhnin A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14130-14137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PDK activity is enhanced through changes in the status of the lipoyl domains from oxidized to reduced and acetylated forms, which in turn depend on the NADH/NAD+ and acetyl-CoA/CoA ratios (14Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 653-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mammalian PDK isoenzymes differ in their catalytic activity, responsiveness to the modulators such as NADH and acetyl-CoA, and tissue-specific expression (15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). PDK1 is present mostly in heart, whereas PDK2 is found in most tissues. PDK3 is predominantly expressed in testis, whereas heart and skeletal muscle have the highest amount of PDK4 (6Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28989-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem.

The E1 component has six potential phosphorylation sites (3 sites per α subunit) namely, site 1 (Ser-264), site 2 (Ser-271), and site 3 (Ser-203) (5Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The rates of phosphorylation of the three sites in mammalian E1 were shown to be different (4.6-fold higher for site 1 than for site 2 and 16-fold higher for site 1 than for site 3) with PDK preparations (containing more than one isoenzyme) purified from mammalian tissues (16Korotchkina L.G.

However, various kinds of DNA damage induced by endogenous and exogenous factors impair this replication ability and cause genetic alterations, resulting in cancer predisposition (1Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Cells have excellent systems for avoiding these genetic alterations by removing and repairing the damaged lesions before DNA replication for maintaining the genetic stability of the organism; these systems include base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and recombination repair (2Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 3Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). If a lesion on template DNA escapes these repair systems, a polymerase may stall at this point and start synthesis again downstream, resulting in a single strand gap in the DNA, which can be repaired by postreplication repair. Usually, recombination repair in postreplication repair can fix this gap without base substitution, but when this repair does not happen, DNA synthesis by a bypass formation across the lesion called translesion synthesis (TLS)1 may take place to fill the gap. This TLS may be held in the last resort for DNA repair because mutations can be induced during this step (for reviews, see Refs.4Freidberg E.C. Gerlach V.L.

The human cells expressing high levels of hREV1 or hREV3 antisense mRNA fragments grow normally but show less mutagenic properties after UV irradiation, suggesting that hREV1 and hREV3 are involved in UV-induced mutagenesis (31Gibbs P.E.M.

Interaction between hREV3 and hREV7 was confirmed in vitrobinding assay, indicating the existence of DNA polymerase ζ complex in human cells, but the function of hREV7 is not yet known, nor is that of its yeast counterpart (36Murakumo Y. Roth T. Ishii H. Rasio D. Numata S. Croce C.M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We describe here the analyses of interactions in the human REV proteins hREV1, hREV3, and hREV7. The interaction between hREV1 and hREV7 was identified by two-hybrid library screening using a bait of hREV7 and was confirmed by both in vitro and in vivobinding assays. Such interaction has not yet been shown in yeast. In addition, the homodimerization of hREV7 was also detected in the two-hybrid assay. We determined the precise interaction domains of hREV1 and hREV7, hREV3 and hREV7, and hREV7 homodimerization. Although we investigated a stable complex formation of these three proteins, it was undetectable in vitro. These results suggest that hREV7, which interacts with either hREV1 or hREV3, might play an important role in regulating the hREV1 and hREV3 enzymatic activities for damage tolerance and mutagenesis. For yeast two-hybrid assay, full-length and truncated fragments of hREV7 cDNA were placed into vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH), and full-length and truncated fragments of hREV1 cDNA and truncated fragments of hREV3 cDNA were placed into vector pACT2 (CLONTECH). For in vitro binding assay, full-length hREV1 cDNA and full-length hREV7cDNA were placed into vector pET24d (Novagen) to produce radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled hREV1 and hREV7 proteins, and truncated fragments of hREV1 cDNA and full-length hREV7cDNA were placed into vector pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. For in vivo binding assay, full-length hREV1cDNA tagged with the FLAG sequence on its N terminus and a truncated fragment of hREV3 cDNA tagged with the FLAG sequence on its C terminus were placed into vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to express the FLAG-tagged hREV1 and hREV3 proteins in cells. The DNA fragment cloned into each vector was produced by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The pAS2–1/hREV7 plasmid, which contained a full sequence of the hREV7 coding region, was used for yeast two-hybrid library screening to isolate the hREV7 interacting proteins. Yeast two-hybrid library screening was performed in the Y190 yeast strain using MATCHMAKER 2 two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-five mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was added to selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine to inhibit His3p expression activated by GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion hREV7 alone. We screened about 5×105 independent clones of the human testis cDNA library constructed in vector pACT2 (CLONTECH) on 150-mm dishes. Sequential qualitative β-galactosidase assay was performed to eliminate false positives according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Liquid culture assay for β-galactosidase activity was also performed to check the interactions quantitatively according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). The β-galactosidase activity was determined by taking the average of values in three independent experiments. pACT2/library plasmids in the positive clones were extracted and subjected to sequencing. Double-strand sequencing of the inserts in pACT2/library plasmids extracted from positive clones was performed by a cycle sequencing program using the dye-deoxynucleotide kit and Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nucleotide sequences were determined by an automated Applied Biosystems sequencer model 377 or 310 (Applied Biosystems). To obtain the complete cDNA sequence of hREV1, the λTriplEx human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened using a PCR probe derived from the insert of pACT2/C76 plasmid by the conventional plaque hybridization method. The phage DNAs of isolated positive clones were converted to plasmids according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH) and purified using a Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen), and the purified plasmids were subjected to sequencing. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends and reverse transcription-PCR were also performed to confirm the sequence of hREV1. The λEMBL3 human genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened using hREV1 cDNA as a probe to isolate the genomic clones of hREV1. The phage DNAs of positive clones were purified using a Qiagen lambda kit, and the DNAs were sequenced directly to elucidate the intron-exon boundaries of hREV1. The size of each intron was determined first by genomic PCR using the sets of primers on exons and was confirmed with the genomic sequence available in the data base. To determine the chromosomal location ofhREV1 locus, sets of PCR primers were designed to amplify gene specific genomic fragments and were used for PCR screening of the GeneBridge 4 radiation hybrid mapping panel (Research Genetics). The result of the screening was submitted to the Whitehead Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome Research and was analyzed with the statistical program RHMAP. Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot and Human Cancer Cell Line Northern Blot membranes were purchased from CLONTECH and were hybridized withhREV1 cDNA or human β-actin cDNA probe using standard methodologies. HeLa cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For a transient transfection experiment, HeLa cells were grown on a 10-cm culture dish and transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)/FLAG-hREV1 or pcDNA3.1(+)/ hREV3-8-FLAG plasmid by using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection for further analysis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-hREV7 antibody was produced by immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide containing the C-terminal 19 amino acids of hREV7, and affinity-purified as described previously (36Murakumo Y. Roth T. Ishii H. Rasio D. Numata S. Croce C.M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Harvested cells were disrupted in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) with freeze and thaw cycles. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min, and then they were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with anti-hREV7 antibody (2 mg/ml) at a 1:500 dilution or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (4.4 mg/ml) at a 1:500 dilution followed by incubation with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako). After intensive washing, the antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli transformed with pGEX4T-2 plasmids with the induction of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation for several hours at 30 °C, E. coli cells were harvested and disrupted in bacterial lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) with sonication. The bacterial lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min, and the GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled proteins were synthesized with [35S]methionine using a coupled in vitrotranscription-translation (IVTT) system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Protein-protein interaction was examined by a method similar to that of Guerrette et al. (37Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 5 μg of a GST fusion protein or GST protein (alone) were incubated with radiolabeled proteins at 4 °C for 2 h in 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The beads were washed 5 times with the binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels followed by autoradiography. In some of the in vitro interaction assays, glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with nonradiolabeled proteins, and the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-hREV7 antibody. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)/FLAG-hREV1 or pcDNA3.1(+)/hREV3-8-FLAG plasmid to express hREV1 or hREV3-8 protein tagged with FLAG. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and disrupted by the same procedure described above. The cell lysates were incubated first with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C to eliminate the nonspecific binding of proteins to the beads. After a brief centrifugation (1000 cpm for 30 s), the supernatants were incubated with 3–4 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or a control mock antibody for 2 h. The antigen-antibody complex was immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads, and the beads were washed five times in the same lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-hREV7 or anti-FLAG antibody. To identify the interacting proteins of hREV7, we performed a yeast two-hybrid library screening using hREV7 as a “bait.” Approximately 5 × 105 independent clones in the human testis cDNA expression library constructed in vector pACT2 (CLONTECH) were screened on selective medium, and sequential β-galactosidase assay was performed to eliminate false positives. Several positive yeast clones were detected in this screening. pACT2/library plasmids were extracted from the positive yeast clones, and the library DNA fragments in the pACT2 plasmids were subjected to sequencing. Three of them, C76, C156, and C234, were shown to be derived from the same gene, which showed significant homology with scREV1. We screened a human testis cDNA library using a PCR probe derived from the insert of pACT2/C76 plasmid and obtained a complete cDNA of 4214 base pairs in length containing a 3753-base pair protein coding region with a predicted protein of 1251 amino acid residues and an expected molecular mass of about 138 kDa. The amino acid sequence of this gene product showed 35, 28, and 30% identity in three parts of its N-terminal and middle regions compared with that of scRev1 protein. Therefore, we concluded that this gene ishREV1, the human homolog of scREV1, which was described by other groups while this work was under way (30Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Gibbs P.E.M. Wang X.-D. Li Z. McManus T.P. Glenn McGregor W. Lawrence C.W. Maher V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although we tried 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends twice and another cDNA library screening to confirm the sequence of its 5′-terminal region, an in-frame stop codon upstream of the first ATG was not detected. hREV1 was found to be located on chromosome 2q11 by using the radiation hybrid mapping panel. Northern hybridization analysis showed the ubiquitous expression of a single 4.6-kilobase hREV1 mRNA in all normal tissues with the highest expression in testis (Fig.1 A). In addition, it showed no alteration of the hREV1 transcript in the human cancer cell lines (Fig. 1 B). Genomic clones of hREV1were isolated by screening of a human genomic library and the genomic structure of hREV1 was determined from the sequences of both cDNA and genomic locus, which revealed that hREV1 locus contains 23 exons covering a region of about 90 kilobase pairs (Fig. 1 C). The interaction between hREV1 and hREV7 was analyzed precisely by the yeast two-hybrid assay. We cloned full-length hREV1 cDNA into vector pACT2 to express hREV1 protein fused to GAL4 transcription activation domain in the yeast host strain. A positive interaction between full-length hREV1 and full-length hREV7 was demonstrated by the two-hybrid assay (Fig.2 A). We then subcloned several deletion mutants of hREV1 cDNA into vector pACT2 and checked the interaction of truncated hREV1 proteins with full-length hREV7. In addition to the qualitative colony color system, we performed quantitative liquid culture β-galactosidase assay for all of the constructs. As shown in Fig. 2 B, full-length hREV1 and hREV1-1, -2, -5, -6, -8, and -10 truncated proteins displayed both a qualitative and quantitative interaction with hREV7, whereas hREV1-3, -4, -7, and -9 truncated proteins displayed no interaction. The minimum interaction domain of hREV1 was revealed to be within amino acid residues 1130–1251. In the same way, the domain of hREV7 for interaction with hREV1 was determined by using the full-length and deletion mutants of hREV7 cDNA cloned in vector pAS2–1, which expressed hREV7 proteins fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig.2 C). Full-length hREV7 and hREV7-6, -8, and -9 truncated proteins showed both a qualitative and quantitative interaction with full-length hREV1, whereas hREV7-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -7 truncated proteins did not. These results indicate that hREV1 interacts with the region of amino acid residues 21–155 of hREV7. The interaction was also confirmed by in vitro and in vivo binding assays. A GST-hREV7 fusion protein containing full-length hREV7 was produced in bacteria and was purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled full-length hREV1 was synthesized using IVTT system (Promega) and tested for binding to GST-hREV7 compared with a control containing the GST moiety alone. We found that the IVTT hREV1 bound the GST-hREV7 fusion protein, but not GST alone (Fig.3 A). Conversely, the interaction between GST-fused hREV1 protein and non-radiolabeled IVTT hREV7 protein, which could be detected by Western blotting with anti-hREV7 antibody, was checked in vitro. Fig.3 B shows the specificity of anti-hREV7 antibody. Western blot analysis using an anti-hREV7 antibody showed one major product in a HeLa cell lysate, the size of which was the same as that of the IVTT product of hREV7. In in vitro binding assay, IVTT hREV7 bound GST-hREV1-5 fusion protein, containing amino acid residues 826–1251, but not GST-hREV1-3 and GST-hREV1-4, containing amino acid residues 1–386 and 387–825, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Inin vivo binding assay, HeLa cells were transfected transiently with the pcDNA3.1(+)/FLAG-hREV1 plasmid, which was designed to express full-length hREV1 protein tagged with FLAG on its N terminus. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and disrupted in the cell lysis buffer with freeze and thaw cycles. Their lysates were immumoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or a control mock antibody, and the precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting with anti-hREV7 or anti-FLAG antibody. The endogenous hREV7 co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged hREV1 when anti-FLAG antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, whereas neither hREV7 nor FLAG-tagged hREV1 was detected when the mock antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, indicating that hREV7 interacts with hREV1in vivo (Fig. 3 D). These results are consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data and confirm the interaction between hREV1 and hREV7. As shown in a previous publication (36Murakumo Y. Roth T. Ishii H. Rasio D. Numata S. Croce C.M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), hREV3 interacts with hREV7, just as their yeast counterparts, scRev3 and scRev7, do. We determined the precise interaction domains of hREV3 and hREV7 by the two-hybrid assay. We made truncated hREV3 cDNA fragments and cloned them in vector pACT2, which expressed hREV3 truncated proteins fused to GAL4 transcription activation domain in yeast host strain (Fig.4 A). We found that full-length hREV7 displayed both a qualitative and quantitative interactions with hREV3-3, -4, -7, -8, -9, -11, -14, and -15 truncated proteins, but not with hREV3-1, -2, -5, -6, -10, -12, and -13 truncated proteins. The minimal interaction domain of hREV3 was shown to be within the region of amino acid residues 1847–1892 (Fig. 4 A). Full-length and truncated hREV7 cDNAs cloned in vector pAS2–1 and hREV3-3 truncated cDNA cloned in vector pACT2 then were used to determine the domain of hREV7 for interaction with hREV3. Full-length hREV7 and hREV7-6, -8, and -9 truncated proteins showed both a qualitative and quantitative interaction with hREV3-3 truncated protein, but hREV7-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -7 truncated proteins did not. This indicates that hREV7 interacts with hREV3 within the region of amino acid residues 21–155 of hREV7, which is the exact same region in which hREV7 interacts with hREV1 (Fig. 2 C). However, the levels of the β-galactosidase activity for interaction between hREV3 and hREV7 truncation proteins were different from those for interaction between hREV1 and hREV7 truncation proteins. For example, the activity for the interaction between hREV3 and hREV7-6 is much higher than that between hREV1 and hREV7-6 (Fig. 2 C). This finding suggests that the binding affinity for hREV7-hREV3 complex is different from that for hREV7-hREV1 complex, although the same region of hREV7 interacted with both hREV1 and hREV3. The interaction between hREV3 and hREV7 was also checked by in vivo binding assay. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1(+)/hREV3-8-FLAG plasmid, which was designed to express hREV3-8 truncated protein containing the hREV3 amino acid residues 1776–2044 tagge"

In the presence of α-lactalbumin (LA), it transfers Gal to Glc, which is its lactose synthase (LS) activity. It also transfers glucose (Glc) from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc, constituting the glucosyltransferase (Glc-T) activity, albeit at an efficiency of only 0.3–0.4% of Gal-T activity. In the present study, we show that LA increases this activity almost 30-fold. It also enhances the Glc-T activity toward various N-acyl substituted glucosamine acceptors. Steady state kinetic studies of Glc-T reaction show that the Km for the donor and acceptor substrates are high in the absence of LA. In the presence of LA, the Km for the acceptor substrate is reduced 30-fold, whereas for UDP-Glc it is reduced only 5-fold. In order to understand this property, we have determined the crystal structures of the Gal-T1·LA complex with UDP-Glc·Mn2+ and withN-butanoyl-glucosamine (N-butanoyl-GlcN), a preferred sugar acceptor in the Glc-T activity. The crystal structures reveal that although the binding of UDP-Glc is quite similar to UDP-Gal, there are few significant differences observed in the hydrogen bonding interactions between UDP-Glc and Gal-T1. Based on the present kinetic and crystal structural studies, a possible explanation for the role of LA in the Glc-T activity has been proposed. β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 1 (Gal-T1) transfers galactose (Gal) from UDP-Gal toN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which constitutes its normal galactosyltransferase (Gal-T) activity.

For example, Gal-T1, the milk galactosyltransferase enzyme transfers Gal to the non-reducing terminalN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of glycans to form β-1,4-linked galactosylated glycan and to free GlcNAc to formN-acetyllactosamine (1Hill R. UCLA Forum Med. Sci. 1979; 21: 63-86Google Scholar), whereas Gal-T6 transfers Gal to Glc in glucosylceramide synthesizing lactosylceramide (10Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K.

Gal-T1 has been reported to be able to use, at a lower efficiency, otherN-acetyl/N-acyl substituted sugars such asN-acetyl-d-mannosamine,N-acetylmuramic acids as sugar acceptors (11Berliner L.J.

It also does not show an absolute requirement for UDP-Gal as a sugar donor since it can transfer glucose (Glc), 2-deoxy-Glc, arabinose, and GalNAc from their UDP derivatives, albeit at very low efficiencies (12Do K.Y.

In recent years, many other transferases have been shown to transfer related sugars from their UDP-derivatives, albeit with a lesser efficiency. For example, the glucosylceramide synthase, which transfers Glc from UDP-Glc to ceramide to synthesize glucosylceramide, can also transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to ceramide to synthesize galactosylceramide with ∼10% efficiency (15Sprong H.

The normal galactosyl acceptor specificity of some β4Gal-T family members, in particular of Gal-T1, is altered from GlcNAc to Glc by α-lactalbumin (LA), a mammary gland-specific Ca2+ion-binding protein that has sequence and structural similarity to c-type lysozyme (16Qasba P.K. Kumar S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 255-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The transfer of galactose to glucose to synthesize lactose by Gal-T1 in the presence of LA constitutes the lactose synthase (LS) activity of Gal-T1. In the present study we show that, in the presence of LA, Gal-T1 can transfer Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc, at an ∼30-fold higher efficiency than in the absence of LA. This constitutes its glucosyltransferase (Glc-T) activity, which compares to an efficiency of ∼10% of Gal transfer from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc. In order to better understand the broad donor specificity of Gal-T1, we have in this report attempted to investigate the Glc transfer activity of Gal-T1 in greater detail. In our continued efforts to understand the structure-function relationship between Gal-T1 and its nucleotide-sugar donor and acceptor substrates, we have previously determined several crystal structures of the complex of Gal-T1 with LA in the presence of various substrates (17Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These studies, together with the previously determined crystal structure of Gal-T1 by Gastinel et al. (18Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), have led to an understanding of the enzyme mechanism of Gal-T1 and the modulation of the acceptor specificity by LA. In order to understand the observed Glc-T activity by Gal-T1 and the role of LA, we have determined the crystal structure of Gal-T1 complex with UDP-Glc in the presence of LA. Our attempts to grow the crystals of this complex in the absence of LA have not yet been successful. We did succeed, however, in obtaining the crystals of the complex of Gal-T1 with LA in the presence of UDP-Glc·Mn2+ and also in the presence ofN-butanoylglucosamine (N-butanoyl-GlcN), a preferred sugar acceptor in Glc-T activity. Here we present these crystal structures in view of the newly observed Glc-T activity. We also found that the mutation of Cys-342 to Thr in Gal-T1 enhances thein vitro folding of the protein from the inclusion bodies and increases the stability of Gal-T1 without perturbing the crystal structure of the enzyme. Bacterial growth and plasmid transformations were performed using standard procedures (19Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kinstom, R. E., Moore, D. D., Smith, J. A., Seidman, J. G., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The plasmid pEGT-d129, which encodes the catalytic domain (residues 130–402) of bovine Gal-T1, was used for mutation (20Boeggeman E.E. Balaji P.V. Sethi N. Masibay A.S. Qasba P.K. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using aCLONTECH site-directed mutagenesis transformer kit. The transformation mixture contained the template pEGT-d129, a selection primer (pNotApa), and the mutagenic primer 5′-GTGATCGGGAAGACCCGGATGCGCCA- 3′. Mutants were screened for the incorporated mutations by looking for changes in restriction enzyme digestion patterns and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The positive clones were transformed into B834(DE3)pLysS cells. The expression and purification of the inclusion bodies were carried out as described previously (19Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kinstom, R. E., Moore, D. D., Smith, J. A., Seidman, J. G., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The inclusion bodies were S-sulfonated by dissolving in 5 m GdnHCl, 0.3 m sodium sulfite, and the addition of di-sodium 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate to a final concentration of 5 mm (21Noel J.P. Bingman C.A. Deng T.L. Dupureur C.M. Hamilton K.J. Jiang R.T. Kwak J.G. Sekharudu C. Sundaralingam M. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11801-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sulfonated protein was precipitated by dilution with water, and the precipitate was washed thoroughly. It was re-dissolved in 5 m GdnHCl to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (1.9–2.0 optical density at 275 nm). The protein solution was diluted 10-fold, in 10 portions, in a folding solution to give a final concentration of 100 μg/ml Gal-T1, 0.5m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, 4 mm cysteamine, and 2 mm cystamine, pH 8.0 at 4°C. It was left at 4 °C for 48 h to allow the protein to fold and then dialyzed against 3 × 4 liters of water containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 4 mm cysteamine, and 2 mm cystamine at 4°C to remove GdnHCl. Any protein that precipitated during dialysis was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was concentrated. Typically, when 100 mg of sulfonated protein was folded in a 1-liter folding solution, it yields 2–5 and 10–12 mg of active, soluble, and pure wild-type d129-Gal-T1 and C342T-Gal-T1, respectively. The folded proteins were purified further on the LA-agarose column (Sigma). The final, purified protein had a specific activity that was slightly higher than that of purified milk Gal-T1. The mouse LA gene was PCR-amplified from the clone p35MLA that contains mouse LA cDNA cloned into pBR322 vector. 2P. V. Balaji and P. K. Qasba, unpublished observation. The oligonucleotides with a built-in restriction site for NdeI andBamHI (shown in bold type) were used as the 5′ end and 3′ end primers and were used for the PCR amplification, respectively: 5′-GGAATTCATATGACAGAGGCTTACAAAATGCAAGGTGACCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGGGCTTCTCACAACGCCA-3′. The PCR-amplified products were cloned into theNdeI/BamHI restriction sites of the modified pET17 expression vector. The bacterial growth, the inclusion body purification, and sulfonation methods were quite similar to those used for Gal-T1. However, unlike Gal-T1, the S-sulfonated LA remained soluble and was dialyzed against water thoroughly. The concentration of the dialyzed sulfonated LA solution was adjusted to ∼l mg/ml by monitoring its absorption at 275 nm (2.4–2.6 optical density). It has been shown previously that CaCl2 is required for the folding of the recombinant LA (22Wang M. Scott W.A. Rao K.R. Udey J. Conner G.E. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21116-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equal volume of a 2× folding solution containing 100 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mm calcium chloride, 8 mmreduced glutathione, and 4 mm oxidized glutathione was added slowly to the protein solution. The resulting solution was left at room temperature for 48 h to fold and then dialyzed against 1 mm calcium chloride to remove the buffer and the oxido-shuffling agents. The dialyzed protein solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove any precipitate formed and then concentrated. The active protein was isolated from the partially folded inactive protein by fractional precipitation at 40–70% ammonium sulfate concentration (23Qasba P.K. Chakrabartty P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1167-1173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was dissolved in water and dialyzed extensively against 1 mm calcium chloride, and the resulting protein solution was directly used for crystallization or other studies. Using this method, 60–70% of the startingS-sulfonated LA material was obtained in an active form. The in vitro assay for Gal-T1 was carried out as described previously (20Boeggeman E.E. Balaji P.V. Sethi N. Masibay A.S. Qasba P.K. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Qasba P.K. Chakrabartty P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1167-1173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of the enzymes were measured using UDP-Gal or UDP-Glc as sugar nucleotide donors, and GlcNAc or Glc as the acceptor sugars. The Glc-T reaction was carried out in the presence of saturating amounts of LA. The trueKm of the donor (KA) and of the acceptor (KB), the dissociation constant of the donor, Kia, and kcat, were obtained by two substrate analyses using the primary plots of five concentrations of donor (UDP-Glc) and five concentrations of acceptor, and the corresponding secondary plots of the intercepts and slopes. Conditions were chosen such that the initial rates were linear with respect to time and the donor and acceptor concentrations were in a range that allowed for an accurate Michaelis-Menten plot to be derived (Fig. 1). The data were also analyzed for a general two-substrate system using Equations 1 and 2 (24Zhang Y. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T.J. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the EnzFitter program, a non-linear curve fitting program for Windows from Biosoft. v=Vmax[A][B]KiaKB+KB[A]+KA[B]+[A][B]Equation 1 v=Vmax[A][B]KB[A]+KA[B]+[A][B]Equation 2 Equation 1 is the rate equation for sequential symmetrical initial velocity pattern associated with an ordered or random equilibrium sequential mechanism, whereas Equation 2 is the rate equation for asymmetric initial velocity pattern associated with a sequential mechanism in which substrate A does not dissociate well from the E·S complex. The kinetic parametersKA, KB,Kia, and Vmax were obtained from the fitted curves using the above rate equations. The graphical method and the EnzFitter program gave very similar kinetic parameters. The catalytic domain of recombinant bovine Gal-T1, residues 130–402 (d129-Gal-T1) (mass ∼33 kDa), and mouse recombinant LA (mass ∼14 kDa) were co-crystallized either in the presence ofN-butanoyl-GlcN or UDP-glucose. Crystals were grown at room temperature by hanging drop methods, using 20 mg ml−1Gal-T1 and 10 mg ml−1 LA in the presence of a substrate with the precipitant containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6), and 12.5% polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystals of the complex could only be obtained in the presence of substrates. The concentration of substrates used during the crystallization were 10 mmN-butanoyl-GlcN and 17 mm UDP-Glc and MnCl2. Complete three-dimensional x-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line X9B, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, using a Quantum-4 CCD detector with a wavelength of 0.98 Å. The frames were processed using DENZO (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

The crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement methods using AMORE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of lactose synthase (17Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) without any substrate was used as a model for molecular replacement. After initial refinement, the difference electron density maps (Fig.2) revealed the substrate bound to the LS molecule and were included for further refinement. The two LS molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. During refinement, the two LS molecules are restrained by this pseudo 2-fold symmetry. All the refinements were carried out initially by XPLOR 3.85, followed by CNS1.0 (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. De Lano W.L. Gross P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The coordination distances for a Mn2+ ion were not restrained, whereas those for Ca2+ in LA were restrained. Only reflections withF > 2ς (F) were used for the refinement. The final refinement statistics are listed in TableI. All the figures were drawn using MOLSCRIPT (28Karulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank access numbers for the coordinates of C342T-Gal-T1·LA·GlcNAc, LS·N-butanoyl-GlcN, and LS·UDP-Glc·Mn complexes are1JN8, 1JNA, and 1JNC, respectively. In a separate study on the role of cysteine residues in Gal-T1, it was observed that the mutation of Cys-342 to Thr in the catalytic domain of the wild-type protein resulted in a 2–3-fold higher yield of the folded protein. The mutant C342T-Gal-T1 was significantly more stable at room temperatures and showed ∼18% higher activity compared with the wild type (TableII). In the crystal structure of wild-type Gal-T1, Cys-342 residue exists in the reduced form, whereas the remaining four Cys residues form two disulfide bonds. Recent mass spectroscopic studies have shown that, during denaturation of milk Gal-T1, this free Cys-342 residue is responsible for the formation of mixed disulfide bonds (29Yen T.Y. Joshi R.K. Yan H. Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Macher B.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased in vitro folding efficiency of the mutant C342T-Gal-T1 may be attributed to the diminished mixed disulfide bond formation during folding.Table IIRelative specific activities of the wild type catalytic domain of Gal-T1 (d129-Gal-T1, residues 130–402) and C342T-Gal-T1, in the Gal-T, LS, and Glc-T reactions and comparison of the influence of α-LA on these reactionsEnzyme− α-Lactalbumin+ α-LactalbuminUDP-galactose → GlcNAc (Gal-T activity)UDP-glucose → GlcNAc (Glc-T activity)UDP-galactose → Glc (LS activity)UDP-glucose → GlcNAc (Glc-T activity)%%%%Bovine milk Gal-T11000.311010d129-Gal-T11000.31297.8C342T-Gal-T11180.318011.8All reactions were performed under saturating conditions of all substrates and at 7 μm α-lactalbumin concentration (see text for assay conditions). 100% activity is defined as 51 pmol min−1 ng−1 of Gal transfer to GlcNAc in the Gal-T reaction.

The LS and Glc-T activities are expressed as a percentage of Gal-T activity, which is set as 100%. Gal-T1 catalyzed the transfer of Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc, generating a β1–4-linked disaccharide (Gal-T activity) (Table II). The modifier protein, LA, changed the sugar acceptor specificity of Gal-T1 to Glc, the LS activity of the enzyme complex. The Gal-T1, however, could also transfer Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc, exhibiting a Glc-T activity (Table II), although the efficiency of this reaction was only 0.3% as compared with Gal-T activity (13Andree P.J. Berliner L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have compared these three activities of the recombinant wild type enzyme, d129-Gal-T1, and of C342T, in the presence and absence of LA (TableII). In the absence of LA, Glc-T activity toward GlcNAc acceptor was only ∼0.3% of that of Gal-T activity. In the presence of LA, however, this activity increased ∼30-fold, equivalent to ∼10% of the Gal-T activity. The mutant protein C342T-Gal-T1 also showed 10–15% higher Glc-T activity and ∼40% more LS activity, compared with wild type. In the presence of LA, the transfer of Glc from UDP-Glc to an acceptor molecule (the Glc-T activity) was enhanced by ∼50–75-fold, depending upon the N2-acyl substituent on the glucosamine (GlcN) molecule (TableIII, part A). The transfer to unsubstituted Glc was approximately one-twentieth as that to GlcNAc, indicating the importance of the N-acyl substitution at the 2-amino group of GlcN. The acceptor binding site can accommodateN-acetyl, N-propionyl, and even the bulkierN-butanoyl group. In the absence of LA, the presence of a β-benzyl group at the reducing end of GlcNAc showed an activity higher than with GlcNAc. However, LA did not increase this activity any further as it did with GlcNAc (Table III, part A).N,N′-Diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc) was a less efficient acceptor, and LA inhibited this weak activity even further. In the LS reaction, the 2-hydroxyl group in Glc was necessary for maximum enzymatic reaction since 2-deoxyglucose or 2-fluoro-glucose were less efficient acceptors (Table III, part B).Table IIICatalytic activity of C342T mutant using various acceptors in glucosyltransferase (part A) and lactose synthase (part B) reactionsA.

Open table in a new tab The steady state kinetic analyses of C342T were carried out in the presence and absence of LA, in which acceptor and donor substrate concentrations were varied (Fig. 1). The initial velocity data obtained in the absence of LA with varying concentrations of UDP-Glc at fixed concentrations of GlcNAc gave nonparallel lines in the double-reciprocal plot, and the data fitted best to Equation 1. Under these conditions the trueKm values for UDP-Glc and GlcNAc were much higher than the values found for UDP-Gal and GlcNAc in the Gal-T reaction. In the presence of LA, the data of double-reciprocal plots showed essentially parallel lines and the data fitted best to Equation 2, where Kia, the dissociation constant for UDP-Glc, was 0 (Table IV); theKm values for both substrates were considerably reduced to ∼5-fold for UDP-Glc and 30-fold for GlcNAc, whereas thekcat increased by 30-fold (Table IV).Table IVKinetic parameters for glucose transfer to GlcNAc by C342T-Gal-T1 in the presence and absence of LASubstrateParameter−LA+LAUDP-Glckcat(s−1)0.058 (5)0.247 (5)KA (μm)148 (4)31 (2)Kia (μm)19.5 (6)0GlcNAcKB(mm)73.8 (3)2.5 (1) Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the mutant C342T-Gal-T1 was quite similar to the wild-type Gal-T1 in complex with LA and GlcNAc. The mean r.m.s. deviation of the Cα atoms in the mutant compared with the wild-type Gal-T1 structure was 0.4 Å. Although there was an additional methyl group present in the Thr side chain compared with the Cys residue, it was well accommodated and showed no perturbation to the local structure. The conformation and the binding of LA to C342T-Gal-T1 were quite similar to that observed with the wild type Gal-T1·LA complex with GlcNAc (17Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The molecular interactions between GlcNAc and the C342T-Gal-T1·LA complex were quite similar to those found in the Gal-T1·LA·GlcNAc (LS·GlcNAC) complex (17Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TheN-acetyl group of GlcNAc interacted with a hydrophobic pocket on Gal-T1 formed by the residues Arg-359, Phe-360, and Ile-363. A hydrogen bonding interaction was observed between Arg-359 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc (Fig.4A). The individual structures of Gal-T1 and LA in both the crystal structures, Gal-T1·LA complex with N-butanoyl-GlcN and Gal-T1·LA complex with UDP-Glc·Mn2+, were quite similar (Fig.3, A and B). The r.m.s. deviation for their Cα atoms was only 0.6 Å. These structures were also similar to those of Gal-T1·LA·GlcNAc complex and the Gal-T1·LA·UDP·Mn2+ complex (17Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The binding ofN-butanoyl-GlcN was quite similar to the GlcNAc binding in the C342T-Gal-T1·LA·GlcNAc complex (Fig.4, A and B).N-Butanoyl group was very well accommodated in theN-acetyl binding pocket formed by residues Arg-359, Phe-360, and Ile-363 (Fig. 4B). The molecular interactions between the N-butanoyl group and Gal-T1 were also similar to those found with N-acetyl group (Fig. 4, A andB). In addition, the extended aliphatic chain of theN-butanoyl group is in the close vicinity to the side chain of Met-110 of the LA molecule. Longer aliphatic chain in theN-acyl group would cause steric hindrance with Met-110 residue of LA and expected to affect LA binding to Gal-T1, which is in agreement with the previous results (30Geren C.R. Magee S.C. Ebner K.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1461-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Just as in the crystal structure of the Gal-T1·LA·UDP·Mn2+ complex (17Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J.

The CLCA precursor is about 900 amino acids long with one proteolytic cleavage site following the amino-terminal signal sequence and another around residue 600. The latter results in a 90-kDa product with perhaps four transmembrane segments and a 30–40-kDa product that may be found in close association with the first (1Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D.

Although a structure-function analysis has not been performed on a CLCA family member, potential phosphorylation sites for calmodulin kinase II and protein kinase C are consistent with calcium regulation. Indeed, all CLCA proteins tested thus far have been shown to be outwardly rectified chloride channels that are activated by calcium (2Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P.

Recently, a human CLCA homolog, hCLCA2, was found to be highly expressed in epithelium of mammary ducts and alveoli but down-regulated in mammary tumors and tumor cell lines (9Gruber A.D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of hCLCA2 in breast cancer cells inhibited subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice by an unknown mechanism, suggesting that hCLCA2 is a tumor suppressor. We described previously a calcium-activated chloride channel derived from mouse lung, mCLCA1 (3Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32096-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hybridization studies indicated widespread expression in secretory tissues, including mammary ductal and alveolar epithelium (5Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether a signal from a mammary gland represented mCLCA1 or a closely related homolog, we probed lactating mammary glands by degenerate PCR. The predominant product was a homolog of mCLCA1, referred to here as mCLCA2. High-level expression of mCLCA2 correlated closely with the onset of apoptosis, both in vivoand in vitro. A role for chloride channels in apoptosis induction has been suggested previously. In lymphocytes, an outwardly rectified chloride channel has been shown to be rapidly activated in response to apoptogens, and channel inhibitors blocked apoptosis (10Szabo I. Lepple-Wienhues A. Kaba K. Zoratti M. Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6169-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, CFTR, were found to inhibit apoptosis in C127 cells (11Gottlieb R.A. Dosanjh A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3587-3591Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if CLCA channels played a similar role in mammary epithelial cells, then the mCLCA2 gene should be down-regulated in cells that have become apoptosis-resistant, e.g. tumor cell lines. To find whether selection for apoptosis resistance would suffice to evoke down-regulation of CLCA genes, we selected in vitro for resistance to anoikis, the form of apoptosis driven by cell detachment in the absence of growth and survival factors, and examined CLCA expression (12Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar, 13Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we asked whether re-expression of CLCA genes would be tolerated by tumor cell lines. The mammary epithelial cell line HC11 (14Ball R. Friis R. Schoenenberger C. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) was obtained from Nancy Hynes (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland) and was maintained in complete medium (CM: RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin (5 µg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml)). Serum-free medium contained RPMI alone. The tumor cell lines JC and MCF7 were obtained from the ATCC. CSML-0 was a gift of S. Zain (University of Rochester School of Medicine), and low passage HEK cells were from Microbix Biosystems, Inc., Toronto, Canada. All were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Mammary glands were removed from lactating mice, and RNA was extracted with Trizol and reverse-transcribed (Superscript, Life Technologies, Inc.). A 2.7-kilobase product was amplified by PCR (93 °C, 30 min; 55 °C, 45 min; 72 °C, 2′; 35 cycles) using primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mCLCA1open reading frame (5′-TGGAGCAGTGCGACCATGGTGCCA-3′ and 5′-TAGTTTAAAATAGAGTTAAAAATCACAG-3′) and the high fidelityPwo DNA polymerase. This product was sequenced directly then cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). Of five clones, one corresponded in sequence to mCLCA1. The other clones and the directly sequenced PCR product contained a distinct sequence that was calledmCLCA2. Differences between the two open reading frames were confirmed by amplifying and sequencing smaller intervals of the cDNAs from virgin or lactating glands from two different reverse-transcription reactions and commercially prepared cDNAs (RapidScan, Origene). cDNA from mammary glands of different developmental stages (RapidScan kit, Origene) was analyzed by PCR with a primer pair designed to symmetrically bracket an EcoRI site present in the mCLCA2 cDNA at nucleotide 866 but absent from the mCLCA1 cDNA. Primers were 5′-ACTCGAAGACACGGCTGTATGAAC-3′ and 5′-CTGTCAAATGTGACTAATCCAAC-3′, starting at nucleotides 650 and 1075, respectively. Thus, cleavage of the PCR product with EcoRI and electrophoresis resulted in a 425-base pair band for mCLCA1 and a doublet of 212 and 213 base pairs for mCLCA2. This approach to relative quantitation was designed to avoid problems due to differences in amplification efficiency observed with gene-specific primer pairs. PCR was for 35 cycles (93 °C, 30 min; 55 °C, 45 min; 72 °C, 45 min) using Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cycle number was selected to be within the linear phase of PCR with respect to mCLCA1 product/template ratio. For amplification of the β-actin control, template was diluted 10-fold, and the cycle number was 33. Primers for β-actin were 5′-TGGTGGGAATGGGTCAGA-3′ and 5′-AGGGAGGAAGAGGATGCG-3′. HC11 cells were grown to confluency and incubated a further 2 days in CM, treated with trypsin, and diluted into RPMI without serum. Equal numbers of cells were deposited on 100-mm dishes. Cells were harvested 0, 8, 16, and 48 h later, and RNA was extracted with Trizol. Control cells were cultured in 10% serum for 48 h. Bax primers were 5′-TCCGGGAGCAGCTTGGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CACAAAGATGGTCACTGTCTG-3′, and GAPDH was 5′-ACGACCCCTTCATTGACCTC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCCAGAGGGGCCATCCAC-3′. Confluent HC11 cells were collected by trypsinization, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% serum, and plated on plastic or plastic-treated with poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(HEMA); Sigma) as described (13Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated 30 h before harvesting RNA. 10-cm dishes of HC11 cells were maintained at confluency for 4 days in CM, then primed by incubation in RPMI/2% FBS/insulin (5 µg/ml) for 2 days before inducing with prolactin (5 µg/ml) and dexamethasone (1 µg/ml). After 4 days, the medium in the last dish was replaced with RPMI without supplements, and cells were harvested after a further 2 days. RNA was extracted with Trizol, and 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Initially, serial dilutions of these reactions were amplified 35 cycles with primers specific for mCLCA1 and mCLCA2, β-casein, or GAPDH. Dilutions were selected that produced a linear response with respect to an added template for each primer pair. Primers for β-casein were 5′-GTGGCCCTTGCTCTTGCAAG-3′ and 5′-AGTCTGAGG- AAAAGCCTGAAC-3′. A multi-tissue array of cDNAs normalized to β-actin (RapidScan, Origene) was probed by PCR (35 cycles) as described above for mammary cDNA. HC11 cells were grown to confluency, then detached with trypsin, diluted into RPMI, and incubated 3–4 days until most of the cells were dead. Surviving cells were allowed to recover in 10% serum and to return to confluency. Timing was adjusted to allow about 5–10% survival, and the cycle was repeated 10 times. A control dish was cultured continuously in 10% serum during this period. RNA was extracted, and the expression levels of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 compared with those of the untreated control by RT-PCR, taking care that all dishes were equally confluent for the same period of time before harvest. The resulting cell lines SS1 and SS2 were tested for their tumorigenicity by injecting 106 cells subcutaneously at the right gluteus of three BALB/c mice each. Sets of three control mice were injected similarly with either non-selected HC11 or JC tumor cells. Cells were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS. RT-PCR was performed as described above (650–1075 interval) except that PCR was limited to 31 cycles. Serial dilutions of HC11 cDNA were included for relative quantitation. For detection of splice variants, cDNA prepared from HC11 or tumor cell lines was probed systematically by PCR with a number of primer sets derived from the mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 cDNAs, designed to amplify either the entire open reading frame or smaller segments. When aberrant-sized products were detected, their authenticity was first confirmed by Southern hybridization or nested PCR before determining their sequences. The mCLCA2 cDNA was excised from pGEM-T as a NotI/SalI fragment and transferred to pcDNA3.1Zeo. The mCLCA1 cDNA was excised from pTet-Splice (3Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H-L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32096-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and inserted into pcDNA3.1Zeo as anEcoRI/SalI fragment. The resulting plasmids were transfected into low passage HEK293 cells with LipofectAMINE Plus, and zeocin selection (400 µg/ml) was applied. Co-transfection with pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) provided a control for transfection frequency, which did not vary significantly between DNA preparations. After death of the untransfected cells (5 days), surviving cells were transferred to a 12-well plate and allowed to form colonies under continued selection. MCF-7 and HC11 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 and selected similarly. To visualize and quantify colony survival, cells were stained after 3 weeks with the basic dye crystal violet as described by Carneroet al. (15Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). After washing the cells extensively with water, cells were photographed, and then stain was eluted with 10% acetic acid and quantified spectrophotometrically at 595 nm as a measure of surviving cell number. For retroviral infection, the mCLCA2 cDNA was inserted into the Pinco vector at the BamHI site, and viral supernatants were generated from Phoenix E cells as described (16Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This vector carries a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. HC11 cells were infected overnight as nearly confluent monolayers. After 1 week, cells were trypsinized and diluted into serum-free medium. After 3 days, aliquots of cells were removed, and the DNA-specific fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) were used to distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic cells. While Hoechst is membrane-permeable and stains all nuclei, PI stains only cells that have lost membrane integrity,i.e. necrotic cells (18Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. L. Leinwand A. Apoptosis Assays in Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1998: 15.1-15.24Google Scholar). Cells were considered apoptotic if nuclei were PI-negative and clearly disintegrating into apoptotic bodies. About 500 GFP-positive cells were counted for each measurement, and results from two dishes were averaged. CLCA homologs were amplified from mammary glands of lactating mice as described in “Material and Methods.” Cloning of the products revealed two distinct sequences, one identical to mCLCA1 and the other encoding a protein 95% identical to mCLCA1, mCLCA2 (Fig.1). PCR error was ruled out by using a high fidelity polymerase, directly sequencing PCR products before cloning, and sequencing multiple clones. Amino acid differences between the homologs are generally scattered and do not affect known features of the CLCA family such as phosphorylation sites or the symmetrical multi-cysteine region (1Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M.A. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Gandhi R.

One potential glycosylation site is lost from mCLCA2 at amino acid 687 and another is gained at amino acid 840. Expression of the cDNA in HEK293 cells revealed similar protein precursor and processing products as observed for mCLCA1 and other CLCA family members (data not shown; Ref. 3Gandhi R. Elble R.C.

Recently, a similar cDNA sequence from lactating mammary gland has been reported (19Lee D. Ha S. Kho Y. Kim J. Cho K. Baik M. Choi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 264: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sequence of mCLCA2 in Fig. 1 differs at six amino acid positions but probably represents the same cDNA because RT-PCR with primers that would recognize either cDNA revealed only the sequence shown here in mammary gland (not shown). To assess whether mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 were expressed similarly in mammary development, cDNA from virgin, pregnant, lactating, or involuting mouse mammary glands were analyzed by PCR as described in “Materials and Methods” (Fig.2A). Expression of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 was nearly reciprocal. While mCLCA1 levels were similar in virgin, pregnant, and lactating gland but abated during involution, mCLCA2 mRNA was low in virgin gland but greatly increased during lactation and remained high in involuting gland (Fig.2A). The induction of mCLCA2 and repression of mCLCA1 might be due either to changes in lactogenic hormone levels during the onset and cessation of lactation or to loss of growth factors and disruption of the extracellular matrix during mammary reorganization and involution (13Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar, 20Talhouk R. Bissel M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These two possibilities were tested independentlyin vitro. The immortalized mammary epithelial cell line HC11 is known to induce transcription of β-casein in response to the lactogenic hormones prolactin, insulin, and hydrocortisone and to undergo apoptosis when deprived of serum or anchorage (13Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ball R. Friis R. Schoenenberger C. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when HC11 cells were grown to confluency in CM then transferred to medium without serum, over the course of 48 h cells began to detach from the plate and showed signs of apoptosis (13Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). During this time, expression of mCLCA1 abated while that of mCLCA2 was strongly induced (Fig. 2B). Transcription of Bax, a marker for apoptosis, also increased significantly, while GAPDH, an internal standard, showed no change. Similarly, anchorage deprivation by growth on poly(HEMA)-treated dishes elicited an increase in mCLCA2 transcript levels (Fig. 2C). In contrast, treatment of HC11 with lactogenic hormones did not induce expression of mCLCA2, although mCLCA1 was induced in parallel with β-casein, reaching its peak 2 days after hormone addition and declining after hormone and serum withdrawal (Fig. 2D). By 2 days after withdrawal of hormones and growth factors, neither mCLCA1 nor mCLCA2 transcript was detected, in agreement with Fig. 2A. Thus, increase in mCLCA2 expression observed during mammary development in vivo is triggered by loss of anchorage and growth factors and not by hormones. The results above show that, at least in mammary epithelial cells, mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 are expressed in the same cell type but under differing physiological circumstances. mCLCA1 normally predominates, whereas apoptotic stress induces mCLCA2. To assess whether this relationship prevailed in other tissues, an array of cDNAs from various organs and developmental stages was probed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3). As in mammary, expression of both mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 was observed in most of the tissues examined; however, mCLCA1 usually predominated. The exceptions were thymus, small intestine, and skin, all of which are typified by high rates of cell turnover by apoptosis (21Osborne B.A. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Grimm L. Kallinch T. Liu Z. Schwartz L.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Anderson J.M.

Similarly, high expression of mCLCA2 during embryonic development may reflect re-organization by apoptotic cell death (24Meier P. Finch A. Evan G. Nature. 2000; 407: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). These results, together with the demonstrations that Cl− channels are required for apoptosis in lymphocytes and that CFTR can promote apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells (10Szabo I. Lepple-Wienhues A. Kaba K. Zoratti M. Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6169-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Gottlieb R.A. Dosanjh A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3587-3591Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggested that mCLCA2 might be a component of an apoptosis-promoting pathway. Since one of the early requisite steps in tumorigenesis is inactivation of apoptotic pathways by mutation, we examined expression of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 in two cell lines derived from spontaneous mammary adenocarcinomas, JC (25Chao T.Y. Chu T.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1989; 25: 93-99Google Scholar) and CSML-0 (26Ebralidze A.K. Tul'chinskii E.M. Grigorian M.S. Senin V.M. Lukanidin E.M. Genetika. 1989; 25: 932-936PubMed Google Scholar), with the expectation that mCLCA2 expression would be reduced especially when cells were starved. In both cell lines, net CLCA expression was indeed reduced by at least 30-fold relative to non-transformed HC11 cells even when grown in the presence of serum (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, further analysis revealed that mCLCA1 transcript had been reduced, but not that of mCLCA2 (Fig. 4B). However, when amplification of the entire mCLCA2 open reading frame was attempted, the tumor cells proved to express only truncated splice variants incapable of encoding full-length mCLCA2 protein (Figs. 1 and 4C). For example, JC cells expressed transcripts lacking coding sequences for amino acids 360–730 or 654–708, while the principal transcript detected in CSML-0 cells lacked amino acids 75–383 (Fig. 1). The PCR products clearly represented splice variants rather than genomic deletions because the reading frames were always conserved, deletions generally corresponded to intron/exon junctions mapped in the hCLCA1 gene (4Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H-Li. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and occasionally different cDNAs from the same cell line lacked different intervals. For example, the right-hand panel of Fig. 4C shows the products obtained from amplification of a 1.3-kilobase region containing the conserved proteolytic processing site. JC cells produced one transcript that deleted the site and one that did not. The upper band in the JC and CSML lanes was not characterized. No evidence of mCLCA1 splice variants was found, suggesting that mCLCA1 expression is disrupted at the promoter level in tumor cells. To address the question whether loss of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 expression is an obligatory step in the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis, HC11 cells were subjected to numerous cycles of apoptotic stress and re-growth by withdrawing serum and anchorage for 3 days followed by serum addition and return to confluency. While initial cell loss by apoptosis was >90%, with each subsequent round of starvation fewer cells rounded up, resulting eventually in a fully anoikis-resistant population. Analysis of the cells by RT-PCR showed that, like the tumor cell lines, the selected cell lines SS1 and SS2 had lost expression of mCLCA1 (Fig. 4, A and B). The change in expression was stably inherited over 2 months of serial passage in 10% FBS. This suggests that apoptotic pressure during the course of tumor development selects for cells that have lost CLCA expression. When the resultant cell lines were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice, both produced tumors over the course of 3 months in two out of three mice injected, while non-selected HC11 cells failed to produce tumors. Again, loss of CLCA expression correlated with tumorigenicity. The loss of expression of both mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 during tumorigenesis suggested that either might inhibit survival of tumor cells. To test this idea, the cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 Zeo and transfected into low-passage HEK293 cells in a standard colony survival assay, used previously to demonstrate the growth inhibitory properties of tumor suppressors such as p16 and p19 (15Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with a GFP-expressing plasmid provided a control for transfection frequency, which was about 20% in all dishes. However, when cells were subjected to selection with zeocin, although the same density of single colonies formed initially, nearly all of those transfected with mCLCA1 or mCLCA2 had died by 4 weeks of selection (Fig. 5A). A similar result was obtained when human breast cancer cell line MCF7 was transfected with mCLCA2 (Fig. 5A). Ultimately, only two mCLCA2-expressing HEK colonies survived; upon expansion, they grew slowly and cultures accumulated enlarged, multinucleated cells (Fig.6, A–D). These results, together with the dramatic and divergent modulation of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 expression in HC11, suggested that HC11 cells might also be sensitive to ectopic overexpression of mCLCA1 and mCLCA2. Indeed, while transfection with vector alone produced rapidly growing colonies containing cells of similar morphology to the starting population, overexpression of mCLCA1 or mCLCA2 resulted in few colonies (Fig.5A), consisting of greatly enlarged, slowly growing cells (Fig. 6, E–G).Figure 6Aberrant morphology of HEK293 (A–D) and HC11 (E–G) cells transfected with mCLCA1 or mCLCA2.A–D, colonies arising from transfection with vector (A, B) or mCLCA2 (C, D) and surviving zeocin selection were treated with trypsin and diluted into normal medium.

https://openalex.org/W2007318620,"In this study, two alternatively spliced forms of the mouse death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) have been identified and their roles in apoptosis examined. The mouse DAPK-α sequence is 95% identical to the previously described human DAPK, and it has a kinase domain and calmodulin-binding region closely related to the 130–150 kDa myosin light chain kinases. A 12-residue extension of the carboxyl terminus of DAPK-β distinguishes it from the human and mouse DAPK-α. DAPK phosphorylates at least one substrate in vitro and in vivo, the myosin II regulatory light chain. This phosphorylation occurs preferentially at Ser-19 and is stimulated by calcium and calmodulin. The mRNA encoding DAPK is widely distributed and detected in mouse embryos and most adult tissues, although the expression of the encoded 160-kDa DAPK protein is more restricted. Overexpression of DAPK-α, the mouse homolog of human DAPK has a negligible effect on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of DAPK-β has a strong cytoprotective effect on TNF-treated cells. Biochemical analysis of TNF-treated cell lines expressing mouse DAPK-β suggests that the cytoprotective effect of DAPK is mediated through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways and results in the inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria as well as inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. These results suggest that the mouse DAPK-β is a negative regulator of TNF-induced apoptosis. In this study, two alternatively spliced forms of the mouse death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) have been identified and their roles in apoptosis examined. The mouse DAPK-α sequence is 95% identical to the previously described human DAPK, and it has a kinase domain and calmodulin-binding region closely related to the 130–150 kDa myosin light chain kinases.

Overexpression of DAPK-β has a strong cytoprotective effect on TNF-treated cells. Biochemical analysis of TNF-treated cell lines expressing mouse DAPK-β suggests that the cytoprotective effect of DAPK is mediated through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways and results in the inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria as well as inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. These results suggest that the mouse DAPK-β is a negative regulator of TNF-induced apoptosis. myosin light chain kinase calmodulin regulatory light chain death-associated protein kinase tumor necrosis factor kilobase(s) poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase doxycycline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis base pair(s) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid p-nitroaniline nuclear factor κB Apoptosis is a carefully regulated cellular event with important roles in a number of processes that occur during development and contribute to tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. A large number of signaling molecules involved in regulating the commitment and progression of apoptosis have been identified, and their complex interactions are being investigated. There is now also considerable evidence that many protein kinases have roles in apoptosis and may help regulate the signaling pathways that ultimately determine the critical balance in the choice between life and death (1Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Utz P.J. Anderson P. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Myosin II motor activities have been implicated in the general regulation of morphological changes that occur during the execution phase of apoptosis (3Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In smooth and nonmuscle cells, the phosphorylation of myosin II by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)1 is a key event leading to the activation of myosin II motor activities and the production of forces for contraction, migration, adhesion, and cytokinesis (4Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It is now known that other protein kinases in addition to the conventional calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent MLCKs can phosphorylate myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC). These kinases include p21-activated kinase (PAK), rho-activated kinase (RHOK), and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) (5Chew T.L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 7Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cote G.P. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23433-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple signaling pathways converge at the myosin regulatory light chain, and it is likely that each of these pathways modulates myosin motor activities to generate forces necessary for the formation or disassembly of signaling complexes and their intracellular trafficking. A recent study has shown that myosin II motor activities activated by the conventional Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK has an important role in regulating the translocation of at least one death receptor, TNFR-1, to the plasma membrane (8Jin Y. Atkinson S.J. Marrs J.A. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30342-30349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting an additional role in regulation of the apoptotic response in cells. DAPK is a Ca2+/CaM-dependent Ser/Thr protein kinase that was identified as a positive mediator of interferon-γ-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (9Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Several other kinases related to DAPK have also been identified, and all have strong sequence homology that is restricted to the kinase domain of DAPK (11Kogel D. Prehn J.H. Scheidtmann K.H. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This kinase family includes ZIP/DLK, DAPK-related apoptosis-inducing kinases 1 and 2, DAPK2, and dystrophin-related protein-1 (12Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Kogel D. Plottner O. Landsberg G. Christian S. Scheidtmann K.H.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but to date no in vivo substrates have been identified. The significance of RLC phosphorylation by DAPKs is unknown, although DAPK, dystrophin-related protein-1, and ZIP/DLK are or can become associated with the actomyosin cytoskeleton (10Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 16Inbal B. Shani G. Cohen O. Kissil J.L. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell.

Similar to other apoptotic regulators, ectopic overexpression of the DAPK family members induces morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis, and this family of protein kinases is considered to be positive regulators of apoptosis. Although the signaling pathway through which members of the DAPK family promote apoptotic cell death is not understood, it has been shown that DAPK acts upstream of p53 to regulate p53 activity in a p19ARF-dependent manner (19Raveh T. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. DePinho R.A. Kimchi A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This study describes the cloning and characterization of two alternatively spliced mouse DAPKs. Mouse DAPK-α and DAPK-β are highly related to the previously described proapoptotic human DAPK. However, ectopic overexpression of the murine DAPK-α or DAPK-β does not promote apoptosis as previously shown for the human DAPK (9Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, in TNF-treated cells, overexpression of DAPK-β is cytoprotective and suppresses caspase-3 and -9 activity and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Together these studies show that DAPK can protect cells from apoptosis. A cDNA probe encoding the kinase domain of the mouse 130-kDa MLCK (20Herring B.P. Dixon S. Gallagher P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1656-C1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in a low stringency screen of a mouse AT2 cardiac myocyte gt11 cDNA library, generously provided by the Indiana University School of Medicine. Positive isolates were subcloned and sequenced. One cDNA identified from this library screen had significant homology to the kinase domain of MLCK and was extended by subsequent screens to yield a 4.9-kb cDNA encoding the full-length DAPK-α. Sequencing of several other positive cDNAs obtained from subsequent library screens identified a cDNA encoding a DAPK-β that was distinguished at the 3′ end by a putative alternative splice that would result in extending the carboxyl-terminal coding region of DAPK by 12 residues. Two monoclonal anti-human DAPK (BD/Transduction Laboratories, clone 17, and Sigma, clone 55) were used at dilutions of 1:250 and 1:10,000, respectively, and gave similar results. Omniprobe polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Xpress tag antibody (Invitrogen), all of which recognize the Xpress epitope tag (Invitrogen), were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 and 1:2,500, respectively. A polyclonal antibody to purified myosin II regulatory light chains was generated and characterized in this laboratory. The cytochrome c antibody is from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and the poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognizes both full-length and caspase-cleaved PARP. MDCK or HeLa cell lines expressing either DAPK-α or DAPK-β under the control of a tetracycline-inducible transactivator were constructed by the transfection of a pCDNA4/TO plasmid containing DAPKs into MDCK or HeLa cells already expressing tetracycline-VP16 transactivator (21Barth A.I. Pollack A.L. Altschuler Y. Mostov K.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Gaush C.R. Hard W.L. Smith T.F. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1966; 122: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Stable zeocin resistant cell lines were selected and characterized for tetracycline-regulated expression of DAPKs. A similar strategy was used to generate MDCK cell lines expressing mutant DAPK-α (K42A) and DAPK-β (K42A). The exogenously expressed mouse wild-type and mutant DAPKs have an amino-terminal Xpress epitope tag that is recognized by both the Omniprobe and Xpress tag antibodies. Parental cells and cell lines expressing DAPKs were maintained routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. To regulate expression of DAPK in the MDCK and HeLa cell lines, Doxycycline (Dox) is increased from 0 (repression) to 2 (maximal induction) µg/ml. Under maximal induction conditions, stable and approximately equal expression levels of the DAPKs were achieved in each of the cell lines. For each experiment, controls included MDCK and HeLa parental cells expressing only the tetracycline transactivator and cells under maximal repression (0 µg/ml Dox for MDCK and HeLa cells). In all cases the repressed cells gave similar results as the parental cell line. Overexpression of DAPKs did not have a deleterious effect on growth, doubling time, or morphology. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used routinely to monitor the expression of the exogenous DAPKs to ensure that the cell lines were expressing each DAPK at equal levels. Cells were maintained at subconfluent levels (∼30–50% density) during analysis. MDCK cells are sensitive to TNF and do not require inhibition of protein synthesis with cyclohexamide (8Jin Y. Atkinson S.J. Marrs J.A. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30342-30349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A biochemical apoptotic response is apparent in MDCK cells within 8 h of exposure to TNF; however, morphological changes including apoptotic blebbing are not readily apparent until between 24 and 48 h of treatment. HeLa cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF in the presence of 10 µg/ml cyclohexamide to induce apoptosis, which becomes morphologically apparent within 2–3 h. Western blotting was performed as described previously (23Gallagher P.J. Jin Y. Killough G. Blue E.K. Lindner V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1078-C1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein or immunoprecipitates were fractionated by electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoreactive proteins on Western blots were visualized using the Supersignal West Dura or West Pico detection systems (Pierce) according to manufacturer directions. Cell extracts were prepared from cells or tissues by homogenization in a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 40 µg/ml aprotinin, 60 µg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 60 µg/mlNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, and 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, Western blotting was performed using the appropriate anti-DAPK or Xpress antibodies. RNA was prepared from mouse tissues and cell lines using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion). For Northern blotting, 20 µg of total RNA/lane was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel. The RNA was transferred to Brightstar Plus positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion) using a vacuum blotter (Bio-Rad), UV cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene), and prehybridized for 60 min at 65 °C. A 550-bp 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe (cRNA) corresponding to bp 3370–3920 was transcribed from DAPK cDNA using the Maxiscript kit (Ambion). The probe was added to the blot in prehybridization buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml buffer and hybridized overnight at 65 °C. Final wash conditions were 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl (0.1× SSC), and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. The blot was rinsed in 2× SSC and exposed to X-OMAT AR film with an intensifying screen for 1 week. RNase protection was performed using the reagents and protocols from the RPA III kit (Ambion). A 507-bp 32P-labeled probe was prepared using the Maxiscript kit (Ambion) from aStuI-linearized template from DAPK-β. The probe generated contains an additional 43 nucleotides from the pGEM polylinker. A β-actin probe was used as a positive control. The hybridization of the cRNA probe and total RNA was performed at 42 °C overnight followed by a 30-min RNase digestion (2.5 units/ml RNase A and 100 units/ml RNase T1) and ethanol precipitation. Protected fragments were separated on a 6% acrylamide/7 m urea gel and exposed to film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 3 days. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing Xpress-tagged DAPK were washed with PBS, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m NaCl, 6 µg/mlNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 µg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 40 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Pefabloc SC). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was precleared using protein A-Sepharose. DAPK was immunoprecipitated by the addition of protein A beads precomplexed with rabbit anti-mouse IgG and monoclonal omniprobe antibody. Immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose 4B were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Protein A-Sepharose beads containing the immunopurified DAPK were resuspended in kinase assay buffer, and equivalent volumes were used for in vitro RLC phosphorylation reactions. Assays to determine the specific activity of the recombinant murine 160-kDa DAPKs were performed as described previously (24Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Trafny A. Sowadski J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26578-26582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of DAPK immunoprecipitated per assay was estimated by ligand blotting with biotin-conjugated calmodulin using purified 150-kDa bovine tracheal MLCK as a standard. RLCs were phosphorylated in 50-µl kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10 mm MgAc, 0.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2 µm CaM, and 22.5 µm chicken gizzard RLC) containing [γ-32P]ATP (200 cpm/pmol) diluted in 1 mm ATP for 15 min. To determine whether both forms of DAPK undergo autophosphorylation, the immunoprecipitated DAPK was analyzed following SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiography after completion of the kinase assay. To determine whether DAPK phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chains at the activating sites (Ser-19 and Thr-18) and RLC associated with myosin II, kinase assays were performed using either 1 µg of purified mutant recombinant regulatory light chain or 10 µg of myosin II, and the results were analyzed following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The myosin II was purified from partially fractionated human platelets, and Western blotting using isoform-specific myosin antibodies confirmed that both nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB were present. The phosphorylation of RLCs was determined as described (25Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cellular proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid; the pellets were washed with acetone and dissolved in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 23 mm glycine, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Western blotting with an anti-myosin II RLC antibody was used to identify unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated forms of RLC after fractionation through a 10% glycerol-polyacrylamide gel and transfer to nitrocellulose. The relative abundance of each RLC band was determined by scanning densitometry. The scan data were used to calculate the myosin II RLC phosphorylation index as described previously (8Jin Y. Atkinson S.J. Marrs J.A. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30342-30349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For transient expression analysis, Cos or HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/30-mm dish, transfected with vectors as indicated for expression of DAPKs, and an empty vector (pCDNA4TO, mock) together with a vector encoding β-galactosidase. Transfections were carried out using Fugene 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to manufacturer protocol. At 24 h after transfection, HeLa cells were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) and cyclohexamide (10 µg/ml) for 3 h and then fixed and stained for β-galactosidase expression. Control transfections (−TNF), were incubated for 48 h before analysis. The percentage of apoptotic cells were determined by scoring the number of transfected (LacZ+) cells having apoptotic morphology with condensed cytoplasm and several apparent plasma membrane blebs. At least 100 LacZ-positive blue cells were counted in each well, and each experiment was independently repeated eight times. To examine the expression levels of DAPK and LacZ proteins, cells treated in parallel were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and examined by Western blotting to detect DAPK or β-galactosidase expression. Quantification of apoptotic cell death in conditionally regulatable HeLa or MDCK cell lines expressing DAPKs was performed by seeding the cells at 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes and culturing the cells in the presence (+) or absence (−) of Dox for 24 h to induce stable levels of the exogenous DAPKs. At 24 h post-seeding, TNF (10 ng/ml) or vehicle (Me2SO, final concentration <0.01%) was added (t = 0). At the indicated times, viable attached cells were identified using trypan blue exclusion and counted. Cell viability is expressed as the percentage of the surviving TNF-treated cells compared with the surviving control cells not treated with TNF. Caspase-8, caspase-3, and caspase-9 activity were determined after extraction of the cells with CHAPS lysis buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 µm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After centrifugation, equal amounts of total cellular proteins were incubated at 37 °C in assay buffer (CHAPS lysis buffer plus 10% glycerol), and the assay was initiated by the addition of either 200 µm Ac-IETD-pNA (caspase-8), 200 µmAc-DEVD-pNA (caspase-3), or 200 µm Ac-LEHD-pNA (caspase-9) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The change in absorbance at 405 nm with time was monitored by spectrophotometry and converted to caspase activity (pmol/min/mg of total protein). Purep-nitroaniline (pNA, Calbiochem) was used for calibration of the standard A405 curve. For every cell sample, the background was determined by adding the caspase-specific inhibitors, Ac-IETD-CHO (caspase-8), Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase-3), or Ac-LEHD-CHO (caspase-9) (Calbiochem) as negative control. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by enzymatic detachment of the adherent cells, which were pooled with floating cells and then fixed in 5% acetic acid/95% ethanol at −20 °C and stained with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Cells were analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson (Mountain View, CA) FACStar plus, and the data were computed with CellQuest. At least 10,000 cells were counted for each condition. Hela or MDCK cells were scraped into PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (20 µg/ml leupeptin, 40 µg/ml aprotinin, 60 µg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 60 µg/mlNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 µg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by passage through a 23-gauge needle 10 times. Cytosol (devoid of mitochondria) and pellet (including mitochondria and nuclei) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Western blotting of both fractions was used to determine the relative amounts of cytochrome c and NF-κB. Each analysis was repeated at least three times, and the relative levels of expression were quantified by densitometry. A low stringency screen of a mouse AT2 cardiomyocyte cDNA library using the kinase domain of the mouse 130-kDa MLCK identified two cDNA clones that represent the murine homologs of human DAPK. The two mouse DAPK clones represent alternative splice forms, differing only at their carboxyl termini. A sequence alignment of the mouse and human DAPKs (Fig. 1A) shows that the murine DAPKs are ∼95% identical to the previously described human DAPK (9Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The murine DAPK-β appears to be an alternatively spliced DAPK that has a unique carboxyl terminus that extends DAPK-α by 12 residues. All the structural features between the mouse and human DAPKs are highly conserved including the kinase, calmodulin binding, ankyrin repeats, P-loops, and death domain (Fig. 1 B). Within the kinase domain (residues 13–263) there are two nonconserved residues, and throughout the remainder of the molecule there are ∼25 nonconserved changes in the sequence (Fig. 1 A). The significance of these findings, if any, is not known. The kinase domain of DAPK is ∼40–50% identical to the 130–150-kDa conventional MLCK, and importantly, residues involved in binding and phosphorylation of myosin II RLC and activation by Ca2+/CaM are highly conserved (24Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Trafny A. Sowadski J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26578-26582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs of DAPK-α and DAPK-β or two mutants with an alanine substitution at the ATP-reactive lysine within the kinase domain, K42A (αK42A, βK42A), which is predicted to inactivate kinase activity, were cloned into pcDNA3His such that the predicted translation start site at the amino terminus was fused in frame to the Xpress/hexahistidine tag, and the plasmids were transfected into Cos cells for expression. Fig.2A shows the results of a Western blot to detect the wild-type recombinant DAPKs using either a DAPK-specific antibody or the Omniprobe monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect the Xpress-tagged DAPK. Blots reacted with the anti-DAPK antibody revealed that the molecular mass of the mouse DAPKs is indistinguishable from the 160-kDa endogenous DAPK present in Cos cells. A smaller, proteolytic breakdown product of ∼100 kDa is also detected with this antibody. There is also no apparent size difference between DAPK-α and DAPK-β isoforms (∼160 and 161 kDa, respectively) when they are separated on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel. Identical results were obtained for the mutant cDNAs (data not shown). Ribonuclease protection assays were used to confirm the presence of mRNAs for both isoforms of DAPK. DAPK-β has a deletion of 485 bp that occurs immediately prior to the UGA stop codon. The splicing results in a deletion of 485 nucleotides of mRNA present in the 3′-untranslated region of DAPK-α and the extension of the open reading frame for an additional 12 residues to generate DAPK-β. The DAPK-β cDNA was linearized at a StuI site located at bp 4506; the resulting template allowed us to generate a cRNA probe that distinguishes the DAPK-α and DAPK-β isoforms. The results of the ribonuclease protection analysis are shown in Fig. 2 B. Two protected fragments of 507 and 445 bp were detected, corresponding to the predicted sizes of the32P-labeled cRNA probe protected by the mRNAs encoding DAPK-β and DAPK-α, respectively. Both of these protected fragments appear in adult liver, whole embryos at days 10, 15, and 19, and embryonic heart (at days 12 and 15), showing that DAPK-β is expressed during early development as well as in adult liver tissue. Northern blotting with a probe corresponding to bp 3370–3920 (residues 1033–1215) of the DAPK cDNA identified a predominant mRNA of ∼6.0 kb in mouse embryos obtained at days 10, 15, and 19 and many adult tissues tested as well as one cell line (Fig.3A). The relative levels of the 6.0-kb mRNA were highest in the embryo tissues and in adult bladder, uterus, vas deferens, liver, kidney, and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-DAPK antibody (Transduction Laboratories) revealed the presence of a 160-kDa band that is detectable in several adult tissues including bladder, uterus, vas deferens, lung, liver, and kidney (Fig. 3 B). The 100-kDa protein is a proteolytic breakdown product of DAPK. Comparison of the Northern and Western blotting revealed that for several tissues a 6.0-kb mRNA is present, but no DAPK protein is detectable. These tissues generally had lower relative levels of the 6.0-kb mRNA, suggesting that either DAPK is expressed in skeletal muscle, testes, stomach, colon, and ileum but at levels below the detectable limit of the antibody or expression is post-transcriptionally regulated. The kinase activity of the human DAPK has been determined in vitro using commercially available myosin II RLC purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as a substrate (10Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A.

In the present study, we have analyzed the formation and structure of the cleavage complex catalyzed by Sufolobus shibatae DNA topoisomerase VI (topoVI), a member of the recently described type IIB DNA topoisomerase family. A purification procedure of a fully soluble recombinant topoVI was developed by expressing both subunits simultaneously in Escherichia coli. Using this recombinant enzyme, we observed that the formation of the double-strand breaks on supercoiled or linear DNA is strictly dependent on the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP. This result suggests that ATP binding is required to stabilize an enzyme conformation able to cleave the DNA backbone. The structure of cleavage complexes on a linear DNA fragment have been analyzed at the nucleotide level. Similarly to other type II DNA topoisomerases, topoVI is covalently attached to the 5′-ends of the broken DNA. However, sequence analysis of the double-strand breaks revealed that they are all characterized by staggered two-nucleotide long 5′ overhangs, contrasting with the four-base staggered double-strand breaks catalyzed by type IIA DNA topoisomerases. While no clear consensus sequences surrounding the cleavage sites could be described, interestingly A and T nucleotides are highly represented on the 5′ extensions, giving a first insight on the preferred sequences recognized by this type II DNA topoisomerase.

DNA topoisomerase VI DNA topoisomerase II DNA topoisomerase IV dithiothreitol adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate base pair(s) Type II DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA duplex through a second DNA segment via a transient double-strand break (1Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This ability to modulate the topological state of DNA is essential in major biological processes such as replication, recombination, and transcription (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Until recently, these enzymes were thought to form a single family of homologous proteins. The discovery of DNA topoisomerase VI (topoVI)1 in hyperthermophilic archaea has modified this classification. Type II DNA topoisomerases are now subdivided into two subfamilies, type IIA and IIB DNA topoisomerases (Fig. 1) (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar).The type IIA subfamily contains three cellular representatives: eucaryotic DNA topoisomerase II (topoII), bacterial DNA gyrase, and DNA topoisomerase IV (topoIV). DNA gyrase and topoIV are heterotetramers composed of two subunits GyrA and GyrB, and ParC and ParE, respectively, while the eucaryotic enzyme is a homodimer. Despite this difference in quaternary structure, protein sequences comparison revealed that GyrB and ParE subunits are homologous to the N-terminal part of the eucaryotic enzyme while GyrA and ParC are homologous to the C-terminal half. These similarities were further confirmed by structural analysis of several fragments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA topoII and Escherichia coli DNA gyrase (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 5Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).Archaeal topoVI is the prototype of the recently described type IIB DNA topoisomerase subfamily (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). This enzyme was first characterized from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae (8Bergerat A. Gadelle D. Forterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27663-27669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further identified in other archaeal species (see below). Like bacterial type II DNA topoisomerases, topoVI is a heterotetramer composed of two subunits, A and B, with molecular masses of 45 and 60 kDa, respectively. This enzyme is able to decatenate intertwined DNA and to relax both positively or negatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of ATP and divalent cations. These reactions, shared with the type II DNA topoisomerases implicated in chromosome segregation (i.e. eucaryotic topoII and bacterial topoIV), suggest that topoVI is the enzyme responsible for chromosome decatenation at the end of the replication in archaeal cells.Surprisingly, initial sequence analysis of the genes encoding the two subunits of the S. shibatae enzyme revealed no evident similarities with classical type II DNA topoisomerases (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), apart from a few amino acids of the ATP binding/hydrolysis domain of type IIA DNA topoisomerases located near the N terminus of the topoVI B subunit. These conserved residues, which are distributed into three small motifs, are key elements of an ATP binding fold (referred to as the Bergerat fold) present in three other protein families: the heat-shock proteins of the Hsp90 family, the mismatch repair proteins of the MutL family, and a histidine kinase family (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the topoVI B subunit sequences by protein secondary structure prediction suggests that the first 215 residues adopt a similar fold. 2C. Buhler, unpublished observation.2C. Buhler, unpublished observation.Whereas topoVI A subunits are not homologous to the cleavage domains of type IIA DNA topoisomerases (referred to as the A′ domain in Fig. 1), significant similarities with the eucaryotic proteins, Spo11 fromS. cerevisiae, Rec12 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and a putative Spo11 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans have been described (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). SPO11 is one of the essential genes involved in the initiation of meiotic recombination (10Smith K.N. Nicolas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two different studies have clearly identified Spo11 as the protein responsible for the double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae. Site-directed mutagenesis on Spo11, of the only conserved tyrosine (Tyr135) between archaeal topoVI and eucaryotic Spo11 proteins, abolishes double-strand breaks formation (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In parallel, a covalent attachment of S. cerevisiae Spo11 to the 5′-ends of these double-strand breaks via a phosphotyrosine linkage has been described (12Keeney S. Giroux C.N. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 88: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these results suggest strongly that the conserved tyrosine is also directly implicated in the transient DNA cleavage catalyzed by archaeal topoVI (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar).The growing number of fully archaeal sequenced genomes revealed that topoVI is not restricted to hyperthermophilic archaea but is widely represented in the archaeal domain. Noteworthy, top6a andtop6b genes have been identified in the complete genome sequence of the mesophilic strain Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (13Ng W.V. Kennedy S.P. Mahairas G.G. Berquist B. Pan M. Shukla H.D. Lasky S.R. Baliga N.S. Thorsson V. Sbrogna J. Swartzell S. Weir D. Hall J. Dahl T.A. Welti R. Goo Y.A. Leithauser B. Keller K. Cruz R. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Maddocks D.G. Jablonski P.E.

Hood L. DasSarma S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12176-12181Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The topoVI A subunit homolog, Spo11, is also widespread in eucaryotes and has been identified in mouse, human, and plants (14Hartung F. Puchta H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1548-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,15Shannon M. Richardson L. Christian A. Handel M.A. Thelen M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The situation in plants is particularly striking since three Spo11 homologs are present in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (16Grelon M. Vezon D. Gendrot G. Pelletier G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recent identification of a topoVI B subunit homolog in this organism raises the possibility of a bona fide topoVI in plants (GenBankTM accession numbersAB025629 and BAB02486). However, no coding sequence similar to the archaeal top6b gene has been identified in other completely sequenced eucaryotic genomes.While the DNA cleavage by type IIA topoisomerases is also ultimately performed by the active tyrosine in the breakage-reunion domain (markedA′ in Fig. 1), several studies have highlighted the requirement of the B′ domain in the DNA cleavage reaction (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 17Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The central portion of the B′ domain is an α-β structure that resembles the “Rossman fold,” present in a variety of metal-binding phosphotransfer proteins, including nucleases, topoisomerases, and response regulators (19Berger J.M. Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions suggested that topoVI also contains a Rossman fold located, however, on the A subunit, instead of the B subunit, as in the case of Type IIA enzymes. (Fig. 1) (20Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This prediction has been confirmed with the resolution of the cristal structure of the archaeal Methanoccocus jannashii topoVI A subunit (spanning residues 69–369 and referred to as TopoVI-A′ fragment) (21Nichols M.D. DeAngelis K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6177-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This structural analysis has shown that the Rossman-fold like domain of topoVI lies next to a CAP-like domain, 3CAP designates the DNA-binding domain of theE. coli catabolite activator protein.3CAP designates the DNA-binding domain of theE. coli catabolite activator protein. giving an overall structure unique among type II DNA topoisomerases, and confirming that topoVI belongs to a new family of type II DNA topoisomerases. This study has also revealed the presence of a Mg2+ ion within the Rossman-fold domain, supporting the idea of a metal-assisted cleavage reaction by type II DNA topoisomerases (21Nichols M.D. DeAngelis K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6177-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Therefore, all the catalytic domains (Rossman-fold and CAP) known to be involved in the DNA cleavage reaction by type IIA DNA topoisomerases are located whithin the same subunit for both topoVI A subunit and Spo11 protein. This particular organization could suggest that DNA cleavage is performed without the help of an additional protein. Hence this would explain the absence of a topoVI B subunit homolog in most eucaryotes, suggesting that Spo11 can cleave DNA by itself at the onset of the meiotic recombination. However, we failed to detect DNA cleavage using S. shibatae topoVI A subunit alone, while recombinantS. shibatae topoVI reconstituted from both subunits separately overexpressed in E. coli generates double-strand breaks (23Buhler C. Gadelle D. Forterre P. Wang J.C. Bergerat A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, eucaryotic Spo11 proteins have not yet been purified, precluding the possibility to test their ability to perform DNA cleavage in the absence of a companion protein.To further analyze the formation of the double-strand breaks catalyzed by type IIB DNA topoisomerase, we have overproduced and purified a new recombinant topoVI in E. coli. Cloning both S. shibatae topoVI subunits in the same expression vector results in the overproduction of a soluble and active heterotetrameric enzyme. Analysis of the DNA cleavage reaction on supercoiled or linear DNA reveals a strict dependence on ATP binding, contrasting with DNA cleavages catalyzed by type IIA DNA topoisomerases (24Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1979; 17: 175-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have also analyzed the structure of topoVI double-strand breaks on a 529-bp linear fragment. We observed that, similarly to type IIA DNA topoisomerases and S. cerevisiae Spo11 protein (12Keeney S. Giroux C.N. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 88: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 27Keeney S. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), topoVI is covalently attached to the 5′-ends of the cleaved DNA. Characterization of several double-strand breaks at the nucleotide level reveals unusual features. All breaks generated have staggered two-nucleotide overhangs, contrasting with the four-base overhangs known for type IIA DNA topoisomerase (25Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1979; 17: 175-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the 5′ overhangs are mainly composed of the nucleotides A and T, giving the first insight of a consensus sequence recognition for this particular type II DNA topoisomerase.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we used a fully soluble form of recombinant S. shibatae topoVI to analyze the double-strand DNA cleavage mechanism, on both linear and negatively supercoiled DNA. This new recombinant enzyme was obtained by expressing the two topoVI subunits simultaneously in E. coli from a single vector. We had previously reported the reconstitution of S. shibatae topoVI from its separately purified subunits (Fig. 2) (23Buhler C. Gadelle D. Forterre P. Wang J.C. Bergerat A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in that case, the A subunit was recovered in inclusion bodies, and could only be solubilized after denaturation and renaturation, raising the possibility that some data obtained with the renatured enzyme could have been misleading. The coexpression of the two subunit genes in tandem might be important for the in vivo reconstitution of the heterotetramer in a soluble form. It should be noticed that the two genes encoding topoVI subunits are indeed organized in tandem in several archaeal genomes, including S. shibatae.DNA double-strand cleavage is a key step in the catalytic mechanism of type II DNA topoisomerase. We report here two major differences of the DNA cleavage reaction between both families of type II DNA topoisomerases. 1) ATP is absolutely required for the DNA cleavage reaction by topoVI (Figs. 3 and 4). 2) TopoVI cleavage sites are all characterized by staggered two-nucleotide long 5′ protruding ends, instead of four-nucleotide overhangs previously observed for type IIA DNA topoisomerase cleavage sites (Fig. 6).The strict requirement of either ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP for trapping topoVI cleavable complexes is unique among type II DNA topoisomerases since several reports indicate that ATP is not required in the DNA cleavage reactions catalyzed by type IIA enzymes. (i) DNA gyrase is able to relax a negatively supercoiled DNA in the absence of ATP (31Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). (ii) Eucaryotic topoII, or truncated enzymes lacking the ATPase binding/hydrolyzing domain, are still able to cleave DNA in the absence of ATP (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 18Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (iii) Finally, analysis of E. coli DNA topoIV activities indicates also an ATP independent DNA cleavage reaction (24Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The recent crystallographic structure of the DNA-binding core of theM. jannashii topoVI A subunit has revealed that a Rossman-fold like domain, which coordinates a magnesium ion through conserved acidic residues, lies next to the active site tyrosine, itself located whithin a CAP-like DNA-binding domain (21Nichols M.D. DeAngelis K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6177-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore the topoVI A subunit possesses, by itself, all the functional domains required for DNA cleavage by type IIA DNA topoisomerases (B′ plus A′ domain, see Fig. 1). However, since no cleavage activity using theS. shibatae topoVI A subunit alone has been detected (23Buhler C. Gadelle D. Forterre P. Wang J.C. Bergerat A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), these functionnal domains do not seem to be sufficient to generate DNA cleavage, at least not in the case of this enzyme. The data presented here indeed support the idea that topoVI-induced DNA cleavage requires the cooperation of both A and B subunits, since this cleavage is strictly ATP dependent and the ATP-binding site of topoVI is located on the B subunit.The modeling of a DNA duplex into the TopoVIA′ dimer DNA binding groove, showed that the CAP-like domains lie too far from the DNA backbone to cleave and generate a phosphotyrosine linkage (21Nichols M.D. DeAngelis K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6177-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, a conformational change of the topoVI A subunits seems to be required to cleave the DNA backbone. Our results thus strongly suggest that the B subunit could induce this change (through ATP binding), shifting the catalytic domains into proper orientation to cut DNA. In the absence of ATP, the A subunit dimer conformation in the whole enzyme could be similar to the structure obtained for the M. jannashii topoVI-A′ dimer.A “two-gate model,” in which a transported DNA segment enters and exits from two opposite sides of the enzyme, has been proposed for both subfamilies of type II DNA topoisomerases (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 21Nichols M.D. DeAngelis K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6177-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). While the transported duplex can be stored within the A′ domain of type IIA DNA topoisomerases, the topoVI-A′ dimer lacks such a storage area. As a consequence, to allow the crossing of the two DNA segments, a DNA gate should be created by dissociation of the topoVI-A dimer, after covalent fixation to the 5′-ends of the broken DNA segment. In this model, as well as capturing the DNA segment to be transported, the assigned function of B subunits should be to hold the separated A subunits in order to avoid enzyme dissociation and subsequent generation of free double-strand breaks (enzyme-bridging mechanism) (21Nichols M.D. DeAngelis K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6177-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Buhler C. Gadelle D. Forterre P. Wang J.C. Bergerat A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Assuming that the B subunits dimerize after ATP binding, the strict ATP-dependent DNA cleavage presented in this study is in good agreement with this model.While our results on the DNA cleavage reaction catalyzed by S. shibatae topoVI highlight a direct implication of the B subunit in this reaction, it should be reminded that no partner of the meiotic double-strand break effector Spo11 has been yet identified in the complete sequenced genome of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Therefore, even though Spo11 carries all the catalytic domains directly involved in the formation of a double-strand break, our analysis suggests that a partner could be required to stabilize Spo11 in a conformation suitable for DNA cleavage.In the present study, the structure of the topoVI cleavage complex has been further characterized. We observed that topoVI is covalently attached to the 5′-ends of the cleaved strands (Fig. 5), consistent with the fixation of S. cerevisiae Spo11 to the 5′-ends of meiotic double-strand breaks (12Keeney S. Giroux C.N. Kleckner N. Cell. 1997; 88: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 27Keeney S. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Sequence determination of topoVI induced double-strand breaks reveals an unusual feature for a type II DNA topoisomerase. All breaks are characterized by staggered two-nucleotide long 5′ protruding ends (Fig. 6), while earlier studies of the double-strand breaks generated by type IIA DNA topoisomerases revealed four-nucleotide overhangs (25Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1979; 17: 175-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, contrasting results were obtained from in vivoanalysis of the double-strand breaks structure induced by Spo11 during meiosis. While these breaks are characterized by two-nucleotide 5′ overhangs in the ARG4 promoter region (33Liu J. Wu T.C. Lichten M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4599-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), blunt DNA ends were observed in the CYS3 promoter region or upstream of theHIS4 gene (34de Massy B. Rocco V. Nicolas A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4589-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Xu F. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since these analysis were performed in vivo, from a rad50S mutant in which meiotic double-strand breaks persist, these blunt structures could reflect filling in of the 3′ ends by the cellular repair machinery. 4B. de Massy, personal communication.The sequence determination and mapping of the topoVI-induced double-strand breaks revealed another feature unique among type II DNA topoisomerases. Whereas cleavage efficiency differs from site to site, their 5′ extensions are mainly composed of A and T nucleotides (Fig.7). Interestingly, A and T nucleotides have also been found in the 5′ overhangs of the most prominent double-strand break generated by Spo11 protein in the ARG4 promoter region (33Liu J. Wu T.C. Lichten M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4599-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). While no obvious consensus sequence have been described for type IIA enzymes (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), the high occurrence of these nucleotides in the 5′ extensions generated by topoVI could represent a first insight in a preferred sequence recognized by a type IIB DNA topoisomerases.While studies on the catalytic mechanism by type IIB DNA topoisomerases are still in their infancy, this study highlights unusual features for a type II DNA topoisomerase both on formation and structure of the cleavage complex. Moreover the strict requirement of both topoVI subunits in DNA cleavage catalysis would suggest that the eucaryotic Spo11 protein should be somehow assisted to generate the meiotic double-strand breaks Type II DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA duplex through a second DNA segment via a transient double-strand break (1Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This ability to modulate the topological state of DNA is essential in major biological processes such as replication, recombination, and transcription (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Until recently, these enzymes were thought to form a single family of homologous proteins. The discovery of DNA topoisomerase VI (topoVI)1 in hyperthermophilic archaea has modified this classification. Type II DNA topoisomerases are now subdivided into two subfamilies, type IIA and IIB DNA topoisomerases (Fig. 1) (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P.

The type IIA subfamily contains three cellular representatives: eucaryotic DNA topoisomerase II (topoII), bacterial DNA gyrase, and DNA topoisomerase IV (topoIV). DNA gyrase and topoIV are heterotetramers composed of two subunits GyrA and GyrB, and ParC and ParE, respectively, while the eucaryotic enzyme is a homodimer. Despite this difference in quaternary structure, protein sequences comparison revealed that GyrB and ParE subunits are homologous to the N-terminal part of the eucaryotic enzyme while GyrA and ParC are homologous to the C-terminal half. These similarities were further confirmed by structural analysis of several fragments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA topoII and Escherichia coli DNA gyrase (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2018126880,"Erythropoietin (Epo) stimulation of erythroid cells results in the activation of several kinases and a rapid induction of c-myc expression. Protein kinase C is necessary for Epo up-regulation of c-myc by promoting elongation at the 3′-end of exon 1. PKCε mediates this signal. We now show that Epo triggers two signaling pathways to c-myc. Epo rapidly up-regulated Myc protein in BaF3-EpoR cells. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 blocked Myc up-regulation in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on the Epo-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. LY294002 also had no effect on Epo up-regulation of c-fos. MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 blocked both the c-myc and the c-fos responses to Epo. PD98059 and the PKC inhibitor H7 also blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. PD98059 but not LY294002 inhibited Epo induction of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation in normal erythroid cells. LY294002 blocked transcription of c-myc at exon 1. PD98059 had no effect on transcription from exon 1 but, rather, blocked Epo-induced c-mycelongation at the 3′-end of exon 1. These results identify two Epo signaling pathways to c-myc, one of which is PI3K-dependent operating on transcriptional initiation, whereas the other is mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent operating on elongation.

Previously, we reported that Epo up-regulates c-myc as a primary (immediate/early) response gene via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway (1Spangler R. Bailey S.C. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 681-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Spangler R. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that this PKC-dependent signal increased c-myc expression by reducing transcriptional attenuation (arrest) at the 3′-end of exon 1, thereby inducing transcriptional elongation (3Patel H.R. Choi H.S. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21300-21302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, we showed that the PKCε isoform mediates this signal and that down-regulation of PKCε inhibits Epo's growth-promoting action but not its induction of β-globin expression (differentiation) (4Li Y. Davis K.L. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27025-27030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).We have now investigated Epo up-regulation of c-myc further. We report that Epo's PKC-dependent signal to the transcriptional attenuation site in exon 1 of c-myc utilizes the MEK/ERK pathway and, simultaneously, that this pathway leads to up-regulation of c-fos. In addition, we have discovered that Epo independently up-regulates c-myc expression by increasing transcriptional initiation through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway.RESULTSWestern blot analysis showed that Epo up-regulates c-myc expression at the protein level in BaF3-EpoR cells. Cells were exposed to 5 units of Epo/ml for specified times. Total cells lysates were prepared, and equal amounts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. In the absence of added Epo, the cells expressed low levels of Myc1 and Myc2 of ∼67 and 64 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, upper panel). Myc1 was not detected in all experiments. After 30 min of exposure to Epo, Myc2 levels increased to 4.2-fold the amount seen in the absence of Epo and continued to do so, reaching levels of 15- and 18-fold at 45 and 60 min of Epo treatment, respectively. Epo-induced increases in Myc protein were observed in several additional experiments. The magnitude of the increases varied somewhat from experiment to experiment. To demonstrate equal protein loading of the gel, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with antibody to the p44/42 MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 1, bottom panel). ERK1 and ERK2 levels were unchanged during the same Epo treatment period.We showed previously that Epo's signal to c-myc requires PKC (1Spangler R. Bailey S.C. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol.

BaF3-EpoR cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 5 units of Epo/ml for 40 min and in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10Vlahos C.J.

Cell lysates were prepared, and equal amounts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody or with anti-ERK antibody. LY294002 inhibited Epo up-regulation of Myc expression completely in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, top panel). As a control experiment (Fig. 2, bottom panel), probing with anti-ERK antibody revealed no change in ERK1/ERK2 levels. Similarly, incubation of Epo-treated cells in the absence or presence of MEK (MAPK kinase) inhibitor PD98059 (11Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Total cellular RNA from cells incubated in the absence or presence of 5 units of Epo/ml for 40 min or in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of LY294002 or PD98059 was reverse-transcribed. The cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers specific for c-myc as well as primers specific forGAPDH control transcript. The c-myc-specific primers amplified a 549-bp product, the exact size predicted from the primers selected. The amount of this product was reduced dramatically in a concentration-dependent manner both by LY294002 (Fig.4A) and by PD98059 (Fig. 4B).

BaF3-EpoR cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 5 units of Epo/ml for 40 min and in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of LY294002 or PD98059. Epo treatment of the cells resulted in the appearance of a 338-bp c-fos product. LY294002 did not inhibit Epo up-regulation of c-fos (Fig.5A), in contrast to its inhibition of Epo up-regulation of c-myc, indicating that Epo's signal to c-fosdoes not require PI3K. However, PD98059 did inhibit Epo up-regulation of c-fos in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). This result was expected, because c-fos has been described to be downstream of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway (see “Discussion”). Thus, in this BaF3-EpoR cell system, MEK/ERK are not downstream of PI3K (see “Discussion”). This result implies that the LY294002-inhibited PI3K pathway to c-myc and the PD98059-inhibited MEK/ERK pathway to c-myc are independent and that both are independently necessary for Epo up-regulation of c-myc.Figure 5Effect of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (A) or by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (B) on erythropoietin-induced c-fos mRNA in BaF3-EpoR cells.

Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 5 units of Epo/ml for 40 min and in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of LY294002 or of PD98059. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and equal amounts were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-ERK antibody or with anti-ERK antibody. In the absence of Epo, the cells contained trace amounts of phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 6, top leftand top center panels, first lanes,Epo−). Treatment of the cells with Epo resulted in a marked increase in phospho-ERK1 and a significant although somewhat lesser increase in phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 6, top leftand top center panels, second lanes,Epo+). This preferential increase in phospho-ERK1 occurred even though the abundance of ERK2 protein exceeded that of ERK1 (Fig. 6, bottom left and bottom center panels). Epo had no effect on the levels of ERK1 or ERK2 protein (Fig. 6, bottom left and bottom center panels). Epo-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was not inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 6, top left panel) but was almost completely inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by PD98059 (Fig. 6, top center panel). The levels of ERK1 and ERK2 protein were unchanged under all conditions (Fig. 6, bottom left and bottom center panels). Epo also induced phosphorylation of Elk-1, which is downstream of MEK/ERK. Epo-dependent Elk-1 phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059, whereas LY294002 had no significant effect (data not shown).Figure 6Effect of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (left panels) or MEK inhibitor PD98059 (center panels) on erythropoietin induction of ERK phosphorylation. Experiments were carried out on nuclear extracts (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Results”). Incubation of the cells in the presence of Epo resulted in a substantial increase in phospho-ERK1 and a somewhat lesser increase in phospho-ERK2 (P-ERK1/2,top left and top center panels). Addition of LY294002 did not appear to alter this (top left panel). However, addition of PD98059 inhibited this Epo-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation markedly (top center panel). ERK protein levels were unchanged under all conditions (bottom left andbottom center panels). Note the preferential phosphorylation of ERK1 despite greater abundance of ERK2 protein. Right panels, top and bottom, show essentially equal EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in HeLa cells, in contrast to the preferential phosphorylation of ERK1 in BaF3-EpoR cells (see “Results”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The unexpected preferential increase in phospho-ERK1 over phospho-ERK2 in Epo-induced BaF3-EpoR cells, despite the predominant abundance of ERK2 protein, was seen repeatedly in several experiments. To prove that this finding was not an artifact, we performed the following control experiment. We grew HeLa cells, which express the EGF receptor, the stimulation of which induces ERK phosphorylation (15Gomez-Cambronero J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Johannessen L.E. Ringerike T. Molnes J. Madshus I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and stimulated them with 100 ng EGF/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared and were analyzed on the same SDS-PAGE run as were the BaF3-EpoR cells extracts (Fig. 6, top right and bottom right panels). Nuclear extracts of HeLa cells incubated in the absence of added EGF contained modest amounts of phopho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2. Importantly, the phopho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2 were of equal abundance. Incubation of the cells in the presence of EGF induced an equal increase in the abundance of both phopho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2. Total ERK2 protein was slightly more abundant than ERK1 in the HeLa nuclear extracts. ERK1 and ERK2 from HeLa cells, which are human in origin, migrated consistently as a more closely spaced doublet than did ERK1 and ERK2 from BaF3-EpoR cells, which are murine in origin.As a control to demonstrate the ability of LY294002 to inhibit PI3K in the BaF3-EpoR cell experiments, we stripped the blot shown in Fig. 6and reprobed it with anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Fig.7). Akt (protein kinase B) is a downstream target of the PI3K-dependent signaling pathway, being phosphorylated by PDK1 (17Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of cells incubated in the absence of Epo contained a small amount of phospho-Akt (Fig. 7,top and center panels). Incubation in the presence of Epo for 40 min induced a 2.8- to 3.1-fold increase in phospho-Akt. LY294002 treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in phospho-Akt to baseline levels, confirming that LY294002 was active in blocking PI3K in these experiments (Fig. 7, top panel). PD98059 had no effect on Epo-induced Akt phosphorylation, as expected (Fig. 7, center panel).Figure 7Effect of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on erythropoietin-induced Akt phosphorylation in BaF3-EpoR cells. Epo induced a significant increase in phospho-Akt. LY294002 inhibited this increase (top panel), whereas MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect (center panel). An equivalent amount of ERK1/2 total protein in each lane confirms equal loading of the gel (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We had shown previously that PKC inhibitors block c-myctranscriptional elongation similar to that seen in the present study with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (3Patel H.R. Choi H.S. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21300-21302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that PKC might be upstream of MEK in the Epo signaling cascade in BaF3-EpoR cells. To test this possibility, we incubated cells in the absence or presence of 5 units of Epo/ml for 40 min and with specified concentrations of the PKC inhibitor H7. As seen in Fig. 8,top panel, Epo induced an increase in phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2. Addition of H7 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in Epo-induced phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2, supporting the hypothesis that PKC is upstream of MEK in this pathway.Figure 8Effect of PKC inhibitor H7 on erythropoietin-induced ERK phosphorylation in BaF3-EpoR cells.Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of specified concentrations of H7 for 30 min and then in the presence of 5 units of Epo/ml for an additional 40 min. Experiments were carried out on nuclear extracts (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Results”). H7 markedly inhibited Epo-induced phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2 (top panel). There was no change in total ERK protein (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results presented above indicate that PI3K is not upstream of the MEK/ERK pathway in the Epo signal cascade of BaF3-EpoR cells. This finding is in apparent contradiction to two other studies that employed different cells to investigate Epo signal transduction. In the first study, Klingmüller et al. (18Klingmüller U. Wu H. Hsiao J.G. Toker A. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3016-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) isolated fetal liver (erythroid) cells from EpoR−/− mice and introduced a mutant EpoR into the cells by retroviral gene transfer. The mutant EpoR contained only one tyrosine (Tyr-479) in its cytoplasmic domain, the other seven having been replace by phenylalanine. Exposure of the cells to Epo triggered association of PI3K with the mutant receptor and activation of MAPK, leading to proliferation and differentiation of the cells in vitro, thus placing MAPK downstream of PI3K in these cells. In the second study, Sui et al. (19Sui X. Krantz S.B. You M. Zhao Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studied purified human “erythroid colony-forming cells.” Treatment of these cells with Epo resulted in a very modest increase in phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2. The increase was apparently blocked by pretreatment either with 100 µm PD98059 or with 0.5 µmwortmannin. To determine if our results on ERK phosphorylation are unique to the BaF3-EpoR cell system, we carried out studies using normal erythroid cells isolated from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice (2Spangler R. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bacon E.R. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1987; 69: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.9, normal erythroid cells incubated in the absence of Epo contained a modest amount of phospho-ERK1 and a trace amount of phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 9, top). Incubation of the cells in the presence of Epo resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in total phospho-ERK1/2, with phospho-ERK1 in significantly greater abundance. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not inhibit this Epo-induced increase in phospho-ERK1/2. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited this increase in phospho-ERK1/2 almost completely. These results mirror those shown above that we obtained using BaF3-EpoR cells and indicate that PI3K is not upstream of the MEK/ERK pathway in the Epo signal cascade of these normal erythroid cells. We confirmed the action of LY294002 in these cells by stripping the membrane shown in Fig. 9 and reprobing it with anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Fig.10, top panel). Untreated normal erythroid cells contained a small amount of phospho-Akt. Epo induced a 2.7-fold increase. LY294002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation dramatically. In contrast PD98059 had only a minor effect on phospho-Akt at the highest concentration employed (50 µm).Figure 9Effect of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or MEK inhibitor PD98059 on erythropoietin-induced ERK phosphorylation in normal murine erythroid cells.

Epo induced a greater increase in phospho-ERK1 than in phospho-ERK2 (top panel) despite the greater abundance pf ERK2 protein (bottom panel). LY294002 had no effect on ERK phosphorylation.

We showed this by carrying out RT-PCR experiments that detected either c-myc exon 1 expression (by amplifying a product between nucleotides 54 and 508 of the gene), thereby providing a measurement of transcriptional initiation, or that detected expression of c-myc exons 1 and 2 (by amplifying a product between nucleotides 54 and 2141 of the gene), thereby measuring elongation. As seen in Figs. 11A and12A, treatment of cells with Epo resulted in the appearance of a 451-bp RT-PCR product, consistent with increased expression of exon 1 mediated by an increase in transcriptional initiation. LY294002 inhibited this increased expression of exon 1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 11A). This inhibition also resulted in decreased expression of exon 1/2 in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 11B). The controlGAPDH product was not affected by LY294002, confirming the specificity of the results seen in Fig. 11, A andB (see Fig. 11C). Whereas the LY294002-inhibited PI3K-dependent pathway up-regulates c-myc expression by an increase transcriptional initiation, the PD98059-inhibited MEK/ERK pathway operates on transcriptional elongation. Inhibition of MEK with PD98059 did not inhibit Epo up-regulation of exon 1 by increased transcriptional initiation (Fig.12A). However, PD98059 did inhibit the increased expression of exon 1/2 (Fig. 12B), consistent with reduced elongation due to increased transcriptional attenuation within exon 1. PD98059 had no significant effect on the control GAPDH product, confirming the specificity of the results seen in Fig. 12, A and B (see Fig.12C).DISCUSSIONThe c-myc gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein, Myc, which forms heterodimers with the transcription factor Max and also interacts with several other proteins (22Thompson E.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 23Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C.

These interactions are involved in the various biological activities of Myc, including cell cycle regulation, transformation, and anti-apoptosis. Normal expression of the c-myc gene is critical for regulated cell proliferation, whereas deregulated expression of c-myc is a frequent hallmark of neoplasia and is associated with cellular apoptosis. c-myc gene expression is controlled at multiple levels, including transcriptional initiation at several promoters, transcriptional elongation (transcriptional attenuation/arrest) at the 3′-end of exon 1 and post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA and protein stability (22Thompson E.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 23Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C.

Me2SO treatment resulted in the biphasic down-regulation of c-myc transcript levels. Interestingly, transfection of these cells with a constitutively expressed c-myc resulted in inhibition of Me2SO-induced differentiation. These results suggested that down-regulation of c-myc was essential for erythroid differentiation. However, other investigators used"

In mammals two different genes encode mitochondrial and cytoplasmic/peroxisomal located enzymes, whereas in Saccharomyces cerevisiae three separate genes specify compartment specific enzymes. We have identified a single gene, idpA, in the filamentous fungusAspergillus nidulans that specifies a protein with a high degree of identity to mammalian and S. cerevisiae enzymes. Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of two idpA transcripts and two transcription start points were identified by sequencing cDNA clones and by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The shorter transcript was found to be inducible by acetate and by fatty acids while the longer transcript was present in higher amounts during growth in glucose containing media. The longer transcript is predicted to encode a polypeptide containing an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence as well as a C-terminal tripeptide (ARL) as a potential peroxisomal targeting signal. The shorter transcript is predicted to encode a polypeptide lacking the mitochondrial targeting signal but retaining the C-terminal sequence. Immunoblotting using antibody raised against S. cerevisiae Idp1p detected two polypeptides consistent with these predictions. The functions of the predicted targeting sequences were confirmed by microscopic analysis of transformants containing fluorescent protein fusion constructs. Using anti-Idp1p antibodies, protein localization to mitochondria and peroxisomes was observed during growth on glucose whereas cytoplasmic and peroxisomal localization was found upon acetate or fatty acid induction. Therefore, we have established that by the use of two transcription start points a single gene is sufficient to specify localization of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase to three different cellular compartments in A. nidulans.

This reaction is an essential and rate-limiting step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and 2-oxoglutarate produced by this activity can contribute to the synthesis of glutamate, which serves as a precursor for amino acids. This reaction is therefore an important branchpoint between catabolic and anabolic processes in the cell. Although a single NADP-specific form of this enzyme is responsible for this reaction in Escherichia coli (1Plaut G.W.E. Boyer P.D. Lardy K. Myerback K. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1963: 105-126Google Scholar, 2Borthwick A.C. Holms W.H. Nimmo H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), multiple isozymes of isocitrate dehydrogenase that vary in subunit structure and cofactor specificity have been reported for both lower and higher eukaryotes. In plants two different isocitrate dehydrogenase activities co-exist in the cell. NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase appears to be heteromeric as three different subunits are present in tobacco (3Lancien M. Gadal P. Hodges M. Plant J. 1998; 16: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and expression is coordinated with other genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (4Chen R.-D. Gadal P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1990; 28: 141-145Google Scholar). Plant NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase isoenzymes are located within the cytosol (5Galvez S. Hodges M. Decottignies P. Bismuth E. Lancien M. Sangwan R.S. Dubois F. LeMarechal P. Cretin C. Gadal P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 307-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mitochondria (6Galvez S. Roche O. Bismuth E. Brown S. Gadal P. Hodges M.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells three highly similar isoforms of NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase are localized to the mitochondrial matrix (8Ramachandran N. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8859-8864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of at least two NADP-dependent enzymes in mammalian cells, encoded by two independent genes, has been reported. One isoenzyme is mitochondrial whereas the other is located in both the cytosol (9Jennings G.T. Sechi S. Stevenson P.M. Tuckey R.C. Parmelee D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in peroxisomes (10Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 1983; 760: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, located in mitochondria, is a heterooctamer composed of two similar but distinct subunits encoded byIDH1and IDH2, respectively (12Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Gene disruption studies show that both subunits are essential for catalytic activity (15Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae contains three NADP-dependent enzymes encoded by three separate genes. Idp1p is mitochondrial and contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (16Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Idp3p is peroxisomal, lacks the mitochondrial signal (MTS)1 but contains a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) (17Henke B. Girzalsky W. Berteaux-Lecellier V. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3702-3711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Idp2p is cytoplasmic and lacks targeting signals (19Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the NAD-dependent enzyme is similar to other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (20McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kim K. Rosenkrantz M.S. Guarente L. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 1936-1942Google Scholar). In contrast, mitochondrial Idp1p levels are relatively unchanged during growth on glucose or on nonfermentable carbon sources (22Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that the role of Idp1p in the tricarboxylic acid cycle may be minor in comparison to NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. IDP2 is highly regulated with mRNA and protein levels of cytosolic Idp2p elevated in cells grown on nonfermentable carbon sources and undetectable in cells grown on glucose or glutamate (19Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disruption ofIDP2 in an idh2 null background results in glutamate auxotrophy, indicating that cytosolic Idp2p plays a role in glutamate synthesis (23Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Idp3p is located in the peroxisomal lumen and shows carbon source-dependent expression (17Henke B. Girzalsky W. Berteaux-Lecellier V. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3702-3711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Glucose strongly represses transcription of IDP3, whereas nonfermentable carbon sources like glycerol and ethanol derepress transcription. In addition, fatty acids such as oleate strongly induce expression of IDP3 (18van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As the peroxisomal membrane has been shown to be impermeable to pyrimidine nucleotides and other small molecules (24van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Idp3p is an important NADPH-generating system for peroxisomes. Peroxisomal enzymes required for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids by S. cerevisiae have an NADPH cofactor requirement (25Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schultz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition NADPH is required for glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that constitute major defenses against oxidative damage (28Wells W.W. Yang Y. Deits T.L. Gan Z.-R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 149-201PubMed Google Scholar, 29Halliwell B. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). A major source of NADPH is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by theZWF1 gene, and Minard and McAlister-Henn (30Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of both ZWF1 and IDP2 results in loss of viability when transferred to medium with oleate as the carbon source. Therefore, a major function of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases may be to shuttle reducing equivalents between NADP in different cellular compartments (18van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, mitochondrially localized NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is found (31Osmani S.A. Scrutton M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As well, distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic NADP-dependent isozymes, observed as two activity bands separable by electrophoresis, are present. In mycelia grown on glucose, the mitochondrial isozyme activity dominates, while the soluble activity band is much more intense when acetate is the sole carbon source (31Osmani S.A. Scrutton M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A. nidulans NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity is inducible by acetate (32McCullough W. Payton M.A. Roberts C.F. Smith J.E. Pateman J.A. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus. Academic Press, London1977: 97-129Google Scholar), and the pattern of acetate regulation closely resembles that for acetamidase and enzymes involved in acetate utilization (33Kelly J.M. Hynes M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar). Using published sequences we have identified A. nidulansexpressed sequence tag (EST) sequences with high similarity to known NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases. This has enabled us to clone a unique idpA gene from A. nidulans.We show here that two forms of IdpA (one located in mitochondria and one in the cytosol and peroxisomes) result from the use of different transcription start points. This therefore differs significantly from the situation in S. cerevisiae and animals, where separate genes encode compartment-specific enzymes. TheA. nidulans strains used in this study are listed in TableI. Gene symbols have been described previously (34Clutterbuck J.A. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 1.

Nitrogen sources were used at a final concentration of 10 mm and carbon sources at 1% w/v unless stated otherwise for specified sole carbon sources: 0.1% w/v for Tween 80 and propionate, 10 mm for sodium butyrate, 50 mm for sodium acetate. Mycelia for RNA isolation and total protein extracts were grown at 37 °C for 16 h in 1% glucose-minimal medium containing 10 mm ammonium tartrate, washed with carbon-free media, and transferred to media with the appropriate carbon source and 10 mm ammonium chloride for 4 h.

Transformants from cotransformation experiments were selected using theriboB+-selectable marker plasmid pPL3 (37Oakley C.E. Weil C.F. Kretz P.L. Oakley B.R. Gene. 1987; 53: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) on media lacking riboflavin. Southern analysis was used to confirm that cotransformants contained the plasmids of interest. No effects of copy number on phenotypes were observed. Standard methods were as described by Sambrook et al. (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using the BresaClean DNA purification kit (GeneWorks) following the manufacturer's specifications. DNA dephosphorylation was performed by addition of 1 unit of arctic shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) to 50 ng of DNA in the recommended buffer and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Southern and Northern blotting were performed using Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Filters were hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled probes (random primer) and processed using standard procedures (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

For Western immunoblot analysis, total cellular extracts were prepared by grinding frozen mycelia with glass beads in extraction buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol) in the presence of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and repeated freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by centrifuging to remove cellular debris. 2A.

The cDNA inserts were subcloned into theEcoRI site of pBluescript SK+. Sequencing was performed by Australian Genome Research Facility (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) utilizing ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencers. Samples were sequenced and labeled using the BigDye Terminator (Applied Biosystems) Chemistry followed by a single-pass gel run. Thegpd(p)::gfp::idpA construct pES4962 encoding a GFP-IdpA/PTS1-(464–493) fusion protein, was generated by ligation of a 500-bp NotI-XbaI fragment containing the C-terminal IdpA fragment isolated from pES4758, into theHindIII-XbaI sites of pALX213. pALX213 contains the coding sequence for the enhanced variant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aqueora victoria(CLONTECH) expressed from the A. nidulans gpdA promoter (41Punt P.J.

Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos or Green FM (Molecular Probes) for 20 min. For each experiment, at least three cotransformants with different copy numbers were studied. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells grown on coverslips were fixed and prepared using the method described by Smallet al. (42Small A.J. Todd R.B. Zanker M.C. Delimitrou S. Hynes M.J.

Microscopy was performed using a Reichert-Jung microscope equipped with Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence optics. For GFP and MitoTracker Green FM fluorescence and FITC immunofluorescence, the filter set used was a standard FITC set, with an excitation wavelength range of 450–495 nm, dichroic mirror at 510 nm and long pass barrier filter at 520 nm.

For cells stained with DAPI to visualize nuclei, the filter set used had an excitation wavelength range of 330–380 nm, dichroic mirror at 420 nm, and long pass barrier filter at 418 nm. Photomicrographs were captured using a Diagnostic Instruments Spot Camera and then manipulated using Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems). The sequence for theidpA gene has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession no. AY040207. A BLAST search performed on the University of Oklahoma A. nidulans EST data base (www.genome.ou.edu/fungal.html) revealed sequences (EST x8f10a1.f1, k0c02a1.f1, and k0c02a1.r1) with a high level of similarity to the NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes of S. cerevisiae (16Haselbeck R.J.

The EST x8f10a1.f1 clone obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS) was used to probe an A. nidulans BAC library (see “Experimental Procedures”) and four hybridizing BAC clones were identified. Clones 8H5, 12K11, 28H17, and 28K20 all showed an identical restriction pattern in the hybridizing region in Southern blots. A 7.8-kb ApaI-PstI fragment was subcloned from BAC 28K20, creating pES5206. Sequencing 5.7 kb of the 5′ end of this clone revealed an open reading frame, interrupted by seven introns, with extensive similarity to Idp1p, Idp2p, and Idp3p of S. cerevisiae. The gene was designated idpA. GenBank data base searches (BLAST) of sequences upstream of the promoter region of the idpA gene also identified a portion of a second open reading frame in this clone with significant identity to the C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase from Yarrowia lipolytica(AF291429) (Fig. 1). The idpA coding region contained seven introns most of which ranged in size from 48 to 90 bp with an unusually long 299-bp first intron. SequencingidpA cDNA clones isolated from a λgt10 library confirmed the positions of the predicted introns and revealed the presence of an additional intron (61 bp) in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene (from position −149 to −89). The independent cDNA clones also allowed the localization of start points of transcription (at −319, −279, −276, −271, and −270 relative to the first predicted ATG) and polyadenylation sites (+2249, +2250, +2252, +2291, and +2292) (Fig. 1). The position of introns, as well as their relative length, are strictly conserved between A. nidulans andA. niger. The idpA gene is predicted to encode a 493-amino acid protein with significant similarity to all reported NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, with a highly conserved isocitrate dehydrogenase and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase signature sequence and putative sites involved in isocitrate binding (PROSITE data base; Ref. 44Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). IdpA shows the highest degree of similarity to the enzyme from A. niger (85% identity and 90% similarity, with conservation across the entire protein) and the enzymes from S. cerevisiae (Idp1p, 72% identity and 82% similarity; Idp2p, 69% identity and 82% similarity; Idp3p, 66% identity and 81% similarity) (Fig.2). A PSORTII (psort.nibb.ac.jp) search for subcellular targeting signals in IdpA identified both an N-terminal MTS with a presequence cleavage site after amino acid 33 -LRS↓FS (47Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), as well as a C-terminal PTS1 -ARL (48McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. Trends Biochem.

Southern blot analysis at low stringency revealed noidpA cross-hybridizing sequences in the genome of A. nidulans, indicating that idpA is unique (data not shown). Northern blot analysis ofidpA expression in mycelia grown on different carbon sources revealed the presence of two differently regulated transcripts (Fig.3). The longer (1.9 kb) transcript correlated with the size of the cDNA clones and was readily detected during growth in the presence of glucose with lower levels present in the absence of glucose (Fig. 3B). A shorter (1.5 kb) transcript (Fig. 3A) was detected that was highly regulated by the carbon source, with induction by acetate, propionate, butyrate, and Tween 8"
https://openalex.org/W2042867596,"Hypertensive rats from the Milan strain show a significant decrease in calpastatin activity as compared with normotensive control animals. Calpastatin deficiency is age-related and highly relevant in kidney, heart, and erythrocytes and of minor entity in brain tissue. In normotensives the changes during aging in the levels of calpastatin activity and mRNA are consistent with an increase of calpastatin protein. In hypertensive rats such a relationship during aging is not observed, because a progressive accumulation of mRNA is accompanied by a lower amount of calpastatin protein as compared with control rats. Together with the low level of calpastatin in kidney of hypertensive rats, a progressive accumulation of an active 15-kDa calpastatin fragment, previously shown to represent a typical product of calpain-mediated calpastatin degradation, is also observed. Evidence for such intracellular proteolysis by Ca2+-activated calpain is provided by the normalization of the calpastatin level, up to that of control animals, in hypertensive rats treated with drugs known to reduce both blood pressure and intracellular Ca2+ influx. Further evidence is provided by the disappearance, in these conditions, of the 15-kDa calpastatin fragment. These data allow the conclusion that calpastatin degradation is a relevant part of the overall mechanism for regulating calpain activity.

These data allow the conclusion that calpastatin degradation is a relevant part of the overall mechanism for regulating calpain activity. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase polymerase chain reaction Calpain activation is a multistep process involving transient conformational changes as well as irreversible limited autoproteolysis. The first event is ascribed to a calcium-induced molecular transition initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to the calmodulin-like domains of the catalytic and small calpain subunits and subsequently transferred to the thiol proteinase-like domain II, promoting a rearrangement of the active site (1Croall D.E.

The calpain active site becomes accessible, and the enzyme is ready for autoproteolysis and is probably active also on exogenous substrates. This reversible phase is thus followed by a rapid autoproteolysis affecting the N-terminal region of both calpain subunits. The resulting digested enzyme is considered to be the true active form of the cells on the basis that its calcium requirement was reduced to values close to the physiological range. However, some evidencee indicates that the autoproteolyzed calpain may also represent a transient product of an auto-inactivation process, typical of almost all proteinases (7Inomata M. Kasai Y. Nakamura M. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19783-19787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Hayashi M. Inomata M. Saito Y. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of calpain occurs at the inner face of the plasma membrane, but the digested proteinase form is released and recovered as soluble enzyme (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Tedesco I. Averna M. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This calpain form is potentially dangerous, having almost completely lost its dependence from a high concentration of Ca2+ and being freely active in the cytosol. Furthermore, it is preferentially recognized by calpastatin, the natural inhibitor of the proteinase (10Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the conclusion that within the cells autoproteolysis represents a rough regulation of calpain through two steps. The first stage promotes the removal of the enzyme from its preferential site of action, and the second one involves the inhibition in the cytosol by calpastatin. Further autoproteolysis can then produce inactive fragments of calpain. This is consistent with the assumption that calpastatin can play an essential role inhibiting activated calpain in the soluble fraction of the cells. The preferential interaction of calpastatin with the autoproteolyzed calpain form explains why intracellular calpain can become active even in the presence of an excess of calpastatin as we have observed in human erythrocytes enriched with calcium (11Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The inhibitor molecule cannot interact with native calpain at the basal cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ because the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex requires a conformationally modified calpain that is produced, in the absence of specific cofactors, only at a higher [Ca2+], reached probably only transiently or in pathological conditions. On the basis of these observations, it can be concluded that calpastatin binds only active calpain forms, regardless if they are autoproteolyzed or not. It has been reported that when calpastatin is associated to calpain, it is not fully resistant to the proteinase digestion but is slowly degraded (10Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Blomgren K. Hallin U. Andersson A.L. Puka-Sundvall M. Bahr B.A. McRae A. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Hagberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14046-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been also demonstrated previously that bothin vivo and in vitro µ-calpain seems to be involved in the inhibitor fragmentation, generating free active inhibitory domains, whereas m-calpain digests calpastatin producing inactive peptides (13Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Sorimachi Y. Harada K. Saido T.C. Ono T. Kawashima S. Yoshida K.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The different kinds of degradation accomplished by the two calpains is consistent with the hypothesis that fragmentation of calpastatin by µ-calpain, the first step of the inhibitor digestion process, corresponds to a local increase in active calpastatin species. The subsequent calpastatin inactivation could be the charge paid by cells to prevent further activation of calpain. Accumulation of intracellular active calpain species could be responsible for the rapid degradation of calpain targets such as cytoskeletal proteins, neurofilaments, and transmembrane carriers or ion transporters causing irreversible cell damage (16Siman R.

We have reported previously that erythrocytes from hypertensive patients and rats of Milan strain contain much less calpastatin activity as compared with cells from normotensives (23Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Duzzi L. Bianchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the case of hypertensive rats, inhibitor levels are reduced significantly also in kidney (24Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Duzzi L. Bianchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used the “calpastatin-deficient” tissues of these hypertensive animals to analyze the in vivo proteolysis of this inhibitor molecule. We have shown that calpastatin deficiency in kidney, heart, and erythrocytes of Milan hypertensive rats is a function of aging. Further evidence indicates that in adult animals the loss of calpastatin can be reversed almost completely by a 7-day treatment with an antihypertensive drug affecting those mechanisms that control intracellular calcium homeostasis (25Sandmann S., Yu, M. Unger T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 3: 767-777Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The normalization of inhibitor levels observed under these conditions suggests that calpastatin deficiency is caused by a direct degradation by calpain. Leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 were purchased from Sigma. Diethylaminoethyl cellulose resin (DE53) was obtained from Whatman. Human erythrocyte calpain was purified as reported previously (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Tedesco I. Averna M. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One unit of calpain activity is defined as the amount causing the production of 1 µmol of acid-soluble NH2 groups in the conditions reported previously (26Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The anti-calpastatin monoclonal antibody 35.23, which recognizes the N-terminal region of calpastatin, was produced as described in Ref. 27Melloni E. De Tullio R. Averna M. Tedesco I. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. Samples of kidney (2 g), heart (1 g), and brain (1.5 g) from both normotensive and hypertensive rats of Milan strain were minced, homogenized in a Potter Elvejem homogenizer, and lysed by sonication (four bursts of 10 s each at 0 °C) in 3 volumes of 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples of erythrocytes from both normotensive and hypertensive rats were lysed by sonication in the same conditions reported above. The disrupted cell suspensions from each sample were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the clear supernatant (crude extract) was heated at 100 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble material (heated extract) was collected and loaded onto a DE53 column (5 ml) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.35 m, and the amount of calpastatin activity was measured in the eluted fractions using human erythrocyte calpain and human acid denatured globin as substrate (28Melloni E. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Michetti M. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Int. 1984; 8: 477-489PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ as described previously (26Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been selected because it is equally sensitive to all calpastatin forms regardless of their sources. Because globin is present in the assay in a denatured form and in very large amounts (2 mg/ml) with respect to calpastatin, it is the preferential substrate for the free enzyme, and thus it is possible to quantitatively detect calpastatin in the sample measuring the residual enzyme activity. One unit of calpastatin activity is defined as the amount of inhibitor required to inhibit one unit of human erythrocyte calpain. Crude extract samples (400 µg of total protein) were heated and centrifuged, and the clear supernatants corresponding to one-tenth of the original samples were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). Proteins were then blotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using Tris/glycine containing 20% methanol as the transferring buffer. The membrane was blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween, probed with the specific anti-calpastatin monoclonal antibody 35.23 (27Melloni E. De Tullio R. Averna M. Tedesco I. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and then developed with the ECL detection system after incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (29Palejwala S. Goldsmith L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4202-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the quantification of the immunoreactive bands, the membrane was scanned in a Shimadzu CS-9000 densitometer. Total RNA was isolated from kidney of both normotensive and hypertensive rats of different ages by extraction with guanidium thiocyanate (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total RNA, quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, were reverse-transcribed (100 µl of incubation) by using oligo(dT) (20 pmol) as primer (31Sparatore B. Melloni E. Patrone M. Passalacqua M. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (30 µl) of each sample were coamplified in the presence of primers specific for GAPDH1 (sense primer 5′-ACGACCCCTTCATTGACC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′) and calpastatin (sense primer 5′-CTGGCATCTCCCAGAATGAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCAAAAGTCACCATCCACCAGC-3′) (32De Tullio R. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PCR was started by adding the sense primers 5′ 32P-labeled (40 pmol, 0.5 × 105 cpm/pmol) and 3 units of recombinant TaqDNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) (100-µl final volume). The PCR conditions were: denaturation (60 s, 94 °C), annealing (60 s, 60 °C), and extension (60 s, 72 °C) carried out on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler. Aliquots (10 µl) were collected at cycles 16, 18, 20, and 22 and submitted to electrophoresis on a 3.5% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel. The gel lanes were subsequently sliced, and the radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. To minimize tube-to-tube variation each experiment was carried out in triplicate. Equal amounts of kidney heated extract from normotensive and hypertensive rats, prepared as described above and corresponding to 600 µg of protein contained in crude extract, were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). At the end of the electrophoretic run, the gel was washed with buffer A containing 20% methanol to remove any remaining SDS. After 20 min, the gel was transferred to buffer A without methanol and stirred gently for additional 20 min; then the gel lanes containing calpastatin were cut in 0.3-cm slices (13Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from each slice by incubation in buffer A (0.3 ml) for 5 h. The treatment was repeated three times, and the solutions obtained from each sample (0.9 ml total) were pooled. This procedure almost completely recovers (∼95–96%) the protein loaded into the gel. Finally, calpastatin activity was assayed on 200 µl of the recovered solutions using human erythrocyte calpain as described above. Rat kidney calpastatin (10 units) was incubated in 0.1 ml of 50 mmsodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 100 µmCa2+ (33Salamino F. Sparatore B. De Tullio R. Pontremoli R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with 10 units of native (80 kDa + 30 kDa) or autoproteolyzed calpain (75 kDa + 18 kDa) (11Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this reconstructed system we used purified rat erythrocyte calpain that, although belonging to the µCL type/cls1 gene products (34Sorimachi H. Takaomi C. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), shows catalytic properties intermediate between classical µ and m isoforms (35Murachi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 36Mellgren R.L. FEBS Lett. 1980; 109: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 37Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Murachi T. Mellgren R. Erythrocyte Calpain in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 225-239Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation at 20 °C, the digestion was stopped by adding 1 mm EDTA. Active calpastatin species produced by calpain were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and identified through the assay of their inhibitory activity as described above. Lisinopril ((S)-1–[N-2-(1-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl)-l-lysyl]-l-proline), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Merck Sharp and Dohme), was dissolved in tap water at a concentration of 80 mg/liter and given to rats ad libitum. In 7 days, each normotensive rat drank ∼750–800 ml of solution, whereas each hypertensive rat drank ∼950–1000 ml. Systolic blood pressure was measured during treatment by the tail-cuff method using the plethysmographic system based on techniques originally described by Byrom and Wilson (38Byrom F.B. Wilson C.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1938; 93: 301-304Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In kidney of normotensive rats (Fig.1), calpastatin activity increases progressively with aging, reaching at 150 days values approximately three times higher than those of 30-day-old animals. On the contrary, in kidney of hypertensive rats, calpastatin activity remains almost unchanged at levels corresponding to those of 30-day-old normotensive animals; this results in 3–4 times lower levels in 150-day-old animals as compared with those of control rats. For comparison, we measured calpastatin levels also in other tissues (Fig. 1). Although in heart and erythrocytes the behavior of the inhibitor activity is similar to that observed in kidney, in brain, which contains the highest levels of calpastatin, we observed no significant differences between normotensive and hypertensive rats. The amount of native calpastatin protein in kidney extracts, measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig.2A) increases with age only in normotensive animals, whereas in hypertensive rats it remains at lower levels regardless of the age of the animal. The ratio between calpastatin activity, calculated from Fig. 1, and the corresponding amount of protein determined from Fig. 2A (see “Experimental Procedures”) is almost identical in all animals, indicating that in normal and hypertensive rats calpastatin has similar specific activity and inhibitory efficiency (Fig. 2B). We also analyzed the expression of calpastatin in kidney of normotensive and hypertensive rats at different ages. As shown in Fig. 3, after 30 amplification cycles by PCR, although the staining intensity of GAPDH transcripts is almost the same in all the samples considered, calpastatin mRNA increases progressively with aging in both normotensive and hypertensive animals. Furthermore, this increase is much more consistent in normotensive rats; in fact, comparing Fig. 3,A and B, although old rats of both strains display similar amounts of calpastatin transcript, in young normotensive rats, unlike hypertensive animals, this band is very faint. Because of the fact that the fluorescence analysis shown in Fig.3 is not really quantitative, we have chosen the method described by Chelly et al. (39Chelly J. Kaplan J.C. Maire S.G. Kahn A. Nature. 1988; 333: 858-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) to obtain more satisfactory results. This procedure utilizes the co-expression of an internal standard (GAPDH) and 5′ 32P-labeled primers to detect the amount of product present at various amplification cycles. As shown in Fig. 4, in kidney of normotensive and hypertensive 30-day-old rats, the amounts of the internal marker (GAPDH) and calpastatin, expressed at increasing amplification cycles, follow straight parallel lines, intercepting they axis at values comparable with the amount of the original material. With this method we determined the quantitative levels of mRNA in kidney of normotensive and hypertensive rats, which are reported in Table I, together with the corresponding amount of inhibitor activity. During aging in normotensive rats, mRNA and protein increase in comparable amounts, reaching the maximal level at 150 days. A difference in the behavior has been observed in kidney of hypertensive rats, in which the level of mRNA in younger animals is four times higher than that in normotensive rats of the same age and undergoes only a small increase during aging. To obtain more information about these differences in the expression of calpastatin, we compared the amount of calpastatin mRNA with the level of calpastatin protein (see Table I). This ratio is almost constant in kidney of control rats, whereas in hypertensive animals it is very high in younger rats and further increases as a function of age. These data are indicative of an imbalance between levels of mRNA transcript and accumulation of the inhibitor protein. This imbalance could be ascribed to an increased rate of calpastatin degradation caused by the concomitant calpain activation resulting from an increase in intracellular free [Ca2+] (40Kaplan N.M. Braunwald E. Systemic Hypertension: Mechanisms and Diagnosis in Heart Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1988: 833Google Scholar). The calpain-mediated calpastatin digestion is then responsible for the reduced amount of calpastatin available for calpain inhibition.Table IRelationship between calpastatin mRNA and calpastatin activity in kidney of normotensive and hypertensive rats during agingAgeCalpastatin mRNA1-aCalpastatin mRNA was corrected on the basis of the GAPDH mRNA amount calculated following the procedures of Chelly et al.

These data represent the average of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab In previous experiments using LAN-5 cells, we demonstrated that calpastatin digestion following calpain activation induced by an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] is accompanied by the formation of the active 15-kDa calpastatin fragment, which does not contain the N-terminal region (15De Tullio R. Averna M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the calpastatin deficiency observed in kidney of hypertensive rats is caused by calpain-mediated inhibitor digestion, we followed in a reconstructed system both the formation of the active 15-kDa fragment and the loss of calpastatin activity. When purified kidney calpastatin is incubated in the presence of native calpain (80-kDa form) purified from rat erythrocytes, a slight decrease in total calpastatin activity is observed (Fig.5A). Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the calpastatin species present in this incubation mixture revealed that ∼5–8% of total calpastatin has been converted into the active 15-kDa fragment. When the same experiment was carried out using autoproteolytically activated calpain (75-kDa form), a significant inactivation of calpastatin is observed, accompanied by the formation of a high amount of the 15-kDa fragment. Similar results have been obtained adding Ca2+ions to a crude extract prepared from kidney of a normotensive rat (Fig. 5B), indicating that also in these conditions, calpain activation promotes the appearance of the 15-kDa calpastatin form. In light of these observations, we measured the amount of the 15-kDa fragment in kidney of normotensive and hypertensive rats at different ages. As shown in Fig. 6, the kidneys of normotensive rats contain low levels of the 15-kDa calpastatin fragment. However, in hypertensive rats this fragment is already detectable in 30-day-old animals and increases ∼3-fold in 150-day-old rats. Even if the amount of total calpastatin activity is higher in kidney of normotensive rats, the level of the 15-kDa calpastatin fragment ranges from 1 to 3%. However this calpastatin fragment represents in kidney of younger and adult hypertensive rats from 6 to 20% of total calpastatin activity, respectively. Thus, the identification of large amounts of this calpastatin form in tissues of hypertensive rats further supports the in vivocalpain-mediated digestion of its inhibitor protein, producing an imbalance in the regulation of the calcium-dependent proteolytic system. The indication for an increased degradation of calpastatin by calpain in hypertensive rats posed the question of a different level of calpain isozymes in kidney of hypertensive rats. To answer this question, we thus determined the expression and activity of both µ- and m-calpain in kidney of 150-day-old normotensive and hypertensive rats, and no difference between the two strains of animals has been observed (data not shown). These data allow the conclusion that increases in calpastatin degradation can presumably be caused by an augment of intracellular free [Ca2+], leading to calpain activation. This hypothesis was tested by the administration to both strains of adult animals of an antihypertensive drug (Lisinopril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor) known to promote the normalization of Ca2+ homeostasis (41Haenni A. Berglund L. Reneland R. Andersson P.E. Lind L. Lithell H. Am. J. Hypertens. 1997; 10: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After a week of therapy, the blood pressure of normotensive rats is not modified significantly (Fig. 7A), whereas that of hypertensive rats decreases from 150 to ∼90–95 mm Hg. Furthermore in treated hypertensive rats a 3–4 times increase in calpastatin activity was observed (Fig. 7B); no significant effect could be detected in normotensive animals. As shown in 7B, inset, immunoblot analysis reveals that an increase in the protein amount parallels that of biological activity. As expected, the normalization of the calpastatin level was found to be accompanied by the restoration of normal small levels of the 15-kDa active calpastatin fragment (Fig. 7C). Calpain regulation is accomplished by a number of post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications of the natural inhibitor protein calpastatin (13Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 42Lee W.J. Hatanaka M. Maki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1129: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Goto K. Iwamoto T. Kondo H. Mol. Brain. Res. 1994; 23: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An alternative exon splicing at the level of l-domain seems necessary to produce tissue-specific calpastatin molecules (44Hao L.Y. Kameyama A. Kuroki S. Takano J. Takano E. Maki M. Kameyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the number of repetitive domains present in the calpastatin molecule was found to range between four in the high Mr form and one in the lowest Mr form (32De Tullio R. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At a molecular level calpastatin protein undergoes structural modifications determining its specificity and inhibitory efficiency (13Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 45Averna M. De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as well as its intracellular localization. This is particularly evident in neuroblastoma cells (46De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Averna M. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in which calpastatin is normally present in a phosphorylated and aggregated form localized in a specific position close to the nucleus. After hydrolysis of these phosphate groups by a protein phosphatase, the dephosphorylated inhibitor diffuses into the cytosol and acquires a significant increase in its inhibitory efficiency (45Averna M. De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These sequential events are triggered by an increase in intracellular [Ca2+]. Hence, the intracellular mechanism for the regulation of calpastatin inhibitory activity and functional localization seems to be represented by a reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation process. An additional down-regulation process can be attributed to the prolonged activation of the calcium-dependent proteolytic system resulting in a decrease in calpastatin activity (13Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Sorimachi Y. Harada K. Saido T.C. Ono T. Kawashima S. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The proteinases involved in this process are the calpain family or members of other thiol proteinase families such as caspases (47Wang K.K. Postmentur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.V. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 48Shi Y. Melnikov V.Y. Schrier R.W. Edelstein C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R509-R517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During this down-regulation process mediated by calpain, we have observed that both in cultured tumor cells and in vitro reconstructed systems during calpastatin degradation both 15-kDa active fragments or inactive peptides are produced (15De Tullio R. Averna M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this paper we provide evidence indicating that this degradative process is responsible for the calpastatin deficiency occurring in Milan adult hypertensive rats. In fact, we have observed that the levels of calpastatin protein and activity are similar in young normotensive and hypertensive rats, but they become four times lower in old hypertensive animals. Erythrocytes display the highest defect in calpastatin, probably because they are unable to synthesize new protein to compensate calpastatin decay. Kidney and heart are affected also, whereas in brain no significant difference in calpastatin activity between normotensive and hypertensive rats has been detected at any age. The loss of calpastatin in these tissues is caused by the intracellular activation of calpain, which is known to recognize the inhibitor as one of its specific substrate proteins. This conclusion is supported by the following evidence: (i) calpastatin mRNA levels in kidney of normotensive and hypertensive old animals are similar, yet in kidney of hypertensive rats the level of calpastatin activity and protein is much lower, (ii) the 15-kDa calpastatin fragment, which is a typical product of calpain-mediated calpastatin digestion, is present almost exclusively in tissues of hypertensive rats, and (iii) treatment of hypertensive rats with an antihypertensive drug known to produce normalization of intracellular [Ca2+] results in the restoration of normal levels of calpastatin activity and protein as well as in the almost complete disappearance of the 15-kDa fragment. It has been reported recently that pharmacological treatment with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors has no effect on the expression of calpastatin (25Sandmann S., Yu, M. Unger T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 3: 767-777Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations demonstrate that the calpastatin deficiency observed in hypertensive rats is the result of an increase in calpastatin degradation by calpain, most presumably activated by an increase in [Ca2+]. The model reported in Scheme FS1 describes the cascade of events occurring in hypertensive rats; specifically, it is proposed to be an initial interaction of calpastatin with the 75-kDa calpain form released from its site of activation. In this complex, calpastatin undergoes degradation to the 15-kDa active form together with inactive fragments. After a further increase in [Ca2+], cytosolic calpain can directly acquire the active conformation rapidly inhibited through the formation of a complex with calpastatin, which becomes in this associated form susceptible to a slow proteolytic degradation. It is well known that in essential hypertension, calcium homeostasis is affected by the result of an increase of this metal ion in different tissues (40Kaplan N.M. Braunwald E. Systemic Hypertension: Mechanisms and Diagnosis in Heart Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1988: 833Google Scholar), in all of which calpain activation is thereby promoted. In these conditions, the degradation of calpastatin and decrease in its inhibitory efficiency result in a profound imbalance of the proteolytic system, leaving calpain without its natural regulator. It can be concluded that the calpastatin deficiency observed in hypertensive rats can be regarded as one of the risk factors responsible for tissue damage that is typical of essential hypertension. Because of similarities between the genetically determined hypertension in rats of Milan strain and essential hypertension in humans, it can be postulated that also in these patients calpastatin deficiency is a potential risk for kidney failure and heart attack."

Analysis was carried out on the p67phox 5′-flanking region from –3669 to –4 (relative to ATG), including the first exon and intron and part of the second exon. The construct extending from –985 to –4 produced the highest luciferase activity in myeloid HL-60 cells but was not active in HeLa or Jurkat cells, indicating myeloid-specific expression. Four active elements were identified: Sp1/Sp3 at –694, PU.1 at –289, AP-1 at –210, and PU.1/HAF1 at –182, the latter three being in the first intron. These cis elements bound their cognate transacting factors both in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of the Sp1, PU.1, or PU.1/HAF1 site each decreased promoter activity by 35–50%. Mutations in all three sites reduced promoter activity by 90%. However, mutation of the AP-1 site alone nearly abolished promoter activity. The AP-1 site bound Jun and Fos proteins from HL-60 cell nuclear extract. Co-expression with Jun B in AP-1-deficient cells increased promoter activity by 3-fold.

The oxidase is composed of the membrane-associated heterodimeric flavocytochrome b558(gp91phox and p22phox) and the cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac1 or Rac2 (1Clark R.A. J.

Following stimulation of resting phagocytes, the cytosolic factors translocate to the membrane to form a complex with the flavocytochrome, which generates superoxide by the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen. The reactive oxygen species derived from superoxide are mediators of microbial death, but they can also cause injury to host tissues during the inflammatory process. Expression of the gp91phox, p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox components of NADPH oxidase shows tissue selectivity for cells of myeloid lineage, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocyte/macrophages (3Volpp B.D.

The p40phoxprotein, on the other hand, can be detected in undifferentiated myeloid cell lines, and its expression is increased during Me2SO-induced granulocyte differentiation (10Hua J. Hasebe T.

Thus, the phox proteins are coordinately up-regulated during terminal differentiation and maturation, suggesting shared mechanisms in the control of their expression. However, variations in the kinetics of induction indicate that regulatory factors unique to each gene may also be important. Major contributions to the regulation of expression of the components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase occur at the level of transcription. Studies of the gp91phox promoter have demonstrated a complex regulatory mechanism involving both positive and negative transcription factors (13Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lievens P.M. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol.

The upstream promoter contains a CCAAT-box motif that binds the transcription factor CP1, ISRE sequences that can bind IRF-1/2, and binding sites for a novel transacting factor termed BID. It is thought that in undifferentiated myeloid precursor cells, the positive promoter effect of these elements is masked by CDP, a CCAAT-displacement protein that binds the regions around these motifs, thereby suppressing transcription (13Skalnik D.G.

Down-regulation of the repressor protein during terminal differentiation is required for the expression of gp91phox. A critical regulatory element in the transactivation of gp91phoxis a consensus sequence for the ets family of transcription factors located in the proximal region (bp1 –57 to –50) of the promoter. This sequence binds the myeloid-specific factor PU.1 and the hematopoietic-associated factor complex HAF-1 (16Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

The importance of this etsbinding site is evidenced by the detection of single base pair mutations in this sequence in some kindreds with chronic granulomatous disease (17Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Voo K.S. Skalnik D.G.

Our recent studies indicate that ets factor ciselements also play critical roles in the transcriptional regulation of both the p47phox and p40phox genes. In p47phox, a single consensus PU.1 binding site located on the noncoding strand from bp –40 to –45 (relative to the transcription start site) accounted for most of the myeloid-specific promoter activity found in the proximal 2151 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the gene (20Li S.-L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site essentially abolished p47phoxpromoter/reporter gene activity in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we showed that this site bound PU.1 with high avidity, and mutations of flanking sequences that reduced the avidity of PU.1 binding also resulted in a proportionate reduction in promoter activity (21Li S.-L. Schlegel W. Valente A.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32453-32460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In p40phox, we analyzed ∼6000 bp of the gene and identified three PU.1 binding sites that directed gene transcription in a myeloid-specific manner. 2S. L. Li, A. J. Valente, W. Schlegel, M. J. Gamez, and R. A. Clark, submitted for publication. Two sites are located in the proximal 120 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence of the gene, and the third is in the putative 5′ untranslated region of the transcript. Mutation analysis indicated that each site contributed to a different extent to the overall promoter activity, and mutation of all three sites abolished promoter activity in myeloid cells. In accord with our mutation studies on the p47phox PU.1 site, the promoter activity mediated by each p40phox PU.1 site correlated with its binding avidity for PU.1 (21Li S.-L. Schlegel W. Valente A.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32453-32460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ets factor PU.1 and the ets factor-containing transcriptional complex HAF-1 thus play critical roles in the transcriptional control of the gp91phox, p47phox, and p40phox components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. In the current report, we describe our studies on the transacting factors andcis elements that regulate p67phox transcription in myeloid cells. Although PU.1 sites were identified in the upstream 5′-flanking region of the p67phox gene, we found that most of the functional activity in myeloid cells is directed by elements in the first intron, including binding sites for PU.1, AP-1, and, as recently described (19Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PU.1/HAF-1. Unique among the phox genes, the promoter activity mediated by these sites and by a functional upstream Sp1 site was demonstrated to be entirely dependent on an intact AP-1 binding site. Mutation of this site abolished promoter activity in the myeloid cell line HL-60, even in the presence of intact PU.1 and HAF-1 binding sites. RPMI 1640 medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and pGL3-Basic luciferase vector and the dual luciferase assay kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP, 6000 Ci/mmol, was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The TOPO-TA cloning kit (containing the pCRII vector) for cloning products of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were carried out by the Advanced DNA Technology Unit, University of Texas Health Science Center. Antibodies to transcription factors were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The p67phox 5′-flanking regions were cloned using the PromoterFinder kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using the human genomic libraries provided as templates to amplify the desired sequences. The forward primer was complementary to the adaptor ligated to the genomic DNA fragments in each library. The reverse primer (5′-GAAACCCCACCTTCAAGCC-3′) corresponded to bp –501 to –520 relative to the translation initiation codon of the p67phoxgene. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and then subjected to a second round of PCR using nested primers. The reverse primer (5′-GGCTGAAAGACTAGGCTACTGGTCC-3′) was derived from bp –534 to –558 of the p67phox gene. The final PCR products were cloned directly into the pCRII vector, and their identities were confirmed by sequencing both strands. Two sets of reporter vectors, differing primarily in the location of their 3′ ends (bp –534 versus –4), were constructed in the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector. The promoter regions were amplified using human genomic DNA as templates. For the first set of reporter constructs, the reverse primer was similar to the nested reverse primer indicated above, but with an added XhoI site (5′-CACTCGAGGGCTGAAAGACTAGGCTAC-3′). For the second set, the reverse primer (5′-CACTCGAGTAGGTAGAAACTAGGACC-3′) was derived from bp –4 to –21 upstream of the translation initiation code. The forward primers corresponded to the upstream sequences of desired promoter regions with an added 5′-flanking KpnI site. PCR products were digested with KpnI and XhoI and cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic at the same restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated nucleotides are shown in italics in Fig. 1. All constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and the myeloid leukemia cell line PLB-985 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mmHEPES. The human cervical carcinoma epithelial cell line HeLa, the lymphoid leukemia cell line Jurkat, and the human colon epithelial cell lines LoVo and HCT-116 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media contained penicillin and streptomycin. For suspension cultures, transfection was carried out by electroporation when cells reached a density of about 5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were resuspended in medium containing 20 µg of the luciferase reporter constructs and 0.5 µg of a Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-null, Promega) as a transfection efficiency control. Electroporation was carried out at 960 µF and 250 V. Unless otherwise indicated, at 8 h, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, lysed in 100 µl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at ambient temperature, and 20-µl aliquots of the supernatants were tested in the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer. For adherent cells, transfections were done using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HL-60 cells were disrupted by cavitation using a technique described previously for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (23Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 10 ml of cold relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3), and 3.5 µl diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) added. The cells were kept on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of relaxation buffer, pressurized in N2 at 350 p.s.i. for 20 min in a nitrogen bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL), and released into 750 µl of a solution containing 20 mm EGTA, 100 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmsodium orthovanadate. The cavitated cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the nucleus-enriched pellet was resuspended and further purified on a discontinuous gradient of sucrose (0.3/0.88 m). The nuclear fraction was extracted in ∼100 µl of urea extraction buffer (1.1 mm urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) and microcentrifuged. The supernatant was collected and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A fragment of DNA corresponding to the p67phox promoter region between –731 and –635 was labeled on the noncoding strand by successive T4 polynucleotide kinase and polymerase chain reactions. Briefly, 10 fmol of the reverse-complemented oligonucleotide (5′-GCCTTTTAACCAATTGAATG-3′) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-µl volume containing 30 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1× T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer, and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The kinase was inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was adjusted to 1× PCR buffer; 2 mm MgCl2; 125 µmeach dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 10 fmol of the forward primer 5′-gagctcAGTGCGGGTGAGTCTG-3′; 50 ng of the template DNA (pGL3-p67–330); and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega) in a final volume of 50 µl. Thirty cycles of PCR were carried out (94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), and the ∼100-bp product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The activity of the DNA preparation was ∼105 cpm/µl. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HL-60 cells as noted above. Complementary DNA oligonucleotides were annealed by heating in 1× NET at 95 °C for 5 min and cooling at ambient temperature. Probes were then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For gel shift assays, nuclear extract (6 µg) was incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature with 5 × 104 cpm of the labeled DNA probe in 20 µl of binding buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 µg/µl bovine serum albumin, and 2 µg of poly(dI-dC). For supershift assays, 2 µg of specific antibody were added, and the reaction was continued for 30 min. Samples were loaded on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C at 200 V in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, with 190 mm glycerol and 1 mm EDTA. Competition assays were carried out in the same manner, except that the reaction mixture was preincubated with competitor DNA for 10 min at 4 °C before addition of the labeled probe. Formaldehyde cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of chromatin were carried out as described by Farnham and co-workers (24Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, formaldehyde was added directly to cell cultures to a final concentration of 1%, the cells were incubated at 23 °C for 10 min, and then glycine was added to stop the fixation. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were allowed to swell in 5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were collected, resuspended in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.1), 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin and then incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were sonicated on ice to break chromatin DNA to an average length of ∼600 bp and then precleared with formalin-fixed Staph A cells (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Precleared chromatin from 2 × 107 cells was incubated alone or with 1.5 µg of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotated at 4 °C for 12–16 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with Staph A cells. The supernatant from the reaction lacking primary antibody was saved as total input of chromatin and was processed in the same way as the eluted immunoprecipitates, beginning at the cross-link reversal step. Cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 5 h in the presence of 300 mm NaCl. During this process, RNA was digested by 0.01% RNase A. Samples were then precipitated, resusupended, and treated with proteinase K followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitation with sodium acetate and ethanol plus tRNA and glycogen as carriers. Pellets were collected by microcentrifugation, resuspended in 30 µl of H2O, and analyzed by PCR. Total input samples were resuspended in 100 µl of H2O and then diluted 1:100. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 25 µl containing 2–3 µl of immunoprecipitate or diluted total input and 0.4 µm of each primer. After 35 cycles of amplification, PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. The primer pairs used for p67phox were as follows: forward, 5′-GAACTGATCCTTCAGGCAG-3′, reverse, 5′-TTCATTCCAGAGGCTGATG-3′ for AP-1, PU.1(1)/HAF1, and PU.1(2); forward, 5′-CAGAAGGCGAGATCATGG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCCTGACACTCAGAACTC-3′ for PU.1(3); forward, 5′-TAGACTGCCCCTGCATTG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCTTCCATGGCTTTGCAC-3′ for PU.1(4); and forward, 5′-TTCAGTGGAGAGGGGATG-3′, reverse, 5′-CTAGGCAGATAGGGGCAG-3′ for Sp1. The primers used for controls were as follows: forward, 5′-GCGCCAAGGACTGACATC-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGCAGGTGGTGCGTCTC-3′ for p40-PU.1; and forward, 5′-GCGCCAAGGACTGACATC-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGCAGGTGGTGCGTCTC-3′ for CCR5. The promoter region of p67phox was cloned using the PromoterFinder kit (CLONTECH). The specific PCR product amplified from the genomic library appeared as a single band (∼1.5 kilobases) on agarose gel. This amplicon was cloned directly into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and its identity was confirmed by the overlapping sequence between the 3′ end of the clone and the known 5′ end of p67phox cDNA (25Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunoi H. Sechler J.M. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Kenney R.T. Malech H.L. Epstein N.D. Roberts R.L. Leto T.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A clone was sequenced and later found to be identical to the sequence of the p67phox gene deposited in the GenBankTM (accession number NM 005003 (51550–533640)), except for a G to A change at bp –912 and the deletion of 3 of 18 tandem A residues between bp –1171 and –1169 (nucleotide positions relative to the ATG translation initiation codon). The sequenced clone was subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic. Based on this plasmid, a series of deletion constructs was made, all of which extended downstream to nucleotide –534 in exon 1 of the p67phox gene (Fig.1). The activity of these constructs was assayed in the HL-60 human myeloid cell line by transient transfection. As shown in Fig. 2, a ∼30-fold increase in luciferase reporter gene activity was observed in lysates prepared from cells transfected with pGL3-p67–733 and pGL3-p67–862, compared with pGL3-Basic vector. Constructs extending further upstream gave progressively less luciferase activity, suggesting the presence of negative regulatory elements between bp –862 and –2022. However, a deletion to nucleotide –682 resulted in >80% reduction in activity, indicating that sequences important for p67phox promoter activity are located between bp –733 and –682. To identify the potential protein-binding sites in this active region, a DNase I protection assay was carried out using nuclear extracts from HL-60 cells and a 32P-labeled fragment of DNA corresponding to the region of –733 to –637 of the p67phox gene. A broad protected region corresponding to the 25 nucleotide sequence CTCAGAATAGGGGAGGGGCAGGACA located at –704 to –680 was identified (Fig. 3). The core of this sequence, GGGAGGG (–694 to –688), is very similar to the consensus binding sequence (GGGCGGG) for the Sp1 family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors. To determine whether the p67phox sequence could bind Sp1 factors, EMSA was carried out using a labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the protected region of the gene. This oligonucleotide formed a number of DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extract from HL-60 cells (Fig. 4A). A pattern characteristic of Sp1 factors binding to their cognate element was observed, and this was confirmed by competition with both homologous probe and consensus Sp1 probe (data not shown). Specificity was further confirmed in supershift EMSA using antibodies to human Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the proximal promoter of the p67phox gene. To determine whether members of the Sp1 family of proteins bindin vivo to this cis element, we performed a ChIP analysis on the HL-60 cells. DNA-protein complexes were cross-linkedin vivo by the addition of formaldehyde to the cultures, and the chromatin DNA was sheared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp3 antiserum. Cross-linking was reversed, and the released DNA was purified and used as the template for PCR amplification by genomic primers specific for this region of the p67phox promoter. As a control for antibody specificity, we carried out the assay using an antibody to the transcription factor C/EBPα, which is expressed in HL-60 cells but does not have a cognate binding site in this region of the p67phox promoter. As a control for PCR specificity, we used p40phox primers designed to amplify a region of the p40phox gene that does not contain Sp1 or C/EBPα binding sites. The PCR primers specific for p67phoxproduced an amplicon of predicted size (317 bp) from both the total input DNA and the anti-Sp3 immunoprecipitates but not from the anti-C/EBPα immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the p40phox primers produced an amplicon only from the total input DNA. These data indicate that endogenous Sp3 protein in HL-60 cells binds to the p67phox promoter and that Sp3 or Sp1 factors may promote transcription of the p67phox gene in vivo. Although the reporter gene constructs described above showed promoter activity, it was not restricted to cells of myeloid lineage. These constructs were active in several cell types, including the nonmyeloid cell lines LoVo and HCT-116. To locate the DNA sequences that direct myeloid-specific expression of the p67phox gene, we extended the promoter sequences in both directions. PCR primers were designed based on the sequence of the p67phox gene deposited in GenBankTM (NM005003), and the genomic DNA libraries in the PromoterFinder kit were used as templates. Initially, we kept the 3′ end of the p67phoxpromoter fragment unchanged at bp –534 and extended the 5′ end to bp –3669, producing the construct pGL3-p67–3669. It was reasonable that this construct might dictate myeloid-specific expression of the reporter luciferase gene, because it contained two strong binding sites for the myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1, one at bp –3291 and the other at –2584, which were identified by sequence analysis and EMSA (data not shown; also refer to Fig. 6D). However, the pGL3-p67–3669 construct was 30–50% less active than pGL3-p67–2022 and was functional in both myeloid (HL-60 and PLB-985) and nonmyeloid (LoVo and HCT-116) cell lines (data not shown). We then analyzed the downstream sequences for cis elements that might mediate myeloid-restricted expression. A segment of the p67phox gene extending from bp –4 to bp –3624 (relative to ATG) was obtained by PCR amplification. This DNA segment, composed of the 5′-flanking sequence, exon 1, intron 1, and 27 bp of exon 2 of the gene, was subcloned into the pGL3-Basic reporter vector as before. This reporter construct was designated pGL3-p67–3624. Two 5′ deletion constructs that extended to bp –985 (291 bp 5′ to the active Sp1 site) and bp –678 (16 bp 3′ to the active Sp1 site) were also made for comparison. The highest luciferase activity was observed in HL-60 lysates prepared from cells transfected with construct pGL3-p67–985, compared with pGL3-Basic vector (Fig. 5). Further extension from bp –985 to –3624 (pGL3-p67–3624) led to a 65% decrease in the luciferase activity. Deletion construct pGL3-p67–678, which excluded the Sp1 site, showed a 55% reduction of the promoter activity compared with pGL3-p67–985. A similar reduction in promoter activity was obtained when the Sp1 site was mutated (Fig.5). However, when this Sp1 mutant construct was tested in nonmyeloid HeLa or Jurkat cells, no significant changes of the promoter activity were observed. More importantly, the promoter activity of pGL3-p67–985 was about 35-fold higher in HL-60 cells than in either Jurkat or HeLa cells. Combined with the results obtained with the fi"
