https://openalex.org/W2038516800,"Fluid flows that are smooth at low speeds become unstable and then turbulent at higher speeds. This phenomenon has traditionally been investigated by linearizing the equations of flow and testing for unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem, but the results of such investigations agree poorly in many cases with experiments. Nevertheless, linear effects play a central role in hydrodynamic instability. A reconciliation of these findings with the traditional analysis is presented based on the ""pseudospectra"" of the linearized problem, which imply that small perturbations to the smooth flow may be amplified by factors on the order of 10(5) by a linear mechanism even though all the eigenmodes decay monotonically. The methods suggested here apply also to other problems in the mathematical sciences that involve nonorthogonal eigenfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2013095310,"Synchrotron x-ray scattering studies were performed to probe the nonequilibrium structures of two layered systems at high shear rates: the smectic-A phase of the thermotropic liquid crystal 4-cyano-4'-octylbiphenyl (8CB) and the lamellar L(alpha) phases of surfactant membranes composed of sodium dodecyl sulfate and pentanol. Whereas the lamellar surfactant phases oriented primarily with their layers parallel to the shearing plates, as expected intuitively, in the corresponding high shear regime, the smectic-A liquid crystalline material oriented with the layers perpendicular to the shearing plates. A careful numerical study revealed that this surprising layer orientation results from nonlinear dynamics of the liquid crystal director and is caused by the flow distortion of thermal fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2066111688,"Measurement of rhenium (Re) and osmium (Os) concentrations and Os isotopic compositions in Ivory Coast tektites (natural glasses with upper crustal compositions that are ejected great distances during meteorite impact) and rocks from the inferred source crater, Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, show that these tektites incorporate about 0.6 percent of a meteoritic component. Analysis of elemental abundances of noble metals alone gives equivocal results in the detection of meteoritic components because the target rocks already have relatively large amounts of noble metals. The Re-Os system is ideally suited for the study of meteorite impacts on old continental crust for three reasons. (i) The isotopic compositions of the target rocks and the meteoritic impactor are significantly different. (ii) Closed-system mixing of target rocks and meteorites is linear on Re-Os isochron diagrams, which thus permits identification of the loss of Re or Os. (iii) Osmium isotopic compositions are not likely to be altered during meteorite impact even if Re and Os are lost."
https://openalex.org/W2039229520,"Global analysis of NASA Magellan image data indicates that a major concentration of volcanic centers covering âˆ¼40 percent of the surface of Venus occurs between the Beta, Atla, and Themis regiones. Associated with this enhanced concentration are geological characteristics commonly interpreted as rifting and mantle upwelling. Interconnected low plains in an annulus around this concentration are characterized by crustal shortening and infrequent volcanic centers that may represent sites of mantle return flow and net downwelling. Together, these observations suggest the existence of relatively simple, large-scale patterns of mantle circulation similar to those associated with concentrations of intraplate volcanism on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2074061082,"The authors review some experiments in molecular rectification and their implication for commercial uses of molecular electronic devices. Two of the cases involve rectification by single molecules which consist of an electron donor on one side, an electron acceptor on the other side, and a bridge in between, coupled to electrodes. The third case involves rectification at a graphite electrode derivatized with a Cu phthalocyanine derivative, and probed with a Pt/Ir scanning tunneling microscope tip. Some potential applications of molecular devices are in high-density memory storage of holographic memory devices, neural networks, cellular automata, and chemical and biochemical sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2108996076,"Graphite contains varying concentrations of screw dislocations whose Burgers vector parallels the c axis. Single crystals of natural graphite contain very few such dislocations; furthermore, their Burgers vector always exceeds 450 angstroms. Pyrolytic graphites annealed above 3000 degrees C contain abundant screw dislocations, ranging from 10(6) to 5 x 10(8) per square centimeter in two different samples prepared by somewhat different methods. The Burgers vectors of these screws are predominantly 3.35 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W2162097299,"The pressure dependence of the alpha-beta transition temperature in Ag(2)Se was determined by observing the temperature at which the sharp change in resistivity occurs when Ag(2)Se is transformed from the low-temperature orthorhombic to the high temperature body-centered-cubic form. The transition temperature increased from 133 degrees C at 1 atmosphere to 298 degrees C at 47 kilobars. The value of DeltaH(t), the heat of transformation, of 2.19 kcal/mol measured calorimetrically agreed well with the value calculated from dT/dP of the transition."

https://openalex.org/W2039726867,"A quantitative analysis of oxygen in the iron-nickel matrix of the Santa Catherina iron meteorite has been accomplished by using an electron microprobe with dispersive x-ray optics and by applying theoretically calculated corrections to the observed intensity ratios. Microvolume analyses and two-dimensional scanning images in OKalpha, FeLalpha, and NiLalpha x-radiation show that the high nickel phase of the meteorite has been oxidized while the low nickel phase has remained unoxidized."
https://openalex.org/W2052150437,Fractionation of neon-20 with respect to neon-22 during a single-stage transient permeation process results in as much as 45-percent enrichment of neon-20. The observed fractionations agree with those calculated from simple diffusion theory.

https://openalex.org/W2032769929,"Measurements of atomic sodium in the upper atmosphere by absorption spectroscopy with the Pepsios spectrometer on the Fraunhofer D(2) line during February to August 1964 at Madison. Wisconsin, have indicated abundances of about 10(10)/cm(2) for the late winter, about twice the values from a similar method in 1961-62. An abrupt decrease in abundance occurred during March in agreement with established seasonal behavior, but the abundance then increased anomalously in the summer to 8 x 10(9)/cm(2). The summertime increase may be related to observations of increased turbidity of the upper atmosphere, presumably caused by volcanic dust."
