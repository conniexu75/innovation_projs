A search of the literature indicated that very little work had been done on the dry inactivation of enzymes. In the present experiments, dry samples of these two enzymes were heated in vacuo at temperatures ranging from 160° to 200° C. The inactivation process was found to be irreversible. The values of the thermodynamic parameters ΔH and ΔS were also calculated from the survival data."

https://openalex.org/W2028113520,"BIOLOGICAL control is assuming an ever-increasing importance as a means of augmentation of, or substitution for, the use of pesticides in the control of both medically and economically important arthropods. This applies in particular to Culex fatigans, the main vector of Wuchereria bancrofti throughout most of the tropics and subtropics. Control of this mosquito is complicated by the widespread occurrence of resistance to most insecticides, together with the complexities of larval control by sanitation or other non-insecticidal methods."

https://openalex.org/W2067457145,"THE question as to whether the mammalian red coll is or is not a ‘perfect osmometer’ in hypotonic media has been sufficiently discussed1,2, the perfection of the osmometer being measured in terms of the value of a constant R. The red cells of heparinized blood are usually very good osmometers (R = 0.95–1.0) (refs. 3 and 4), and those of oxalated blood are poor osmometers (R = 0.5–0.8); the value of R} however, depends on the details of the methods used to measure it. Several explanations for the value of R being less than 0.95–1.0 have been suggested, for example, that some of the water in the red cell is bound, that electrolytes escape into hypotonic media, and that crenated or paracrystalline red cells have a real bulk modulus, It has also been suggested that red cells are compressed during high-speed centrifuging5, the extent of the compression increasing as the quantity of water in the cell increases, and that compression of the cells accounts for values of R less than 0.9–1.0."

Very similar results were obtained with five non-alcoholic peptic ulcer cases, duration of flushing being of the order of 30 min and extending over face, neck, arms and sometimes as far as the legs."
