https://openalex.org/W2006444687,"Established histochemical procedures have been altered by utilizing reagents which contain a group capable of reacting selectively with OsO 4 . This permits the cytochemical demonstration of a particular enzyme or functional group of a macromolecule with the light and electron microscope. The osmiophilic groups used thus far are mercapto, thiocarbamyl, and diazothioether. The ""osmium black"" produced at the site of reaction is electron opaque, is insoluble in lipids, and is not altered when the issue is embedded in acrylic and epoxy resins. Its fine amorphous character enables it to be maintained precisely in the electron beam."

Rather than sticking to the web, they may simply lose some of their scales to the viscid threads, and then fly on. Other insects, covered with detachable hairs or waxy powder, are similarly protected against entrapment. Quantitative data are presented on the adhesiveness of spider thread to insect cuticles oq various kinds."
https://openalex.org/W2031437715,"THE minor and seemingly random morphological differences between the two hemispheres stand in contrast to the marked and consistent differences in their functions, as reflected, for example, in the specialization of the left hemisphere for speech1. Some evidence that unilateral removals of cerebral tissue have different effects in the two sexes2 suggests that relationships between morphology and function might become apparent if observations on cerebral asymmetry were analysed for each sex separately. Of interest in this respect is a recent investigation by Conel of a series of eight brains from 4-year-old children3; no consistent feature was apparent in the differences between the hemispheres. However, if the sex of the children is taken into consideration, two noteworthy differences emerge. Conel's Table IX shows that in 4 out of the 5 female brains the amount of myelination is greater in the left FAγ-hand area than in the corresponding area on the right, while in the 3 male brains this difference is reversed. In Table X the number of exogenous fibres in layer I of areas FAγ and PB is greater on the right in the 4 female brains for which data are provided, but greater on the left in 2 of the 3 male brains. Neither of these comparisons reaches acceptable levels of statistical significance, but the importance of, and the difficulty in obtaining, these limited data may warrant a conjecture. Could these anatomical differences be related to the finding that side differences in the tactual thresholds on the thumbs of young children are not the same for the two sexes4 ?"

https://openalex.org/W1988689840,An association of rapidly metabolized DNA and RNA labeled with P(32) has been found in peanut cotyledons by incorporation of either uridine-C(14) or thymidine-C(14) by peanut cotyledon slices. Chromatography of the extracted nucleic acids on methylated- albumin columns shows that the rapidly metabolized DNA and RNA are contained only in the first half of the DNA peak where RNA and DNA occur in equal amount. One-fourth of the radioactivity is recovered in ribonuc'eotides. Density-gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride indicates that the material containing the P(32) has a higher density than most of the DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2093168498,"Thirty years of testing has yielded over 120 esterase inhibitors in current use for pest control. Several hundred million pounds of these organophosphates and carbamates are employed each year as insecticides and acaricides and, to a much lesser extent, as anthelmintic agents, nematocides, and herbicides. Systemics or chemotherapeutic agents for control of insect pests of plants and animals first became practical with the organophosphates. Compounds of lower mammalian toxicity and other favorable biological properties continue to appear and displace established compounds and broaden the use areas. Problems of resistance and residues in certain areas of insect control by chlorinated hydrocarbons will result in a further shift to esterase-inhibitors for pest control. Interpretation of the potential hazards of pesticides to man is dependent on the availability of fundamental information on their modes of action combined with use experience; this knowledge is available for the organophosphates and carbamates that act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors."

The differences may result from production locality, culture, and curing. The polonium seems to be not entirely derived from the radium; plants probably take it up from the soil or air."
https://openalex.org/W2036888637,"PREVIOUS work on a cell-bound bacterial enzyme which catalyses a reversible enzymatic cleavage of benzyl penicillin to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and phenylacetic acid had shown that this enzyme represents an acyl transferase which, under suitable conditions, is able to synthesize penicillins by transferring acyl- and α-aminoacyl residues from acylamino acids, acyl amides, acyl-atedhydroxycarboxylic acids, mercaptocarboxylic acids, alcohols, phenols and thiophenols to the amino group of 6-APA (refs. 1–3). Free amino-acids, ammonia, hydroxy-carboxylic acids, mercaptocarboxylic acids, alcohols phenol and thiophenol, liberated in the course of these reactions, may be considered to be hydrolysis products of the acyl compounds used."

https://openalex.org/W2054879966,A highly significant retardation of spontaneous atherosclerosis was observed in 2-year-old cockerels fed on a standard diet supplemented with 5 percent pectin for 18 months. The pectin-fed birds excreted three times as much lipid extract and almost twice as much cholesterol as did the control cockerels fed the standard diet supplemented with 5 percent nonnutritive fiber.

https://openalex.org/W2049087830,"Yeast cells, carrying on normal biosyntheses in the treatment cup of a sonic oscillator, cease synthesis when the oscillator is operated at a critical low power level. Synthesis is resumed immediately when the oscillator is turned off. At the sonic intensities employed the cells are not extracted, uptake of ammonium ion is unaffected, and most cells remain viable. The inhibition may be the result of disruption of supramacromolecular organization in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2064252191,"COBALT is known to accelerate nitrogen fixation by the blue-green algae, and the lowest cobalt requirement of Nostoc muscorum was observed to be 0.05 p.p.m.1. Its influence on Azotobacter does not seem to have been examined critically. The experiment recorded here was therefore planned to examine the effect of cobalt at different concentrations varying from 0.02 to 5.0 p.p.m. on nitrogen fixation by Azotobacter chroococcum in Jensen's medium2. The results obtained were compared with those observed with molybdenum, which was already known to be essential for Azotobacter. The basal medium was tested for cobalt and molybdenum by ‘Nitroso-R-salt’ method3 and Aspergillus niger method respectively. While cobalt could not be detected in the medium, molybdenum of the order of 0.00028 p.p.m. was found to be present. The cobalt salt CoCl2·6H2O used was also tested for molybdenum by the same method as mentioned here, and it contained 0.0001 p.p.m. of molybdenum at 0.1 p.p.m. concentration of cobalt, at which nitrogen fixation was found to be enhanced."

Although 1,2-tritiated androgens are available1,2, their use was precluded in this instance by the extensive loss of radioactivity which would occur during the metabolism of the steroid3. Carrier-free (7-3H)-testosterone acetate was prepared by catalytic reduction in pure tritium of 17β-acotoxy-androstan-4,6-dien-3-one."
