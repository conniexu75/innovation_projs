The system was used to study the invasion of erythrocytes by malaria merozoites. Invasion consists of attachment of the anterior end of the parasite to the erythrocyte, deformation of the erythrocyte, and entry of the parasite by erythrocyte membrane invagination."
https://openalex.org/W1588054335,"The finding that transferrin does not bind Fe3+ at the specific metal binding sites in the absence of carbonate and synergistic anions emphasizes the fundamental importance of the anion binding site to the chemistry of Fe3+-transferrin-CO32-. An important question regards the chemical and structural requirements for carbonate substitution. This has been, however, an area of some dispute in the literature. We have utilized four synthetic routes for the preparation of Fe3+-transferrin-anion complexes. The products have been examined with regard to spectral properties, and reaction with: (a) NaHCO3, (b) Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid in NaHCO3, and (c) sodium citrate under CO2-free conditions. The results provide information as to which anions are synergistic, and the basic properties of the Fe3+-transferrin-anion complexes that are formed. The 6 inorganic anions that were tested were all found to be nonsynergistic. Dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde were also nonsynergistic. Dicarboxylic acids were found to form stable Fe3+-transferrin-anion complexes which were only slowly displaced by carbonate. Several monocarboxylic acids with proximal aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, amino, or thiol functional groups proved to be synergistic. CPK molecular model studies suggested the functional group and the carboxylic acid must be able to fit within a site between 6.3 and 7.0 A in maximal length. One large substituent could be accommodated by the site, however, two methylgroups on the alpha carbon to a carboxylate group could not be accommodated. Chloroacetate and monocarboxylic acids were nonsynergistic. The results are interpreted in terms of an interlocking sites hypothesis which envisions the synergistic anion as interacting with the protein via its its carboxyl group and bonding with the Fe3+ via its proximal functional group."

https://openalex.org/W2077813077,"During adult life, the quantity of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) present in F cells—that is, rare erythrocytes which are reactive with rabbit antiserum to human HbF during microscopic immunodiffusion—is sufficient to account for all of the small quantity (less than 0.7 percent) of HbF normally present in whole blood. Thus, erythrocytes are normally heterogeneous with respect to the presence of HbF."
https://openalex.org/W2025262653,"1. A reaction center from chloroplasts was purified by means of detergent treatment, differential centrifugation, column chromatography, and sucrose gradient. 2. The reaction center is active in NADP photoreduction by ascorbate. Ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADP-reductase, and plastocyanin were required for the reaction. 3. The preparation contains five classes of polypeptide chains with apparent molecular weights of 70,000, 25,000, 20,000, 18,000 and 16,000 as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. 4. Treatment with 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate abolished the NADP photoreduction activity and released the low molecular weight subunits, which were removed by sucrose gradient centrifugation from the high molecular weight ones. The P700 signal is associated with the 70,000 molecular weight polypeptide. 5. Antibody, prepared against the active reaction center, inhibited NADP photoreduction catalyzed by the purified reaction center as well as by isolated chloroplasts. The antibody interacted on immunodiffusion plates with any subchloroplast preparation capable of NADP photoreduction. It also interacted with the purified 70,000 molecular weight polypeptide. 6. It is concluded that both the primary oxidation and the primary reduction in Photosystem I are associated with the 70,000 molecular weight polypeptide."

Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PHAGE) of extracts from cells pulse-labeled for 10-20 min with 35 S-methionine showed that immune precipitates contained none of the nonglycosylated internal structural polypeptides of mature viruses. The major viral-specific polypeptides labeled in 10 min included polypeptides of 180,000, 140,000, 110,000, 80,000, and 60,000 daltons with minor polypeptides of 65,000, 50,000, and 40,000 daltons. Labeling the intracellular virus-specific polypeptides with 14C-glucosamine indicated that the 180,000, 110,000, 80,000, and 60,000 dalton polypeptides were gylcosylated, and all but the 110,000 dalton polypeptides are contained in the mature virions. Based on pulse-chase experiments, it appears that at least 3 of the large polypeptides (140,000, 65,000, and 50,000 daltons) are precursors to the three major internal structural polypeptides of the mature virions."

https://openalex.org/W1487579703,"Polysomal RNA was isolated from pea epicotyls treated with (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid, and fractionated on oligo(dT)-CELLULOSE TO YIELD POLY(A)-containing RNA. This RNA fraction was translated in a wheat embryo cell-free system and found to have more than 90% of the messenger activity in total polysomal RNA. Immunoprecipitation of the translation product by monospecific antibodies to pea cellulases (beta-1,4-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.4) indicated that cellulase was synthesized in this system. The immunoprecipitate co-migrated with the buffer-soluble cellulase component in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Buffer-insoluble cellulase was not detected in the in vitro translation products. Fractionation of mRNA from membrane-bound and free polysomes and their subsequent translation indicated preferential synthesis of buffer-soluble cellulase on membrane-bound polysomes. With the above techniques for assaying buffer-soluble cellulase mRNA, a 10-fold increase in the level of this messenger per tissue segment was observed within 48 hours following (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid treatment. There was no evidence for pre-existing untranslated message for cellulase in control tissues. Since there was no delay in the appearance of mRNA for cellulase, compared to a 24-hour lag in the increase of cellulase activity, it is suggested that translational as well as transcriptional controls are exerted on the biosynthesis of cellulase in vivo. Analysis of the rates of peptide chain initiation and elongation, both in vivo and in vitro, indicated that peptide chain elongation may be rate-limiting during the lag phase of cellulase development."
https://openalex.org/W1489587149,"Heparinase was isolated from a transplantable mouse mastocytoma, by salt extraction of a particulate fraction sedimenting at 20,000 times g, followed by precipitation from saturated ammonium sulfate. By use of gel chromatography through Sepharose 4B, the enzyme was shown to degrade macromolecular. 35S-labeled, mastocytomal heparin (K-av about 0.25) to products similar in size to commercial heparin (K-av about 0.85), apparently by nonrandom cleavage of a limited number of glycosidic linkages per molecule. Prolonged incubation times (up to 5 days, with repeated addition of enzyme) did not result in further degradation of the product. No significant depolymerizing activity was observed with any other glycosaminoglycan tested, including chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, and commercial heparin. The pH optimum for degradation of macromolecular heparin was around pH 5. The nature of the linkage cleaved by the heparinase was investigated by reduction of unlabeled polysaccharide degradation products with sodium [3H]borohydride. The degraded chains (but not the macromolecular substrate) incorporated significant amounts of tritium. An essentially monodisperse fraction of the labeled, degraded heparin was subjected to meniscus depletion sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, indicating a molecular weight of 14,500. By relating the molecular weight to the specific activity of the preparation, the amount of reducible groups was calculated to be approximately one per molecule. The 3H-labeled heparin was degraded to monosaccharides by a combination of acid hydrolysis and cleavage due to deamination with nitrous acid. Analysis of the degradation products, by paper electrophoresis and paper chromatography, showed a major radioactive component which behaved like L-gulonic acid. Since [3H]gulonic acid would be the expected reduction product of a polysaccharide molecule, containing a glucuronic acid residue in terminal position, these results tentatively suggest that the heparinase is an endoglucuronidase. By direct deaminative cleavage (no hydrolysis) of the 3H-labeled heparin, the glucosamine unit in penultimate position (i.e. adjacent to the [3H]gulonic acid residue) was shown to be 52% N-sulfated and 48% N-acetylated. As only 14% of the glucosamine was N-acetylated in the macromolecular heparin substrate, it is suggested that cleavage of this polysaccharide, by the heparinase, occurs in regions more abundant in N-acetylated glucosamine residues than other portions of the molecule. The possibility that formation and degradation of macromolecular heparin occurs also in mammalian species other than rodents in discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1554639867,"The N-acetymuramic acid L-alanine amidase from Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051) has been purified to homogeneity. It is a monomeric protein of molecular weight 50,000. The enzyme has a high affinity for homologous cell walls and once attached to a cell wall will hydrolyze the wall completely before initiating the hydrolysis of a new cell wall. The affinity of the enzyme for cell walls devoid of teichoic acid or for cell walls of Bacillus megaterium is much lower than that for B. subtilis cell walls. A second homogenous protein has been isolated from B. subtilis which specifically combines with the amidase in a 1:1 molar ratio and stimulates enzyme activity. This modifier protein has no intrinsic cell wall lytic activity. The binding of enzyme and modifier protein has a dissociation constant of 8.5 times 10-9 M in 0.1 M LiCl, pH 8.0, but the two proteins can be completely dissociated in 3 M LiCl at pH 8.0."
https://openalex.org/W1979057030,"The five proteins programmed in a cell-free system by a mouse kappa light chain messenger RNA were labeled with [3H]leucine and subjected to amino acid sequence analyses. In all five proteins, 20 amino acid residues precede the amino terminus of the mature protein, indicating that there is one major point for the initiation of messenger RNA translation. The abundance (30 percent) of leucine residues in the extra piece (leucine at positions 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13) indicates that this moiety is hydrophobic. Furthermore, it seems that the precursor may have an additional extra piece at the carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1514743628,"Bacterial luciferase catalyzes a bioluminescent oxidation of reduced flavin mononucleotide; the products include a photon and oxidized FMN. The experiments reported here show that luciferase binds oxidized flavin mononucleotide in a 1:1 molar ratio with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.2 times 10-4 M at 3 degrees in 0.05 M 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2'2-nitriloethanol (bis-tris), pH 7.0. Analysis of the binding at temperatures between 3 and 30 degrees indicates an enthalpy of binding (delta H a) of minus 10.0 kcal per mol. The absorption spectrum of luciferase-bound FMN shows considerable alteration relative to that of free flavin. There is one major peak at 366 nm, and the 445-nm band is resolved into two distinct peaks at 434 and 458 nm; this spectrum is indicative of binding in a nonpolar environment. The circular dichroism spectrum of FMN bound to luciferase has structure which correlates well with the optical absorption spectrum of the bound flavin. The detail in the spectra of the bound FMN probably reflects the resolution of vibrational structure which is blurred in polar environments. The optical activity shown by the CD spectrum presumably results from binding in an electronically asymmetric fashion. Although FMN free in solution is highly fluorescent, FMN bound to luciferase is nonfluorescent, thus indicating that the emitting species is not an excited state of product FMN located in the same site in which luciferase binds oxidized FMN."
https://openalex.org/W1581906851,"Microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase prepared from either rat liver or human fibroblasts was shown to be inactivated in vitro by a factor in extracts of cultured human fibroblasts in a reaction requiring ATP or ADP and Mg2+ or Mn2+. The inactivation factor was found in the soluble fraction of fibroblasts extracts and was shown to be heat-labile, nondialyzable, and precipitable with ammonium sulfate. The inactivation reaction was prevented by the addition of either an ATP-regenerating system or an ADP-regenerating system, suggesting that the presence of both adenine nucleotides may be required. A series of kinetic experiments suggested that the fibroblast inactivation factor catalyzes the conversion of the microsomal enzyme from an active to an inactive form. The finding that solubilized preparations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase from both rat liver and human fibroblasts were resistant to inactivation raises the possibility that some unidentified microsomal component also may participate in the inactivation reaction."

A crude urinary protein concentrate was prepared by treating pooled urine with ammonium sulfate and subsequently drying the precipitate with acetone. The powder thus obtained was extracted with buffer and was subjected to chromatographic and electrophoretic procedures as follows: (a) ammonium sulfate reverse gradient solubilization chromatography; (b) DEAE-cellulose chromatography; (c) Sephadex G-200 gel filtration; (d) preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (e) SP-Sephadex chromatography; and (f) antialbumin-Sepharose chromatography. The enzyme was judged to be essentially homogeneous by: (a) a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at two pH values; (b) formation of a single precipitin line on immunodiffusion against its antiserum: (c) complete freedom from albumin, the major contaminating protein; and (d) a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1599039286,"Isocitrate lyase from both and free living nematodes (Turbatrix aceti) has been purified and compared. The old enzyme consists of the same five isozymes as the young preparation, but with quantitative differences. The enzyme shows an age-related decline in specific activity. Use of antibodies has confirmed the accumulation of cross-reacting material in organisms as found by Gershon and Gershon ((1970) Nature 227, 1214), using crude homogenates. Km, molecular weight, subunit size, and behavior toward the inhibitors oxalate, malonate, and tartronate all appear unchanged. Although the enzyme isolated from organisms has a sharply reduced specific activity, it binds as well to an affinity column as does young enzyme. It is tentatively concluded that the loss of specific activity in the old enzyme is due to the presence of partially active molecules, rather than to a mixture of active and inactive molecules."

The enzymatic block could be isolated to the first component, pyruvate decarboxylase (E1) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This enzymatic deficiency allowed a demonstration of an ""intercomplex"" exchange of the components of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase system and indicated that the first component is normally present in an apparent excess."
https://openalex.org/W1538872196,"Abstract The Dolichos biflorus lectin was isolated from seed homogenates by adsorption onto insoluble polyleucyl hog blood group A + H substance and subsequent elution with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Although the lectin was homogeneous as determined by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, sedimentation equilibrium, and immunodiffusion against rabbit antisera prepared against the crude seed extract, the lectin was fractionated into at least two electrophoretically distinquishable forms (A and B) by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose. Approximately 12% of the original lectin sample did not bind to the concanavalin A and contains the B form. The bound lectin was eluted specifically and quantitatively as a biphasic peak from the concanavalin A-Sepharose with a gradient of methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Carbohydrate analyses of lectin fractions obtained from different portions of the elution profile showed variation in the amount of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine, thus confirming the heterogeneity of the electrophoretic A form. Both the A and B forms of the lectin are active and are apparently present in the dry seeds. Once separated, the two electrophoretic forms of the D. biflorus lectin are distinguishable by electrophoresis. The separated A and B forms show a high degree of similarity in molecular weights (113,000 and 109,000, respectively), antigenic character, and amino acid compositions. Both forms have alanine as NH2-terminal residues and either leucine or valine as the only detectable COOH-terminal residues. The A and B forms specifically agglutinate and have similar titers for type A human red blood cells. They gave similar precipitin curves with hog blood group A + H substance and show similar inhibition curves with methyl alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the unfractionated D. biflorus lectin in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-8.0 M urea produced two major bands, corresponding to subunits IA and IIA of the A form of the lectin and two minor bands corresponding to subunits IB and IIB of the B form. Subunit molecular weight determinations by electrophoresis in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate gels showed molecular weights of 26,500 for subunits IA and IIA and 26,000 for subunits IB and IIB, Thus indicating that each form of the lectin is composed of four subunits."

Bacteriophage Pl can adsorb to M. xanthus and inject its DNA into this organism despite the wide taxonomic gap separating myxococcus from Escherichia coli, the source of Pl.

We have shown previously that competition occurred between different scrapie agents intracerebrally injected into mice2, indicated by an increase in the incubation period of the lethal scrapie agent when a different scrapie agent had also been injected to impede its pathogenesis. We did not establish whether the increased incubation resulted from replication of the lethal agent being hindered throughout or at particular stages of pathogenesis, or whether the increased incubation period resulted from some loss of effective titre."
https://openalex.org/W1595369525,"Protein synthesis during germination of Bacillus megayerium spores can be divided into two stages. During the first 75 min of germination (Stage I) endogenous nitrogen reserves are sufficient to support protein synthesis, and most amino acids are generated by proteolysis of dormant spore protein. The amino acids produced are excreted initially from the spore, but then reabsorbed and partially utilized for protein synthesis. Significant amino acid metabolism also occurs during Stage I, utilizing enzymes already present in the dormant spore. The biosynthesis of a number of amino acids is low or absent during Stage I due to the absence of biosynthetic enzymes. Subsequently, at defined times in Stage I, these missing enzymes are synthesized and amino acid biosynthesis is initiated. By the beginning of Stage II (from 75 min on) the developing spore has regained the capacity for synthesis of all amino acids and requires an exogenous nitrogen source for rapid protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2089053014,"Isosporan oocysts, measuring 13 by 16 micrometers, from a cat in Hawaii produced Besnoitia cysts in tissues of mice and rats. Feeding these cysts to cats led to oocyst shedding after 11 to 13 days, continuing for a mean of 11 days. This indicates a two-host cycle for Besnoitia, adding an intestinal phase and oocyst production by a carnivore to the already known tissue stages. Thus a representative of Besnoitia, similar to other species in cattle, horses, reindeer, impala, other mammals, and reptiles, has been shown to be a coccidian of cats, capable of being spread by fecal contamination. Besnoitia is the fourth mammalian tissue parasite, together with Toxoplasma, Hammondia, and Sarcocystis, found to produce isosporan-type oocysts."
https://openalex.org/W1583584160,"Water-soluble [14C]glycerol-labeled lipoteichoic acid isolated from the membrane preparations of Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790 released chloroform-soluble radioactivity upon mild acid hydrolysis. Chromatography of the radioactive, chloroform-extractable material revealed the presence of a very polar lipid (lipid I). Depending upon the conditions of acid hydrolysis, lipid I accounted for as much as 92% of the total 14C-labeled lipids released. More stringent conditions of acid hydrolysis reduced the amount of lipid I and increased the quantity of the other lipids. Lipid I on further mild acid hydrolysis yielded phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride almost quantitively. The other lipids released from the lipoteichoic acid were kojibiosyl diglyceride, monoglucosyl diglyceride, monoglyceride, diglyceride, and phosphatidylmonoglucosyl diglyceride. These lipids are most likely the degradation products of phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride because they are all simpler, structural derivatives of the phosphoglucolipid and they increase in concentration with increasing acid hydrolysis. These and other data demonstrate that the glycerol phosphate polymer of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of S. faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790 is covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride."

https://openalex.org/W2078977696,"Bobbed mutants of Drosophila melanogaster were used to determine whether there is any functional compensation for deficiency in rDNA content. The rate of rRNA accumulation was measured in the testes of five bb mutants of different phenotypic severity and in a wild type strain. The different rates of rRNA accumulation were compared to the phenotype (macroscutellar bristle length) and found to have a direct correlation (as in Weinman, 1972). However, there was not a direct relationship between the rate of rRNA accumulation and rDNA content. It is concluded that there is regulation of rRNA accumulation in some mutants, but that the regulation cannot be considered to be a compensation for the lack of rDNA. These results are discussed relative to other observations on the regulation of RNA synthesis in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1574567705,"Abstract Thioredoxin from Escherichia coli (a small hydrogen transport protein containing 108 amino acid residues and having in its oxidized form a single disulfide bond) was acylated with citraconic anhydride. Citraconylation of all amino groups resulted in total loss of enzymatic activity with thioredoxin reductase and immunoprecipitin activity with antithioredoxin antibodies; both these activities were fully restored after deblocking of the citraconylated protein by acid treatment. Large enzymatically inactive peptide fragments of thioredoxin were prepared by selective cleavage at Arg-73 and Met-37, respectively, and tested for their antigenic activity with antibodies against native thioredoxin. Thioredoxin-T-(1-73) and thioredoxin-T-(74-108) were separated by Sephadex G-50 chromatography in 50% acetic acid of a deblocked trypsin digest of citraconylated thioredoxin. Thioredoxin-T-(1-73) afforded about 25% of the corresponding immunoprecipitate of native thioredoxin without significant inhibition at antigen excess. Thioredoxin-T-(74-108) gave no immunoprecipitate but was a potent inhibitor of the reaction of thioredoxin and antithioredoxin as measured by turbidity formation. A major antigenic determinant of thioredoxin was present in the COOH-terminal sequence of the molecule. An equimolar mixture of thioredoxin-T-(1-73) and thioredoxin-T-(74-108) showed full immunoprecipitation activity with antithioredoxin and significant enzymatic activity with thioredoxin reductase. Gel chromatography experiments at pH 8 with the peptide mixture showed a main symmetrical peak with elution volume and amino acid composition identical with native thioredoxin. The results strongly suggested reconstitution of these two fragments to a complex, thioredoxin-T', with a conformation similar to native thioredoxin. Reconstitution of a thioredoxin-like structure was also obtained from a mixture of the overlapping fragments thioredoxin-T-(1-73) and thioredoxin-C-(38-108), although these peptides represented more than the 108 amino acid residues of the protein. Previous results showed reconstitution of thioredoxin-C-(1-37) and thioredoxin-C-(38-108) to a complex called thioredoxin-C' (Holmgren, A. (1972) Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. Lett. 24, 351-354). Together with the present results, this shows that three different combinations of two larger peptide fragments obtained by cleavage at two permissible sites gives reconstitution of thioredoxin. In each case, at least one of the component peptides showed strong immunochemical activity with antibodies to native thioredoxin, Netion from a tetrameric to a dimeri"
https://openalex.org/W1519007766,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor binding in membrane fractions of rabbit superior cervical ganglia has been measured after treatment with a variety of enzymes, protein-modifying reagents, and ions. Receptor binding is degraded by low concentrations of trypsin but is much less sensitive to alpha-chymotrypsin. Low concentrations of phospholipase A from Vipera russelli decrease NGF receptor binding by lowering the number of binding sites, while phospholipase A preparations from Crotalus terrificus terrificus and bee venom do not affect binding. Phospholipase C and D, neuraminidase, DNase, and RNase have minimal effects on receptor binding. NGF receptor binding appears to be absolutely dependent upon calcium ion. Removal of calcium from the incubation medium greatly reduces binding as does treatment with EDTA. Maximal receptor binding occurs at 5 mM calcium. Magnesium and sodium are unable to substitute for calcium. Receptor binding is greatly reduced by treating membranes with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, 2-methoxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, diazonium tetrazole, and tetranitromethane. NGF receptor sites can be protected from 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide by incubation with NGF."

https://openalex.org/W1479906117,"colicinogenic cells are immune to colicin E3. A called E3 immunity protein was previously isolated from colicinogenic cells and shown to prevent the E3-induced in vitro inactivation of ribosomes. We now show that the structural gene for immunity resides on the Col plasmid, a plasmid which is present in colicinogenic cells and carries the structural gene for colicin production. For this purpose, Col plasmid DNA was purified and characterized. The DNA preparation was shown to be homogeneous as judged by electron microscopy as well as agarose gel electrophoresis and has the ability to transform noncolicinogenic Escherichia coli cells into colicinogenic cells with a high efficiency. The Col DNA was then used as a template in a DNA-dependent in vitro protein-synthesizing system, and products were characterized. A radioactive product was detected which co-migrates with reference immunity in urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.7 and urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 7.6. This was produced only in the presence of Col plasmid DNA. No such was produced when Col plasmid DNA was omitted or replaced with chromosomal DNA. This radioactive was isolated and shown to be very similar to reference immunity protein, as judged by the correspondence of tryptic peptides. The synthesis of immunity in vitro was also shown by radioimmunodiffusion. Thus, the structural gene for immunity resides on the Col plasmid. In addition, we have shown that colicin is also synthesized in the same in vitro system using Col plasmid DNA, as a template, confirming the previous notion that the structural gene for colicin resides on the Col plasmid."

https://openalex.org/W1560746727,"Two distinct proteolytic systems have been detected during germination of Bacillus megaterium spores: one degrading a unique class of dormant spore proteins and the other degrading primarily protein synthesized during germination. Proteolysis of dormant spore protein began by the 3rd min of germination and by 25 min had degraded 15 to 20% of the pre-existing protein to free amino acids. This reaction was not significantly ( less than 20%) different with or without amino acids or a carbon or nitrogen source in the germination medium, or when RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, or energy metabolism were inhibited. Spore coat proteins and most enzymes were not degraded in this process, rather the major substrates were a unique class of low molecular weight (6,000 to 12,000) proteins which were soluble in acetic acid. Proteins synthesized early in germination (0 to 12 min) were also degraded rapidly (20% per hour). However, proteins synthesized later in germination (90 to 100 min) were degraded more slowly (similar to 4% per hour). At all times tested proteolysis of newly synthesized protein was identical in the presence or absence of amino acids or chloramphenical in the medium, but was abolished by inhibitors of energy metabolism. Most proteins degraded in this process had molecular weights greater than 12,000 and were insoluble in acetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1508694391,"Alpha-Acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase from Salmonella typhimurium has a native molecular weight of 220,000. The constituent polypeptide chains exhibit anomalous but unimodal electrophoretic migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gels. The subunit molecular weight, determined by sedimentation equilibrium in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, is 57,000. The apparent tetrameric nature of the native enzyme was confirmed by determining the types of oligomers formed upon cross-linking with dimethylsebacimidate. Analysis of tryptic peptides suggests that the polypeptide chains have an identical amino acid sequence. Carbohydrate analysis, ultraviolet absorption spectrum, and atomic absorption spectrum are consistent with the lack of cobalamine and cobalt. The Michaelis constants are as follows: alpha-acetolactate, 2.9 x 10-4 M; alpha-aceto-alpha-hydroxybutyrate, 7.8 x 10-4 M; NADPH, 1.5 x 10-5 M; Mg2+, 7.7 x 10-4 M. The catalytic constants (molecules of substrate catalyzed per min per molecules of enzyme) for alpha-acetolactate and alpha-aceto-alpha-hydroxybutyrate are 1,100 and 4,700, respectively. Comparative tryptic peptide analysis and immunological analysis show that alpha-acetohydroxyacid isomero-reductase and biosynthetic L-threonine deaminase bear no structural relationship and therefore rule out a shared structure hypothesis for the putative involvement of L-threonine deaminase in the synthesis of alpha-acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase."

The periplasmic protein seems to be missing from some mutants of E. coli (designated cbt) which are incapable of transporting succinate in whole cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030033150,"Proteins were selectively solubilized from human erythrocyte membranes with deoxycholate. After ultracentrifugation and preliminary fractionation procedures, the detergent was removed from the soluble membranes by Bio-Beads SM-2 and dialysis against 5 millimolar magnesium chloride. Reaggregation took place with the apparent formation of vesicles which showed serologically specific Rh antigen activity."
https://openalex.org/W2006296390,"In the pregnant rat, dietary protein restriction reduces the transfer of 14C-labeled alpha-aminoisobutyric acid from the maternal blood into the fetus. One of the causes of this phenomenon is a reduced capacity of the placenta to release into the fetus alpha-aminoisobutyric acid taken up from the maternal blood."
https://openalex.org/W1524791278,"Two enzymes with tyrosinase activity have been purified from the frog Rana pipiens. Both enzymes are isolated in an inactive form which can be activated with trypsin. Amino acid analysis, NH2-terminal amino acid determination (arginine for both proteins), and immunological evidence indicate that athe two enzymes are similar if not identical. They can be distinguished by their trypsin activation kinetics. Cell fractionation studies suggest that one form is found associated with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum whereas the other protein fraction is localized mainly within the premelanosomes. Sedimentation equilibrium studies demonstrate that both protein fractions are self-associating systmes. Ionic strength, temperature, and specific anion effects alter the equilibria of the associating systems. The monomeric molecule weight for both fractions is 30,000 and at low ionic strengths the predominant molecular weight species is the tetramer. The partial specific volume of each protein is 0.70."
https://openalex.org/W1582723524,"The complete amino acid sequence of tuberculin-active protein from tubercle bacilli was determined. The sequences of residues of tryptic, chymotryptic, and peptic peptides were established by Edman degradation and dansylation (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) and by digestion with carboxypeptidases A and B. Certain peptides were further degraded using partial acid hydrolysis. The aspartyl and glutamyl residues at positions 70 and 73 are present as amides. There is one intrachain disulfide bridge linking residues 27 and 59; there are no free sulfhydryls."
https://openalex.org/W1546404165,"Crude tRNA from adult Drosophila melanogaster was fractionated on bensoylated-diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns. The eluate was assayed for both amino acid acceptance and cytokinin activity. Most of the cytokinin activity was associated with a peak of serine acceptance. The five major serine tRNAs were purified by chromatography on benzoylated-dietyhlaminoethyl cellulose and reversed phase chromatography-5 columns. The major species, tRNA7-Ser was isolated from this tRNA and was shown to be N-6-(delta-2-isopentenyl)adenosine (i-6A) on the basis of ultraviolet and mass spectral data. The nucleoside somposition of all five serine tRNAs was determined directly and by the 3-H derivative method. They all contain pseudouridine, ribothymidine, 1-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, N-2-dimethylguanosine, 5, 6-hydrouridine, and 3-methylcytosine, while two contain an unidentified nucleoside, and one containes 1-methylguanosine. These techniques also confirmed the presence of i-6A in tRNA7-Ser as well as showing its presence in tRNA6-Ser and tRNA4-Ser. These three tRNA-Ser species exhibit marked changes in elution from reversed phase chromatography-5 columns as a function of temperature and this may be related to their minor base composition. The tRNAs-Ser were bound to ribosomes in response to the following triplets: tRNA2-Ser, AGU, AGC; tRNA4-Ser, UCG; tRNA5-Ser, AGU, AGC; tRNA7-Ser, UCG."
https://openalex.org/W1568768380,"When Mycobacterium tuberculosis was grown on Sauton medium, intracellular tuberculin-active protein was produced. This product was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 and was obtained in crystalline form. The crystals were plates, somewhat irregular in shape, about 50 mum in length and 25 mum in width. The yield corresponded to a 1.5% over-all recovery of total protein. Ultracentrifugal analysis showed only one major component with a calculated molecular weight of 9700. Sedimentation velocity analysis gave a sedimentation coefficient at 20 degrees (see article) of 1.73 S. The estimated specific activities of tuberculin-active protein were 6.33 times 10-9 tuberculin units per mg of protein-nitrogen for sensitized guinea pigs and 6.33 times 10-11 tuberculin units per mg of protein-nitrogen for humans. This is the most potent tuberculin-active protein that has yet been obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2053146084,"Corneal epithelium from hamsters dying of transmissible mink encephalopathy contained a virus titer of 10-4.8 times the 50 percent lethal dose (10-4.8 LD50) per 0.05 milliliter when assayed as a cell suspension derived directly from the infected animal. After one passage in tissue culture, an equivalent concentration of cells contained only 10-0.8 LD50 per 0.05 milliliter.. It is concluded that corneal tissues are infectious; the infectivity may be mainly associated with free nerve endings. However, the most important immediate inference is that corneas from human beings affected with Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease are likely to be lethal if transplanted to healthy recipients."
https://openalex.org/W1546580090,"The role of five enzymes essential to differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum has been analyzed by simulation studies and ranked with respect to their over-all effect on the conversion of glycogen to cellulose and trehalose in the later stages of differentiation. Their order is, in decreasing effectiveness, (a) glycogen phosphorylase, (b and c) cellulose and trehalose synthetase, (d) UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and (e) glycogen synthetase. Glycogen phosphorylase controls the speed of differentiation, which can also be slightly modified by the level of glycogen synthetase. The cellulose and trehalose synthetases and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase control the relative concentrations of trehalose and cellulose. The final trehalose to cellulose ratio is also affected by the speed of differentiation. Compensatory interaction between enzymes affecting the outcome of differentiation is also analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1513263572,"Glycogen synthase purified to homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle is essentially free of carbohydrate and shows no activity in the absence of added acceptor. It can use glucose as a substrate converting it to a glucose disaccharide in the presence of UDP-glucose as cosubstrate. The reaction is dependent on time, and on UDP-glucose, glucose, and enzyme concentrations. The product of the single step reaction co-chromatographs in two solvent systems with maltose. The glucose disaccharide produced in the reaction with UDP-[14-C]glucose and nonradioactive glucose as well as with nonradioactive UDP-glucoes and [14-C]glucose is labeled asymmetrically. The linkage is characterized as alpha-1,4 and therefore the disaccharide is identified as maltose."
https://openalex.org/W1557109494,"Exponentially growing cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 60AM Gasser were previously shown to lose about one-third of their cell wall peptidoglycan per generation via turnover (Boothby, D., Daneo-Moore, L., Higgins, M. L., Coyette, J., and Shockman, G. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2161-2169). We now show that 20 to 30% of the [3H]lysine initially present in insoluble peptidoglycan fractions was retained after 4 or more generations of continued exponential growth of cultures in the absence of label. Treatment of peptidoglycan fractions, before and after 6 or 8 generations of chase with lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17), released soluble products containing [3H]lysine which had electrophoretic mobilities identical with the disaccharide-peptide derivatives obtained from the wall peptidoglycan of this species. Because protein is known to contaminate peptidoglycan residues, the double labeled technique was used to show that one-half or less of the label lysine present after 6 or 8 generations of chase could be attributed to protein contamination. This then left a minimum fraction of 10 to 20% of the peptidoglycan that was immune to turnover. The absence of turnover of peptidoglycan labeled during short pulses has now been quantitated to show that pulses shorter than 12% of a generation (6 to 7 min) did not turn over. This turnover-immune fraction is in reasonably good agreement with the immune fraction of 10 to 20% observed after long periods of chase of extensively labeled peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2168435397,"Previous work has shown that aggregation and disaggregation of cells during development of D. discoldeum significantly affects the expression of certain developmentally regulated enzymes. We have examined this cell contact regulation in a previously isolated mutant, Fr-17, and found that during the course of its developmental sequence it becomes specifically defective in this function."
https://openalex.org/W1665819244,"The protoplasts of a mutant of Bacillus subtilis 168 (B. subtilis CMK33) are osmotically fragile when compared to protoplasts of the parent organism and contain an active, membrane-associated phospholipase A1. A protein found in the parent organism specifically inhibits the phospholipase A1 (Kent, C., and Lennarz, W.J. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 2793-2797). The inhibitor exists in both a soluble and particulate form. The soluble inhibitor is not found in the cytoplasm, but rather in a periplasmic fraction released from the cell during incubation with lysozyme. The soluble inhibitor has been purified to homogeneity by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Its molecular weight is 28,000 to 32,000 as determined by gel filtration chromatography and 36,000 to 37,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. The inhibitor appears to inactivate the membrane bound phospholipase A1 by an enzymatic process that is dependent on time and protein concentration. Binding of the inhbitor to the membrane-associated phospholipase cannot be detected. When purified inhibitor is added to cells of B. subtilis CMK33 during treatment with lysozyme, the osmotic stability of the resultant protoplasts is similar to that of protoplasts of the wild type of organism."
