https://openalex.org/W1999764709,"Background To examine the effect of multicomponent exercise program on memory function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and identify biomarkers associated with improvement of cognitive functions. Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects were 100 older adults (mean age, 75 years) with MCI. The subjects were classified to an amnestic MCI group (n = 50) with neuroimaging measures, and other MCI group (n = 50) before the randomization. Subjects in each group were randomized to either a multicomponent exercise or an education control group using a ratio of 1∶1. The exercise group exercised for 90 min/d, 2 d/wk, 40 times for 6 months. The exercise program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory. The control group attended two education classes. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that no group × time interactions on the cognitive tests and brain atrophy in MCI patients. A sub-analysis of amnestic MCI patients for group × time interactions revealed that the exercise group exhibited significantly better Mini-Mental State Examination (p = .04) and logical memory scores (p = .04), and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy (p<.05) compared to the control group. Low total cholesterol levels before the intervention were associated with an improvement of logical memory scores (p<.05), and a higher level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly related to improved ADAS-cog scores (p<.05). Conclusions/Significance The results suggested that an exercise intervention is beneficial for improving logical memory and maintaining general cognitive function and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy in older adults with amnestic MCI. Low total cholesterol and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor may predict improvement of cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Further studies are required to determine the positive effects of exercise on cognitive function in older adults with MCI.

https://openalex.org/W2045197676,"Although many adults with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are induced into remission, most will relapse, underscoring the dire need for novel therapies for this disease. We developed murine CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and an immunocompetent mouse model of B-ALL that recapitulates the disease at genetic, cellular, and pathologic levels. Mouse T cells transduced with an all-murine CD3ζ/CD28-based CAR that is equivalent to the one being used in our clinical trials, eradicate B-ALL in mice and mediate long-term B cell aplasias. In this model, we find that increasing conditioning chemotherapy increases tumor eradication, B cell aplasia, and CAR-modified T cell persistence. Quantification of recipient B lineage cells allowed us to estimate an in vivo effector to endogenous target ratio for B cell aplasia maintenance. In mice exhibiting a dramatic B cell reduction we identified a small population of progenitor B cells in the bone marrow that may serve as a reservoir for long-term CAR-modified T cell stimulation. Lastly, we determine that infusion of CD8+ CAR-modified T cells alone is sufficient to maintain long-term B cell eradication. The mouse model we report here should prove valuable for investigating CAR-based and other therapies for adult B-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2057421194,"The objective of the study was to investigate how inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, and TNF-α control NOTCH signaling activity in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. An increase in expression of selective NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1 and -2), ligand (JAGGED2), and target genes (HES1, HEY1, and HEY2) was observed in NP cells following cytokine treatment. A concomitant increase in NOTCH signaling as evidenced by induction in activity of target gene HES1 and HEY1 promoters and reporter 12xCSL was seen. Moreover, treatment increased activity of a 2-kb NOTCH2 promoter. Treatment of cells with NF-κB and MAPK inhibitors abolished the inductive effect of cytokines on NOTCH2 promoter and its expression. Gain and loss-of-function studies confirmed the inductive effect of p65 on NOTCH2 promoter activity. In contrast, p50 blocked the cytokine induction of promoter activity. Supporting promoter studies, lentiviral delivery of sh-p65, and sh-IKKβ significantly decreased cytokine dependent change in NOTCH2 expression. Interestingly, MAPK signaling showed an isoform-specific control of NOTCH2 promoter; p38α/β2/δ, ERK1, and ERK2 contributed to cytokine dependent induction, whereas p38γ played no role. Analysis of human NP tissues showed that NOTCH1 and -2 and HEY2 expression correlated with each other. Moreover, expression of NOTCH2 and IL-1β as well as the number of cells immunopositive for NOTCH2 significantly increased in histologically degenerate discs compared with non-degenerate discs. Taken together, these results explain the observed dysregulated expression of NOTCH genes in degenerative disc disease. Thus, controlling IL-1β and TNF-α activities during disc disease may restore NOTCH signaling and nucleus pulposus cell function."

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, however, is also involved in the development of fibrosis. Using normal human lung fibroblasts, we investigated the induction of fibrotic responses by the S1P receptor (S1PR) agonists S1P, FTY720-P, ponesimod, and SEW2871 and compared them with the responses induced by the known fibrotic mediator TGF-β1. In contrast to TGF-β1, S1PR agonists did not induce expression of the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin. However, TGF-β1, S1P, and FTY720-P caused robust stimulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and increased pro-fibrotic marker gene expression including connective tissue growth factor. Ponesimod showed limited and SEW2871 showed no pro-fibrotic potential in these readouts. Analysis of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways showed that in contrast to TGF-β1, S1PR agonists did not activate Smad2/3 signaling but rather activated PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling to induce ECM synthesis. The strong induction of ECM synthesis by the nonselective agonists S1P and FTY720-P was due to the stimulation of S1P2 and S1P3 receptors, whereas the weaker induction of ECM synthesis at high concentrations of ponesimod was due to a low potency activation of S1P3 receptors. Finally, in normal human lung fibroblast-derived myofibroblasts that were generated by TGF-β1 pretreatment, S1P and FTY720-P were effective stimulators of ECM synthesis, whereas ponesimod was inactive, because of the down-regulation of S1P3R expression in myofibroblasts. These data demonstrate that S1PR agonists are pro-fibrotic via S1P2R and S1P3R stimulation using Smad-independent pathways.Background: The sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) system may contribute to lung fibrosis.Results: S1P receptor (S1PR) agonists with different receptor subtype selectivity profiles varied in their potential to induce fibrotic responses in human lung fibroblasts.Conclusion: S1P2R and S1P3R signaling contributes to fibrotic responses in lung fibroblasts.Significance: Improving S1P1R modulator selectivity may lead to an improved safety profile of compounds for autoimmune therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2040204759,"MicroRNAs are a class of naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs that target protein-coding mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level and regulate complex patterns of gene expression. Our previous studies demonstrated that in human prostate cancer the miRNA miR-125b is highly expressed, leading to a negative regulation of some tumor suppressor genes. In this study, we further extend our studies by showing that miR-125b represses the protein product of the ink4a/ARF locus, p14ARF, in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (wild type-p53) and 22Rv1 (both wild type and mutant p53), as well as in the PC-346C prostate cancer xenograft model that lentivirally overexpressed miR-125b. Our results highlight that miR-125b modulates the p53 network by hindering the down-regulation of Mdm2, thereby affecting p53 and its target genes p21 and Puma to a degree sufficient to inhibit apoptosis. Conversely, treatment of prostate cancer cells with an inhibitor of miR-125b (anti-miR-125b) resulted in increased expression of p14ARF, decreased level of Mdm2, and induction of apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of miR-125b in p53-deficient PC3 cells induced down-regulation of p14ARF, which leads to increased cell proliferation through a p53-independent manner. Thus, we conclude that miR-125b acts as an oncogene which regulates p14ARF/Mdm2 signaling, stimulating proliferation of prostate cancer cells through a p53-dependent or p53-independent function. This reinforces our belief that miR-125b has potential as a therapeutic target for the management of patients with metastatic prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2079179318,"Circulating subclinical lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occurs in health and disease. Ingesting high fatty meals increases LPS that cause metabolic endotoxemia. Subclinical LPS in periodontal disease may impair endothelial function. The heart may be targeted as cardiac cells express TLR4, the LPS receptor. It was hypothesized that recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS increases mortality and causes cardiac fibrosis.C57Bl/6 mice were injected with intraperitoneal saline (control), low dose LPS (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), or moderate dose LPS (10 or 20 mg/kg), once a week for 3 months. Left ventricular (LV) function (echocardiography), hemodynamics (tail cuff pressure) and electrocardiograms (telemetry) were measured. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed by picrosirius red staining and LV expression of fibrosis related genes (QRT-PCR). Adult cardiac fibroblasts were isolated and exposed to LPS.LPS injections transiently increased heart rate and blood pressure (<6 hours) and mildly decreased LV function with full recovery by 24 hours. Mice tolerated weekly LPS for 2-3 months with no change in activity, appearance, appetite, weight, blood pressure, LV function, oximetry, or blood chemistries. Mortality increased after 60-90 days with moderate, but not low dose LPS. Arrhythmias occurred a few hours before death. LV collagen fraction area increased dose-dependently from 3.0±0.5% (SEM) in the saline control group, to 5.6±0.5% with low dose LPS and 9.7±0.9% with moderate dose LPS (P<0.05 moderate vs low dose LPS, and each LPS dose vs control). LPS increased LV expression of collagen Iα1, collagen IIIα1, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, periostin and IL-6 (P<0.05 moderate vs low dose LPS and vs control). LPS increased α-SMA immunostaining of myofibroblasts. LPS dose-dependently increased IL-6 in isolated adult cardiac fibroblasts.Recurrent exposure to subclinical LPS increases mortality and induces cardiac fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2036806228,"CD274, one of two co-stimulatory ligands for programmed death 1 and widely expressed in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), may co-stimulate T cells and regulates inflammatory responses. However, changes in CD274 gene expression and the underlying molecular mechanism are poorly understood during inflammatory responses. Therefore, delineation of the complex mechanisms regulating CD274 expression is critical to understand this immunoregulatory system during inflammatory responses. The purpose of this study was to assess the molecular mechanisms regulating CD274 expression in an in vitro monocyte model of inflammatory response. Firstly, CD274 expression levels in human primary monocytes after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment were observed and correlated with NF-κB activation. Secondly, based on the distribution of putative NF-κB binding sites, 5' truncated human CD274 promoter reporters were constructed, transfected into U937 cells and critical promoter regions for basal (nt -570 to +94) and LPS-induced (nt -1735 to -570) transcription were identified by dual luciferase assays. Finally, a key NF-κB binding site (nt -610 to -601) for LPS-inducible CD274 transcriptional activity was characterized by point mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis assays (ChIP). Thus, the present study establishes a molecular basis to understand the mechanisms governing CD274 expression in certain infections and inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2076649239,"Plasmodium falciparum infection of human erythrocytes is known to result in the modification of the host cell cytoskeleton by parasite-coded proteins. However, such modifications and corresponding implications in malaria pathogenesis have not been fully explored. Here, we probed the gradual modification of infected erythrocyte cytoskeleton with advancing stages of infection using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We reported a novel strategy to derive accurate and quantitative information on the knob structures and their connections with the spectrin network by performing AFM-based imaging analysis of the cytoplasmic surface of infected erythrocytes. Significant changes on the red cell cytoskeleton were observed from the expansion of spectrin network mesh size, extension of spectrin tetramers and the decrease of spectrin abundance with advancing stages of infection. The spectrin network appeared to aggregate around knobs but also appeared sparser at non-knob areas as the parasite matured. This dramatic modification of the erythrocyte skeleton during the advancing stage of malaria infection could contribute to the loss of deformability of the infected erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2000162145,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNP C) is a core component of 40S ribonucleoprotein particles that bind pre-mRNAs and influence their processing, stability and export. Breast cancer tumor suppressors BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 form a complex and play key roles in homologous recombination (HR), DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and cell cycle regulation following DNA damage.PALB2 nucleoprotein complexes were isolated using tandem affinity purification from nuclease-solubilized nuclear fraction. Immunofluorescence was used for localization studies of proteins. siRNA-mediated gene silencing and flow cytometry were used for studying DNA repair efficiency and cell cycle distribution/checkpoints. The effect of hnRNP C on mRNA abundance was assayed using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR.We identified hnRNP C as a component of a nucleoprotein complex containing breast cancer suppressor proteins PALB2, BRCA2 and BRCA1. Notably, other components of the 40S ribonucleoprotein particle were not present in the complex. hnRNP C was found to undergo significant changes of sub-nuclear localization after ionizing radiation (IR) and to partially localize to DNA damage sites. Depletion of hnRNP C substantially altered the normal balance of repair mechanisms following DSB induction, reducing HR usage in particular, and impaired S phase progression after IR. Moreover, loss of hnRNP C strongly reduced the abundance of key HR proteins BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and BRIP1, which can be attributed, at least in part, to the downregulation of their mRNAs due to aberrant splicing. Our results establish hnRNP C as a key regulator of BRCA gene expression and HR-based DNA repair. They also suggest the existence of an RNA regulatory program at sites of DNA damage, which involves a unique function of hnRNP C that is independent of the 40S ribonucleoprotein particles and most other hnRNP proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2090624720,"Elucidating the spatial dynamic and core constituents of the microbial communities found in association with arthropod hosts is of crucial importance for insects that may vector human or agricultural pathogens. The hematophagous Cimex lectularius (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), known as the human bed bug, has made a recent resurgence in North America, as well as worldwide, potentially owing to increased travel, climate change and resistance to insecticides. A comprehensive survey of the bed bug microbiome has not been performed to date, nor has an assessment of the spatial dynamics of its microbiome. Here we present a survey of internal and external bed bug microbial communities by amplifying the V4–V6 hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA gene region followed by 454 Titanium sequencing using 31 individuals from eight distinct collection locations obtained from residences in Cincinnati, OH. Across all samples, 97% of the microbial community is made up of two dominant OTUs, previously identified as the α-proteobacterium Wolbachia and an unnamed γ-proteobacterium from the Enterobacteriaceae. Microbial communities varied among host locations for measures of community diversity and exhibited structure according to collection location. This broad survey represents the most in-depth assessment, to date, of the microbes that associate with bed bugs."

However, there is need to learn from established programs to identify ways to achieve the strongest, most sustainable impact. This study examined the Botswana lay counselor cadre, a task shifting initiative, to explore effectiveness and contribution to the health workforce.This evaluation used multiple methods, including a desk review, a national lay counselor survey (n = 385; response = 94%), in-depth interviews (n = 79), lay counselors focus group discussions (n = 7), lay counselors observations (n = 25), and client exit interviews (n = 47).Interview and focus group data indicate that lay counselors contribute to essentially all HIV-related programs in Botswana and they conduct the majority of HIV tests and related counseling at public health facilities throughout the country. Interviews showed that the lay counselor cadre is making the workload of more skilled health workers more manageable and increasing HIV acceptance in communities. The average score on a work-related knowledge test was 74.5%. However for 3 questions, less than half answered correctly. During observations, lay counselors demonstrated average competence for most skills assessed and clients (97.9%) were satisfied with services received. From the survey, lay counselors generally reported being comfortable with their duties; however, some reported clinical duties that extended beyond their training and mandate. Multiple factors affecting the performance of the lay counselors were identified, including insufficient resources, such as private counseling space and HIV test kits; and technical, administrative, and supervisory support.Lay counselors are fulfilling an important role in Botswana's healthcare system, serving as the entry point into HIV care, support, and treatment services.For this and other similar task shifting initiatives, it is important that lay counselors' responsibilities are clear and that training and support are adequate to optimize their effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1991621680,"Stress alters immunological and neuroendocrinological functions. An increasing number of studies indicate that chronic stress can accelerate tumor growth, but its role in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) progression is not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of chronic restraint stress (CRS) on CRC cell growth in nude mice and the possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, we showed that CRS increased the levels of plasma catecholamines including epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE), and stimulated the growth of CRC cell-derived tumors in vivo. Treatment with the adrenoceptor (AR) antagonists phentolamine (PHE, α-AR antagonist) and propranolol (PRO, β-AR antagonist) significantly inhibited the CRS-enhanced CRC cell growth in nude mice. In addition, the stress hormones E and NE remarkably enhanced CRC cell proliferation and viability in culture, as well as tumor growth in vivo. These effects were antagonized by the AR antagonists PHE and PRO, indicating that the stress hormone-induced CRC cell proliferation is AR dependent. We also observed that the β-AR antagonists atenolol (ATE, β1- AR antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (ICI, β2- AR antagonist) inhibited tumor cell proliferation and decreased the stress hormone-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 (ERK1/2) in vitro and in vivo. The ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also blocked the function of the stress hormone, suggesting the involvement of ERK1/2 in the tumor-promoting effect of CRS. We conclude that CRS promotes CRC xenograft tumor growth in nude mice by stimulating CRC cell proliferation through the AR signaling-dependent activation of ERK1/2."
https://openalex.org/W2010709148,"The buckwheat family Polygonaceae is a diverse group of plants and is a good model for investigating biogeography, breeding systems, coevolution with symbionts such as ants and fungi, functional trait evolution, hybridization, invasiveness, morphological plasticity, pollen morphology and wood anatomy. The main goal of this study was to obtain age estimates for Polygonaceae by calibrating a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, using a relaxed molecular clock with fossil data. Based on the age estimates, we also develop hypotheses about the historical biogeography of the Southern Hemisphere group Muehlenbeckia. We are interested in addressing whether vicariance or dispersal could account for the diversification of Muehlenbeckia, which has a ""Gondwanan"" distribution. Eighty-one species of Polygonaceae were analysed with MrBayes to infer species relationships. One nuclear (nrITS) and three chloroplast markers (the trnL-trnF spacer region, matK and ndhF genes) were used. The molecular data were also analysed with Beast to estimate divergence times. Seven calibration points including fossil pollen and a leaf fossil of Muehlenbeckia were used to infer node ages. Results of the Beast analyses indicate an age of 110.9 (exponential/lognormal priors)/118.7 (uniform priors) million years (Myr) with an uncertainty interval of (90.7-125.0) Myr for the stem age of Polygonaceae. This age is older than previously thought (Maastrichtian, approximately 65.5-70.6 Myr). The estimated divergence time for Muehlenbeckia is 41.0/41.6 (39.6-47.8) Myr and its crown clade is 20.5/22.3 (14.2-33.5) Myr old. Because the breakup of Gondwana occurred from 95-30 Myr ago, diversification of Muehlenbeckia is best explained by oceanic long-distance and maybe stepping-stone dispersal rather than vicariance. This study is the first to give age estimates for clades of Polygonaceae and functions as a jumping-off point for future studies on the historical biogeography of the family."

We aimed to study the association of vitamin D insufficiency with elevated serum uric acid among middle-aged and elderly Chinese Han women.We collected data from participants residing in Jinchang district of Suzhou from January to May, 2010. Serum uric acid, 25-hydroxy vitamin D and other traditional biomarkers including fasting plasma glucose and blood lipids were determined in 1726 women aged above 30 years. Association between vitamin D insufficiency and elevated uric acid was analyzed in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively.Among postmenopausal women, 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of participants with elevated uric acid was lower than that of those with normal uric acid (median [interquartile range]: 35[28-57] vs 40[32-58], µg/L; P = 0.006). Elevated uric acid was more prevalent in participants with vitamin D insufficiency compared to those without vitamin D insufficiency (16.50% vs 8.08%; P<0.001). Association between vitamin D insufficiency and elevated uric acid was not significant among premenopausal women. However, participants with vitamin D insufficiency were more likely to have elevated uric acid compared with those without vitamin D insufficiency among postmenopausal women (OR, 95% CI: 2.38, 1.47-3.87). Moreover, after excluding individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension, the association of vitamin D insufficiency with elevated uric acid was still significant (OR, 95% CI: 2.48, 1.17-5.44).Vitamin D insufficiency was significantly associated with elevated uric acid among postmenopausal Chinese Han women. This study suggested that a clinical trial should be conducted to confirm the association of vitamin D insufficiency with hyperuricemia."

Estimation of the infectivity in the vector population, collected in different seasons, may be useful to better understanding the transmission dynamics of VL as well as to plan vector control measures.We collected sand flies from highly endemic regions of Bihar state, India for one year over three seasons. The species of the sand flies were confirmed by species-specific PCR-RFLP. Leishmania donovani infection was investigated in 1397 female Phlebotomus argentipes using PCR, targeting the Leishmania specific minicircle of the kDNA region. Further, the parasitic load in the infected sand flies was measured using quantitative PCR.Though sand flies were most abundant in the rainy season, the highest rate of infection was detected in the winter season with 2.84% sand flies infected followed by the summer and rainy seasons respectively. This study can help in vector elimination programmes and to reduce disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2026758079,"To date, a great number of studies have demonstrated that altered expression of kinesins is associated with development and progression of various human cancers. Kinesin family member 26B (KIF26B), a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs), is essential for kidney development. However, the role of KIF26B during tumorigenesis and progression is limited. Here, we demonstrate that both KIF26B mRNA and protein are overexpression in breast cancer tissues by RT-qPCR and western blot. Immunohistochemistry revealed that KIF26B expression significantly correlated with clinicopathological factors, including tumor size (P = 0.011), grade (P = 0.017), lymph node status (P = 0.009) and ER status (P = 0.012). Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that breast cancer patients with high KIF26B expression had a shorter survival than those with low KIF26B expression. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that KIF26B is an independent prognostic for outcome in breast cancer (HR, 2.356; 95%CI, 1.268-4.378; P = 0.007). Collectively, our study demonstrated that KIF26B was overexpression in breast cancer and could be served as a potential prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2051882786,"Background The impact of a newly emerged influenza pandemic will depend on its transmissibility and severity. Understanding how these pandemic features impact on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative intervention strategies is important for pandemic planning. Methods A cost effectiveness analysis of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies intended to mitigate a future pandemic was conducted using a simulation model of a community of ∼30,000 in Australia. Six pandemic severity categories were defined based on case fatality ratio (CFR), using data from the 2009/2010 pandemic to relate hospitalisation rates to CFR. Results Intervention strategies combining school closure with antiviral treatment and prophylaxis are the most cost effective strategies in terms of cost per life year saved (LYS) for all severity categories. The cost component in the cost per LYS ratio varies depending on pandemic severity: for a severe pandemic (CFR of 2.5%) the cost is ∼$9 k per LYS; for a low severity pandemic (CFR of 0.1%) this strategy costs ∼$58 k per LYS; for a pandemic with very low severity similar to the 2009 pandemic (CFR of 0.03%) the cost is ∼$155 per LYS. With high severity pandemics (CFR >0.75%) the most effective attack rate reduction strategies are also the most cost effective. During low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, while for high severity pandemics costs are dominated by hospitalisation costs and productivity losses due to death. Conclusions The most cost effective strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic involve combining sustained social distancing with the use of antiviral agents. For low severity pandemics the most cost effective strategies involve antiviral treatment, prophylaxis and short durations of school closure; while these are cost effective they are less effective than other strategies in reducing the infection rate."
https://openalex.org/W1985161776,"Liquid-based cytology (LBC) in conjunction with Whole-Slide Imaging (WSI) enables the objective and sensitive and quantitative evaluation of biomarkers in cytology. However, the complex three-dimensional distribution of cells on LBC slides requires manual focusing, long scanning-times, and multi-layer scanning. Here, we present a solution that overcomes these limitations in two steps: first, we make sure that focus points are only set on cells. Secondly, we check the total slide focus quality. From a first analysis we detected that superficial dust can be separated from the cell layer (thin layer of cells on the glass slide) itself. Then we analyzed 2,295 individual focus points from 51 LBC slides stained for p16 and Ki67. Using the number of edges in a focus point image, specific color values and size-inclusion filters, focus points detecting cells could be distinguished from focus points on artifacts (accuracy 98.6%). Sharpness as total focus quality of a virtual LBC slide is computed from 5 sharpness features. We trained a multi-parameter SVM classifier on 1,600 images. On an independent validation set of 3,232 cell images we achieved an accuracy of 94.8% for classifying images as focused. Our results show that single-layer scanning of LBC slides is possible and how it can be achieved. We assembled focus point analysis and sharpness classification into a fully automatic, iterative workflow, free of user intervention, which performs repetitive slide scanning as necessary. On 400 LBC slides we achieved a scanning-time of 13.9±10.1 min with 29.1±15.5 focus points. In summary, the integration of semantic focus information into whole-slide imaging allows automatic high-quality imaging of LBC slides and subsequent biomarker analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2100310611,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy, and mechanisms linking the underlying risk and dietary factors are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that dietary intake of saturated fat increases the levels of sphingolipids, namely ceramide and sphingomyelin in cardiac cell membranes that disrupt caveolae, specialized membrane micro-domains and important for cellular signaling. C57BL/6 mice were fed two high-fat diets: palmitate diet (21% total fat, 47% is palmitate), and MCT diet (21% medium-chain triglycerides, no palmitate). We established that high-palmitate feeding for 12 weeks leads to 40% and 50% increases in ceramide and sphingomyelin, respectively, in cellular membranes. Concomitant with sphingolipid accumulation, we observed a 40% reduction in systolic contractile performance. To explore the relationship of increased sphingolipids with caveolins, we analyzed caveolin protein levels and intracellular localization in isolated cardiomyocytes. In normal cardiomyocytes, caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 co-localize at the plasma membrane and the T-tubule system. However, mice maintained on palmitate lost 80% of caveolin-3, mainly from the T-tubule system. Mice maintained on MCT diet had a 90% reduction in caveolin-1. These data show that caveolin isoforms are sensitive to the lipid environment. These data are further supported by similar findings in human cardiac tissue samples from non-obese, obese, non-obese cardiomyopathic, and obese cardiomyopathic patients. To further elucidate the contractile dysfunction associated with the loss of caveolin-3, we determined the localization of the ryanodine receptor and found lower expression and loss of the striated appearance of this protein. We suggest that palmitate-induced loss of caveolin-3 results in cardiac contractile dysfunction via a defect in calcium-induced calcium release."
https://openalex.org/W2107526208,"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is a recreational club drug with supposed neurotoxic effects selectively on the serotonin system. MDMA users consistently exhibit memory dysfunction but there is an ongoing debate if these deficits are induced mainly by alterations in the prefrontal or mediotemporal cortex, especially the hippocampus. Thus, we investigated the relation of verbal memory deficits with alterations of regional cerebral brain glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) in recreational MDMA users.Brain glucose metabolism in rest was assessed using 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG PET) in 19 male recreational users of MDMA and 19 male drug-naïve controls. (18)FDG PET data were correlated with memory performance assessed with a German version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.As previously shown, MDMA users showed significant impairment in verbal declarative memory performance. PET scans revealed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, bilateral thalamus, right hippocampus, right precuneus, right cerebellum, and pons (at the level of raphe nuclei) of MDMA users. Among MDMA users, learning and recall were positively correlated with rMRGlu predominantly in bilateral frontal and parietal brain regions, while recognition was additionally related to rMRGlu in the right mediotemporal and bihemispheric lateral temporal cortex. Moreover, cumulative lifetime dose of MDMA was negatively correlated with rMRGlu in the left dorsolateral and bilateral orbital and medial PFC, left inferior parietal and right lateral temporal cortex.Verbal learning and recall deficits of recreational MDMA users are correlated with glucose hypometabolism in prefrontal and parietal cortex, while word recognition was additionally correlated with mediotemporal hypometabolism. We conclude that memory deficits of MDMA users arise from combined fronto-parieto-mediotemporal dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2076931556,"The function of Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) in the regulation of metabolic pathways is conserved from flies to human. Alterations in KLF11 function result in maturity onset diabetes of the young 7 (MODY7) and neonatal diabetes; however, the mechanisms underlying the role of this protein in metabolic disorders remain unclear. Here, we investigated how the A347S genetic variant, present in MODY7 patients, modulates KLF11 transcriptional activity. A347S affects a previously identified transcriptional regulatory domain 3 (TRD3) for which co-regulators remain unknown. Structure-oriented sequence analyses described here predicted that the KLF11 TRD3 represents an evolutionarily conserved protein domain. Combined yeast two-hybrid and protein array experiments demonstrated that the TRD3 binds WD40, WWI, WWII, and SH3 domain-containing proteins. Using one of these proteins as a model, guanine nucleotide-binding protein β2 (Gβ2), we investigated the functional consequences of KLF11 coupling to a TRD3 binding partner. Combined immunoprecipitation and biomolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that activation of three different metabolic G protein-coupled receptors (β-adrenergic, secretin, and cholecystokinin) induces translocation of Gβ2 to the nucleus where it directly binds KLF11 in a manner that is disrupted by the MODY7 A347S variant. Using genome-wide expression profiles, we identified metabolic gene networks impacted upon TRD3 disruption. Furthermore, A347S disrupted KLF11-mediated increases in basal insulin levels and promoter activity and blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thus, this study characterizes a novel protein/protein interaction domain disrupted in a KLF gene variant that associates to MODY7, contributing to our understanding of gene regulation events in complex metabolic diseases.Background: Most genetic alterations in MODY affect transcription factors.Results: We functionally characterize a conserved domain in KLF11, which is disrupted in MODY7 patients.Conclusion: Defects in KLF11 not only affect insulin biosynthesis but also diabetes-associated metabolic gene networks.Significance: Disruption of this KLF11 regulatory domain as in MODY7 has wider effects on β cell gene expression than anticipated, helping to clarify disease mechanisms.

Thus, the medical significance of this knowledge led us to study how alterations in KLF11 proteins impact the regulation of metabolic gene networks of relevance to gain a better understanding of complex human diseases.

The following study was designed to further our mechanistic understanding of how disease-associated alterations affect the membrane-to-nucleus coupling of KLF11 to the regulation of metabolic genes. Contrary to the variants in KLF11 DNA binding sites, which have the power to uncouple a single gene promoter (e.g. c.-331 INS variants) (5Bonnefond A. Lomberk G. Buttar N. Busiah K. Vaillant E.

Interestingly, variants that fall near the Sin3a domain alter the ability of KLF11 to regulate metabolic target genes and associate with MODY7 (6Neve B. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Ashkenazi-Katalan V.

However, the mechanisms and function of other KLF11 mutations that associate with diseases remain to be characterized. Thus, studying these types of alterations can aid in better defining the identities of KLF11-mediated metabolic gene networks, the mechanisms of their regulation, and the mechanisms that inactivate these pathways in humans. The KLF11 A347S variant found in MODY7 diabetic patients (6Neve B. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Ashkenazi-Katalan V. Dina C. Hamid Y.H. Joly E. Vaillant E. Benmezroua Y. Durand E. Bakaher N. Delannoy V.

In the current study, we demonstrate that the KLF11 TRD3 functions as a novel protein/protein interaction domain and that its function is altered in the A347S diabetes variant. We further show that activation of cell surface receptors involved in metabolism (β-adrenergic, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors) can induce the translocation of a TRD3-binding protein (Gβ2) to the nucleus where it binds KLF11 to regulate metabolic gene targets. Combined, these studies reveal the existence of a novel KLF-mediated pathway for coupling extracellular signals to the regulation of gene expression related to metabolism and diabetes. These findings extend our understanding of transcriptional regulatory events that are disrupted in human metabolic diseases.

QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis was performed as suggested by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). All constructs were verified by sequencing at the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility. Epitope-tagged (His6 XpressTM) KLF11 and KLF11 A347S variant as well as empty vector (Ad5CMV) were generated as recombinant adenovirus in collaboration with the Gene Transfer Vector Core at the University of Iowa.

To identify putative evolutionarily conserved domains, the N termini prior to the conserved zinc finger regions of cabut (Drosophila) and KLF1–17 (Homo sapiens) were analyzed using a sliding window of 15 amino acids. Windows were scored for overall hydrophobicity using the Kyte-Doolittle scale (20Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol.

Regions were screened via pairwise alignment with KLF10 and KLF11 for R1 and R2 domains to determine the N-terminal boundary. Pairwise alignments were performed using the Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation Program (MUSCLE) (22Edgar R.C. MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30224) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using Geneious Tree Maker (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) with the following settings: BLOSUM62 matrix, global alignment with free gap ends, and outgroup set to cabut. As bait, the coding region of the KLF11 TRD3 (amino acids 273–351) was cloned into the pGBKT7 plasmid of the Matchmaker system (Clontech). The integrity and expression of the fusion construct were confirmed by sequencing. No autoactivation of the reporters was associated with this bait construct as determined by cotransformation of the bait with prey library vector in host AH109 cells. Sequential library scale transformations were performed from a normal bone marrow cDNA library. A total of 2.5 million clones were screened and selected on high stringency plates (Synthetic Defined medium/−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp) coated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation for a period of 72–96 h at 30 °C, colonies were recovered, and DNA from each colony was extracted and sequenced. The cDNA inserts from yeast clones were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGA-3′ (reverse) and sequenced at the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. To eliminate false positives, isolated library prey plasmids were transformed into Y187 yeast and crossed with AH109 yeast carrying either the empty plasmid or the bait plasmid; activation of the reporter gene was assessed by growth in Synthetic Defined medium/−Trp/−Leu/−His plus 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. To screen for binding between the KLF11 TRD3 and SH3 or WW domain-containing proteins, solid phase SH3 and WW domain arrays were obtained from Panomics (Fremont, CA) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions utilizing 10–20 μg/ml purified His-KLF11 TRD3 (amino acids 273–351) for hybridization. CHO-CCKAR cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged or His-tagged Gβ2 and KLF11 expression constructs. The fluorescence was imaged using an LSM510 microscope (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany).

https://openalex.org/W2083467568,"Recent discoveries of early bony fishes from the Silurian and earliest Devonian of South China (e.g. Psarolepis, Achoania, Meemannia, Styloichthys and Guiyu) have been crucial in understanding the origin and early diversification of the osteichthyans (bony fishes and tetrapods). All these early fishes, except Guiyu, have their dermal skeletal surface punctured by relatively large pore openings. However, among these early fishes little is known about scale morphology and dermal skeletal histology. Here we report new data about the scales and dermal skeletal histology of Psarolepis romeri, a taxon with important implications for studying the phylogeny of early gnathostomes and early osteichthyans. Seven subtypes of rhombic scales with similar histological composition and surface sculpture are referred to Psarolepis romeri. They are generally thick and show a faint antero-dorsal process and a broad peg-and-socket structure. In contrast to previously reported rhombic scales of osteichthyans, these scales bear a neck between crown and base as in acanthodian scales. Histologically, the crown is composed of several generations of odontodes and an irregular canal system connecting cylindrical pore cavities. Younger odontodes are deposited on older ones both superpositionally and areally. The bony tissues forming the keel of the scale are shown to be lamellar bone with plywood-like structure, whereas the other parts of the base are composed of pseudo-lamellar bone with parallel collagen fibers. The unique tissue combination in the keel (i.e., extrinsic Sharpey's fibers orthogonal to the intrinsic orthogonal sets of collagen fibers) has rarely been reported in the keel of other rhombic scales. The new data provide insights into the early evolution of rhombic (ganoid and cosmoid) scales in osteichthyans, and add to our knowledge of hard tissues of early vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2093060269,"Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) is a key enzyme in the metabolism and termination of action of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, derivatives of arachidonic acid, which are protective against ischemic stroke. Mice lacking sEH globally are protected from injury following stroke; however, little is known about the role of endothelial sEH in brain ischemia. We generated transgenic mice with endothelial-specific expression of human sEH (Tie2-hsEH), and assessed the effect of transgenic overexpression of endothelial sEH on endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity and ischemic injury following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Compared to wild-type, male Tie2-hsEH mice exhibited impaired vasodilation in response to stimulation with 1 µM acetylcholine as assessed by laser-Doppler perfusion monitoring in an in-vivo cranial window preparation. No difference in infarct size was observed between wild-type and Tie2-hsEH male mice. In females, however, Tie2-hsEH mice sustained larger infarcts in striatum, but not cortex, compared to wild-type mice. Sex difference in ischemic injury was maintained in the cortex of Tie2-hsEH mice. In the striatum, expression of Tie2-hsEH resulted in a sex difference, with larger infarct in females than males. These findings demonstrate that transgenic expression of sEH in endothelium results in impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the cerebral circulation, and that females are more susceptible to enhanced ischemic damage as a result of increased endothelial sEH than males, especially in end-arteriolar striatal region."
https://openalex.org/W2085819580,"To localize the neural generators of the musically elicited mismatch negativity with high temporal resolution we conducted a beamformer analysis (Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry, SAM) on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from a previous musical mismatch study. The stimuli consisted of a six-tone melodic sequence comprising broken chords in C- and G-major. The musical sequence was presented within an oddball paradigm in which the last tone was lowered occasionally (20%) by a minor third. The beamforming analysis revealed significant right hemispheric neural activation in the superior temporal (STC), inferior frontal (IFC), superior frontal (SFC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) cortices within a time window of 100-200 ms after the occurrence of a deviant tone. IFC and SFC activation was also observed in the left hemisphere. The pronounced early right inferior frontal activation of the auditory mismatch negativity has not been shown in MEG studies so far. The activation in STC and IFC is consistent with earlier electroencephalography (EEG), optical imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that reveal the auditory and inferior frontal cortices as main generators of the auditory MMN. The observed right hemispheric IFC is also in line with some previous music studies showing similar activation patterns after harmonic syntactic violations. The results demonstrate that a deviant tone within a musical sequence recruits immediately a distributed neural network in frontal and prefrontal areas suggesting that top-down processes are involved when expectation violation occurs within well-known stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2012329539,"Among Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CoNS), Staphylococcus hominis represents the third most common organism recoverable from the blood of immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to characterize biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, define the SCCmec (Staphylococcal Chromosomal Cassette mec) type, and genetic relatedness of clinical S. hominis isolates.S. hominis blood isolates (n = 21) were screened for biofilm formation using crystal violet staining. Methicillin resistance was evaluated using the cefoxitin disk test and the mecA gene was detected by PCR. Antibiotic resistance was determined by the broth microdilution method. Genetic relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and SCCmec typed by multiplex PCR using two different methodologies described for Staphylococcus aureus.Of the S. hominis isolates screened, 47.6% (10/21) were categorized as strong biofilm producers and 23.8% (5/21) as weak producers. Furthermore, 81% (17/21) of the isolates were methicillin resistant and mecA gene carriers. Resistance to ampicillin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim was observed in >70% of isolates screened. Each isolate showed a different PFGE macrorestriction pattern with similarity ranging between 0-95%. Among mecA-positive isolates, 14 (82%) harbored a non-typeable SCCmec type: eight isolates were not positive for any ccr complex; four contained the mec complex A ccrAB1 and ccrC, one isolate contained mec complex A, ccrAB4 and ccrC, and one isolate contained the mec complex A, ccrAB1, ccrAB4, and ccrC. Two isolates harbored the association: mec complex A and ccrAB1. Only one strain was typeable as SCCmec III.The S. hominis isolates analyzed were variable biofilm producers had a high prevalence of methicillin resistance and resistance to other antibiotics, and high genetic diversity. The results of this study strongly suggested that S. hominis isolates harbor new SCCmec structural elements and might be reservoirs of ccrC1 in addition to ccrAB1 and mec complex A."
https://openalex.org/W1991537678,"Cell-free biosystems comprised of synthetic enzymatic pathways would be a promising biomanufacturing platform due to several advantages, such as high product yield, fast reaction rate, easy control and access, and so on. However, it was essential to produce (purified) enzymes at low costs and stabilize them for a long time so to decrease biocatalyst costs. We studied the stability of the four recombinant enzyme mixtures, all of which originated from thermophilic microorganisms: triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Thermus thermophiles, fructose bisphosphate aldolase (ALD) from Thermotoga maritima, fructose bisphosphatase (FBP) from T. maritima, and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) from Clostridium thermocellum. It was found that TIM and ALD were very stable at evaluated temperature so that they were purified by heat precipitation followed by gradient ammonia sulfate precipitation. In contrast, PGI was not stable enough for heat treatment. In addition, the stability of a low concentration PGI was enhanced by more than 25 times in the presence of 20 mg/L bovine serum albumin or the other three enzymes. At a practical enzyme loading of 1000 U/L for each enzyme, the half-life time of free PGI was prolong to 433 h in the presence of the other three enzymes, resulting in a great increase in the total turn-over number of PGI to 6.2×10(9) mole of product per mole of enzyme. This study clearly suggested that the presence of other proteins had a strong synergetic effect on the stabilization of the thermolabile enzyme PGI due to in vitro macromolecular crowding effect. Also, this result could be used to explain why not all enzymes isolated from thermophilic microorganisms are stable in vitro because of a lack of the macromolecular crowding environment."
https://openalex.org/W2142998338,"A number of studies have shown that the production of chemical defences is costly in terrestrial vascular plants. However, these studies do not necessarily reflect the costs of defence production in macroalgae, due to structural and functional differences between vascular plants and macroalgae. Using a specific culturing technique, we experimentally manipulated the defence production in the red alga Bonnemaisonia hamifera to examine if the defence is costly in terms of growth. Furthermore, we tested if the defence provides fitness benefits by reducing harmful bacterial colonisation of the alga. Costly defences should provide benefits to the producer in order to be maintained in natural populations, but such benefits through protection against harmful bacterial colonisation have rarely been documented in macroalgae. We found that algae with experimentally impaired defence production, but with an externally controlled epibacterial load, grew significantly better than algae with normal defence production. We also found that undefended algae exposed to a natural epibacterial load experienced a substantial reduction in growth and a 6-fold increase in cell bleaching, compared to controls. Thus, this study provides experimental evidence that chemical defence production in macroalgae is costly, but that the cost is outweighed by fitness benefits provided through protection against harmful bacterial colonisation."
https://openalex.org/W1969336600,"The population dynamics of shark species are generally poorly described because highly mobile marine life is challenging to investigate. Here we investigate the genetic population structure of the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in French Polynesia. Five demes were sampled from five islands with different inter-island distances (50-1500 km). Whether dispersal occurs between islands frequently enough to prevent moderate genetic structure is unknown. We used 11 microsatellites loci from 165 individuals and a strong genetic structure was found among demes with both F-statistics and Bayesian approaches. This differentiation is correlated with the geographic distance between islands. It is likely that the genetic structure seen is the result of all or some combination of the following: low gene flow, time since divergence, small effective population sizes, and the standard issues with the extent to which mutation models actually fit reality. We suggest low levels of gene flow as at least a partial explanation of the level of genetic structure seen among the sampled blacktip demes. This explanation is consistent with the ecological traits of blacktip reef sharks, and that the suitable habitat for blacktips in French Polynesia is highly fragmented. Evidence for spatial genetic structure of the blacktip demes we studied highlights that similar species may have populations with as yet undetected or underestimated structure. Shark biology and the market for their fins make them highly vulnerable and many species are in rapid decline. Our results add weight to the case that total bans on shark fishing are a better conservation approach for sharks than marine protected area networks."
https://openalex.org/W2002490710,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is one of the most prevalent and medically important tick-borne arboviruses in Eurasia. There are overlapping foci of two flaviviruses: TBEV and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) in Russia. Inactivated vaccines exist only against TBE. There are no antiviral drugs for treatment of both diseases. Optimal animal models are necessary to study efficacy of novel vaccines and treatment preparations against TBE and relative flaviviruses. The models for TBE and OHF using subcutaneous inoculation were tested in Cercopithecus aethiops and Macaca fascicularis monkeys with or without prior immunization with inactivated TBE vaccine. No visible clinical signs or severe pathomorphological lesions were observed in any monkey infected with TBEV or OHFV. C. aethiops challenged with OHFV showed massive hemolytic syndrome and thrombocytopenia. Infectious virus or viral RNA was revealed in visceral organs and CNS of C. aethiops infected with both viruses; however, viremia was low. Inactivated TBE vaccines induced high antibody titers against both viruses and expressed booster after challenge. The protective efficacy against TBE was shown by the absence of virus in spleen, lymph nodes and CNS of immunized animals after challenge. Despite the absence of expressed hemolytic syndrome in immunized C. aethiops TBE vaccine did not prevent the reproduction of OHFV in CNS and visceral organs. Subcutaneous inoculation of M. fascicularis with two TBEV strains led to a febrile disease with well expressed viremia, fever, and virus reproduction in spleen, lymph nodes and CNS. The optimal terms for estimation of the viral titers in CNS were defined as 8–16 days post infection. We characterized two animal models similar to humans in their susceptibility to tick-borne flaviviruses and found the most optimal scheme for evaluation of efficacy of preventive and therapeutic preparations. We also identified M. fascicularis to be more susceptible to TBEV than C. aethiops."
https://openalex.org/W1993151304,"Although the contribution of carbohydrate catabolism to bacterial colonization and infection is well recognized, the transcriptional changes during these processes are still unknown. In this study, we have performed comparative global gene expression analysis of GBS in sugar-free versus high glucose milieu. The analysis revealed a differential expression of genes involved in metabolism, transport and host-pathogen interaction. Many of them appeared to be among the genes previously reported to be controlled by the CovRS two-component system. Indeed, the transcription profile of a ΔcovRS strain grown in high-glucose conditions was profoundly affected. In particular, of the total genes described to be regulated by glucose, ∼27% were under CovRS control with a functional role in protein synthesis, transport, energy metabolism and regulation. Among the CovRS dependent genes, we found bibA, a recently characterized adhesin involved in bacterial serum resistance and here reported to be down-regulated by glucose. ChIP analysis revealed that in the presence of glucose, CovR binds bibA promoter in vivo, suggesting that CovR may act as a negative regulator or a repressor. We also demonstrated that, as for other target promoters, chemical phosphorylation of CovR in aspartic acid increases its affinity for the bibA promoter region. The data reported in this study contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms modulating the adaptation of GBS to glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2074962990,"The last step in the biosynthetic route to the key strawberry flavor compound 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF) is catalyzed by Fragaria x ananassa enone oxidoreductase (FaEO), earlier putatively assigned as quinone oxidoreductase (FaQR). The ripening-induced enzyme catalyzes the reduction of the exocyclic double bond of the highly reactive precursor 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-2-methylene-3(2H)-furanone (HMMF) in a NAD(P)H-dependent manner. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this peculiar reaction, we determined the crystal structure of FaEO in six different states or complexes at resolutions of ≤1.6 Å, including those with HDMF as well as three distinct substrate analogs. Our crystallographic analysis revealed a monomeric enzyme whose active site is largely determined by the bound NAD(P)H cofactor, which is embedded in a Rossmann-fold. Considering that the quasi-symmetric enolic reaction product HDMF is prone to extensive tautomerization, whereas its precursor HMMF is chemically labile in aqueous solution, we used the asymmetric and more stable surrogate product 2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (EHMF) and the corresponding substrate (2E)-ethylidene-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (EDHMF) to study their enzyme complexes as well. Together with deuterium-labeling experiments of EDHMF reduction by [4R-(2)H]NADH and chiral-phase analysis of the reaction product EHMF, our data show that the 4R-hydride of NAD(P)H is transferred to the unsaturated exocyclic C6 carbon of HMMF, resulting in a cyclic achiral enolate intermediate that subsequently becomes protonated, eventually leading to HDMF. Apart from elucidating this important reaction of the plant secondary metabolism our study provides a foundation for protein engineering of enone oxidoreductases and their application in biocatalytic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2047693906,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling has been implicated in mediating inhibitory odorant input to mammalian olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). To better understand the breadth of such inhibition in odor coding, we screened a panel of odorants representing different chemical classes, as well as odorants known to occur in a natural odor object (tomato), for their ability to rapidly activate PI3K-dependent inhibitory signaling. Odorants were screened on dissociated native rat ORNs before and after pre-incubation with the PI3K-isoform specific blockers AS252424 and TGX221. Many different odorants increased their excitatory strength for particular ORNs following PI3K blockade in a manner consistent with activating PI3K-dependent inhibitory signaling in those cells. The PI3K-dependent inhibitory odorants overlapped with conventional excitatory odorants, but did not share the same bias, indicating partial partitioning of the odor space. Finding that PI3K-dependent inhibition can be activated by a wide range of otherwise conventional excitatory odorants strongly implies PI3K-dependent inhibition provides a broad basis for opponent coding in mammalian ORNs."

SSADHs are ubiquitous in a wide range of organisms, including humans, bacteria, plants, and mammals. In eukaryotes, mitochondrial SSADH plays a crucial role in the γ-aminobutyrate shunt (1Fait A.

Mutation-induced malfunction or a deficiency in SSADH activity has been attributed to an uncommon and heritable neuropharmacological disorder in humans (3Malaspina P. Picklo M.J. Jakobs C. Snead O.C.

Similar to the role of human and plant SSADH in secondary metabolism, bacterial SSADH plays an important role in carbon and nitrogen metabolism (6Schneider B.L. Reitzer L. Pathway and enzyme redundancy in putrescine catabolism in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, SSADH was recognized to play a novel role in the primary metabolic pathway of cyanobacteria. The TCA cycle in cyanobacteria has long been considered incomplete, mainly due to a lack of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA (7Steinhauser D. Fernie A.R. Araújo W.L. Unusual cyanobacterial TCA cycles. Not broken just different.Trends Plant Sci. 2012; 17: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the recent identification of two different genes for 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase and SSADH from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 indicates that the TCA cycle in Synechococcus bypasses the production of succinyl-CoA and produces succinate from 2-oxoglutarate via SSA using these two enzymes (8Zhang S. Bryant D.A. The tricarboxylic acid cycle in cyanobacteria.Science. 2011; 334: 1551-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, cyanobacterial 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase and SSADH act as members of the TCA cycle by replacing 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase. SSADH belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily (9Kirch H.H. Bartels D. Wei Y. Schnable P.S. Wood A.J.

These investigations highlighted a redox-dependent regulation of SSADH activity. Human SSADH (HsSSADH) contains a catalytic loop with two cysteine residues (2-Cys SSADH), including the catalytic cysteine (Fig. 1C), which form a reversible disulfide bridge in response to redox conditions. As a result, the loop undergoes a large conformational transition between a functionally active open form in the reduced state and a catalytically inactive, closed form in the oxidized state (11Kim Y.G.

Given the redox-dependent regulation of HsSSADH, the oxidation-resistant catalytic features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis SSADH (14de Carvalho L.P. Ling Y. Shen C. Warren J.D. Rhee K.Y.

Plant succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Cloning, purification, localization in mitochondria, and regulation by adenine nucleotides.Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the regulation of SSADH activity is much more complex than initially thought. The different regulatory mechanisms by which these enzymes are controlled remain to be resolved. In particular, a general catalytic mechanism analogous to that of the ALDH family has long been considered (Fig. 1A) (16Muñoz-Clares R.A. González-Segura L. Díaz-Sánchez A.G.

Briefly, a catalytic cysteine carries out a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of an incoming SSA, forming a thiohemiacetal intermediate. A thioester intermediate is then formed after a hydride transfer from the proposed intermediate to NAD(P)+. Subsequently, a water molecule activated by a general base carries out a deacylation to produce succinate as a product. Here, we determined the crystal structure of cyanobacterial SSADH from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (SySSADH) together with a functional analysis. SySSADH is an NADP+-dependent enzyme (8Zhang S. Bryant D.A. The tricarboxylic acid cycle in cyanobacteria.Science. 2011; 334: 1551-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and differs from HsSSADH and EcSSADH in that it contains only one cysteine in the catalytic loop (1-Cys SSADH) that acts as the catalytic residue (Fig. 1C). Three different structures of SySSADH were determined, including a 1.7 Å resolution apo structure, a 1.4 Å resolution binary complex with NADP+, and a 1.4 Å resolution ternary complex with SSA and NADPH. Unexpectedly, a covalent adduct of NADP+ was discovered with the catalytic cysteine in the binary complex as well as the proposed thiohemiacetal intermediate in the ternary complex, with different conformations of the cofactor in each complex. These results along with kinetic and functional analyses provide molecular insights into the cofactor-dependent oxidation protection and mechanistic features of SySSADH. The gene for SySSADH (GenBankTM accession number NC010475.1) (8Zhang S. Bryant D.A. The tricarboxylic acid cycle in cyanobacteria.Science. 2011; 334: 1551-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was synthesized from Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea) with codon optimization for expression in E. coli. The resulting DNA was restricted by NdeI and XhoI enzymes and subcloned into a modified pET-28a vector (Merck) containing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site between the His5 tag and a multiple cloning site. For structural studies, seleno-l-methionine-substituted, N-terminal His-tagged SySSADH (residues Met-1 to Lys-454) was expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3) methionine auxotroph cells (Merck). Cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium supplemented with seleno-l-methionine to an A600 of 0.7. The cells were then induced for 16 h at 20 °C by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and sonicated in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The enzyme was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. After the purified SySSADH was dialyzed against buffer A, the N-terminal His tag was removed by treatment with tobacco etch virus protease for 16 h at 22 °C. SySSADH was then further purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was concentrated to 13 mg ml−1 based on its molar extinction coefficient of 40,910 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. The apo form of seleno-l-methionine-SySSADH was crystallized at 22 °C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method in a crystallization buffer of 0.05 m potassium phosphate monobasic, 20% (w/v) PEG8000, and 2 mm CaCl2. Formation of the SySSADH-ligand complex either with NADP+ for the binary complex or NADPH and SSA for the ternary complex was achieved by soaking the crystal with the cofactor and/or substrate. For the binary complex with NADP+, a pre-grown crystal of SySSADH was soaked for 60 min in a solution of 0.05 m potassium phosphate monobasic, 20% (w/v) PEG8000, 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 50 mm NADPH. An additional 50 mm SSA was included in the soaking solution for the ternary complex. In both experiments, ethylene glycol was used as a cryoprotectant. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data for the apo form of seleno-l-methionine-SySSADH were collected to a resolution of 1.7 Å on beamline 7A of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea). Single-wavelength diffraction data to a resolution of 1.4 Å were collected on beamline 5C at the same facility for the binary and the ternary complexes. All data were collected at 100 K and processed using the program HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the space group P212121, with two monomers per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The structure of SySSADH in its apo form was determined by molecular replacement after failing to locate selenium atoms using single- and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data. The program PHENIX with an AUTOMR option (19Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W.

Manual model building and refinement were performed using the programs COOT (20Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17075) Google Scholar) and PHENIX, respectively. After several iterative cycles of manual inspection and refinement, the model was built including Ile-3 to Lys-454 for each monomer. The refined apo form was then used as an initial model to solve the structures of the binary and ternary complexes. Structural refinements were performed including a rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing and TLS refinement. At the final refinement stage, water molecules, whose refined temperature factors were less than 50 Å2, were assigned based on possible hydrogen bonds to the enzyme or other nearby water molecules. Details regarding data and structural refinement are described in Table 1. Structural comparisons and analyses were carried out using the CCP4 suite program (21Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D.

All enzymes, including the WT enzyme, were expressed in Luria-Bertani medium using the procedures described above, with the exception of using E. coli BL21(DE3) strain as an expression host (Agilent Technologies). The N-terminal His-tagged enzymes were purified in the absence of DTT using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6). Enzyme assays for the steady-state kinetics were performed at 30 °C using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Jasco). Our standard assay solution contained 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm DTT, 10 mm CaCl2, and 15 μg (153 nm) of SySSADH enzyme. With the addition of 2.5 mm NADP+, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 200 μm SSA. Initial velocity was determined by measuring the linear increase in absorbance at 340 nm for the first 30s and calculated as the NADPH concentration produced per min. The molar extinction coefficient of NADPH at 340 nm was 6220 m−1 cm−1. Km and Vmax values for NADP+ were calculated using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). To characterize the functional role of the cofactor-cysteine adduct in response to oxidation, we measured the dehydrogenase activity of SySSADH under various levels of H2O2-dependent oxidative stress. To rule out the possible contribution of the reducing agent DTT in this assay, purification of SySSADH was carried out in the absence of DTT as described under “Dehydrogenase activity assays” (above), and its activity was measured using DTT-free standard assay solution unless otherwise specified. EcSSADH (12Ahn J.W. Kim Y.G. Kim K.J. Crystal structure of non-redox regulated SSADH from Escherichia coli.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

SySSADH is a dimeric protein in solution as characterized by size-exclusion chromatography. Consistent with this observation, no higher oligomerization states were evident from the crystallographic symmetry of the P212121 space group. Therefore, the two monomers in an asymmetric unit represent the functional unit of the dimer and are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry with a root mean square deviation of 0.10 Å for 452 Cα atoms from Ile-3 to Lys-454. The overall structure of monomeric SySSADH is reminiscent of an ALDH fold (22Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. The genetic component of ethanol aversion.Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and similar to the structures of HsSSADH (11Kim Y.G. Lee S.

Structural insights into NADP+/enzyme interactions.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9280Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is made up of three segments: α/β-fold N- and C-domains for a cofactor binding and a catalytic domain, respectively, and three antiparallel β-strands constituting a dimerization domain (Fig. 1, B and C). Specifically, the N-domain (residues 3–103, 121–230, and 420–444) contains a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β5–β9) sandwiched between three helices (α1, α6, α7) on one side and four helices (α2, α3, α4, α5) on the other side. The seven-stranded parallel β-sheet (β10–β16) in the C-domain (residues 231–419) is flanked by three helices (α10–α12) and two helices (α8, α9). Juxtaposition of the N- and C-domains generates an active site tunnel between the two domains that is accessible from both ends. The catalytic residues are located in the middle of the tunnel. A nucleophile Cys-262 is located in the catalytic loop between α8 and β11 of the C-domain, and a general base Glu-228 is located in an interdomain-connecting loop between β9 and β10. Dimerization is mediated largely by N-domain α7 and the three antiparallel β-strands (β3, β4, β17) protruding from the N- and C-domains, resulting in a total of 2313 Å2 for the buried surface area. In addition to these structural features, which are also observed in other SSADHs, we identified the binding sites of a phosphate ion and ethylene glycol near the entrance of the tunnel. These sites act as a binding site for cofactor (see below). Specifically, the phosphate ion from the crystallization buffer is located at the N terminus of α6 and the C terminus of β6 in the N-domain. The hydroxyl group and the main chain nitrogen atom of Ser-157 and the side chain amino group of Lys-154 form possible hydrogen bonds within 3.0 Å of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate ion. In addition to these contacts, the positive helix dipole at the N terminus of α6 likely stabilizes the binding of the phosphate ion. Structural analysis of the binary complex revealed a covalent linkage between the catalytic residue Cys-262 and the C4 atom on the nicotinamide ring of a cofactor (Fig. 2, A and B). Formation of this adduct occurred when NADP+, not NADPH, was present. This was true even when a crystal of SySSADH was soaked with NADPH. NADPH was later discovered to be spontaneously oxidized to NADP+ under these experimental conditions (data not shown). One molecule of the cofactor adduct with Cys-262 was clearly located in each subunit (Figs. 1B and 2A). Overall, the cofactor moiety in the adduct adopted an extended conformation, with the nicotinamide ring and its associated ribose being completely buried in the tunnel. The newly formed covalent linkage to the sulfur atom of Cys-262 was mediated with a pro-R face at C4 of the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 2B), resulting in an sp3 configuration at C4 of the nicotinamide ring, with bond angles of 108° and 109° for the C3-C4-S and C5-C4-S linkages, respectively. The carbonyl amide group of the ring interacts with the side chains of Arg-139 and Glu-228 within 3.3 Å (Fig. 2C). The position of ribose is stabilized by hydrogen bonds of 2.8 Å between Glu-359 and the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups and by possible hydrophobic interactions with Phe-361. The pyrophosphate group of the cofactor maintains only a few contacts with residues near the active site tunnel, forming hydrogen bonds with several water molecules and with the side chain nitrogen atom of Trp-130 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-207. In contrast, a ribose in the adenosine moiety is located near the entrance of the tunnel at a site enclosed by α6 and α7 in the N-domain. Specifically, the 2′-phosphate group in the ribose moiety occupies the binding site of the phosphate ion that was identified in the apo form. Almost identical binding modes were observed with Ser-157 and Lys-154. The 3′-hydroxyl group mediates a possible hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Met-128 and His-155. The adenine base is inserted into a concave, hydrophobic pocket formed between the α6 and α7 helices with its aromatic ring parallel to the helical axes of those two helices and surrounded by Ala-187 and Val-190 in α6 and Ala-210 and Leu-214 in α7. An additional binding site for ethylene glycol was also identified in the binary complex. It is located in the active site tunnel opposite the cofactor entrance and is located ∼4.0 Å from Cys-262 (data not shown). The presence of NADPH and SSA facilitated the formation of a ternary complex among SySSADH, the cofactor, and the substrate. Unlike in the binary complex, the cofactor remains as free NADPH, based on the sp3 configuration of the C4 atom in the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 3, A and B). SSA forms a covalent linkage with the catalytic residue Cys-262 (Fig. 3C), resulting in a tetrahedral, thiohemiacetal intermediate (Fig. 1A). NADPH in the ternary complex exhibits a bent conformation, with a large change in the dihedral angle of the pyrophosphate group. The nicotinamide moiety and its associated ribose is no longer in the active site tunnel but has moved away from the active site Cys-262 by about 5 Å toward the entrance of the tunnel, relative to its position in the binary complex. The nicotinamide ring, which is nearly at the position occupied by ribose in the binary complex, is further stabilized by possible stacking interactions with Phe-361. The carbonyl amide group of the nicotinamide ring interacts with nearby residues, including the side chains of Asn-131, Gln-136, and Glu-228 as well as the main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Glu-228 and Leu-229. Several interactions are associated with ribose in the nicotinamide moiety and pyrophosphate group. Glu-359 maintains its interaction with the 2′-hydroxyl group of ribose, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds are predominant with the pyrophosphate group. Moreover, the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of ribose replace the binding site of ethylene glycol that was conserved in both the apo form and the binary complex. Except for these alterations, the binding environment for the adenosine moiety is essentially identical with that of the binary complex. In the active site, the substrate SSA replaced the ethylene glycol that was identified in the binary complex. The bound SSA forms a covalent adduct with Cys-262 with angles of 109°, 119°, and 105° for the O-C4-S, O-C4-C3, and S-C4-C3 bonds, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). The SSA-cysteine adduct thus represents a thiohemiacetal intermediate in catalysis. The re-face of the trigonal C4 atom in SSA was subject to a nucleophilic attack by Cys-262 to produce an (R)-thiohemiacetal intermediate. The possible negative charge of the O4 atom in the intermediate can be neutralized by a hydrogen bond within 3.1 Å of the carbonyl amide group of NADPH and the side chain of Asn-131. The carboxyl group of SSA is within 3.0 Å of Trp-135, Arg-139, Ser-419, and several water molecules (Fig. 3D). In addition to these hydrophilic residues, the binding site is enclosed by hydrophobic residues including Phe-132, Ile-263, and Phe-425. No significant changes were noted (within a root mean square deviation of 0.10 Å for 452 Cα atoms) in the overall conformations of the three structures characterized in this study. Noticeable alterations occurring along the catalytic reaction were localized within the cofactor and active site residues. Specifically, different binding modes were observed for the cofactor in the binary and ternary complexes. These were associated with a 5 Å positional shift of the nicotinamide moiety along the tunnel and a change of 85° in the dihedral angle of C4-C5-O–PN (Fig. 4, A–C). The catalytic loop (Asn-257 to Lys-266), which contains the nucleophile Cys-262, remains in the same position in each of the three ligation states. However, signif"
https://openalex.org/W2037761339,"The physiological function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its two homologues APP-like protein 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2) is largely unknown. Previous work suggests that lack of APP or APLP2 impairs synaptic plasticity and spatial learning. There is, however, almost no data on the role of APP or APLP at the network level which forms a critical interface between cellular functions and behavior. We have therefore investigated memory-related synaptic and network functions in hippocampal slices from three lines of transgenic mice: APPsα-KI (mice expressing extracellular fragment of APP, corresponding to the secreted APPsα ectodomain), APLP2-KO, and combined APPsα-KI/APLP2-KO (APPsα-DM for ""double mutants""). We analyzed two prominent patterns of network activity, gamma oscillations and sharp-wave ripple complexes (SPW-R). Both patterns were generally preserved in all strains. We find, however, a significantly reduced frequency of gamma oscillations in CA3 of APLP2-KO mice in comparison to APPsα-KI and WT mice. Network activity, basic synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were unaltered in the combined mutants (APPsα-DM) which showed, however, reduced long-term potentiation (LTP). Together, our data indicate that APLP2 and the intracellular domain of APP are not essential for coherent activity patterns in the hippocampus, but have subtle effects on synaptic plasticity and fine-tuning of network oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2001377077,"Stopped-flow kinetic data were obtained for the iron-type nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus equi TG328-2 (ReNHase) using methacrylonitrile as the substrate. Multiple turnover experiments suggest a three-step kinetic model that allows for the reversible binding of substrate, the presence of an intermediate, and the formation of product. Microscopic rate constants determined from these data are in good agreement with steady state data confirming that the stopped-flow method used was appropriate for the reaction. Single turnover stopped-flow experiments were used to identify catalytic intermediates. These data were globally fit confirming a three-step kinetic model. Independent absorption spectra acquired between 0.005 and 0.5 s of the reaction reveal a significant increase in absorbance at 375, 460, and 550 nm along with the hypsochromic shift of an Fe(3+)←S ligand-to-metal charge transfer band from 700 to 650 nm. The observed UV-visible absorption bands for the Fe(3+)-nitrile intermediate species are similar to low spin Fe(3+)-enzyme and model complexes bound by NO or N3((-)). These data provide spectroscopic evidence for the direct coordination of the nitrile substrate to the nitrile hydratase active site low spin Fe(3+) center."
https://openalex.org/W2121193458,"Aims Controversy exists in regard to the beneficial effects of transplanting cardiac or somatic progenitor cells upon myocardial injury. We have therefore investigated the functional short- and long-term consequences after intramyocardial transplantation of these cell types in a murine lesion model. Methods and Results Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in mice (n = 75), followed by the intramyocardial injection of 1−2×105 luciferase- and GFP-expressing embryonic cardiomyocytes (eCMs), skeletal myoblasts (SMs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or medium into the infarct. Non-treated healthy mice (n = 6) served as controls. Bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging confirmed the engraftment and survival of the cells up to seven weeks postoperatively. After two weeks MRI was performed, which showed that infarct volume was significantly decreased by eCMs only (14.8±2.2% MI+eCM vs. 26.7±1.6% MI). Left ventricular dilation was significantly decreased by transplantation of any cell type, but most efficiently by eCMs. Moreover, eCM treatment increased the ejection fraction and cardiac output significantly to 33.4±2.2% and 22.3±1.2 ml/min. In addition, this cell type exclusively and significantly increased the end-systolic wall thickness in the infarct center and borders and raised the wall thickening in the infarct borders. Repetitive echocardiography examinations at later time points confirmed that these beneficial effects were accompanied by better survival rates. Conclusion Cellular cardiomyoplasty employing contractile and electrically coupling embryonic cardiomyocytes (eCMs) into ischemic myocardium provoked significantly smaller infarcts with less adverse remodeling and improved cardiac function and long-term survival compared to transplantation of somatic cells (SMs and MSCs), thereby proving that a cardiomyocyte phenotype is important to restore myocardial function."
https://openalex.org/W1973995060,"In regenerative medicine finding a new method for cell differentiation without pharmacological treatment or gene modification and minimal cell manipulation is a challenging goal. In this work we reported a neuronal induced differentiation and consequent reduction of tumorigenicity in NT2 human pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells exposed to an extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF), matching the cyclotron frequency corresponding to the charge/mass ratio of calcium ion (Ca(2+)-ICR). These cells, capable of differentiating into post-mitotic neurons following treatment with Retinoic Acid (RA), were placed in a solenoid and exposed for 5 weeks to Ca(2+)-ICR. The solenoid was installed in a μ-metal shielded room to avoid the effect of the geomagnetic field and obtained totally controlled and reproducible conditions. Contrast microscopy analysis reveled, in the NT2 exposed cells, an important change in shape and morphology with the outgrowth of neuritic-like structures together with a lower proliferation rate and metabolic activity alike those found in the RA treated cells. A significant up-regulation of early and late neuronal differentiation markers and a significant down-regulation of the transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and the fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4) were also observed in the exposed cells. The decreased protein expression of the transforming gene Cripto-1 and the reduced capability of the exposed NT2 cells to form colonies in soft agar supported these last results. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the Ca(2+)-ICR frequency is able to induce differentiation and reduction of tumorigenicity in NT2 exposed cells suggesting a new potential therapeutic use in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2038997077,"Biogenetic silica displays intricate patterns assembling from nano- to microsize level and interesting non-spherical structures differentiating in specific directions. Several model systems have been proposed to explain the formation of biosilica nanostructures. Of them, phase separation based on the physicochemical properties of organic amines was considered to be responsible for the pattern formation of biosilica. In this paper, using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Si(OCH2CH3)4) as silica precursor, phospholipid (PL) and dodecylamine (DA) were introduced to initiate phase separation of organic components and influence silica precipitation. Morphology, structure and composition of the mineralized products were characterized using a range of techniques including field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), infrared spectra (IR), and nitrogen physisorption. The results demonstrate that the phase separation process of the organic components leads to the formation of asymmetrically non-spherical silica structures, and the aspect ratios of the asymmetrical structures can be well controlled by varying the concentration of PL and DA. On the basis of the time-dependent experiments, a tentative mechanism is also proposed to illustrate the asymmetrical morphogenesis. Therefore, our results imply that in addition to explaining the hierarchical porous nanopatterning of biosilica, the phase separation process may also be responsible for the growth differentiation of siliceous structures in specific directions. Because organic amine (e.g., long-chair polyamines), phospholipids (e.g., silicalemma) and the phase separation process are associated with the biosilicification of diatoms, our results may provide a new insight into the mechanism of biosilicification."
https://openalex.org/W2051591778,"Dysregulation of the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein by γ-secretase and the ensuing generation of amyloid-β is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the identification of amyloid precursor protein binding proteins involved in regulating processing of amyloid precursor protein by the γ-secretase complex is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the molecular pathology of the disease. We identified calreticulin as novel amyloid precursor protein interaction partner that binds to the γ-secretase cleavage site within amyloid precursor protein and showed that this Ca2+- and N-glycan-independent interaction is mediated by amino acids 330–344 in the C-terminal C-domain of calreticulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that calreticulin is not only associated with amyloid precursor protein but also with the γ-secretase complex members presenilin and nicastrin. Calreticulin was detected at the cell surface by surface biotinylation of cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein and was co-localized by immunostaining with amyloid precursor protein and presenilin at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons. The P-domain of calreticulin located between the N-terminal N-domain and the C-domain interacts with presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex. The P- and C-domains also interact with nicastrin, another functionally important subunit of this complex. Transfection of amyloid precursor protein overexpressing cells with full-length calreticulin leads to a decrease in amyloid-β42 levels in culture supernatants, while transfection with the P-domain increases amyloid-β40 levels. Similarly, application of the recombinant P- or C-domains and of a synthetic calreticulin peptide comprising amino acid 330–344 to amyloid precursor protein overexpressing cells result in elevated amyloid-β40 and amyloid-β42 levels, respectively. These findings indicate that the interaction of calreticulin with amyloid precursor protein and the γ-secretase complex regulates the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein by the γ-secretase complex, pointing to calreticulin as a potential target for therapy in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1977082337,"Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal cysteine peptidase with diverse and highly specific functions. The involvement of CTSL in thymic CD4+ T-cell positive selection has been well documented. Using CTSLnkt/nkt mice that lack CTSL activity, we have previously demonstrated that the absence of CTSL activity affects the homeostasis of the T-cell pool by decreasing CD4+ cell thymic production and increasing CD8+ thymocyte production. Herein we investigated the influence of CTSL activity on the homeostasis of peripheral B-cell populations and bone marrow (BM) B-cell maturation. B-cell numbers were increased in lymph nodes (LN), spleen and blood from CTSLnkt/nkt mice. Increases in splenic B-cell numbers were restricted to transitional T1 and T2 cells and to the marginal zone (MZ) cell subpopulation. No alterations in the proliferative or apoptosis levels were detected in peripheral B-cell populations from CTSLnkt/nkt mice. In the BM, the percentage and the absolute number of pre-pro-B, pro-B, pre-B, immature and mature B cells were not altered. However, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that BM B-cell production was markedly increased in CTSLnkt/nkt mice. Besides, BM B-cell emigration to the spleen was increased in CTSLnkt/nkt mice. Colony-forming unit pre-B (CFU pre-B) assays in the presence of BM stromal cells (SC) and reciprocal BM chimeras revealed that both BM B-cell precursors and SC would contribute to sustain the increased B-cell hematopoiesis in CTSLnkt/nkt mice. Overall, our data clearly demonstrate that CTSL negatively regulates BM B-cell production and output therefore influencing the homeostasis of peripheral B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968661533,"Fructus Xanthii (FX) has been widely used as a traditional herbal medicine for rhinitis, headache, cold, etc. Modern pharmacological studies revealed that FX possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-hyperglycemic properties. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of FX on glucose and insulin tolerance, and hepatic lipid metabolism in rats fed on high-fat diet (HFD). Hepatic steatosis was induced by HFD feeding. Aqueous extraction fractions of FX or vehicle were orally administered by gavage for 6 weeks. Body weight and blood glucose were monitored. Glucose and insulin tolerance test were performed. Liver morphology was visualized by hematoxylin and eosin, and oil red O staining. Expression of liver lipogenic and lipolytic genes was measured by real-time PCR. We showed here that FX improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD rats. FX significantly decreased the expression of lipogenic genes and increased the expression of lipolytic genes, ameliorated lipid accumulation and decreased the total liver triglyceride (TG) content, and thus attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, FX improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, decreases lipogenesis and increases lipid oxidation in the liver of HFD rats, implying a potential application in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2083138901,"Bioengineering of vascular grafts holds great potential to address the shortcomings associated with autologous and conventional synthetic vascular grafts used for small diameter grafting procedures. Lumen endothelialization of bioengineered vascular grafts is essential to provide an antithrombogenic graft surface to ensure long-term patency after implantation. Conventional methods used to assess endothelialization in vitro typically involve periodic harvesting of the graft for histological sectioning and staining of the lumen. Endpoint testing methods such as these are effective but do not provide real-time information of endothelial cells in their intact microenvironment, rather only a single time point measurement of endothelium development. Therefore, nondestructive methods are needed to provide dynamic information of graft endothelialization and endothelium maturation in vitro. To address this need, we have developed a nondestructive fiber optic based (FOB) imaging method that is capable of dynamic assessment of graft endothelialization without disturbing the graft housed in a bioreactor. In this study we demonstrate the capability of the FOB imaging method to quantify electrospun vascular graft endothelialization, EC detachment, and apoptosis in a nondestructive manner. The electrospun scaffold fiber diameter of the graft lumen was systematically varied and the FOB imaging system was used to noninvasively quantify the affect of topography on graft endothelialization over a 7-day period. Additionally, results demonstrated that the FOB imaging method had a greater imaging penetration depth than that of two-photon microscopy. This imaging method is a powerful tool to optimize vascular grafts and bioreactor conditions in vitro, and can be further adapted to monitor endothelium maturation and response to fluid flow bioreactor preconditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2090477869,"Although clinical experience suggests that patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to several types of infections, the overall scope of pneumonia in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) has received little attention.This was a prospective observational cohort study in CAPD patients in which prognostic risks of pneumonia were evaluated in DN and non-DN patients by Cox regression analysis. Hazard ratios of pneumonia events, all-cause and pneumonia-related mortality were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model for DN versus non-DN patients.A total of 1148 patients (58.6% male, 48.34±15.78 years) had a median follow-up of 23.8 months and a maximum follow-up of 72.0 months. The pneumonia incidence rate of 62.3/1,000 patient-years in CAPD patients with DN was significantly higher than that of 28.5/1,000 patient-years in non-DN patients. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of pneumonia occurrence in CAPD patients with DN were high body mass index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.31; P = 0.037) and low serum albumin level (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98; P = 0.014). Older age (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.35-1.96; P<0.001) was an independent risk factor for the presence of pneumonia in non-DN patients. CAPD patients with DN had higher pneumonia-related mortality (HR, 4.424; 95% CI, 1.871-10.461; P<0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR, 2.608; 95% CI, 1.890-3.599; P<0.001) hazards than their non-DN counterparts, even when extensive demographics, comorbidities, and lab adjustments were made.The pneumonia and all-cause mortality risks were strikingly higher in CAPD patients with DN than in non-DN counterparts, which may warrant further investigation and therapeutic care intensification."
https://openalex.org/W2086586523,"Background Haptocorrin (HC) carries cobalamin analogues (CorA), but whether CorA are produced in the body is unknown. All cobalamins (Cbl) to the foetus are delivered by the Cbl-specific protein transcobalamin (TC), and therefore analysis of cord serum for CorA may help to clarify the origin of CorA. Methods HC-CorA were quantified in paired samples of cord serum from newborns and serum from mothers (n = 69). Results The CorA-concentration was higher in cord serum (median = 380, range: 41–780 pmol/L) than in serum from the mothers (median = 160, range: 64–330 pmol/L), (p<0.0001). HPLC-analysis showed CorA-peaks with retention times of 13.5, 14,5 and 16.5 min in samples from both the mother and cord serum. The peak with retention time 16.5 min constituted 24% (mother) and 45% (cord serum) of the total amount CorA, and eluted as does dicyanocobinamide. Conclusion Our results support that CorA in the human body are derived from Cbl."
https://openalex.org/W2053006945,"Transepithelial potential (TEP) is the voltage across a polarized epithelium. In epithelia that have active transport functions, the force for transmembrane flux of an ion is dictated by the electrochemical gradient in which TEP plays an essential role. In epithelial injury, disruption of the epithelial barrier collapses the TEP at the wound edge, resulting in the establishment of an endogenous wound electric field (∼100 mV/mm) that is directed towards the center of the wound. This endogenous electric field is implicated to enhance wound healing by guiding cell migration. We thus seek techniques to enhance the TEP, which may increase the wound electric fields and enhance wound healing. We report a novel technique, termed synchronization modulation (SM) using a train of electric pulses to synchronize the Na/K pump activity, and then modulating the pumping cycles to increase the efficiency of the Na/K pumps. Kidney epithelial monolayers (MDCK cells) maintain a stable TEP and transepithelial resistance (TER). SM significantly increased TEP over four fold. Either ouabain or digoxin, which block Na/K pump, abolished SM-induced TEP increases. In addition to the pump activity, basolateral distribution of Na/K pumps is essential for an increase in TEP. Our study for the first time developed an electrical approach to significantly increase the TEP. This technique targeting the Na/K pump may be used to modulate TEP, and may have implication in wound healing and in diseases where TEP needs to be modulated."
https://openalex.org/W2023163630,"Earthquakes are the most violent type of natural disasters and injuries are the dominant medical problem in the early phases after earthquakes. However, likely because of poor data availability, high-quality research on injuries after earthquakes is lacking. Length of hospital stay (LOS) has been validated as a proxy indicator for injury severity in high-income settings and could potentially be used in retrospective research of injuries after earthquakes. In this study, we assessed LOS as an adequate proxy indicator for severe injury in trauma survivors of an earthquake.A retrospective analysis was conducted using a database of 1,878 injured patients from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Our primary outcome was severe injury, defined as a composite measure of serious injury or resource use. Secondary outcomes were serious injury and resource use, analysed separately. Non-parametric receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used to test the discriminatory accuracy of LOS when used to identify severe injury. An 0.7<AUC<0.8 was defined as adequate.Our study shows that LOS discriminatory accuracy is poor for the primary outcome. However, LOS discriminatory accuracy is adequate for resource use, excluding critical orthopaedic interventions and debridement.Length of hospital stay was not validated as a proxy indicator for severe injury in earthquake survivors. However, LOS was found to be a proxy for major nonorthopaedic surgery and blood transfusion. These findings can be useful for retrospective research on earthquake-injured patients when detailed hospital records are not available."
https://openalex.org/W1977553365,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are integrated as DNA proviruses in the genomes of all mammalian species. Several ERVs are replication-competent and produced as fully infectious viruses from host cell. Thus, live-attenuated vaccines and biological substances have been prepared using the cell lines which may produce ERV. Indeed, we recently reported that several commercial live-attenuated vaccines for pets were contaminated with the infectious feline endogenous retrovirus, RD-114. In this study, to establish a cell line for vaccine manufacture with reduced risk of ERVs, we generated a cell line stably expressing human tetherin (Teth-CRFK cells). The release of infectious ERV from Teth-CRFK cells was suppressed to undetectable levels, while the production of parvovirus in Teth-CRFK cells was similar to that in parental CRFK cells. These observations suggest that Teth-CRFK cells will be useful as a cell line for the manufacture of live-attenuated vaccines or biological substances with reduced risk of ERV."
https://openalex.org/W2058297116,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a sophisticated visual system and exhibits complex visual behaviors. Visual responses, vision processing and higher cognitive processes in Drosophila have been studied extensively. However, little is known about whether the retinal location of visual stimuli can affect fruit fly performance in various visual tasks. We tested the response of wild-type Berlin flies to visual stimuli at several vertical locations. Three paradigms were used in our study: visual operant conditioning, visual object fixation and optomotor response. We observed an acute zone for visual feature memorization in the upper visual field when visual patterns were presented with a black background. However, when a white background was used, the acute zone was in the lower visual field. Similar to visual feature memorization, the best locations for visual object fixation and optomotor response to a single moving stripe were in the lower visual field with a white background and the upper visual field with a black background. The preferred location for the optomotor response to moving gratings was around the equator of the visual field. Our results suggest that different visual processing pathways are involved in different visual tasks and that there is a certain degree of overlap between the pathways for visual feature memorization, visual object fixation and optomotor response."
