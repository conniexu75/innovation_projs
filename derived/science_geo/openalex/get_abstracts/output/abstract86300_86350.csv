https://openalex.org/W1995785876,"Thin vitrified layers of unfixed, unstained and unsupported virus suspensions can be prepared for observation by cryo-electron microscopy in easily controlled conditions. The viral particles appear free from the kind of damage caused by dehydration, freezing or adsorption to a support that is encountered in preparing biological samples for conventional electron microscopy. Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens offers possibilities for high resolution observations that compare favourably with any other electron microscopical method."
https://openalex.org/W2110582366,"As an alternative approach to classical genetic analysis, we are investigating the potential of anti-sense (nonsense) DNA strand transcription to inhibit gene activity. A promoter will direct transcription of the complementary nonsense DNA strand when the protein coding sequence of a cloned gene is excised and then reinserted in reverse orientation. When such flipped gene constructions of the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) gene are coinjected with the wild-type gene at a 100:1 ratio, there is a reduction of transient TK expression in TK- mouse L cells. The proportion of viable cells with demonstrable TK activity drops 4-fold as compared with neighboring cells coinjected with TK and an excess of control plasmid. Furthermore, autoradiography of the cells still expressing TK shows that 3H-thymidine incorporation is reduced. Cells contransformed with flipped TK gene constructions have a reduced capacity to express subsequently microinjected TK genes, suggesting that the anti-message phenomenon is due to a trans-inhibition of TK and is probably not an artifact of rearrangements following microinjection."
https://openalex.org/W1973964227,"Although the natural multicopy plasmid CoIE1 is maintained stably under most growth conditions, plasmid cloning vectors related to it are relatively unstable, being lost at frequencies of 10(-2)-10(-5) per cell per generation. Evidence suggests that CoIE1 and related plasmids are partitioned randomly at cell division and that plasmid stability is correlated inversely with plasmid multimerization; factors or conditions that reduce multimerization increase stability. Cells containing plasmid multimers segregate plasmid-free cells because the multimers are maintained at lower copy numbers than monomers, as predicted by origin-counting models for copy number control. CoIE1 is stable because it encodes a determinant, cer, that is necessary for recA-, recF-, and recE-independent recombination events that efficiently convert any multimers to monomers. We have localized monomerizing and stability determinants of CoIE1 to within a 0.38 kb region that, when cloned into plasmid vectors, greatly increases their stability."
https://openalex.org/W2147716555,"In order to identify determinants governing nuclear protein localization, we constructed a set of hybrid genes by fusing the S. cerevisiae gene, MAT alpha 2, coding for a presumptive nuclear protein, and the E. coli gene, lacZ, coding for beta-galactosidase. The resultant hybrid proteins contain 3, 13, 25, 67, or all 210 amino acids of wild-type alpha 2 protein at the amino terminus and a constant, enzymatically active portion of beta-galactosidase at the carboxy terminus. Indirect immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies with yeast cells containing the alpha 2-LacZ hybrid proteins indicate that the alpha 2 segment can direct localization of beta-galactosidase to the nucleus. A segment as small as 13 amino acids from alpha 2 is sufficient for this localization. Comparison of amino acid sequences of other nuclear proteins with this region of alpha 2 reveals a sequence that may be necessary for nuclear targeting. Production of some alpha 2-LacZ hybrid proteins causes cell death, perhaps as a result of improper or incomplete localization. These studies also indicate that the alpha 2 protein, argued on genetic grounds to be a negative regulator, acts in the yeast nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2060262597,"The herpes simplex viral DNA-binding protein, ICP8, is targeted to two different locations in the cell nucleus as part of its maturation pathway. Prior to viral DNA synthesis ICP8 was found at discrete pre-replicative sites throughout the nucleus, where it exhibited a high salt-labile association with the nuclear matrix. During viral DNA replication ICP8 was localized in randomly distributed replication compartments, where it is bound to viral DNA. Initiation of viral DNA replication caused the protein to move from the prereplicative sites to the replication compartments, while inhibition of replication caused movement in the opposite direction. In cells where viral DNA synthesis was proceeding, a minor population of ICP8 may also have been associated with the prereplicative sites. The prereplicative sites may serve as a nuclear reservoir for ICP8 not bound to replicating or progeny DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2031235671,"Biochemical investigation of receptors for neurotransmitters and drugs in the brain has been one of the most active areas of molecular neuroscience during the past decade. This work has permitted fundamental insights into how binding of neurotransmitters to their receptors excites or inhibits neuronal firing or changes cellular metabolism. The recognition of receptor subtypes has suggested subtle ways for neurotransmitters to modulate neuronal functioning. Finally, the ability to measure receptor sites in simple test tube systems and to distinguish readily between agonists and antagonists has provided useful probes for drug discovery programs."

https://openalex.org/W1529449066,"Cytochrome b558-d complex, a terminal oxidase in the respiratory chain of Escherichia coli K12 grown under the condition of limited oxygen, was purified to near homogeneity. The purified oxidase complex is composed of equimolar amounts of two polypeptides, with Mr = 26,000 and 51,000, determined with gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It contains 12.3 nmol of protoheme, 9.54 nmol of d, and 26.6 nmol of iron/mg of protein. The enzyme is a cytochrome bd-type which shows absorption peaks at 558 and 624 nm in the difference spectrum at 77 K. This oxidase combines with CO, and the Soret region of the CO difference spectrum at room temperature has a peak at 420 nm and troughs at 430 and 442 nm. The oxidation-reduction potentials of b558 and d at pH 7.4 were estimated to be +10 mV and +240 mV, respectively. The b558-d complex catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol-1, menadiol, and ascorbate in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. This oxidase activity was inhibited by the respiratory inhibitors piericidin A, KCN, and NaN3, but the b558-d complex was less sensitive to the inhibitors than the b562-o complex. The Km values for oxygen of purified b558-d complex and b562-o complex were determined to be 0.38 and 2.9 microM, respectively. Formation of a membrane potential by the reconstituted b558-d complex in liposomes was observed with the fluorescent dye 3,3'-dipropylthiocarbocyanine iodide on addition of ubiquinol-1. This is the first indication that there is a coupling site in the terminal oxidase, which contains d. Steady state kinetics of cytochromes in the membrane showed that these oxidase complexes branch at the site of ubiquinone-8 in the respiratory chain. From these and previous results, branched electron-carrying systems of the E. coli respiratory chain are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1971807649,"The secretory pattern of growth hormone (GH) differs between the sexes; in males it is more pulsatile than in females. Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that differences in the secretory rhythm of GH are responsible for sex-dependent liver functions of mice. Continuous delivery of GH was achieved either by introducing metallothionein-GH fusion genes into the germ line or by implanting minipumps. Pulsatile delivery of GH was mimicked by injection. The effects of these treatments on production of hepatic prolactin/GH receptors, albumin, and major urinary protein (MUP) were monitored. The results suggest that induction of MUP mRNA requires pulsatile occupancy of GH receptors, which is achieved naturally in males or by injection of GH, whereas chronic occupancy of GH receptors is inhibitory. In contrast, induction of prolactin/GH receptors requires chronic stimulation of GH receptors, which is approximated in normal female mice or results from increased GH levels in mice with foreign genes or undergoing infusions from mini-pumps."

https://openalex.org/W2029467634,"To study the mode of action of human cytomegalovirus, an important teratogenic agent in human populations, the susceptibility of a pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cell line to the virus was investigated. Viral antigens were not expressed nor was infectious virus produced by human embryonal carcinoma cells after infection, although the virus was able to penetrate these cells. In contrast, retinoic acid-induced differentiated derivatives of embryonal carcinoma cells were permissive for antigen expression and infectious virus production. Replication of human cytomegalovirus in human teratocarcinoma cells may therefore depend on cellular functions associated with differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1995745005,"Entamoeba histolytica was found to grow normally without producing glutathione and the main enzymes of glutathione metabolism, indicating that glutathione is not essential for many eukaryotic processes. This parasitic amoeba is an unusual eukaryote whose special features may help define the crucial functions of glutathione in those eukaryotes that do use it. Since Entamoeba histolytica lacks mitochondria and the usual aerobic respiratory pathways, the finding that it grows without glutathione and other evidence support the hypothesis that a primary function of glutathione in eukaryotes involves protection against oxygen toxicity associated with mitochondria and suggest that eukaryotes may have acquired glutathione metabolism at the time that they acquired mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2083153561,"The gene TOP2 encoding yeast topoisomerase II has been cloned by immunological screening of a yeast genomic library constructed in the phage λ expression vector, λgt11. The ends of the message encoded by the cloned DNA fragment were delimited by the Berk and Sharp procedure (S1 nuclease mapping) for the 5′ end and mapping of the polyA tail portion of a cDNA fragment for the 3′ end. The predicted size of the message agrees with the length of the message as determined by Northern blot hybridization analysis. The identity of the gene was confirmed by expressing the gene in E. coli from the E. coli promoter lac UV5 to give catalytically active yeast DNA topoisomerase II. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function."

https://openalex.org/W2059678906,"Nucleoids isolated from a temperature-sensitive gyrB mutant of E. coli, incubated at restrictive temperatures, exhibit increased sedimentation rates and an abnormal doublet or dumbbell-shaped morphology. Shifting cells from restrictive to permissive temperature prior to nucleoid isolation leads to decreases in the percentage of doublet nucleoids and in nucleoid sedimentation rates. When nucleoids isolated from mutant cells exposed to restrictive temperature are incubated with purified gyrase, the percentage of doublet nucleoids decreases as the total number of nucleoids increases. These results, together with the demonstrated ability of gyrase to decatenate small circular DNA molecules in vitro, suggest that gyrase participates in bacterial chromosome segregation through its decatenating activity."
https://openalex.org/W2107670036,"We have analyzed the structure, expression, and inheritance of a foreign DNA insert of an unusual transgenic mouse, designated MyK-103. The insert is composed of two copies of pMK (a metallothionein-thymidine kinase fusion gene) oriented as inverted repeats. No methylation of the foreign DNA could be detected. The original transgenic mouse was mosaic; 10% to 20% of both somatic and germ cells contained the plasmid insert. The pMK insert has been stably transmitted by females through five generations; however, expression of thymidine kinase is extremely variable in different members of the pedigree. Although males carrying the pMK insert are fertile, they never transmit the pMK insert. We propose that the foreign DNA has disrupted a gene that must be expressed during haploid stages of spermatogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2033893181,The role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase in relaxing smooth muscle was examined. The kinase was immunoprecipitated from tissue extracts and the phosphate content was determined. The addition of forskolin to resting or methacholine-contracted muscles resulted in an increase in myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase is one of the reactions in the process by which cyclic adenosine monophosphate causes relaxation of smooth muscle.

By day 4 in vitro, the Schwann cells had all lost their surface galC. Three days after beginning treatment with 10-3 molar 8-bromo-adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (8-bromo cyclic AMP) or N6,O2′-dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP), galC reappeared on the Schwann cells, and 2 days later 48 percent of the cultured Schwann cells showed surface galC. Tritium from tritiated D-galactose was incorporated into galC by the 8-bromo cyclic AMP- and dibutyryl cyclic AMP-treated cultures at a rate 15 times the control rate."
https://openalex.org/W2079214991,"During the life cycle of the hypotrichous ciliate Oxytricha nova, a macronucleus containing short, gene-sized DNA molecules is produced from a copy of the chromosomal micronuclear genome. In order to characterize the process of macronuclear development, we have isolated and determined the DNA sequence of a particular macronuclear gene and its micronuclear precursor. The results of this analysis indicate that macronuclear telomeric sequences (5′C4A43′ repeats) are not present at the ends of the gene in its micronuclear chromosomal location and must be added during development. In addition, the micronuclear copy of the gene contains three short blocks of sequence that must be removed during development, implying the involvement of a nucleic acid-splicing process in generating mature macro-nuclear genes."
https://openalex.org/W2064783342,"The effect of the anion associated with sodium loading on the development of hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat was determined. For 5 weeks rats were fed a diet containing normal or high concentrations of sodium chloride or high concentrations of sodium provided as a mixture of sodium bicarbonate, phosphate, and amino acids. After 1 week on these diets and until the end of the study the rats receiving high concentrations of sodium chloride had higher systolic blood pressures than the rats in the other two groups. There were no statistically significant group differences in plasma volume, arterial pH, or plasma concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, or creatinine, or in renomedullary prostaglandin E2 production. Compared to the animals receiving normal concentrations of sodium chloride, those receiving high concentrations of sodium chloride or amino acids showed decreased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations. Thus, the anion ingested with sodium alters the development and severity of hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat."
https://openalex.org/W2083015347,"We sequenced the 5' and 3' RNA termini of 16 defective interfering (DI) particles of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolated at intervals from persistent infections and from a series of undiluted lytic passages. All DI RNAs exhibited complementary termini, but sequences internal to these termini were extensively rearranged in a variety of ways. Despite extensive rearrangement, these internal sequences (in addition to the termini) apparently are important for DI particle interference properties. Some of these DI particles are derived from multiple intrastrand and interstrand recombination events, and the generation of each can be explained by current replicase error models. During viral evolution in persistent and acute infections, DI particles with specific termini base substitutions are selected. One DI particle exhibits a remarkable clustering of specific A----G (and complementary U----C) substitutions, apparently as a result of repetitive misincorporations by an error-prone viral polymerase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1561419139,"The nucleotide sequence of the rat parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene was established from a 14.5-kilobase pair fragment of rat liver DNA cloned in bacteriophage Charon 4A. The transcriptional unit of the gene of 2.5 kilobase pairs is interrupted by two introns (1600 and 111 base pairs). Blot hybridization of restriction enzyme digests of rat spleen DNA using 32P-labeled fragments of the cloned PTH gene suggests that the gene is unique and present in a single copy in the genome. A promoter sequence (Goldberg-Hogness or TATA box) is situated 28 base pairs upstream from the point of initiation of transcription which was found by S1 nuclease mapping and by oligonucleotide-primed reverse transcription of rat PTH mRNA. The gene is flanked on its 5' side by repetitive DNA and contains a different, more abundant repetitive DNA on its 3' side. The mRNA encoded by the parathyroid hormone gene consists of 800 +/- 50 nucleotides as determined by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The 5' untranslated region of the mRNA contains three AUG triplets. Only one AUG triplet initiates biosynthesis of preproparathyroid hormone (prepro-PTH). The 3' untranslated segment of the mRNA contains two AATAAA sequences characteristic of polyadenylation signals. The mRNA encodes prepro-PTH, a precursor of PTH of 115 amino acids. When the amino acid sequence of the rat precursor is compared with the analagous bovine and human precursors, it becomes evident that the hormone sequences are highly conserved in two regions of known function near the NH2 terminus and in a third region near the carboxyl terminus whose biologic function, if any, has not yet been defined."

https://openalex.org/W1984233328,"Polyene antibiotics such as amphotericin and nystatin increase membrane permeability and thus increase the amount of oxygen consumed in active electrolyte transport. In isolated perfused rat kidneys, the polyenes produced extensive injury to the medullary thick ascending limb, a segment of the nephron with limited oxygen supply. This damage was prevented if reabsorptive transport was inhibited by ouabain. Cell death under these circumstances thus appears to be mediated by increased oxygen demand for transport activity."

Transcription of both the light and heavy strands initiates at the same sites previously identified as in vivo transcription start sites. The sequences responsible for initiation of heavy strand transcription are investigated in detail, since this transcript includes the rRNA cistrons and the majority of tRNA genes and potential mRNAs. Deletion mutagenesis is employed to delimit the sequences responsible for heavy strand transcription to a region of less than 35 bp surrounding the transcription start site. This region contains a repetitive sequence, AAACCCC, and shows homology to other regions of the human mtDNA that have been implicated as transcription initiation sites or that show unusual homology to other mammalian mtDNA genomes."

The occurrence of positive results in the assay was significantly greater among donors to the AIDS patients (9 of 117; 7.7 percent) than among random donors (1 of 298; 0.3 percent). Of 12 sets of donors examined, 9 sets included a donor whose serum gave positive results for the presence of the antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W1995588164,"Human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) is a human C-type retrovirus that can transform T lymphocytes in vitro and is associated with certain T-cell neoplasms. Recent data suggest that, in the United States, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), homosexual men with lymphadenopathy, and hemophiliacs have had significant exposure rates to HTLV, whereas matched and unmatched control American subjects have rarely been exposed to this agent. In the present experiments, T cells specifically reactive against HTLV were propagated from a patient whose HTLV-bearing lymphoma was in remission. The T cells were cloned in the presence of the virus and an HTLV-specific cytotoxic T-cell clone was isolated. This clone was infected and transformed by the virus, with one copy of an HTLV-I provirus being integrated into the genome. This T-cell clone did not exhibit the normal dependence on T-cell growth factor (interleukin-2) and proliferated spontaneously in vitro. Exposure of the clone to HTLV-bearing, autologous tumor cells specifically inhibited its proliferation and resulted in its death. These results may have implications for HTLV-associated inhibition of T-cell responses."

https://openalex.org/W1493129150,"Fat cells from the hypothyroid rat fail to synthesize cyclic AMP in response to beta-adrenergic agonists, although possessing normal amounts of beta-adrenergic receptors (R) and catalytic adenylate cyclase activity. Membranes of hypothyroid rat fat cells contain Mr = 42,000 (major form), 46,0000, and 48,000 (minor forms) peptides of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Ns) radiolabeled in the presence of cholera toxin and [32P]NAD+. Maps of fragments generated by partial proteolysis of these radiolabeled peptides are virtually identical in hypothyroid and euthyroid preparations. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the size and charge of the Mr = 42,000, 46,000, and 48,000 radiolabeled peptides are similar in euthyroid and hypothyroid rat fat cell membranes. Extracts of hypothyroid rat fat cell membranes express normal amounts of Ns activity as measured by their ability to reconstitute the adenylate cyclase of membranes of S49 mouse lymphoma cyc- mutant cells which lack functional Ns activity. Hybridization of hypothyroid rat fat cells with donor membranes of normal rat fat cells, rat hepatocytes, or S49 cyc- cells restores the beta-adrenergic response of these fat cells. Pretreating the donor membranes with a beta-adrenergic antagonist covalent label blocks the ability of these membranes to restore the response of the cells. Rat hepatocytes pretreated with a beta-adrenergic antagonist covalent label do not accumulate cyclic AMP in response to isoproterenol. Hybridization of these receptor-deficient hepatocytes with fat cell ghosts of euthyroid rats restores beta-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation, whereas hybridization with fat cell ghosts of hypothyroid rat does not restore this response. Ns of pigeon erythrocyte membranes radiolabeled with cholera toxin and [32P]NAD+, extracted in cholate, and reconstituted with fat cell membranes interacts with fat cell R. The ability of R to interact with Ns of pigeon erythrocyte membranes is impaired when the reconstitution is performed with membranes from the hypothyroid rat fat cell. Hypothyroidism appears to affect the ability of R to interact productively with Ns, without affecting either R number or Ns structure and function."

When this mRNA was microinjected into the cytoplasm of BHK cells, mouse IgG was seen to accumulate in the Golgi complex after 5-6 hr of incubation. No accumulation was seen in 3T3 cells which lack the epitope recognized by 53FC3.

https://openalex.org/W2063122028,"Immunoprecipitation of extracts of human carcinoma cell lines with three different monoclonal antibodies generated against ras proteins revealed the coprecipitation of a 90,000 dalton protein. The coprecipitated protein was identified as the transferrin receptor by comigration in both reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, by absorption with a monoclonal antibody directed against transferrin receptor, and by analysis of partial proteolysis products. Coprecipitation of the transferrin receptor with three monoclonal antibodies with differing specificities to ras proteins, as well as the inability to coprecipitate the transferrin receptor from cell extracts from which ras proteins were depleted by preabsorption, indicates that ras proteins and the transferrin receptor form a molecular complex. This complex is disrupted by addition of transferrin to cell extracts. These findings suggest that ras proteins function in regulation of cell growth via interaction with the cell surface receptor for transferrin."

https://openalex.org/W2103418578,"We describe the internal organization of a large part of the Balbiani ring (BR) 6 gene in Chironomus tentans. The BR6 gene is a diverged member of the BR gene family. It displays the characteristic hierarchic organization of repetitive sequences, but in the constant region of the repeat units the overall sequence homology is only 49% when compared to other BR genes. All four cysteines are among the few amino acids conserved in the constant region. In the subrepeat region the central part is built from a repeated tripeptide, Pro-Glu--Arg+. A similar charge distribution adjacent to prolines is found in other BR gene subrepeat regions, most pronouncedly in the BR2-encoded protein. These conserved properties of the BR gene products are relevant to the issue how the various BR gene products interact to form a supramolecular structure, the larval tube, and how functional demands influence the evolution of a eucaryotic gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1499002501,"It has been suggested that the interferon (IFN)-induced 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase, which polymerizes ATP into a series of 2',5'-linked oligomers with the general formula pppA(2'p5'A)n, plays a general role in cell growth and terminal differentiation. For instance, an increase in 2-5A synthetase activity has been described during dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced erythroid differentiation of Friend leukemia cells (FLC). 2-5A synthetase has been measured in two Friend leukemia cell sublines by various techniques including a radioimmunoassay of its products which would detect 10(-16) mol of 2-5A cores. Although cells of both sublines fully differentiate (as measured by benzidine staining), only in one subline was there an increase in 2-5A synthetase activity upon treatment with Me2SO. Hexamethylenebisacetamide, another potent agent of differentiation in this system, did not increase 2-5A synthetase activity in either of these two sublines. An IFN-resistant FLC variant differentiated normally upon treatment with Me2SO or hexamethylenebisacetamide while it was noninducible for 2-5A synthetase activity by exogenous IFN or by the inducers themselves. A similar situation has been observed with regard to the level of phosphorylation of the IFN-induced Mr = 67,000 protein band. In addition, treatment of IFN-sensitive and resistant FLC sublines with mouse alpha beta IFN antiserum did not affect differentiation. Even though we have duplicated previous findings on the increase of 2-5A synthetase activity in Me2SO-induced FLC, the lack of any such increase with other inducers or other sublines indicates that there is no causal relationship between the enzyme activation and FLC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1582311917,"Acanthamoeba myosin I heavy chain kinase activates the actin-activated Mg2+ -ATPase activity of the Acanthamoeba myosin I isoenzymes, myosins IA and IB, by phosphorylating a single site within the myosin heavy chain. In this paper, we report that myosin I heavy chain kinase also phosphorylates isolated turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chains, gizzard smooth muscle heavy meromyosin, and intact gizzard smooth muscle myosin, all in the absence of Ca2+ and with specific activities close to those measured for purified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. Myosin I heavy chain kinase incorporates a maximum of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of heavy meromyosin, both by itself and together with smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (the light chain kinase alone incorporates 1.6 mol of phosphate/mol of heavy meromyosin). Both kinases phosphorylate intact smooth muscle myosin to a maximum of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin. Myosin I heavy chain kinase fully activates the actin-activated Mg2+ -ATPase of both myosin and heavy meromyosin. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of isolated light chains phosphorylated by myosin I kinase show the same phosphopeptide as for light chains phosphorylated by the light chain kinase. These results support the conclusion that myosin I heavy chain kinase phosphorylates gizzard smooth muscle myosin at the same site within the 20,000-Da light chain as does smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. The results suggest that the amino acid sequence around the phosphorylation site within the heavy chain of Acanthamoeba myosin I isoenzymes may be similar to the primary sequence around the phosphorylation site within the smooth muscle myosin light chain."

Site-specific deadenylylation of both globin mRNAs is demonstrated by partial enzymatic sequence analysis following 3'-terminal labeling with 5'-pCp (where p indicates the labeled phosphate group). The secondary structure of the 3'-noncoding region is studied by enzymatic digestion with S1 nuclease and cobra venom ribonuclease.

A specifically labeled peak of IGF-II binding activity was identified by freezing, slicing, and counting the gels. The proteins eluted from the region of the gel when cross-linked to 125I-IGF-II with disuccinimidyl suberate and electrophoresed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate have the same molecular weight, Mr, as the previously described IGF-II receptor. From the slope of a plot of log of the relative mobility, RF, at each of 6 to 7 gel concentrations for the 125I-IGF-II-receptor and for each of seven standard proteins (Ferguson-Hedrick plot), a retardation coefficient, KR, was determined. Using a reference curve constructed from a plot of square root KR versus the molecular radius, R, of the standard proteins, the IGF-II receptor was estimated to have a R of 4.13 nm and a calculated Mr of 250,000. Thus, quantitative procedures that separate native proteins based on their size and charge have provided information which is in good agreement with the results of studies of the IGF-II-receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and supports the premise that it is a monomeric single chained glycoprotein, constrained by intradisulfide bonds and with a mass of 250 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W2073443886,"We have found that a portion (150 base pairs) of the seventh exon of the human gamma fibrinogen gene is duplicated in the preceding intron. This duplicated sequence, termed a ""pseudoexon,"" is flanked on each side by a single-copy inverted repeat sequence consisting of 102 base pairs. Frequencies of point substitutions indicate that both the pseudoexon and the inverted repeat sequence arose approximately 10 to 20 million years ago. The generality of this type of duplication is suggested by the occurrence of a similar duplication in the mouse immunoglobulin mu-delta region. As in the fibrinogen pseudoexon, the portion of the immunoglobulin mu-delta region containing the duplication and the inverted repeat was reported to be single-copy in the mouse genome. Since both of the first two single-copy inverted repeats to be sequenced are associated with regional duplications, it is likely that many of the single-copy inverted repeat sequences, which make up 1 to 2 percent of the genome, are also associated with regional duplications."
