Experiments in the United States, where most of the investigations have been made, have been reviewed by Easterbrooks1, while Rottensten and Oestergaard2 have described a series of experiments in Denmark; but no systematic examination of this problem has been made in the United Kingdom, and the American experiments have been on a comparatively small scale, which obviated the possibility of a comprehensive investigation. A large experiment in Britain, involving four Milk Marketing Board artificial insemination centres and their sub-centres, was therefore started in February 1951. The experiment was designed to find out which of the two diluents commonly used in artificial insemination, egg-yolk citrate buffer (equal volumes of 3.2 per cent sodium citrate, pH adjusted to 6.8 with citric acid, and egg-yolk) and egg-yolk phosphate buffer (equal volumes of phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (2 per cent Na2HPO4. 12H2O and 0.2 per cent KH2PO4 and egg-yolk), was the better in the sense of being associated with the higher conception-rate, the buffers being used with and without all possible combinations of sulphanilamide (1.5 mgm./ml.), penicillin (500 units/ml.) and streptomycin (500 µgm./ml.)."

In some cases, it is possible to avoid the colour-forming reaction by measuring the ultra-violet or visible absorptions of the materials themselves. Bellamy1 has shown that it is possible to examine directly the infra-red spectra of materials adsorbed on paper chromatograms, and it has now been found possible to make quantitative measurements on paper chromatograms by scanning the paper with infra-red radiation of suitable wave-lengths. This method may prove to be particularly useful for substances which do not absorb in the ultra-violet or visible regions and which do not undergo quantitative colour-forming reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2047160753,"BAKER1 introduced in 1946 a carefully standardized technique, developed from the Smith–Dietrich test, for the detection of lipines. In a later communication2 she claimed that this modification (the acid–hæmatein test), controlled by his pyridine-extraction test, allows histochemical recognition of phospholipines. This was confirmed by Cain3 while working in Baker's laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W1982174348,Abstract : The administration of a cobalt diet for 5 and 8 days before and for 15 days after x-irradiation increased the tolerance of female albino mice to total body x-irradiation (720 r). The administration of a cobalt diet for 36 days before and for 15 days after irradiation and the administration of a cobalt diet for 30 days beginning immediately after irradiation produced no pronounced beneficial effects.

https://openalex.org/W2020594766,"DURING a recent study of a large number of strains of Aspergillus niger we observed a morphological feature not hitherto recorded, so far as we know, for the A. niger group. The mycelium growing from a point-inoculation of one strain on a modified Czapek solution agar (normal Czapek solution salts, but 30 per cent sucrose instead of 3 per cent) showed a left-handed twist, or spiral development, when viewed from above in the ordinary way. The word ‘spiral’ is used loosely, for a form which indeed suggests the picture of a spiral nebula. The tracks both of the primary hyphæ and of their lateral branches curved in a counter-clockwise sense as they advanced."

Whether or not the inner structureless layer remains on the surface is a matter of controversy, but it may be inferred from recent papers that it does remain throughout life1–3. This, however, is difficult to envisage in view of the findings of Scott et al.
4 and Scott5, who have demonstrated the wear which takes place continually on the enamel surface of erupted teeth, although it is true that these authors do speak of a ‘cuticle’."

In fact, while Bavin et al.2 have found an activity corresponding to that of the para-amino-salicylic acid, according to Beyerman and Alberda1 the compound should be 2–5 times less active than para-amino-salicylic acid."
