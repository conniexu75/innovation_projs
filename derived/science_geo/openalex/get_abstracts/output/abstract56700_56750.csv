https://openalex.org/W2056942998,"Some of the simplest nonlinear difference equations describing the growth of biological populations with nonoverlapping generations can exhibit a remarkable spectrum of dynamical behavior, from stable equilibrium points, to stable cyclic oscillations between 2 population points, to stable cycles with 4, 8, 16, . . . points, through to a chaotic regime in which (depending on the initial population value) cycles of any period, or even totally aperiodic but boundedpopulation fluctuations, can occur. This rich dynamical structure is overlooked in conventional linearized analyses; its existence in such fully deterministic nonlinear difference equations is a fact of considerable mathematical and ecological interest."
https://openalex.org/W1538720735,"The subunit structures of Factor XIII from plasma and platelets have been examined by sedimentation equilibrium in the ultracentrifuge. Plasma Factor XIII has a molecular weight of 320,000 ± 20,000 in dilute salt solution at neutral pH. The two different types of subunits of the plasma factor, the a and b chains, have molecular weights of about 75,000 and 88,000, respectively. Platelet Factor XIII has a molecular weight of 146,000 ± 10,000, whereas its single type of subunit, the a chain, has a molecular weight of about 75,000. The a chains of the platelet and plasma factors are identical not only in molecular weight but also on gel electrophoresis in three different systems and in amino acid composition. The a chain of platelet Factor XIII combines with the b chain of plasma factor to give a protein which is electrophoretically indistinguishable from native plasma Factor XIII. In addition, the amino acid composition of the plasma factor is essentially identical with twice the average amino acid composition of the a and b chains. These analyses indicate that the subunit structure of plasma factor is a2b2 and that of the platelet factor is a2. The subunits of each factor are combined in the native molecules solely by noncovalent bonds. Thrombin, trypsin, reptilase, papain, and an enzyme contaminating some ancrod preparations activate plasma Factor XIII. In each case, except possibly with papain, Factor XIII activation coincides with a decrease in molecular weight of 4,000 of the a chain. High concentrations of thrombin only slightly inactivate Factor XIII after prolonged incubation, whereas trypsin not only activates but extensively inactivates plasma Factor XIII. Activation of Factor XIII is not autocatalyt c. Neither release of the fibrinopeptides nor gelation is required for activated plasma Factor XIII to cross-link fibrinogen. The γ chains of fibrin are cross-linked by activated plasma Factor XIII more rapidly than the α chains, but the rates of cross-linking of the α (A) and γ chains of fibrinogen are about the same. In addition, the pattern of cross-linking of fibrinogen or fibrin by guinea pig liver transglutaminase is different from that catalyzed by activated Factor XIII. The lysis time of fibrin clots with cross-linked α and γ chains was considerably greater than that of fibrin clots containing cross-linked γ chains but little or no cross-linked α chains."
https://openalex.org/W1607141688,"Abstract The 40–44 hydrophobic peptide segment, present in cytochrome b5 obtained by nonhydrolytic means, but absent from lipase or trypsin-extracted cytochrome b5, has been found to be required for the binding of a 10- to 20-fold molar excess of cytochrome b5 to liver microsomes. At saturation, the bound cytochrome b5 constitutes nearly 20% of the total protein of the vesicle preparations. This extra bound hemoprotein is indistinguishable from endogenous cytochrome b5 as an electron acceptor from microsomal NADH cytochrome b5 reductase and as an electron donor for external cytochrome c or the rat liver microsomal stearyl coenzyme A desaturase. On the basis of earlier work of others and present data, it appears that these enzymes are localized on the outside of microsomal vesicles. A model, consistent with these data, proposes that the extra, as well as endogenous cytochrome b5, is bound to microsomes by interactions between the nonpolar peptide segment and the phospholipid of the membrane. This permits interactions of the polar catalytic heme binding segment at the surface of the outer membrane with either reductase, cytochrome c, or the desaturase system. The latter catalytic events require only the translational movement of the nonpolar portion of the protein in the lipid membrane of several molecular diameters."
https://openalex.org/W1602537057,"Abstract The subcellular distribution and properties of an enzyme system responsible for hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD3) to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3) in chicken kidney have been described. The enzyme, which is highly specific for 25-OHD3 since it does not hydroxylate cholecalciferol or dihydrotachysterol, is located in the mitochondria and has a pH optimum of 7.4 and an apparent Km of 2.2 x 10-6 m. At 8.34 x 10-7 m 25-OHD3, 1,25-(OH)2D3 production is linear with mitochondrial protein concentrations of up to 8 mg per ml. Enzyme activity is maximal in Tris-acetate buffer and requires Mg2+, oxygen, and a source of reduced pyridine nucleotide, which in intact mitochondria is provided by malate or succinate. The succinate-supported hydroxylation is dependent upon electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. The 25-OHD3-1-hydroxylase is inhibited by carbon monoxide, metapyrone, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine. The enzyme is also inhibited by its product, 1,25-(OH)2D3. It is, however, much more strongly inhibited competitively by 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, a close analog of 1,25-(OH)2D3."
https://openalex.org/W1587165109,"Abstract Cytochalasin B binds rapidly and reversibly to human red blood cells. Scatchard plot analysis of binding data reveals a class of high affinity binding sites (dissociation constant ≅10-7 m; 3 x 105 sites per cell) and a class of low affinity binding sites (dissociation constant ≧10-5 m). All of the high affinity binding sites are in the plasma membrane (i.e. ghost). Variation of ionic strength and of pH in the range of 5.0 to 9.0 has only a small effect on the ability of the membrane to bind cytochalasin B with high affinity. The high affinity binding is not affected when intact cells are treated with pronase or with trypsin, but is lost when ghosts are similarly treated under conditions where the inner surface of the membrane is accessible to these enzymes. This binding decreases by more than 90% when either intact cells or ghosts are treated with p-chloromercuribenzoate. d-Glucose inhibits the high affinity binding by 80 to 90%, whereas l-glucose has very little effect. The effectiveness of eight different sugars to inhibit high affinity binding of cytochalasin B to ghosts is related to their affinity for the sugar transport system. All of these results indicate that at least 80% of the high affinity cytochalasin B binding sites are intimately related to this transport system. As judged by competition experiments, cytochalasin A and B have the same affinity for the high affinity binding sites, whereas dihydrocytochalasin B and the γ-lactone derivative have a much lower affinity. Selective elution of spectrin and components 5 and 6 has no effect on the high affinity binding of cytochalasin B to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2026977957,"The first measurement has been made of the number of diverse mRNA sequences (mRNA sequence complexity) in the total polysomes of a eucaryotic system, the sea urchin gastrula. mRNA was purified of nuclear RNA and any other heterogeneous RNA contaminants by release from polysomes with puromycin. Trace quantities of labeled nonrepetitive DNA fragments were hybridized with an excess of mRNA. The hybridization reaction followed ideal first order kinetics in mRNA concentration. At completion of the hybridization reaction, 1.35% of the nonrepetitive DNA was present as mRNA-DNA hybrid. The hybridized DNA was extracted and was at least 70% hybridizable with mRNA, demonstrating a 50-fold purification of the expressed sequences. This purified DNA fraction reassociated with excess unfractionated sea urchin DNA at a rate identical to that of the total nonrepetitive DNA tracer. The mRNA had therefore been hybridized to nonrepetitive DNA sequence, and the amount of hybrid could be used as a direct measure of the mRNA sequence complexity.
The complexity of the gastrula mRNA can be calculated as about 17 million nucleotides, sufficient to comprise some 14,000 distinct structural genes. This result also provides an estimate of the number of diverse proteins being translated in the gastrula. From the rate of mRNA-DNA hybrid formation, we estimate that about 8% of the mRNA belongs to this complex class, and that less than 500 copies of each species of message in this class exist per embryo. Most of the mRNA population consists of a relatively small number of diverse species represented a much larger number of times."
https://openalex.org/W2061301951,"The severity of enzyme deficiency often does not correlate well with the clinical severity of genetic diseases. Thus, some G6PD variants associated with severe enzyme deficiency, such as Union and Markham, cause no hemolytic problem, while some variants associated with less severe deficiency, such as Manchester, Alhambra, and Tripler, cause chronic hemolytic anemia. The kinetic characteristics of these variant enzymes have not explained the discrepancy. However, examination of the normal and variant enzymes under simulated physiologic conditions, with the effects of various intermediate metabolites and co-enzymes in red cells being taken into consideration, reveal that the G6PD's from hemolytic variant subjects are strongly inhibited by a physiologic concentration of NADPH because of their high Michaelis constant for NADP or low inhibition constant for NADPH, and they are more sensitive to inhibition by ATP. These variant enzymes cannot generate enough NADPH in red cells to maintain an adequate concentration of reduced glutathione. The nonhemolytic variant enzymes are far less sensitive to the inhibition by NADPH because of their low Michaelis constant for NADP and high inhibition constant for NADPH. The physiologic activity of these nonhemolytic variant enzymes is estimated to be more than 30 percent of the activity of the normal G6PD, and this activity is adequate to maintain the red cells unhemolyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1508211961,"Abstract Dihydropteridine reductase has been obtained from sheep liver in essentially homogeneous form. The enzyme exists as a dimer of molecular weight 41,000 to 42,800. The subunit molecular weight has been determined to be 21,300. In the presence of the quinonoid tautomer of either dihydrobiopterin or dihydro-6, 7-dimethylpterin, DPNH is a better substrate than TPNH. Evidence indicates that the activity of this enzyme is far greater than that of the known pterindependent hydroxylases in all tissues examined."

https://openalex.org/W1542877165,"Abstract The substrate specificities of the liver microsomal cytochrome P450 fractions from control and phenobarbital-treated immature, male rats were studied with the reconstituted hydroxylation system. In the presence of fixed amounts of the reductase and lipid fractions and various amounts of hemoprotein, the catalytic activities of the cytochrome P450 fractions from control and phenobarbital-treated rats were compared with a variety of substrates. Both fractions were about equally active for the N-demethylation of ethylmorphine and the hydroxylation of testosterone at positions 6β and 7α. However, the cytochrome P450 fraction from phenobarbital-treated rats was much more active than the cytochrome P450 fraction from control rats for the N-demethylation of benzphetamine and chlorcyclizine, the oxidation of pentobarbital, and the hydroxylation of testosterone at position 16α. For the hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene, the cytochrome P450 fraction from control rats was slightly more active than the P450 fraction from phenobarbital-treated rats. These results suggest that the cytochrome P450 from control rats is catalytically different from the cytochrome P450 from phenobarbital-treated rats. The cytochrome P448 fraction from rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene was also assayed for its ability to metabolize various substrates. The substrate specificity of the cytochrome P448 fraction differed from both cytochrome P450 fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2055719149,"Immediately after the injection of reserpine (16 micromoles per kilogram, intraperitoneally), aminophylline (200 micromoles per kilogram, intraperitoneally), and carbamylcholine (8.2 micromoles per kilogram, intraperitoneally), the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in adrenal medulla of rats is increased severalfold. The three drugs also cause a delayed increase of medullary tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Our results are consistent with the view that an increase of medullary adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate concentration is involved in the drug-induced increase of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in adrenal medulla. Experiments with tyramine (130 micromoles per kilogram, intraperitoneally) suggest that the increase of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate concentrations is independent of an increase in adrenal catecholamine turnover rate."

This activity in guinea pig ileum appears to be associated primarily with the plasma membrane as is found in the red cell. By contrast the uptake of calcium in aortic smooth muscle appears to be associated to an appreciable extent with intracellular membranes, possibly analogous to the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1508191644,Abstract These studies are part of an effort to determine how the activities of certain membrane-bound oxidoreductase systems affect the structure and function of the membranes in which they are situated. This report shows that the mitochondrial oxidation of TPNH in the presence of physiological quantities of Fe3+ results in reproducible polyunsaturated fatty acid degradation which is accompanied by a marked loss in mitochondrial capacity to oxidize Krebs cycle intermediates and to perform oxidative phosphorylation. The enzyme responsible for the changes appears to be the mitochondrial non-energy-dependent transhydrogenase. The phenomenon may account for some of the turnover of lipids in mitochondrial membranes.
https://openalex.org/W1598669935,"Abstract Dexamethasone induces the synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase in hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, an established line of rat hepatoma cells in tissue culture. The addition of insulin or dialyzed serum to cells previously induced with dexamethasone in a serum-free medium causes a further doubling in tyrosine aminotransferase activity, which is not dependent on concomitant RNA synthesis. The simultaneous addition of maximally effective concentrations of both insulin and serum causes an additive stimulation of tyrosine aminotransferase activity. This result suggests that insulin and serum might either affect different aspects of the control of a single enzyme, or alternatively the synthesis of different isozymes of tyrosine aminotransferase. Crude extracts of HTC cells induced with dexamethasone alone, dexamethasone plus insulin, or dexamethasone plus serum have been analyzed by titration with antibody to purified rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase, by heat stability, and by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. These methods readily distinguish tyrosine aminotransferase of HTC cell origin from that of renal cell origin. By all three of the techniques used in this study, the tyrosine aminotransferase induced by dexamethasone, insulin, and serum appears to be identical. Thus these three humoral factors all appear to enhance the synthesis of the same enzyme, possibly by affecting different aspects of its post-transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W2131048602,"The enzyme NADP+ reductase from spinach chloroplasts was studied by various methods of enzymology and protein chemistry. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate showed the polypeptide molecular weight to be 37,000, a value which is almost exactly the same as the minimum molecular weight per FAD, so the enzyme has one FAD per polypeptide chain. Considering the previously reported sedimentation coefficients, the enzyme is probably a monomer. The copper protein plastocyanin, also from spinach was studied by the same method and found to have a polypeptide molecular weight of 10,000, which is the same as the previously reported minimum weight per copper and half the value previously determined by sedimentation, so plastocyanin is a dimer with one copper per polypeptide. The effect of pH and ionic strength on a reaction catalyzed by NADP+ reductase has been studied. The Km for NADPH showed the effects of ionizations at pH 6.3 and 8.9, the former assigned to the substrate and the latter to the enzyme. Vmax was relatively pH-independent from pH 4.5 to 10.5. Km increased linearly with increasing ionic strength. The rates of inactivation of the enzyme by various reagents specific for sulfhydryl groups have been determined. The inactivation was slow compared to other sulfhydryl enzymes, but could be accelerated by NADPH or retarded by NADP+. The inactivation was accompanied by the slower dissociation of the FAD. The inactivation could be reversed by sulfhydryl compounds, but only before the dissociation of FAD occurred. By the use of Ellmann's reagent in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the enzyme has been found to have a total of eight sulfhydryls, none of which are reactive in the absence of the denaturant. The flavin of NADP+ reductase has been titrated with NADPH, dithionite, and methyl viologen, and photoreduced with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as the electron donor. Below pH 9, the NADPH titration produced a semiquinone intermediate form. The NADPH titration above pH 9 and the other methods of titration produced no semiquinone. The reduction potentials for the 1-electron reduction to the semiquinone or the 2-electron reduction directly to the fully reduced form of the flavin were determined. At pH 7, the potentials for the 1-electron steps for the reduction of oxidized to semiquinone and semiquinone to fully reduced forms of the enzyme are -0.32 and -0.40 volt, respectively, values which are intermediate between the potentials of ferredoxin and NADP+."
https://openalex.org/W1596318561,"Abstract Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: NADP oxidoreductase EC 1.5.1.5) has been purified from Clostridium thermoaceticum, an obligate anaerobic thermophile. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 55,000 ± 5,000 and consists of 2 subunits of equal molecular weight. The sedimentation constant s20,w0 is 3.8 S, the partial specific volume 0.752 cc per g, and the Stokes radius 31.7 A. The enzyme appears homogeneous during Sephadex chromatography and ultracentrifugation, but during disc gel electrophoresis at pH 8.9 two bands of equal intensity are seen. Both bands are enzymatically active, and, when isolated individually, they again show the same two bands in the electrophoresis, indicating an equilibrium between the two forms. The enzyme has high thermal stability with a temperature optimum above 64° and exhibits a broken line in an Arrhenius graph. The apparent Km for NADP is 9 x 10-5 m and for methylenetetrahydrofolate 3.5 x 10-5 m. The enzyme is specific for NADP and NAD is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 2 x 10-4 m."
https://openalex.org/W1719946011,"Abstract Elevated levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in guinea pig cerebral cortical slices after incubations with histamine, histamine-norepinephrine, adenosine, and combinations of adenosine and biogenic amines rapidly return to basal levels (t½ l 10 min) during subsequent incubations in control medium. Elevated intracellular levels return only slowly to basal levels after stimulation with the depolarizing agent, veratridine. The rate of apparent degradation of cyclic AMP may be somewhat limited by the rate of diffusion of stimulatory test agents out of the brain slices. The time courses for the diappearance of total cyclic AMP and of radioactive cyclic AMP, the latter derived from intracellular radioactive nucleotides labeled by a prior incubation with radioactive adenine, follow similar patterns. The phosphodiesterase inhibitors, papaverine and isobutylmethylxanthine, potentiate the accumulation both of total and of radioactive cyclic AMP elicited by histamine or by histamine-norepinephrine and in addition decrease the rate of degradation of cyclic AMP after removal of the stimulatory agents. Isobutylmethylxanthine potentiates the histamine-elicited accumulation of total cyclic AMP to a greater extent than the accumulation of radioactive cyclic AMP. The potentiative effects of papaverine and isobutylmethylxanthine on accumulations of cyclic AMP are not additive. Papaverine and isobutylmethylxanthine have either no effect or antagonize the accumulations of cyclic AMP evoked by adenosine, adenosine-biogenic amine combinations, or veratridine-histamine, and in addition they do not retard degradation of total and of radioactive cyclic AMP after a prior stimulation by adenosine-histamine-norepinephrine. N,O-Dibutyryl cyclic AMP potentiates the accumulation of radioactive cyclic AMP elicited by histamine or histamine-norepinephrine. The effects of adenosine on cyclic AMP levels are blocked by theophylline and nonpolar analogs, and to a lesser extent by a polar analog, 7-(2'-diethylmethyl-ammoniumethyl)theophylline iodide. Theophylline either has no effect or inhibits the accumulation of cyclic AMP elicited by biogenic amines."
https://openalex.org/W1537402786,"A cytochrome P-450-rich fraction free of alcohol dehydrogenase activity and containing only small amounts of catalase was prepared from rat liver microsomes and shown to catalyze the NADPH-dependent oxidation of ethanol. The recoveries of cytochrome P-450 and the activity of the NADPH-dependent ethanol oxidation were 15.6% and 14.0%, respectively. The addition of separated cytochrome c reductase to the cytochrome P-450 fraction resulted in an increase in the ethanol-oxidizing activity, while the addition of microsomal lipid had a mild inhibitory effect on the activity catalyzed by the combined cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome c reductase fractions. Substitution of the NADPH-generating system by a system generating H2O2 also resulted in oxidation of ethanol by the cytochrome P-450-rich fraction, although at a slightly slower rate. The separated catalase fraction oxidized ethanol only in the presence of a system generating H2O2. It is concluded that ethanol oxidation can be catalyzed by a microsomal component rich in cytochrome P-450 and separate from contaminating alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase."
https://openalex.org/W1550197747,"Abstract A new protease which specifically acts on the apo-form of pyridoxal enzymes was discovered in rat small intestine and skeletal muscle. This enzyme was purified about 500-fold from the small intestine of vitamin B6-deficient rats. Some proporties of the enzyme and its action were studied. The enzyme split the apo-protein of ornithine transaminase into two products, a homogeneous smaller protein and an oligopeptide, and thereby inactivated the transaminase. The substrate enzyme, ornithine transaminase, and the larger product have s020,w values of 9.9 and 5.1, respectively. The enzyme inactivated all of the apo-pyridoxal enzymes tested, including serine dehydratase, ornithine transaminase, tyrosine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, but did not affect non-pyridoxal enzymes (glutamic dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, urease, and glutaminase), bovine serum albumin or some synthetic substrates. Addition of pyridoxal phosphate or a high concentration of pyridoxal had a protective effect against the specific protease, but another active coenzyme, pyridoxamine phosphate, did not. The activity of this protease in the small intestine increased during vitamin B6 deficiency. A reciprocal relation was found between the activity of this protease and that of ornithine transaminase in the small intestine."

https://openalex.org/W1568826728,"Abstract In guinea pig cerebral cortical slices, formation of both endogenous and radioactive cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), the latter derived from intracellular nucleotides labeled during a prior incubation with radioactive adenine, may be stimulated by incubation with histamine, histamine-norepinephrine, adenosine, veratridine, and combinations of adenosine and biogenic amines, allowed to return to basal levels after washing, and then restimulated by the same agent or a different agent. Restimulations by histamine or histamine-norepinephrine are minimal except in the presence of adenosine. Maximal accumulations of total cyclic AMP and of radioactive cyclic AMP decline slowly and in parallel during a series of repetitive stimulations with adenosine-histamine-norepinephrine. The results provide no evidence for significant translocation of nucleotides of different specific activities between morphological compartments of brain slices during repetitive stimulations of cyclic AMP formation. An intermediate incubation of slices with adenosine does not restore the responsiveness of the cyclic AMP-generating system to biogenic amines after a prior stimulation with histamine or histamine-norepinephrine. Part of the lack of response to biogenic amines after a prior stimulation by the same amines is apparently due to an increase in phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation of cyclic AMP since the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitors partially restores the response to the biogenic amines. The presence of adenosine markedly decreases the rate of disappearance of cyclic AMP in slices after a prior stimulation with adenosine-histamine."
https://openalex.org/W1571175075,"Two isozymes of glutamate dehydrogenase were shown to exist in a thermophilic strain of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The NADPH:NADH activity ratios of the NADH- and NADPH-specific isozymes were 1:5 and 33:1, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 179,000 and 269,000, respectively. Only the NADH-specific isozyme was detectable in nitrate-cultured cells; the synthesis of the NADPH-specific isozyme was inducible by ammonium. In light-dark-synchronized cells in nitrate medium, the activity of the NADH-specific isozyme remained constant for 4 hours and then increased continuously for the remainder of the first and into the second synchronous cell cycle. The induction of the NADPH-specific isozyme was dependent on both RNA and protein synthesis and this isozyme was inducible at all times during the cell cycle. The potential, i.e. maximum rate of induction, increased in a single step during the period of DNA replication and the fold increases in potential and in DNA were essentially equal. These data indicate that the structural gene for this isozyme is continuously available for transcription during the cell cycle of this eucaryotic microorganism, and are consistent with the hypothesis that, under fully induced conditions, the gene dosage of the cell governs the potential."
https://openalex.org/W1556415638,"Abstract A procedure is described for the isolation of glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) from chicken neural retina, and the enzyme has been purified to homogeneity. Its amino acid composition is given and the results of electron microscopic examinations are described. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing either sodium dodecyl sulfate or urea showed that the enzyme consists of homogeneous subunits with a molecular weight of 42,000 ± 2,000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was found by sedimentation equilibrium analysis to be 392,000. The sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme (15.8 S) and the Stokes radius (59 A) were determined and their combination gave a molecular weight of 386,000. Calculations from these data would indicate the presence of nine subunits in the native enzyme; however, other considerations favor an octameric structure with a molecular weight of the order of 340,000. The possible reasons for the apparent discrepancy between this value and those obtained from the sedimentation data are discussed. Electron microscopy showed the native enzyme molecules as rectangular particles with dimensions of about 90 x 90 x 125 A; occasionally the individual molecules were seen associated in chain-like aggregates."

https://openalex.org/W1484836512,"Abstract Stopped flow studies of the oxidative deamination of l-glutamate by TPN and beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase were performed at pH 6.5 and 7.6. At each pH value, the initial burst slopes obey an equation of the form: e/v = Φ0 + Φ1/(TPN) + Φ2/(l-glutamate) + Φ12/(TPN)-(l-glutamate). The agreement of dissociation constants for enzyme-TPN and enzyme-l-glutamate binary complexes obtained from the Φ values with those obtained independently in equilibrium studies supports mechanisms which include random and rapid binding of substrate and coenzyme at the active site. The lack of effect of preincubation with either reactant on the transient state kinetics eliminates the possibility of any kinetically important slow isomerization steps in the formation of binary complexes. Comparison of the limiting Michaelis constants with the dissociation constants for TPN and l-glutamate shows that there is a cooperativity between coenzyme and substrate in the formation of an enzyme-TPN-l-glutamate ternary complex."

Lysosomal rich particles isolated from regressed testes, obtained from rats which previously had been hypophysectomized or made cryptorchid, were as temperature-insensitive as those from liver. The hypothesis was advanced that the increased release of hydrolytic enzymes at 37° from lysosomes in certain germinal epithelial cells may be intimately associated with the cellular degeneration and cessation of spermatogenesis which occur in cryptorchid testes."

W. (1960) J. Biol. Chem. 235, 1), was oxidized by a mixture of periodate and permanganate, and the product was hydrolyzed by acid to yield d-allothreonine. The d-allothreonine was identified by amino acid analysis, by paper chromatography, and by its susceptibility to oxidation with d-amino acid oxidase. This established that the diamino sugar belong to the d series and that the substituents on C-4 and C-5 are cis. To establish the configuration at C-2, N-acetylbacillosamine was reduced and dinitrophenylated to yield a 4-acetamido-2-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-hexitol. Acid hydrolysis followed by periodate-permanganate oxidation afforded N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-serine identified by paper chromatography and by optical rotatory dispersion. The amino group at C-2 is thus on the right in the Fischer projection of the molecule. Examination of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the fully acetylated derivative, tetraacetylbacillosamine, revealed that the compound is in the C 1 conformation; that H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-5 are in trans diaxial positions; and that the acetoxy group at C-3 is equatorial. Our findings show that N-acetylbacillosamine belongs to the d-gluco series and has the structure of 4-acetamido-2-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose."

Thioredoxin from the same mammalian source has now been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, heat treatment, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and Sephadex chromatography. 1-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl determination indicated valine to be the sole NH2-terminal amino acid. Based on a molecular weight of 11,400 estimated by gel filtration, summation of assumed integral numbers of amino acid residue weights was 12,100. Although purification of thioredoxin reductase to electrophoretic homogeneity was not attained in these experiments, a molecular weight value of about 66,700 was estimated by gel filtration. Heterologous cross-reaction between Escherichia coli ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase and Novikoff hepatoma thioredoxin was confirmed but no heterologous cross-reaction between E. coli thioredoxin reductase and Novikoff hepatoma thioredoxin was observed."
https://openalex.org/W205498636,"Abstract p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, a flavoprotein isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens, was anaerobically reduced and its reoxidation reactions with O2 studied with a stopped flow spectrophotometer. All effectors of this enzyme which stimulate its TPNH oxidase activity were found also to affect its reactivity with O2. Both the rates of reaction and the binding constant for O2 were enhanced by the effectors. During the reoxidation of the enzyme complexed with the substrate effector, p-hydroxybenzoate, a rapidly formed oxygenated-intermediate is observed. This intermediate is analogous to the oxygenated intermediate previously seen in the presence of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, another substrate effector (Spector, T., and Massey, V. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 5632–5636). It is believed that these intermediates are a hydroperoxide form of the flavin prosthetic group and are catalytic species that are produced prior to hydroxylation. When the reduced enzyme was reoxidized in its uncomplexed form, or complexed with a nonsubstrate effector (i.e. a compound which stimulates the TPNH oxidase activity but is not hydroxylated), no spectral intermediates were detected."
https://openalex.org/W1508774560,"Abstract The substrate specificity of bull semen NAD nucleosidase for various NAD analogs was studied. It was found that NAD, NADP, and nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide served well as substrates for the enzyme. The enzyme also catalyzed the hydrolysis of nicotinamide mononucleotide, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, 3-acetylpyridine hypoxanthine dinucleotide, 3-pyridinealdehyde adenine dinucleotide, thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and 3-pyridinealdehyde hypoxanthine dinucleotide but at much slower rates. The hydrolysis of NADH, NADPH, and α-NAD was found not to be catalyzed by the enzyme. The enzyme was observed to be inhibited noncompetitively in the presence of nicotinamide; however, it was observed not to catalyze a pyridine base exchange reaction. Product inhibition patterns with nicotinamide and adenosine diphosphoribose were consistent with an Ordered Uni Bi reaction in which nicotinamide is the first product released by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532286245,"Abstract The pyridine nucleotide content of wild-type Neurospora is 3 µmoles per g dry wt. It can be raised by 20% if cells are grown in the presence of nicotinic acid, and by 40% in the presence of tryptophan. This suggests that the utilization of tryptophan, the first step unique to pyridine nucleotide synthesis, is a rate-limiting step in this pathway. The pyridine nucleotide content of col-2, a morphological mutant containing a defective glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, was only 40% of the wild-type strain. Growth of this mutant in the presence of nicotinic acid raised its pyridine nucleotide levels by approximately 20%. However, tryptophan had no effect on the levels in the col-2 strain. The lack of tryptophan stimulation in the col-2 strain suggests that there is a ratelimiting step elsewhere in the pyridine nucleotide pathway of this mutant. This step is postulated to be the one catalyzed by kynurenine hydroxylase, since this reaction requires NADPH and since the col-2 strain is deficient in NADPH. Studies on in vivo pyridine nucleotide turnover in a nicotinic acid-requiring strain demonstrated that the levels of NADH decreased faster than the levels of NADPH. By employing four different mutant strains and two double mutant strains grown under a variety of conditions, the total pyridine nucleotide content of Neurospora can be varied over approximately a 3-fold range, from 1.70 µmoles per g to 4.70 µmoles per g. Over this entire range, the ratio of the NAD nucleotides to NADP nucleotides remained at approximately 7:1. One of the factors which controlled this ratio was the level of the NADP type of nucleotide. Another ratio which was constant over the entire 3-fold range was the proportion of reduced pyridine nucleotides. The data indicate that the NADH/NAD + NADH ratio remained at 0.35 ± 0.03, and the NADPH/NADP + NADPH ratio remained at 0.65 ± 0.05. The implications of these constant oxidation-reduction ratios and the effects of the variations of the pyridine nucleotide content on the morphology of this organism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1543762830,"Abstract Calcium-activated guinea pig liver transglutaminase catalyzes the incorporation of amines at the carboxamide group of several aliphatic amides. Initial velocity findings with n-valeramide and methylamine as substrates are consistent with a modified double displacement mechanism for this reaction. This mechanism has already been demonstrated for amine incorporation at the γ-carboxamide group of peptide-bound glutamine (Folk, J. E. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3707). Inhibition patterns for aliphatic amides suggest that binding of these compounds occurs at the site in the enzyme to which the carboxamide side chain of peptide-bound glutamine residues attaches. All of the straight-chain amides tested proved to be substrates with the exception of formamide. Branched-chain amides in which there is a methyl group in the α or β position of the methylene side chain are not substrates; those with methyl groups on the γ-carbon of the side chain are. These observations and their consideration lead to the suggestion that peptide-bound glutamine attaches to the enzyme with its β and γ methylene groups situated in a hydrophobic binding region and with its carboxamide group directed toward the active site —SH group of the enzyme. The dimensions of this site preclude the productive binding of peptide-bound asparagine. An active site pocket of fixed dimensions into which the carboxamide group and methylene side chain of substrate must be injected and from which product must be extruded is not consistent with the substrate specificity of the enzyme or with the ready dissociation of many products. This, taken together with present observations, favors an hypothesis of an essential substrate-induced conformational change in the active site of the enzyme that precedes or accompanies enzyme acylation."
https://openalex.org/W1500331493,"Abstract The methyl linamarin that occurs naturally in linen flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) seedlings was shown to have the R configuration, i.e. it is identical with (R)-lotaustralin, (R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyronitrile-β-d-glucopyranoside. However, when a mixture of the two enantiomers (R,S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyronitrile, was administered to excised flax shoots, both (R)-lotaustralin and its epimer (S)-epilotaustralin ((S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyronitrile-β-d-glucopyranoside) were formed. Similarly, both (R)-lotaustralin and (S)-epi-lotaustralin were formed when (R,S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyronitrile served as substrate for the UDP-glucose:ketone cyanohydrin-β-d-glucosyltransferase of flax. These results demonstrate that the glucosyltransferase does not distinguish either in vitro or in vivo between the two enantiomeric forms of this glucose acceptor. Since, however, only (R)-lotaustralin occurs in the intact plant, the glucosyltransferase must be presented with only the R enantiomer as a substrate. This form is produced from l-isoleucine ([3S]-ls-isoleucine) due to retention of the S configuration at carbon atom 3. When (3R)-ls-isoleucine (threo-ls-isoleucine) was administered to flax shoots, (S)-epi-lotaustralin was formed due to retention of configuration at carbon atom 3 of the amino acid."

https://openalex.org/W1521500850,"Abstract Rates of oxidation to 14CO2 of pure 3d,7d,11d-[U-14C]-phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) and of an equimolar mixture of 3d, 7d, 11d-[U-14C]phytanic acid and 3l,7d,11d-[U-14C]phytanic acid were determined in rat liver mitochondria. At low substrate concentrations oxidation rates were similar; at high substrate concentrations the mixture of diastereoisomers was oxidized somewhat more rapidly, suggesting that the 3l,7d,11d-isomer is more readily oxidized. α-Hydroxyphytanic acid prepared from 3d,7d,11d-phytanic acid by bromination and methanolysis yielded two bands on thin layer chromatography, presumably representing 2d-hydroxyphytanate and 2l-hydroxyphytanate, but absolute configurations were not determined. The isomer with the greater mobility on thin layer chromatography was oxidized 40 to 60% faster than the isomer with lower mobility. Incubation of 3d,7d,11d-[U-14C]phytanic acid with heavy mitochondria led to accumulation of α-hydroxyphytanic acid which was recovered primarily in a single thin layer band, the band with greater mobility. Similar results were obtained during oxidation of mixtures of 14C-labeled 3d,7d,11d- and 3l,7d,11d-phytanic acid isomers, i.e. the labeled α-hydroxyphytanic acid formed was recovered predominantly (l85%) in the band with greater mobility. Heavy mitochondria do not appear to have the ability to interconvert the α-hydroxyphytanic acid isomers. It is concluded that the rat liver mitochondria can oxidize either of the two isomeric forms of phytanic acid, the 3l,7d,11d-isomer being somewhat more rapidly oxidized, particularly at high concentrations of substrate. Again, both the α-hydroxyphytanic acid isomers are oxidized but one form is oxidized 40 to 60% faster. Finally, it appears that the enzymatic introduction of the hydroxyl group in the α position is highly stereospecific."
https://openalex.org/W1538394761,"Abstract Incubation of 50 mg of rat liver microsomal protein with either 25 µg of crude snake venom (Crotalus adamanteus) or 1 µg of purified phospholipase A results in essentially complete loss of NAD+-dependent methyl sterol demethylase activity (R-CH3 → R-H + CO2). However, the snake venom-treated microsomes contain all of the known component enzymes of demethylase and microsomal electron carriers. Methyl sterol demethylase activity is restored either by the addition of supernatant fraction from snake venom treatment or by the addition of reduced pyridine nucleotides. Thus, the source of reducing equivalents for the multistep mixed function oxidase of demethylase has been examined extensively. Evidence for an endogenous, NAD+-dependent cytochrome b5-reducing system has been found in untreated rat liver microsomes. Snake venom treatment removes the endogenous reducing system from microsomes. Concomitant loss of the NAD+-dependent methyl sterol demethylase and the reducing system is observed. Each enzymic activity is restored by the addition of supernatant fraction, which is obtained from the snake venom treatment. The presence of the endogenous reducing system and the known dependence of the mixed function oxidase upon a source of reducing equivalents explains the paradox observed earlier that fully active methyl sterol demethylase of rat liver microsomes is observed in the absence of reduced pyridine nucleotide when NAD+ is the only added cofactor. The rate of generation of reducing equivalents by the endogenous NAD+-dependent system is slow, but the rate is substantially faster than the rate of methyl sterol oxidase, the mixed function oxidase of demethylase. The endogenous reducing system appears to obtain reducing equivalents via a microsomal alcohol dehydrogenase which is readily released by the snake venom treatment Both commercial horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and isolated rat liver alcohol dehydrogenase restore the NAD+-dependent methyl sterol demethylase activity that is lost upon snake venom treatment; the rat liver enzyme is approximately 10 times as efficacious."
https://openalex.org/W1593444497,"Abstract This paper reports the enzymatic synthesis of lycopersene and prelycopersene pyrophosphate from [4,8,12,16-14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by soluble enzyme systems obtained from yeast and tomato fruit plastids. Incubation of a soluble extract of an acetone powder of tomato fruit plastids, or a purified squalene synthetase of yeast, with [4,8,12,16-14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and NADPH yields a product which co-chromatographs with authentic lycopersene on thin layer, column, and gas-liquid chromatographic systems. These enzyme systems also form prelycopersene pyrophosphate from [4,8,12,16-14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in the absence of NADPH. Both of the above compounds, lycopersene and prelycopersene pyrophosphate, are converted to phytoene and lycopene on incubation with the above soluble tomato enzyme system, NADP and FAD. Hence, it is concluded that these compounds are intermediates in the biosynthesis of acyclic and cyclic carotenes from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1510636664,"Abstract The prosthetic group α-ketobutyrate of urocanase from Pseudomonas putida has been found to originate from l-threonine. This was established by growing a threonine auxotroph of P. putida on a medium containing [14C]threonine and observing that α-ketobutyrate (isolated as α-hydroxybutyrate following borohydride reduction) and threonine present in purified urocanase had similar specific radioactivities. The nature of the bond between α-ketobutyrate and the protein was determined to be an amide linkage rather than an ester on the basis of stability of the bond to mild alkaline hydrolysis. A logical position for such an amide-bound α-ketobutyrate directly derived from a threonine precursor is at the NH2 terminus of the protein. The absence of any α-modified amino acid residues upon treatment of urocanase with dimethylaminonaphthalene sulfonyl chloride is consistent with this idea. Tryptic peptide maps, cyanogen bromide cleavage patterns, gel electrophoresis of urocanase treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate, and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation of enzyme in guanidine HCl all suggested the existence of 2 identical subunits of molecular weight 54,000 composing the native molecule of 110,000. Since previously only 1 mole of α-ketobutyrate per mole of enzyme had been detected, the number of keto-acid groups was redetermined by reduction of a tryptic digest of urocanase with tritium-labeled NaBH4. The digested protein incorporated 2 gram-atoms of nonexchangeable tritium per mole of enzyme. Thus each subunit presumably contains one α-ketobutyrate moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1570072286,"Abstract DPNH can be bound to pig heart cytoplasmic and bovine liver mitochondrial glutamate oxalacetate transaminases. The physiological function of this binding is not known, but DPNH does protect the mitochondrial enzyme from inactivation. Not only can DPNH be bound, but in the presence of ammonium ions it can be oxidized to DPN. This reaction is inhibited by phenylhydrazine. Consequently, it is believed that in this reaction a keto group which is tightly bound to the transaminase is reductively aminated. The product of the reaction other than DPN has not yet been identified. If DPNH with tritium on the B-side is incubated, then tritium is transferred from DPNH to water. While some pyridoxamine phosphate can be produced, it is produced in considerably lesser amounts than DPN. These reactions are apparently not the result of an artifact induced during the purification of the enzymes; they are quite slow and apparently take place independent of reactions between glutamate dehydrogenase and transaminase-bound pyridoxal or pyridoxamine phosphate. Additional evidence is presented which suggests that glutamate dehydrogenase can form an enzyme-enzyme complex with the transaminase, and in the presence of DPNH (or TPNH) plus ammonium ions, glutamate dehydrogenase reacts with transaminase-bound pyridoxal phosphate to produce equal amounts of DPN (or TPN) and pyridoxamine phosphate. In the presence of DPN (or TPN), glutamate dehydrogenase reacts with transaminase-bound pyridoxamine phosphate to produce equal amounts of DPNH (or TPNH) plus pyridoxal phosphate. In these reactions glutamate dehydrogenase is apparently reacting directly with pyridoxal or pyridoxamine phosphate. That is, these reactions are apparently not mediated by some keto or amino acid. Glutamate dehydrogenase must have direct physical contact with the transaminase for there to be interaction between the two enzymes. In the enzyme-enzyme complex, glutamate dehydrogenase is the actual catalyst and transaminase-bound pyridoxal or pyridoxamine phosphate is the substrate."

The enzyme is a flavoprotein and contains 1 mole of FAD per 64,000 g of protein. The minimal molecular weight of the enzyme determined by electrophoretic techniques is 58,000. The amino acid composition of the enzyme has been determined. The enzyme exists as long helical structures 7 nm in width and 30 to 800 nm in length at pH 6.8. This structure has a sedimentation constant of 33.5 S. The long helical structures are broken into smaller structures 7 nm in width and 10 to 100 nm in length when the pH is increased to 9.0. The enzyme at pH 9.0 has a sedimentation constant of 7.4 S. At intermediate hydrogen ion concentrations, the enzyme sediments at intermediate rates in sucrose density gradients. The dissociated enzyme structure reaggregates when the pH is decreased from 9.0 to 6.8. The enzyme forms found at pH 9.0 and 6.8 have comparable specific activities. An unusual paired rod structure is isolated in the last stage of enzyme purification. The rods in this structure are 7 nm wide and of varying lengths. A less dense structure 10 to 11 nm in width separates the paired rods. The paired rods are completely devoid of catalytic activity but could possibly be derived from the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1589174691,"Abstract A cell-free particulate preparation from oyster viscera incorporated [14C]palmitate and [14C]serine into the long chain base sphingadienine. Both double bonds of the product were shown to have the trans configuration. trans-2-Hexadecenoic and trans-6-hexadecenoic acids were not effective in decreasing the incorporation of the radioactive label from palmitate, nor was label from palmitate incorporated into these two monounsaturated fatty acids. Excess sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) and sphing-4-enine (sphingosine) added to incubation mixtures also had little effect on the level of incorporation of palmitate into the dienic base, whereas about 30% reduction was observed when 3-ketosphinganine was added. Mono- and diunsaturated 3-keto bases were produced in vitro in the absence of NADPH, and 3-keto[14C]sphinganine and 3-keto[14C]sphing-4-enine were converted in high yields to labeled 3-ketosphingadienine under these conditions. These data are consistent with a mechanism involving condensation of palmitoyl coenzyme A with serine and subsequent desaturations of the 3-ketosphinganine to form mono- and diunsaturated intermediates, followed by reduction to sphingadienine."
