The binding was mediated by the interaction of the chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain of versican with the carbohydrate-binding domain of L- and P-selectin and CD44. The binding of versican to L- and P-selectin was inhibited by CS B, CS E, and heparan sulfate (HS) but not by any other glycosaminoglycans tested. On the other hand, the binding to CD44 was inhibited by hyaluronic acid, chondroitin (CH), CS A, CS B, CS C, CS D, and CS E but not by HS or keratan sulfate. A cross-blocking study indicated that L- and P-selectin recognize close or overlapping sites on versican, whereas CD44 recognizes separate sites. We also show that soluble L- and P-selectin directly bind to immobilized CS B, CS E, and HS and that soluble CD44 directly binds to immobilized hyaluronic acid, CH, and all the CS chains examined. Consistent with these results, structural analysis showed that versican is modified with at least CS B and CS C. Thus, proteoglycans sufficiently modified with the appropriate glycosaminoglycans should be able to bind L-selectin, P-selectin, and/or CD44.

They provide structural integrity to tissues and mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Proteoglycans consist of a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1 side chains are covalently attached. There are several types of GAGs, which include heparin or heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (CS B), and keratan sulfate (KS). Several of the biological activities of proteoglycans are attributable to the GAGs. For example, heparin binds anti-thrombin III (1Lindahl U. Bäckström G. Höök M. Thunberg L. Fransson L.-Å. Linker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3198-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and heparin and HS bind fibroblast growth factor (2Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R.

Furthermore, CS binds a subset of chemokines, such as RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) (6Wolff E.A. Greenfield B. Taub D.D. Murphy W.J. Bennett K.L. Aruffo A. J.

Versican, also known as PG-M, is a large CS proteoglycan that is expressed in cultured fibroblasts (8Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), proliferating keratinocytes (9Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and arterial smooth muscle cells (10Schönherr E. Järveläinen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is found in the kidney, skin, brain, and other tissues (11Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Versican has a hyaluronic acid (HA)-binding domain at its amino terminus and a set of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like, lectin-like, and complement regulatory protein-like domains at its carboxyl terminus (8Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It also has a CS-bearing domain in its middle portion that contains two alternatively spliced domains called GAG-α and GAG-β (12Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of alternative splicing, versican has four distinct isoforms that contain different numbers of CS chains (13Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3914-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of versican binds HA with high affinity (14LeBaron R.G. Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10003-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal lectin-like domain binds simple sugars such as fucose and GlcNAc (15Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and sulfated glycolipids (16Miura R. Aspberg A. Ethell I.M. Hagihara K. Schnaar R.L. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The lectin-like domain also binds extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin-R (17Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and fibulin-1 (18Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), apparently through protein-protein interactions. The EGF-like domain of versican enhances cell proliferation, at least in part through binding to the EGF receptor (19Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Until now, little has been known about the counter receptors that interact with the CS chain of versican in vivo. We have previously shown that versican, derived from a renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, interacts with a leukocyte adhesion molecule, L-selectin, through versican's CS chains (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). L-selectin is a member of the selectin family, which is characterized by an amino-terminal lectin-like domain followed by an EGF-like domain and complement regulatory protein-like domains. Studies of the carbohydrate-based ligands for L-selectin initially identified two sialomucins, GlyCAM-1 (21Lasky L.A. Singer M.S. Dowbenko D. Imai Y. Henzel W.J. Grimley C. Fennie C. Gillett N. Watson S.R. Rosen S.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 927-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and CD34 (22Baumhueter S. Singer M.S. Henzel W. Hemmerich S. Renz M. Rosen S.D. Lasky L.A. Science. 1993; 262: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), which are expressed on the high endothelial venules of lymph nodes. Subsequent studies revealed that these molecules interact with L-selectin via a sialyl Lewis X (sLeX)-like carbohydrate structure, 6-sulfo-sLeX (23Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M.

Other sialomucins, such as podocalyxin-like protein (24Sassetti C. Tangemann K. Singer M.S. Kershaw D.B. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), sulfated glycoprotein (Sgp) 200 (25Hemmerich S. Butcher E.C. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and PSGL-1 (26Spertini O. Cordey A.-S. Monai N. Giuffrè L. Schapira M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) also bind to L-selectin in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. PSGL-1 also binds to the endothelial P- and E-selectin (26Spertini O. Cordey A.-S. Monai N. Giuffrè L. Schapira M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). CD44, a distinct class of carbohydrate-binding molecules, is expressed on a variety of cell types, including leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Its best characterized ligand is probably HA (28Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), whereas other types of ligands have also been described. Previous work from our laboratory shows that a CS proteoglycan, serglycin, derived from a T cell line, binds CD44 to stimulate granzyme release from a CD44-positive cytotoxic cell line (29Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The CS form of the invariant chain has also been reported to bind CD44 (30Naujokas M.F. Morin M. Anderson M.S. Peterson M. Miller J. Cell. 1993; 74: 257-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These carbohydrate-based ligands interact with the link module present on the amino terminus of CD44 (31Bajorath J. Greenfield B. Munro S.B. Day A.J. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 338-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The link module appears to have a close structural similarity to the C-type lectin domain (32Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), suggesting an evolutionary relationship and a possible functional link between CD44 and the selectins. The present study was performed to determine whether versican binds to other selectin family members, besides L-selectin, and to CD44. Our data show that versican that is derived from ACHN renal adenocarcinoma cells binds L-selectin, P-selectin, and CD44 through its CS chains and that, among the various GAG chains, CS B, CS E, and HS bind L- and P-selectin, whereas HA, CS A, CS B, CS C, CS D, CS E, and chondroitin (CH) bind CD44. Human L-selectin-Ig and human E-selectin-Ig were provided by Dr. S. R. Watson (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Human P-selectin-Ig was provided by Dr. M. Omata (Suntory Co., Osaka, Japan). Each selectin-Ig chimera consists of the amino-terminal lectin-like domain, the EGF-like domain, the first two complement regulatory protein-like domains, and the Fc domain of human IgG1. Human CD44-Ig was produced as described previously (29Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

(Tokyo, Japan). SLeX-BSA was purchased from Oxford GlycoSciences (Bedford, MA). SLeX-sphingolipid was purchased from Nisshin Oil Mills Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-sLeX mAb CSLEX-1 was purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Anti-sLeX mAb 2H5 was provided by Dr. R. Kannagi (Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan). HA (human umbilical cord) and human IgG1 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Anti-human L-selectin mAbs were obtained as follows: MHL-1, MHL-2, and MHL-3 from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., TQ1 from Coulter-Immunotech (Miami, FL), DREG-56 from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), 4G8 from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Tojo of Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Anti-human CD44 mAbs were obtained as follows: F10-44-2 from Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc. (Birmingham, AL), BU-75 from Ancell Immunology Research Products (Bayport, MN), BRIC235 from the International Blood Reference Laboratory (Bristol, UK), and RAMBM 5.5.8 from Dr. J. Lesley (Department of Cancer Biology, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). Anti-mouse CD44 mAb KM201 was provided by Dr. K. Miyake (Saga University Medical School, Saga, Japan). Versican was purified from the conditioned medium of a human renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, as described previously (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified versican (50 μg/ml) or HA (1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m NaCl, and coupled overnight with 100 μg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of a quarter volume of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The biotinylated material was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −80 °C until use. Biotinylated versican was subjected to SDS-PAGE or SDS-agarose-PAGE (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and transferred onto an IPVH filter (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). After blocking with PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1% NaN3, the blot was probed with either (i) ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), or (ii) anti-versican mAb 2B1 (0.5 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (American Qualex Co., 1:2000), as described previously (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, the blot was developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Lipid-derivatized GAGs were prepared according to the method of Stoll et al. (33Stoll M.S. Mizuochi T. Childs R.A. Feizi T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 1 mg of each GAG was dissolved in 100 μl of distilled water. To this, 1.9 ml of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (5 mg/ml) in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) was added, and the reaction mixture was sonicated for 10 min, then incubated at 60 °C for 2 h. After the incubation, 200 μl of NaBH3CN (10 mg/ml) in methanol was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 16 h. The reaction mixture was then lyophilized and dissolved in 2m NaCl in 15% ethanol, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The sample was precipitated with five equivalent volumes of ethanol, and the precipitate was dissolved in 0.2m NaCl and applied to a TSKgel Phenyl Toyopearl 650M column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl. The lipid-derivatized GAG was eluted with 30% methanol. The eluate was lyophilized and redissolved in distilled water before use. Chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase B treatment was performed at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0. Neuraminidase, hyaluronidase SD (S. dysgalactiae), hyaluronidase (S. hyalurolyticus), or chondroitinase ACII treatment was performed at 37 °C, for 2 h in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0). Recombinant Ig-chimeras, the control human IgG1, or the mAbs against sLeX or GAGs in PBS (25 μl/well) were added to 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Costar EIA/RIA plate 3690, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and kept overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with buffer A (0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) and blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for 2 h. Biotinylated versican, biotinylated HA, or sLeX BP-probe in buffer A was added to the wells in the presence or absence of mAbs, GAGs, or the soluble Ig-chimeras and incubated for 2 h. After washing the wells with buffer A, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Promega, Madison, WI), diluted 1:500, was added and incubated for 1 h. To quantify the reaction, Blue Phos substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the optical density was read at 650 nm in a microtiter plate reader (InterMed Co., Tokyo). Lipid-derivatized GAGs or sLeX-sphingolipid (100 μg/ml, 25 μl/well) were immobilized on 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates by drying at 60 °C for 5 h. After blocking with Block Ace, human IgG1 (5 μ g/ml), L-selectin-Ig (5 μg/ml), P-selectin-Ig (3 μg/ml), or CD44-Ig (1 μg/ml) was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. The binding was detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-human IgG (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA) diluted 1:1000 and Blue Phos substrate as described above. Versican (2 or 4 μg/ml, 25 μl/well) or HA (4 μg/ml, 25 μl/well) was added to 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates and kept overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with Block Ace, chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase ACII, chondroitinase B, or hyaluronidase (S. hyalurolyticus) was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing the wells with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, mAb CS-56, 2-B-6, 3-B-3, 1-B-5, or biotinylated HABP (5 μg/ml) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. The binding was detected with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG+M (American Qualex) diluted 1:500 ando-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) as described previously (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When biotinylated HABP was used as a primary reagent, the binding was detected with HRP-labeled streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). FACE (fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis) was performed as described previously (34Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In brief, 730 ng of purified versican was digested in 50 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.3, containing 0.5 unit/ml each of chondroitinase ABC and ACII, for 18 h at 37 °C. The digestion products were separated from enzymes and the deglycosylated core protein by ethanol precipitation, fluorotagged with 2-aminoacridone (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), and then analyzed by FACE. The molar ratio of ΔDi-0S:ΔDi-6S:ΔDi-4S was assessed by the Eagle Eye documentation system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with illumination at 300 nm. Mouse T lymphomas BW5147 and EL-4 obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Rockville, MD) or EL-4 transfected with human L-selectin cDNA (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was labeled with 5 μm2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were suspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) with or without 20 μg/ml anti-mouse CD44 mAb KM201 (rat IgG1), or 30 μg/ml anti-human L-selectin mAbs TQ-1 or DREG-56 (mouse IgG1). After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, the cells were directly applied to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (5 × 104 cells/well; Costar EIA/RIA plate 3690) that had been coated with 4 μg/ml versican or HA and subsequently blocked with Block Ace. In some experiments, versican- or HA-coated wells were pretreated with 5 milliunits/ml or 100 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC, or 40 TRU/ml of hyaluronidase (from S. hyalurolyticus) at 37 °C for 2 h before applying the cells. The cells were allowed to bind for 40 min at 4 °C. The wells were then filled with buffer B, and the plate was inverted and placed for 30 s. After removal of the unbound cells by gentle aspiration, 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS was added to each well, and the plate was read at 485 nm of excitation and 538 nm of emission in Labosystems Fluoroskan II (Labosystems Japan, Tokyo). L-selectin-reactive versican was purified from the conditioned medium of a renal adenocarcinoma cell line, ACHN, as described previously (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), labeled with NHS-LC-biotin, and subjected to Western blotting analysis (Fig.1 A). When analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A, left), the purified versican was retained at the top of the gel and was specifically reactive with the anti-versican mAb 2B1. On SDS-agarose-PAGE (20Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the purified versican migrated as a broad band of approximately 1600 kDa that was also reactive with mAb 2B1. The purified versican was used throughout this study. Because the glycoprotein ligands for L-selectin so far identified bear sLeX-like carbohydrates, we examined whether versican also possesses these carbohydrate epitopes. As shown in Fig. 1 (Band C), versican bound minimally, if at all, to immobilized anti-sLeX mAbs (2H5, KM-93, CSLEX-1), whereas the positive control, the sLeX BP-probe, bound well. On the other hand, versican bound to immobilized anti-CS mAb CS-56, whereas the sLeX BP-probe did not. These results indicate that, unlike the other known glycoprotein ligands for L-selectin, versican has CS chains but little or none of the sLeX determinants. We then explored the possibility that versican binds not only L-selectin but also other selectin family members and CD44 (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2 A, biotinylated versican reacted with not only L-selectin-Ig but also P-selectin-Ig and CD44-Ig in a dose-dependent manner, but with neither E-selectin-Ig nor control human IgG. Biotinylated versican did not bind irrelevant Ig chimeras such as CD2-Ig or poliovirus receptor-Ig (data not shown). As expected, sLeX BP-probe bound to the immobilized L-, P-, and E-selectin-Igs (Fig.2 B), consistent with previous reports that sLeXis a common ligand for the selectins (35Foxall C. Watson S.R. Dowbenko D. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Asa D. Brandley B.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Biotinylated HA reacted with CD44-Ig but not with the selectin-Igs (Fig. 2 C). To determine which domains of L- and P-selectin and CD44 are involved in binding versican, we examined the effects of various mAbs with known specificities on the binding of versican or known ligands to L- and P-selectin- and CD44-Igs (Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 3 A, although all anti-L-selectin mAbs that block binding to sLeX (MHL-1, MHL-3, TQ1, DREG-56) inhibited the binding between versican and L-selectin-Ig, non-blocking anti-L-selectin mAbs (MHL-2, 4G8) failed to inhibit the binding. EDTA also inhibited the binding of L-selectin-Ig to versican and sLeX. These results suggest that versican interacts with the lectin domain of L-selectin. Similarly, anti-P-selectin mAbs (G1, CLB-Thromb/6, AK4) and EDTA that block binding to sLeX inhibited the interaction between versican and P-selectin-Ig (Fig. 3 B). However, mAb 1.2B6, which has dual specificity for E- and P-selectin (36Goda K. Tanaka T. Monden M. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), inhibited the interaction of P-selectin-Ig with the sLeX BP-probe but not with versican. These results suggest that versican binds to the lectin domain of P-selectin as does sLeX, although the binding sites are not identical. Anti-CD44 mAbs BRIC235 and RAMBM 5.5.8, but not F10-44-2 or BU75, inhibited the binding of both versican and HA to CD44-Ig (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that versican, like HA, is recognized by the link module of CD44. BRIC235 recognizes epitope 2a in the link module of CD44 as defined in the Vth Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen Workshop (37Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T.

Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3938-3945PubMed Google Scholar), whereas RAMBM 5.5.8 recognizes a different epitope in the link module of CD44 (39Zheng Z. Katoh S. He Q. Oritani K. Miyake K. Lesley J. Hyman R. Hamik A. Parkhouse R.M.E. Farr A.G. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When these mAbs were added together, the binding of both versican and HA to CD44-Ig was completely inhibited, whereas doubling the concentration of either mAb added alone did not further increase the extent of inhibition (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that at least two distinct epitopes are involved in the binding of CD44 to versican and to HA. We next examined whether versican's CS chains are involved in the binding to L- and P-selectin- and CD44-Igs (Fig.4). The binding of versican to L- and P-selectin- and CD44-Igs was almost completely inhibited by treatment with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 4, left), whereas the binding of versican to the anti-versican mAb 2-B-1 was not affected (data not shown). As expected, neuraminidase treatment inhibited the binding of the sLeX BP-probe to L- and P-selectin-Igs, whereas hyaluronidase treatment inhibited the binding of HA to CD44-Ig (Fig. 4,right). In contrast, neither of these treatments affected the binding of versican to the L- and P-selectin- and CD44-Igs. These results indicate that versican binds L- and P-selectin and CD44 through its CS side chains. Although chondroitinase ABC can cleave both CS chains and HA, the processing rate for HA is slower (40Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F. Makiguchi Y. Horie K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9123-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); thus, we used a concentration of chondroitinase ABC (5 milliunits/ml) that selectively cleaves CS but not HA in Fig. 4 C (also see Fig.9 C).Figure 9Lymphoid cells bind to the CS chains of versican in an L-selectin- or CD44-dependent manner. Mouse lymphoma EL-4 cells or EL-4 cells transfected with human L-selectin cDNA (A) or mouse lymphoma BW5147 cells (B) were allowed to bind to the wells coated with versican (4 μg/ml) or HA (4 μg/ml) that had been treated with or without 100 milliunits/ml or 5 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC (CHase), or 40 TRU/ml of hyaluronidase (HAase; from S. hyalurolyticus) in the presence or absence of anti-human L-selectin mAbs TQ-1 or DREG-56 (30 μg/ml), control mouse IgG1 (30 μg/ml), anti-mouse CD44 mAb KM201 (20 μg/ml), or control rat IgG1 (20 μg/ml). The binding of the cells was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, mAbs 2B1 or CS-56, or biotinylated HABP (5 μg/ml), was added to the wells coated with versican (4 μg/ml) or HA (4 μg/ml) that had been treated with or without 100 milliunits/ml or 5 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC (CHase) or 40 TRU/ml hyaluronidase (HAase; from S. hyalurolyticus) at 37 °C for 2 h (solid bars).

Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, participates in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell cycle progression. Recent evidence reveals that members of the Rho family modulate E-cadherin function. To further examine the role of Cdc42 in E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, we developed an assay for active Cdc42 using the GTPase-binding domain of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Initiation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell attachment significantly increased in a time-dependent manner the amount of active Cdc42 in MCF-7 epithelial cell lysates. By contrast, Cdc42 activity was not increased under identical conditions in MCF-7 cells incubated with anti-E-cadherin antibodies nor in MDA-MB-231 (E-cadherin negative) epithelial cells. By fusing the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein/GTPase-binding domain to a green fluorescent protein, activation of endogenous Cdc42 by E-cadherin was demonstrated in live cells. These data indicate that E-cadherin activates Cdc42, demonstrating bi-directional interactions between the Rho- and E-cadherin signaling pathways."

Tumor cells that develop mutations in p53 demonstrate a diminished apoptotic potential, which may contribute to growth and tumor metastasis. Cellular levels of p53 are stabilized during hypoxia. The present study tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from mitochondria regulate the cytosolic redox state and are required for the stabilization of p53 protein levels in response to hypoxia. Our results indicate that hypoxia (1.5% O2) increases mitochondrial ROS generation and increases p53 protein levels in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells and in normal human diploid fibroblast IMR-90 cells. MCF-7 cells depleted of their mitochondrial DNA (rho(o) cells) failed to stabilize p53 protein levels during hypoxia. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid abolished the hypoxia-induced increases in ROS and p53 levels. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, and 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, a mitochondrial anion channel inhibitor, also abolished the increase in ROS signal and p53 levels during hypoxia. The p53-dependent gene p21WAF1/CIP1 was also induced by hypoxia in both MCF-7 and IMR-90 cells without affecting the growth rate of either cell line. In contrast, both cell lines exhibited increases in p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and growth arrest after gamma irradiation. Primary chick cardiac myocytes and murine embryonic fibroblasts also showed an increase in p53 protein levels in response to hypoxia without cell death or growth arrest. These results indicate that mitochondria regulate p53 protein levels during hypoxia through a redox-dependent mechanism involving ROS. Despite p53-induction, hypoxia alone does not cause either growth arrest or cell death."

In many cases, the actions of these two second messengers involve long term changes in gene expression. One well studied target of both calcium and cAMP signaling is the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB).

Consequently, one prevailing model of CREB regulation is that, following increases in intracellular cAMP levels and activation of PKA, the catalytic subunit of PKA translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates CREB, leading to the stimulation of gene transcription (13Hagiwara M.

These kinase families have been reported to mediate the actions of both calcium and growth factors on CREB phosphorylation.

For example, processes such as recruitment and regulation of co-activators and coupling to the basal transcription machinery may present additional targets for kinase action. Indeed, the activity of the transcriptional co-activator CBP has been reported to be regulated by a variety of kinases, including PKA, CaMKIV, and ERK, possibly by direct phosphorylation (11Kwok R.P.

As such, it is likely that the multiple actions of different signaling pathways may ultimately contribute to the stimulation of full CREB-dependent transcription by both calcium and cAMP.We have previously described a mechanism by which cAMP and calcium influx may stimulate ERKs in neuronal cells (29Grewal S.S.

This pathway involves the PKA-dependent activation of the Ras-related small G-protein, Rap1, and subsequent stimulation of the neuronal Raf isoform, B-Raf. Activation of this pathway results in robust stimulation of ERKs and ERK-dependent gene expression (29Grewal S.S. Horgan A.M. York R.D. Withers G.S. Banker G.A. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol.

Hence, stimulation of a Rap1-ERK pathway may contribute to neuronal cAMP and calcium signaling (30Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 32Grewal S.S. York R.D. Stork P.J. S Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25842-25848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, this pathway may allow for cross-talk between PKA and ERK signaling systems. The downstream consequences of stimulation of the Rap1-ERK pathway by calcium and cAMP are not fully understood. However, given the ability of both PKA and ERK to regulate CREB activity, it is possible that some of the observed actions of PKA occur via cross-talk through the Rap1-ERK pathway.In this study, we examined the contribution of the Rap1-ERK pathway to the control of gene transcription by calcium influx and cAMP. Using the PC12 cell model system, we found that both stimulation of calcium influx and elevation of intracellular cAMP levels stimulated CREB-dependent transcription via the PKA-dependent Rap1-ERK pathway. Interestingly, this appears to occur through distinct mechanisms. Calcium used a PKA-Rap1-ERK pathway to mediate phosphorylation of CREB. In marked contrast, cAMP phosphorylated CREB via PKA directly but required a Rap1-ERK pathway to mediate an event that was downstream from Ser-133 phosphorylation and CBP recruitment to achieve full transcription. These data suggest a revised model for cAMP regulation of CREB in which the co-ordinate action of both PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB and Rap1-ERK stimulation of a downstream target are required for full transcription.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that activation of a Rap1-ERK signaling pathway in PC12 cells participates in the regulation of CREB-dependent transcription by both calcium influx and cAMP. However, this pathway seems to be used in distinct ways. Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of CREB requires Rap1-ERK signaling. In contrast, the cAMP-dependent stimulation of the Rap1-ERK pathway appears to contribute to transcription at step downstream of CBP recruitment (Fig.9).Previous studies have demonstrated that a variety of kinase signaling pathways can differentially contribute to calcium influx-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in PC12 cells and neurons (5Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism used by calcium may depend on both cell-type and stimulus-specific factors. For example, in hippocampal cells, CaMKIV is reported to be a major calcium-regulated CREB kinase (17Deisseroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In other cells, in which CaMKIV is not expressed, ERK-dependent pathways may predominate. A recent study reported that calcium-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in PC12 cells occurred via the ERK-dependent activation of the CREB kinase, RSK2 (21Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). PKA was also required for regulating the nuclear translocation of ERK/RSK2, a prerequisite for CREB phosphorylation (21Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with a similar ERK-dependent mechanism of CREB phosphorylation following calcium influx. We also identify a requirement for PKA in this event. However, we suggest that this may reflect the ability of PKA to stimulate ERKs. Whereas the Ras-ERK pathway is an important target for calcium signaling in many cell types, our previous studies have indicated that PKA-dependent activation of a Rap1/B-Raf signaling pathway is the predominant mechanism by which calcium influx stimulates ERKs in the PC12 model system used in this report (29Grewal S.S.

A similar pathway may also be used in hippocampal cells (29Grewal S.S. Horgan A.M. York R.D. Withers G.S. Banker G.A. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3722-3728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 40Martin K.C. Michael D. Rose J.C. Barad M. Casadio A. Zhu H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Ultimately, PKA signaling may play multiple roles in the regulation of ERK-dependent pathways that lead to CREB phosphorylation following calcium influx.A major finding of this study is that cAMP requires a Rap1-ERK signaling pathway to stimulate CREB-dependent transcription. Unlike the situation with calcium, this requirement for ERK activation appears not to involve its ability to mediate CREB Ser-133 phosphorylation. We find that stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels can lead to CREB phosphorylation via PKA, presumably through a direct action on Ser-133. Such an action has classically been thought to account for the ability of cAMP to stimulate CRE-dependent transcription (4Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphorylation of CREB is often considered to be a measure of transcriptional activation by cAMP. Our data suggest that stimulation of a Rap1-ERK pathway may represent an additional required component of CREB regulation by cAMP. Importantly, this requirement for Rap1-ERK signaling was seen in multiple cell-types and in different promoter contexts. In addition, hormonal stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors coupled to adenylate cyclases used a similar mechanism to stimulate transcription. We therefore propose a revised model of cAMP regulation of CREB in which both PKA-mediated Ser-133 phosphorylation and stimulation of a PKA-Rap1-ERK pathway are required for full CREB-dependent transcription. Rap1 is highly expressed in neurons. Moreover, B-Raf expression is mainly restricted to neuronal and neuroendocrine cells. Therefore, this pathway is a potential regulator of neuronal CREB activity. Interestingly, previous reports have demonstrated that, in the context of calcium regulation of c-fostranscription in PC12 cells, a PKA-dependent signaling event distinct from CREB phosphorylation contributes to c-fos gene activation (41Ginty D.D.

It is possible that these findings reflect an activation of Rap1-ERK signaling similar to that described here.An important consideration is the mechanism by which the Rap1-ERK pathway controls transcription downstream of CREB phosphorylation. One potential target is the transcriptional co-activator CBP. CBP is a phosphoprotein that can potentially be regulated by a variety of kinase signaling pathways. However, it has been difficult to discriminate between mechanisms responsible for CREB phosphorylationversus CBP activation. One common approach has been to use gene-reporter assay systems in which GAL4-CBP fusion proteins target CBP to synthetic Gal promoters. Using these methods, studies have demonstrated that CBP-dependent transcriptional activity can be stimulated via a variety of signaling kinases, including CaMKIV, PKA, and ERKs (11Kwok R.P.

Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how well the GAL4-CBP fusion recapitulates the regulation of native CBP.In this report, we have examined the actions of cAMP using a CREB mutant, CREB-DIEDML, that contains a six-amino acid substitution within its kinase-inducible domain (39Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Importantly, this mutant can bind CBP and stimulate CRE-dependent transcription in a phosphorylation-independent manner (39Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We show that stimulation of cAMP/PKA signaling can further increase the transcriptional activity of this mutant. This increase appears to be indirect, involving PKA-dependent activation of the Rap1-ERK pathway. Given that CREB-DIEDML can constitutively bind to CBP and recruit it to the promoter, it is possible these effects involve modification of CBP activity itself. For example, some studies have demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-CBP fusion protein can be increased by ERKs (27Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Liu Y.Z. Thomas N.S. Latchman D.S.

Furthermore, PKA has been shown to augment GAL4-CBP function even when the sole consensus PKA phosphorylation site in CBP is mutated (11Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 44Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275PubMed Google Scholar). These data are therefore also consistent with an indirect action of PKA, possibly via Rap1-ERK signaling. Intriguingly, in one study, the stimulatory actions of PKA on CBP were only observed in PC12 cells, a cell line that expresses B-Raf and in which cAMP can therefore stimulate a Rap1-ERK pathway (45Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, no effect of PKA was seen in COS-7 cells that express little or no B-Raf (45Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Some reports have suggested that stimulation of Ras-ERK signaling cannot increase CBP activity (22Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 24Hu S.C. Chrivia J. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In particular, Ras-dependent activation of RSK2 may actually antagonize CBP-dependent transcription (46Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These differences in the reported actions of ERK signaling may reflect contrasting roles for Ras-dependent versus Rap1-dependent signaling. Thus, one model is that a Rap1-ERK pathway can increase CBP activity, whereas Ras signaling, possibly via RSK2, exerts an inhibitory effect. Given that a major action of PKA is to inhibit Ras signaling (47Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 48Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), cAMP modulation of CBP activity may reflect the net action of PKA-dependent inhibition of Ras and PKA-mediated activation of a Rap1-ERK pathway. CBP is also a co-activator for a variety of other transcription factors, e.g. Smads (49Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 50Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), signal transducers and activators of transcription (51Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), nuclear hormone receptors (52Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of its function through the Rap1-ERK signaling pathway may also provide a mechanism by which cAMP can control transcription independently of CREB.An interesting finding of this study is that one signaling pathway (i.e. Rap1-ERK) can have distinct consequences on regulation of transcription depending on the type of signal (i.e.calcium influx versus cAMP). Moreover, stimulation of PKA activity is central to regulation of CREB by both calcium and cAMP but through different downstream effects. These particular effects may reflect stimulation of discrete spatial or subcellular pools of PKA (53Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). For example, because Rap1 is membrane-bound, PKA signaling at the membrane is probably required for activation of Rap1/B-Raf signaling and thus can regulate both calcium-induced phosphorylation of CREB and cAMP-mediated actions on CBP function through the Rap1-ERK pathway. In contrast, phosphorylation of CREB by cAMP probably involves a direct nuclear action of PKA. A similar scenario has been proposed for calcium signaling, in which distinct transcriptional responses are induced by cytoplasmic versus nuclear pools of calcium (54Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 55Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These differential actions of PKA may be important in neurons in which the intensity and spatial regulation of PKA activation may determine pathways used to stimulate CREB. For example, discrete stimulation in dendrites may not be sufficient to lead to robust elevation of nuclear PKA but could stimulate a Rap1-ERK pathway to phosphorylate CREB (56Roberson E.D. English J.D. Adams J.P. Selcher J.C. Kondratick C. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, robust elevation of cAMP levels in the cell body could lead to direct nuclear PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CREB.In conclusion, we find that stimulation of a PKA-dependent Rap1-ERK signaling pathway is important for the regulation of CREB function by both calcium and cAMP signals. Moreover, this mechanism of regulation may be important in controlling the neuronal action of CREB. Because CREB is a major regulator of processes such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival (5Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 57Walton M.R. Dragunow I. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we propose that activation of Rap1-ERK signaling may be important in mediating these neuronal events. Two major intracellular signals that regulate neuronal function are calcium and cAMP. For example, both activation of G-protein-coupled receptors linked to adenylate cyclase and stimulation of calcium influx via either receptor- or voltage-operated calcium channels can exert rapid actions on neurotransmission and neuronal excitability (1O'Connor V. Augustine G.J. Betz H. Cell. 1994; 76: 785-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, in many cases, the actions of the latter two messengers involve slower, long term changes in gene expression (3Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 4Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These effects are often mediated by stimulation of intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate the activity of multiple transcription factors. One well studied target of both calcium and cAMP is the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)1 (5Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Regulation of this protein may be important in mediating changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival (6Martin K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2057902739,"The GLUT4 glucose transporter resides mostly in perinuclear membranes in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is acutely translocated to the cell surface in response to insulin. Using a novel method to purify intracellular GLUT4-enriched membranes, we identified by mass spectrometry the intermediate filament protein vimentin and the microtubule protein α-tubulin as components of these membranes. Immunoelectron microscopy of the GLUT4-containing membranes also revealed their association with these cytoskeletal proteins. Disruption of intermediate filaments and microtubules in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by microinjection of a vimentin-derived peptide of the helix initiation 1A domain caused marked dispersion of perinuclear GLUT4 to peripheral regions of the cells. Inhibition of the microtubule-based motor dynein by brief cytoplasmic acidification of cultured adipocytes also dispersed perinuclear GLUT4 and inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface. Insulin sensitivity was restored as GLUT4 was again concentrated near the nucleus upon recovery of cells in physiological buffer. These data suggest that GLUT4 trafficking to perinuclear membranes of cultured adipocytes is directed by dynein and is required for optimal GLUT4 regulation by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2083146650,"The tumour suppressor p53 protein integrates multiple signals regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. This regulation is mediated by several kinases that phosphorylate specific residues in the different functional domains of the p53 molecule. The human VRK1 protein is a new kinase related to a poxvirus kinase, and more distantly to the casein kinase 1 family. We have characterized the biochemical properties of human VRK1 from HeLa cells. VRK1 has a strong autophosphorylating activity in several Ser and Thr residues. VRK-1 phosphorylates acidic proteins, such as phosvitin and casein, and basic proteins such as histone 2b and myelin basic protein. Because some transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation, we tested as substrates the N-transactivation domains of p53 and c-Jun fused to GST. Human c-Jun is not phosphorylated by VRK1. VRK1 phosphorylates murine p53 in threonine 18. This threonine is within the p53 hydrophobic loop (residues 13-23) required for the interaction of p53 with the cleft of its inhibitor mdm-2. The VRK1 C-terminus domain (residues 268-396) that contains a nuclear localization signal targets the protein to the nucleus, as determined by using fusion proteins with the green fluorescent protein. We conclude that VRK1 is an upstream regulator of p53 that belongs to a new signalling pathway."

Apoptosis induction by PKR involves phosphorylation of the translational factor eIF-2alpha and activation of the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB, but caspase pathways activated by PKR are not known. Upregulation of Fas mRNA by PKR has been suggested to play a role in PKR-induced apoptosis. To learn how PKR induces apoptosis, we have analysed the role of molecules in death receptor pathways. We showed the involvement of the FADD-caspase 8 pathway on PKR-induced apoptosis based on four experimental findings: upregulation of caspase 8 activity during PKR-induced apoptosis, blocking of PKR-induced apoptosis by the use of a chemical inhibitor of caspase 8, and inhibition of PKR-induced apoptosis by expression of both a FADD dominant negative or a viral FLIP molecule. Significantly, despite the PKR-mediated upregulation of Fas mRNA expression, the Fas receptor-ligand pathway is not needed for PKR-induced apoptosis. Antibodies that inhibit TNFalpha-TNFR1 or Fas-FasL interactions were not able to block PKR-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our observations establish the involvement of caspase 8 in PKR-induced apoptosis and suggest that death receptors other than Fas or TNFR1 or, alternatively, a novel mechanism involving FADD independently of death receptors, are responsible for PKR-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2091196623,"Different mechanisms mediating methylation-dependent repression have been demonstrated. Two of these mechanisms play a role in the context of the granulocyte/macrophage-specific lysozyme gene: direct interference with DNA binding of the transcription factor GA-binding protein and deacetylation of histones. Besides enhancement in the unmethylated state, and transcriptional repression upon DNA methylation, the lysozyme downstream enhancer confers tissue-specific demethylation. Because both demethylation activity and repression ability have been attributed to the methyl-CpG-binding domain-containing protein MBD2, we analyzed this protein. The short form MBD2b binds to the methylated lysozyme enhancer and mediates transcriptional repression. MBD2b is capable of binding to the transcriptional repressor Sin3A. The interaction domain of Sin3A required for binding to MBD2b contains the paired amphipathic helix 3.

An important connection between methylation of tumor suppressor genes and cancer progression has also been shown (8Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 9Eng C. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 101-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In many of the cases analyzed, transcriptional repression was functionally connected with the state of methylation of the gene or of the promoter (for review see Ref. 1Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Gene repression and imprinting is another example of the impact of methylation and its functional connection to repression (for review see Ref. 10Bartolomei M.S. Tilghman S.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differential methylation and demethylation has been shown for many tissue-specific genes. During embryogenesis, housekeeping genes remain unmethylated, whereas tissue-specific genes become methylated. Transcriptional induction of tissue-specific genes is correlated with demethylation (for review see Ref. 11Bergman Y. Mostoslavsky R. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms mediating methylation-dependent repression have been demonstrated. One mechanism is by directly interfering with the DNA binding of transcription factors (for review see Ref. 12Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Another mechanism involves deacetylation of histones, which leads to transcriptional repression (12Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). That both of these mechanisms play a role in the context of a single gene has been shown for the granulocyte macrophage-specific lysozyme gene (13Ammerpohl O. Schmitz A. Steinm ller L. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5256-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mechanisms of methylation-dependent repression that do not involve histone deacetylation have also been demonstrated (14Yu F. Thiesen J. Stratling W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Kaludov N.K. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1921-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A connection between proteins with methyl-CpG-binding domains and gene repression has been documented for the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)1-containing protein MBD2. This factor can interact with the Mi-2/NuRD histone deacetylase complex without being an integral component of this complex (16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MBD2 together with histone deacetylases, HDAC1, HDAC2, and RbAp46/48 are components of the MeCP1 complex (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These connections with histone deacetylases are functionally supported because MBD2-mediated repression is sensitive to trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Repression and direct binding to the Sin3A histone deacetylase complex has been demonstrated for MeCP2, another methyl-CpG-binding protein (reviewed in Ref. 12Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Here we wanted to identify a transcriptional repression domain (TRD) within MBD2b, an N-terminal truncation of MBD2. In addition we asked whether binding of Sin3A plays a role in the transcriptional repression mediated by MBD2. We determined that MBD2b binds to the methylated lysozyme enhancer sequence. Furthermore, we identified a minimal functional domain of MBD2, which confers transcriptional repression, binds to Sin3A, and overlaps with the methyl-CpG-binding domain. For expression of GST-MBD2b fusions in bacteria, pGEX-2T MBD2b was generated by in-frame insertion of the Cfr9I/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3.1 MBD2b (generously provided by Dr. M. Szyf) into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The C-terminal deletions of GST-MBD2b were created by digestion of pGEX-2T MBD2b with EcoRI and the internal sites with HindIII (aa 1–211), NcoI (aa 1–163), Acc65I (aa 1–45), and AccI (aa 1–27), followed by religation. The N-terminal deletions of GST-MBD2b were cloned by cutting pGEX-2T MBD2b with BamHI and the internal sites with Acc65I (aa 45–262), NcoI (aa 163–262), andHindIII (aa 211–262), and religation. The GST fusion of the internal fragment of MBD2b (aa 163–211) was created by excision of theNcoI/HindIII fragment of pGEX-2T MBD2b and in-frame insertion into pGEX-2T digested withBamHI/EcoRI. The GST fusion of the internal fragment of MBD2b (aa 27–82) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and specific primers using pGEX-2T MBD2b as a template. GST fusions of mSin3A were described previously (18Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For expression of lexA-MBD2b fusions in yeast, pEG202 MBD2b was constructed by excision of the Cfr9I/XhoI fragment of pcDNA3.1 MBD2b and in-frame insertion into pEG202 digested withEcoRI and XhoI. The VP16 fusion of mSin3A (aa 54–724) in pVP2 was kindly provided by A. Baniahmad. Mammalian expression vectors for Gal-MBD2b, Gal-MBD2b (aa 145–262), Gal-MBD2b (aa 163–262), and Gal-MBD2b (aa 27–82) were created by excision of the corresponding MBD2b sequences out of pGEX-2T MBD2b or pGEX-2T MBD2b (aa 27–82) and the in-frame insertion into pABGal94 linker (19Baniahmad A.

Cells were harvested 36–48 h after transfection and CAT assays were carried out as described before (23Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. GST pull-downs were carried out essentially as described earlier (24Lutz M. Burke L.J. Barreto G. Goeman F. Greb H. Arnold R. Schultheiss H. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Lobanenkov V. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Bacteria were induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 20 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to normalize protein amounts. Equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled mSin3A or hMBD2b proteins, produced by the T7/T3 TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in 200 μl of binding buffer (100 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg of ethidium bromide, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin). After 0.5 h of incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed eight times with 1 ml of binding buffer without ethidium bromide and bovine serum albumin. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and, after treatment with sodium salicylate, visualized by fluorography. Binding efficiency was quantified by densitometry and analysis with the TINA raytest program. The percentage of binding was calculated relative to the input after subtraction of the GST signal. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as described previously (25Dressel U. Thormeyer D. Altincicek B. Paululat A. Eggert M. Schneider S. Tenbaum S.P. Renkawitz R. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell.

GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads and eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione in gel shift binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (27Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Mobility shift assays were performed using equivalent amounts of recombinant protein and32P radiolabeled HS3.2 fragment (21Schmitz A. Short M. Ammerpohl O. Asbrand C. Nickel J. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20850-20856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The M-lysozyme gene is inactive in nonmyeloid cells as well as in myeloid precursor cells but is activated during granulocyte/macrophage differentiation. The downstream enhancer (HS3.2) is methylated in inactive cell types and is demethylated during differentiation (28Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Short M.L. Nickel J. Schmitz A. Renkawitz R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar, 30Klages S. Mollers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that repression of the mouse M-lysozyme gene involves both hindrance of enhancer factor binding to the methylated enhancer and histone deacetylation (13Ammerpohl O. Schmitz A. Steinm ller L. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5256-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the HS3.2 enhancer several functions have been determined and at least partially characterized. Besides enhancement in the unmethylated state, repression and induction of demethylation have also been demonstrated (21Schmitz A. Short M. Ammerpohl O. Asbrand C. Nickel J. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20850-20856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both demethylation activity and repression ability have been attributed to one of the MBD containing proteins, MBD2. MBD2 mediates transcriptional repression when tested with a reporter gene containing a methylated artificial CpG cluster proximal to the promoter (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). For MBD2b, which shows a 152-amino acid N-terminal truncation in comparison with MBD2, a demethylation activity has been shown (31Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether MBD2b is able to bind to the methylated HS3.2 enhancer and whether binding mediates repression. We expressed MBD2b and truncated mutants as GST fusion proteins and performed bandshift experiments with methylated as well as unmethylated HS3.2 DNA (Fig. 1). Clearly there is a methylation-dependent binding of MBD2b and two of the truncated MBD2b derivatives. This specificity of binding for methylated DNA was seen with a wide range of protein concentrations. Deletion of a C-terminal part of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD2b 1–45) leads to loss of DNA binding. If this in vitro DNA binding of MBD2b is of functional relevance, one would predict that expression of MBD2b would increase repression of an HS3.2-containing reporter. Therefore, we placed the HS3.2 fragment upstream of a tkCAT reporter and transfected this construct after methylation with the M.HpaII methylase into HeLa cells. Negative control transfections show a minimal repressive effect by MBD2b on the unmethylated tkCAT reporter (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 2). Methylation of the reporter shows a significant effect on repression because of many methylated CpG/HpaII sites throughout the reporter plasmid. Interestingly the repressed activity is not changed by MBD2b (lanes 3 and 4). The presence of the HS3.2 enhancer leads to strong enhancement (not shown), which is set to 1 and not changed by MBD2b (lanes 5 and 6). Methylation reduces the enhancement (about 8–10-fold repression;lanes 5 and 7), whereas MBD2b significantly increases the repression of the enhancer more than 60-fold (Fig. 2,lane 8). MBD2 has been shown to be associated with histone deacetylases in the MeCP1 repressor complex (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 32Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases have been found to be components of two major complexes: the Sin3A/HDAC complex and the Mi-2/NuRD complex (27Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Although it is not an integral part of the Mi-2/NuRD complex, MBD2 has been shown to interact in vitro with this complex. We wanted to know whether this is the only histone deacetylase complex MBD2 that can bind to or whether binding to Sin3A may also be possible. Therefore, we carried out GST pull-down assays to test for an interaction between MBD2b and Sin3A. The GST-MBD2b fusion protein binds in vitrotranslated Sin3A (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, a GST-Sin3A fusion also binds in vitrotranslated MBD2b (Fig. 3 B). Then we asked whether a particular region of Sin3A mediates the interaction with MBD2b. Several truncations of the GST-Sin3A fusion were tested for interaction within vitro translated MBD2b (Fig. 3 A). Specific binding could be seen for the Sin3A truncation containing amino acids 404–545. This region contains the paired amphipathic helix 3 domain, which has been shown to mediate different protein-protein interactions (18Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because these pull-down assays only demonstrate a potential interaction tested in vitro, we wanted to examine a MBD2b/Sin3A interaction within a living cell. Therefore, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay designed such that interaction of Sin3A with the DNA bound lexA-MBD2b fusion would result in gene activation mediated by the VP16-Sin3A fusion. Negative controls (lexA or VP16) showed no gene activation, as did the lexA-MBD2b fusion. In contrast, the cotransfection of lex MBD2b with a VP16-Sin3A fusion results in a strong activation of the reporter indicating a specific interaction of MBD2b and Sin3A (Fig. 4).Figure 4MBD2b interacts with Sin3A in vivo. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed with MBD2b f.l. as bait (lexA fusion) and Sin3A as prey (fused to the VP16 activation domain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the direct interaction between MBD2b and Sin3A demonstrated above plays a role in vivo, one would predict that a region that interacts with Sin3A should also be capable of transcriptional repression. To determine which region of MBD2b binds to Sin3A, we generated a detailed set of truncations of the GST-MBD2b fusion (Fig. 5 A) that were used for GST pull-down assays with in vitro translated Sin3A. These experiments identified a region within MBD2b that mediates interaction with Sin3A (Fig. 5). This region (amino acids 27–82) can apparently be subdivided into two parts because MBD2b aa 1–45, as well as MBD2b aa 45–262, are able to bind Sin3A. Interestingly, the Sin3A interaction region overlaps with the methyl-CpG-binding domain but is not able to bind to DNA (data not shown). To avoid interference of compromised DNA binding of MBD2b truncationsversus functional repression, we generated fusions of full-length MBD2b and of truncations with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. These fusions were tested in transient transfections for the activity to repress transcription of a tkCAT reporter containing GAL DNA-binding elements. GAL-MBD2 strongly represses the activity of the tkCAT reporter. Furthermore, regions of MBD2b (aa 27–82 or 45–262) that bind to Sin3A also efficiently repress transcription, whereas a region (aa 163–262) that does not bind Sin3A showed no ability to repress transcription (Fig. 6). Gene repression by co-expressed effectors can be either due to DNA binding of the effector and thereby modulating the nearby transcriptional initiation or due to squelching co-factors that are required for gene activation. To distinguish between these two mechanisms we tested whether DNA binding of the MBD2b repression domain is required to confer functional repression. We used the GAL MBD2b fusion and two types of reporter genes, one harboring GAL-binding sites and the basal reporter, which has no GAL-binding elements (Fig.7). The results clearly show that DNA binding is required for repression mediated by GAL MBD2b, because the basal tkCAT reporter was not affected by any concentration of GAL-MBD2b, whereas repression of 6xs upstream activating sequence tkCAT by GAL MBD2b was dose-dependent. Thus, DNA binding via the GAL4 DNA-binding domain is required for repression of GAL MBD2b. A family of nuclear proteins has been identified that has a MBD in common (34Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). For some of these proteins (MeCP2, MBD1, and MBD2) transcriptional repression has been shown (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 35Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), thereby offering a functional connection for the observed correlation that CpG methylation is often found in inactive genes or inactive promoter regions (12Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). For MBD2 two in-frame potential start codons are found, the upstream AUG allowing translation of MBD2 and an AUG 152 codons downstream, giving rise to MBD2b, which is fully contained within MBD2 (34Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). On the protein level, the in vivo presence has been shown for MBD2 in contrast to MBD2b (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), both of which confer transcriptional repression (Ref. 17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and this paper). In addition to repression, a DNA demethylase activity of MBD2b has been reported (31Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We became interested in this protein because the lysozyme downstream HS3.2 enhancer also shows such a dual activity. In the methylated state, this enhancer is repressed (13Ammerpohl O. Schmitz A. Steinm ller L. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5256-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and provides thecis-acting sequences leading to tissue-specific demethylation (21Schmitz A. Short M. Ammerpohl O. Asbrand C. Nickel J. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20850-20856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, extensive analysis of the demethylase activity of MBD2b failed to show any demethylation (data not shown). Overexpressed or in vitro translated MBD2b did not demethylate a 1.2-kilobase enhancer fragment containing the HS3.2 sequence nor an artificial CpG-island in an in vitrodemethylation assay performed accordingly to Bhattacharya et al. (31Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Additionally cotransfected MBD2b failed to activate the CAT activity of a methylated HS3.2 reporter gene construct in transient transfections. The repression activity of MBD2 was shown to involve HDACs, because repression was sensitive to trichostatin A treatment (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Consequently, MBD2 has been found to be associated with HDACs or to interact with HDAC containing complexes. MBD2 is a component of the MeCP1 complex containing several HDACs (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In vitrointeraction of MBD2 with a chromatin remodeling and HDAC containing complex (Mi-2/NuRD) has also been shown (16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). If transcriptional repression is mediated by direct or indirect binding of MBD2 to HDACs, a minimal trans-repression domain should exist conferring both repression and binding to HDACs. Here we show that a short region of MBD2b is able to mediate repression. This TRD (amino acids 27–82) overlaps with the MBD such that the C-terminal end of the MBD contributes to full repression. TRDs identified within other MBD containing proteins are found at quite distinct locations. MBD1 contains CXXC domains, which are also found in the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 (37Cross S.H. Meehan R.R. Nan X. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 38Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The C-terminal CXXC domain coincides with an unspecific repression function of MBD1 (35Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), whereas the very C-terminal part of MBD1 exhibits repression dependent on DNA binding. Because repression by MBD1 is trichostatin A-sensitive, direct or indirect binding of the TRD to HDACs is likely but has not been shown. For MeCP2, a C-terminal TRD has been identified that binds Sin3A and recruits HDACs (15Kaludov N.K. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1921-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 39Nan X. Cross S. Bird A. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 6-16PubMed Google Scholar, 40Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Here we find that the minimal TRD of MBD2b also binds Sin3A. However, the TRDs of MeCP2 and MBD2 are quite distinct in that the MeCP2 TRD is well separated from the MBD, whereas the MBD2b TRD encompasses part of the MBD. In addition to Sin3A binding, association of the MeCP2 TRD with the transcription factor TFIIB has also been found (15Kaludov N.K. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1921-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which is supported by a trichostatin A-resistant repression (14Yu F. Thiesen J. Stratling W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because MBD1 and MeCP2 are stably associated with chromosomes, even during mitosis, whereas MBD2 can be released from chromatin by low salt (17Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 35Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), a regulatory role for MBD2 could be envisaged. Such a role remains to be determined in the future.

These drugs induce their biological effects by forming an initial complex with cytosolic proteins termed immunophilins. These drug-immunophilin complexes then bind to and inhibit calcineurin (1Liu J.

Calcineurin is widely distributed in mammalian tissues, and may have additional functions other than its well characterized role in lymphocytes. The inhibition of these functions may contribute to the side effects of these drugs. A better understanding of the biological roles of calcineurin in different cell types should promote the development of improved strategies for immunosuppression. Calcineurin is conserved from yeast to man (2Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 3Liu Y. Ishii S.

We have been studying calcineurin signal transduction pathways in fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe because this system is amenable to genetics and has many advantages in terms of relevance to higher systems.

To identify new components in the calcineurin signaling pathway, we have developed a simple genetic screen using the immunosuppressive drug FK506 for mutants that depend on calcineurin for growth, and have identified eight complementation groups (its1–8 forimmunosuppressant- andtemperature-sensitive, to be described elsewhere in detail). Here we report that its3 + encodes a protein most similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mss4 PI(4)P5K. The mutant phenotypes were suppressed by the expression of Mss4 or mammalian PI(4)P5K. In addition, its3-1 mutant cells had only low amounts of PI(4,5)P2 and elevated amounts of PI(4)P, indicating that the encoded protein is a PI(4)P5K and that the mutation caused a significant decrease in PI(4)P5K activity. As expected, growth of the its3-1 mutant cells was dependent on calcineurin, strongly suggesting that Its3 PI(4)P5K and Ppb1 calcineurin share an essential overlapping function. Furthermore, analysis of the its3-1 mutant revealed that PI(4)P5K is required for completion of cytokinesis. Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

Proteins are denoted by roman letters and only the first letter is capitalized (for example, Its3).Table IFission yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceHM123h − leu1Our stockHM528h + his2Our stockKP144h − ura4Our stock5A/1Dh − /h + leu1/leu1 ura4/ura4 his2/+ ade6-M210/ade6-M216Our stockKP119h + leu1 ura4 ppb1::ura4 +Our stockKP167h − leu1 its3–1This studyKP692h − leu1 ura4 its3–1This studyKP919h − /h + leu1/leu1 ura4/ura4 his2/+ ade6-M210/ade6-M216 its3::ura4 + /+This study Open table in a new tab The its3-1 mutant was isolated in a screen of cells that had been mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Cells of strain HM123 were mutagenized with 300 μm nitrosoguanidine (Sigma) for 60 min (∼10% survival) as described by Moreno et al. (9Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). Mutants were spread on YPD plates to give ∼1,000 cells/plate and incubated at 27 °C for 4 days. The plates were then replica-plated at 36 °C to plates containing 0.5 μg/ml FK506. Mutants that showed both FK506 sensitivity and temperature sensitivity were selected. The original mutants isolated were backcrossed three times to wild-type strains HM123 and HM528. To clone its3 + gene,its3-1 mutant (KP167) was grown at 27 °C and transformed with an S. pombe genomic DNA library constructed in the vector pDB248 (9Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). Leu+ transformants were replica-plated onto YPD plates and incubated at 36 °C, and plasmid DNA was recovered from 10 transformants that showed plasmid-dependent rescue. These plasmids had identical or overlapping inserts as judged from restriction digests, and all 10 complemented both the immunosuppressant sensitivity and temperature sensitivity of the its3-1 mutant. A one-step gene disruption by homologous recombination (10Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was performed. The its3::ura4 + disruption was constructed as follows. The 3.4-kilobase HindIII fragment containing the its3 + gene was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega) after Klenow fragment exonuclease treatment. Then, aBamHI-EcoRI fragment containing theura4 + gene was inserted into theBamHI-EcoRI site of the previous construct (Fig.3 B). The HincII fragment containing disruptedits3 + gene was transformed into diploid cells (5A/1D). Stable integrants were selected on medium lacking uracil, and disruption of the gene was checked by genomic Southern hybridization (Fig. 3 C). To express various phosphatidylinositol phosphokinases in fission yeast, a genomic fragment containing budding yeast MSS4 gene was subcloned into the multicopy vector pDB248 (9Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar), and the entire coding regions of murine PI(4)P5K (11Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were amplified from cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the expression vector pREP1, containing the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (13Maundrell K. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). To overexpress Its3, the entire coding region of Its3 was amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the expression vector pREP1 and its attenuated version, pREP41 (13Maundrell K. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Its3 was tagged at its N terminus with GFP carrying the S65T mutation (14Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). To express GFP-Its3 in fission yeast, the coding region for theits3 + gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction, ligated to the C terminus of GFP, and the resultant construct was subcloned into the pREP81 vector, containing an attenuated version of the nmt1 promoter (13Maundrell K. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The Its3 coding region fromits3-1 mutant genome was also amplified, ligated to GFP, and subcloned into pREP81. Similarly, the PH domain of PLCδ (15Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 16Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) was ligated to the C terminus of GFP and the resultant construct was subcloned into the pREP1 vector (13Maundrell K. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Similarly, wild-type and mutant Its3 tagged at their N terminus with GST were constructed and subcloned into the pREP41 vector (13Maundrell K. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). They were expressed in fission yeast and purified using a glutathione affinity column as described previously (6Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Purified samples were processed for lipid kinase assay as described below. To label fission yeast strains with myo-[2-3H]inositol, the cells were grown in EMM. The cells were washed twice with inositol-free EMM, subcultured into 5 ml of the same medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and labeled with 5–25 μCi/ml ofmyo-[2-3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h. After labeling, the cells were harvested and disrupted by vigorous vortexing in 4 ml of methanol, 1 n HCl (1:1) with acid-washed glass beads (1.5 g; Sigma). Phospholipids were extracted by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform and subsequent vortexing. The extracted lipids were deacylated with methylamine reagent, and resulting glycerophosphoinositides were analyzed by Partisphere 5-SAX column (Whatman Inc.) as described by Serunianet al. (17Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 dpm of labeled glycerophosphoinositides were applied to the column, washed with water (buffer A; 1 ml/min) for 10 min, and eluted by a gradient of 1 m (NH4)2HPO4 (pH 3.8) (buffer B) as follows: 0 min, 0% B; 60 min, 25% B; 110 min, 100% B. The lipid kinase reaction and detection of phosphorylated products were described previously (18Itoh T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST fusion proteins and substrate lipids (50 μm) were incubated in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at room temperature. After the lipids had been extracted by addition of 1n HCl and chloroform/methanol (2:1), phosphorylated lipids were separated by TLC and observed by autoradiography. For actin staining, cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and to 50 μl of fixed cell suspension 1 μl of 100 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probe) was added. After 30 min at room temperature, excess phalloidin was washed away with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were dried on coverslips treated with poly-l-lysine and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline to visualize the DNA. Calcofluor white was used to visualize cell wall and septum. To visualize the medial actomyosin ring in living cells, wild-type or its3-1 mutant cells were transformed with a plasmid encoding GFP-Cdc4 (19Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Gould K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A genetic screen was performed to identify genes that share an essential overlapping function with calcineurin. For this purpose, we have developed a simple genetic screen using the immunosuppressive drug FK506 for mutants that depend on calcineurin for growth, and have identified eight complementation groups (its1-8 for immunosuppressant- andtemperature-sensitive, to be described elsewhere in detail). As shown in Fig. 1 A,its3-1 mutant cells could not grow at 33 °C, 36 °C, or in the YPD plate containing FK506, whereas wild-type cells grew normally. its3-1 mutant cells grew almost normally at the permissive temperature (27 °C), but stopped growing 4, 2, or 8 h after shift to 33 °C, 36 °C, or to the YPD media containing FK506 at 27 °C, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Previous reports showed that calcineurin is an in vivotarget of FK506 in fission yeast, and inhibition of calcineurin activity by the addition of FK506 to the culture media resulted in identical phenotypes as those of calcineurin deletion (4Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it could be anticipated that the its3-1 mutant requires functional calcineurin activity for vegetative growth, and tetrad analysis was performed to examine the synthetic lethality with Δppb1 (ΔCN in Fig. 2) mutant. As expected, no double mutant was obtained, indicating thatits3 mutation and calcineurin deletion was synthetically lethal. Thus, it is suggested that Ppb1 calcineurin and Its3 PI(4)P5K share an essential overlapping function for cell viability. Theits3 + gene was cloned by complementation of thets growth defect (Fig. 3,A and B). Nucleotide sequencing of the cloned DNA fragment revealed that the its3 + gene was SPAC19G12.14. It encodes a protein of 742 amino acid residues which is most similar to S. cerevisiae Mss4 PI(4)P5K (see below). As a first step to analyze Its3 function, the its3 +gene was knocked out in a diploid by homologous recombination usingura4 + marker gene (Fig. 3 B). Southern blotting of the genomic DNA of one such transformant confirmed that the wild-type gene had been replaced by the derivative containing theura4 + insertion (Fig. 3 C). Tetrad analysis of the heterozygous diploid showed two viable (Ura−) and two inviable spores (Fig. 3 D), indicating that the its3 + gene is essential for cell growth. As described above, its3 + encodes a PI(4)P5K homologue. A BLAST search of protein sequence data bases revealed that fission yeast Its3 has 44, 34, and 31% identity with budding yeast Mss4 (20Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and human PI(5)P4K (12Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 4). To examine whether Its3 is a functional homologue of any of the phosphatidylinositol phosphokinases, we expressed Mss4, murine PI(4)P5K, and human PI(5)P4K in fission yeast. After the expression plasmids were introduced to its3-1 mutant, the cells were grown at the restrictive temperature. All the transformants expressing PI(4)P5K were capable of growing at 36 °C (Fig.5 A). Expression of PI(4)P5Ks also suppressed the FK506-sensitive phenotype of the its3-1mutant (data not shown). On the other hand, expression of PI(5)P4K failed to complement the its3-1 phenotypes. These results indicate that its3 + encodes a functional homologue of PI(4)P5K. Then, we determined whether the its3-1 mutant strain contained lowered levels of PI(4,5)P2. Wild-type andits3-1 mutant cells were labeled with [3H]inositol, and the tritiated lipid content was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 B, its3-1 mutant cells contained about 10% of the amount of PI(4,5)P2 found in wild-type cells, indicating that the mutation caused a significant decrease in PI(4)P5K activity of Its3. Interestingly, the level of PI(4)P was significantly higher than that of the wild-type cells. These results indicate that Its3 is a PI(4)P5K in vivo, and that Its3 is the major PI(4)P5K in S. pombe under normal growth conditions. A shift to the higher temperature induced a further decrease in the level of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5 B), strongly suggesting that various phenotypes of its3-1 mutant cells found at the restrictive temperature are due to the lowered level of cellular PI(4,5)P2. It also resulted in a significant increase in the relative peak height of PI(4)P, suggesting that activity of mutant Its3 PI(4)P5K decreases upon the temperature shift. On the other hand, as shown in Table II, overexpression of Its3 in wild-type cells resulted in a significant increase in the levels of PI(4,5)P2, but not in the levels of PI(3,5)P2. The increase in the PI(4,5)P2levels were dependent on the promoter strength used for overexpression.Table IIChange in cellular phosphatidylinositol levels by overexpression of Its3StrainPI(3,5)P2PI(4,5)P2%Wild type + pREP1100100 + pREP41-Its3118157 + pREP1-Its3104249Cells were grown in EMM + 2 μm thiamine and were transferred to EMM without thiamine in order to induce the expression. 8 h after medium change, cells were labeled withmyo-[2-3H]inositol for 16 h and phospholipids were extracted by the addition of chloroform and subsequent vortexing. The extracted lipids were deacylated with methylamine reagent, and resulting glycerophosphoinositides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The individual phosphatidylinositols in wild type + pREP1 (empty vector) were taken as 100%. The results represent average of duplicate experiments which agreed within 10%. Open table in a new tab Cells were grown in EMM + 2 μm thiamine and were transferred to EMM without thiamine in order to induce the expression. 8 h after medium change, cells were labeled withmyo-[2-3H]inositol for 16 h and phospholipids were extracted by the addition of chloroform and subsequent vortexing. The extracted lipids were deacylated with methylamine reagent, and resulting glycerophosphoinositides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The individual phosphatidylinositols in wild type + pREP1 (empty vector) were taken as 100%. The results represent average of duplicate experiments which agreed within 10%. To examine PI(4)P5K activity of Its3, we expressed a GST-Its3 fusion protein in fission yeast. A GST-tagged version of Its3 was fully functional as demonstrated by its complementation ofits3-1 mutant phenotypes (data not shown). The Its3 coding region from its3-1 mutant genome was also fused with GST and expressed in fission yeast. Purified GST fusion proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase reaction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6shows that mutant Its3 tagged with GST had detectable but reduced PI(4)5K activity compared with the wild-type. A single base change (G to A transition) was detected in the its3 + gene when genomic DNA sequence from the its3-1 mutant was analyzed. This mutation results in replacement of a glycine with an aspartate acid residue at position 281. This amino acid residue is not conserved in the structure among PI(4)P5K or PI(5)P4K proteins (Fig.4 A). Functional complementation analysis ofits3-1 mutant indicated that the N-terminal 272 amino acids are not absolutely essential for function (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, the domain surrounding the mutated site has high sequence similarity with that of budding yeast Mss4, and is very close to the conserved catalytic domain (Fig. 4 B). These results are consistent with the idea that the mutation does not completely abolish the enzyme activity of Its3 PI(4)P5K but causes a severe loss of its function. Further analysis showed that the Its3 protein is mislocalized in the its3-1 mutant, which will be described below (Fig.9 B). Recent studies have implicated PI(4,5)P2 in many key cell surface events, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton (22Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In particular, studies in budding yeast using temperature-sensitive MSS4mutants have shown that Mss4 PI(4)P5K is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (20Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15787-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Homma K. Terui S. Minemura M. Qadota H. Anraku Y. Kanaho Y. Ohya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15779-15786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to examine the effects of temperature upshift and FK506 on the actin distribution of the its3-1 mutant. Wild-type andits3-1 cells were grown at 27 °C and then shifted to 33 °C. At different time points, aliquots were removed, and cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize F-actin (Fig. 7 A). When grown at 27 °C, wild-type cells displayed the normal cell cycle-dependent distribution of actin in two intracellular regions, cell tips (F-actin patches) and the medial region (F-actin ring) (Fig. 7 A) (23Jochova J. Rupes I. Streiblova E. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Marks J. Hagan I.M. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1986; 5: 229-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, a shift from 27 to 33 °C caused a transient heat-induced disorganization of actin patches, but further incubation at 33 °C restored normal actin patch distribution (Fig. 7 A). Treatment of wild-type cells with FK506 resulted in slight perturbation of cortical patch distribution, but had no effect on the actin ring formation (Fig. 7 A). On the other hand, in the its3-1 mutant cells, actin patches were partially polarized at 27 °C, and the polarization was completely lost upon temperature upshift or FK506 treatment (Fig.7 A). Heat- or FK506-induced disorganization of actin patches was irreversible and became more severe with exposure time (data not shown). Interestingly, F-actin ring was observed even when the polarization of actin patches was completely lost (Fig. 7 A), indicating that contractile ring formation was not so much affected by the lowered intracellular PI(4,5)P2 level. Visualization of actin contractile ring formation in its3-1 mutant cells expressing GFP-Cdc4 (19Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Gould K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) also confirmed that the its3-1mutant was not defective for actin ring formation, although its abnormality such as an extra ring was often observed (Fig.7 B). During the course of experiments studying the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we noted a high incidence of septated cells associated with the its3-1 mutation (Fig. 7). This prompted us to examine the correlation between the mutation and cell septation in more detail. Microscopic observation revealed that some mutant cells have a thick septum that was brightly stained with Calcofluor and was hardly seen in wild-type cells (Fig.8 A). In addition,its3-1 mutant had a septation index approximately twice that seen in wild-type cells at the permissive temperature. Furthermore,its3-1 mutant showed a dramatic increase (from 24 to 50%) in the septation index upon shift to the restrictive temperature, while the septation index of wild-type cells remained unchanged (Fig.8 B). These results suggest that the G281D mutation induces a structural defect in Its3 PI(4)P5K that causes a severe impairment of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, as well as an impairment in cytokinesis. As described previously (4Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of wild-type cells with FK506 had no significant inhibitory effect on the growth rate, but caused a significant increase in the septation index, suggesting a requirement of Ppb1 calcineurin activity in cytokinesis. Consistently, disruption of the ppb1 + gene also resulted in a significant increase in the septation index (4Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present study also showed that addition of FK506 increased the septation index of wild-type cells (Fig. 8 B). When the wild-type cells were cultured at 27 °C in the absence of FK506, the septation index was less than 15%. The index was 27% at 6 h after the addition of FK506. It gradually increased and reached its maximum level (45%) at 15 h. On the other hand, upon addition of FK506 to the incubation medium, theits3-1 mutant cells showed a dramatic change as compared with the wild-type cells. Treatment of its3-1 mutant cells with FK506 markedly inhibited the growth (Fig. 1 B), and the septation index reached nearly 100% only 6 h after the addition of FK506 (Fig. 8, A and B), suggesting a synergistic control of cytokinesis by PI(4)P5K and calcineurin. To investigate the intracellular distribution of Its3 PI(4)P5K, we generated a GFP-Its3 fusion protein. GFP-tagged version of Its3 was fully functional as demonstrated by its complementation of its3-1 mutant phenotypes (data not shown). GFP-Its3 protein was expressed from a multicopy vector containing an attenuated version of the thiamine repressible nmt1 promoter. GFP-Its3 localized to the plasma membrane at all stages of the cell cycle (Fig.9 A). Enrichment of Its3 fusion protein in specific locations within the plasma membrane which occurred during the cell cycle was evident. In cells with the secondary septum, the fusion protein is evenly distributed within the membrane but is heavily concentrated in septum as compared with other cell membranes (Fig. 9 A). The localization of the Its3-1 mutant (G281D mutation) was also examined. As shown in Fig. 9 B, the GFP-Its3-1 mutant protein (GFP-mIts3) was no longer localized to plasma membrane, instead the whole cytoplasm and the nucleus were stained. In addition, the PLCδ PH domain fused to GFP (GFP-PH) was expressed in fission yeast cells. PH domain from PLCδ has been shown to have a high in vivo binding affinity for plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 (15Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Consistently, GFP-PH also specifically labeled the plasma membrane and was highly concentrated at the septum of dividing cells (Fig. 9 C). Expression of GFP-PH induced an increased sensitivity to FK506 in wild-type cells and lowered the restrictive temperature of the its3-1 mutation, suggesting sequestration of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 by GFP-PH (data not shown). In an attempt to identify genes that may have overlapping function with calcineurin, we isolated a fission yeast geneits3 +. Five lines of evidence show that Its3 is a functional homologue of PI(4)P5K. First, its3 +encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to the budding yeast Mss4 and mammalian PI(4)P5K. Second, the FK506 and temperature sensitivity of its3-1 mutant was complemented by expression of Mss4 and murine PI(4)P5K, but not by expression of human PI(5)P4K. Third, the level of PI(4,5)P2 was severely reduced and the PI(4)P level was significantly elevated in the its3-1mutant. Fourth, overexpression of Its3 in wild-type cells resulted in a significant increase in the levels of PI(4,5)P2. Fifth, Its3 fused with GST showed in vitro PI(4)P5K activity. The its3-1 mutant, which exhibits a immunosuppressant- and temperature-sensitive phenotype, carries a single base pair mutation in the PI(4)P5K gene that leads to the production of PI(4,5)P2 at approximately 10% of the normal level. Here, we have shown that the Δppb1 its3-1 double mutant is inviable. These findings of strong genetic interactions between Ppb1 calcineurin and Its3 PI(4)P5K mutation provide in vivo support for a functional interaction between calcineurin and PI(4)P5K. PI(4)P5K catalyzes the production of PI(4,5)P2, which serves as a precursor for diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate in signal transduction cascades. Recent studies suggest that there is yet another signaling mode controlled by PI(4,5)P2, and this novel cascade depends on intact PI(4,5)P2 rather than on the products of its hydrolysis (22Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We first examined the possibility that the synthetic lethality is caused by the lowered level of the hydrolysis products. Protein kinase C, a target molecule of diacylglycerol, appeared not to be involved in this genetic interaction because the its3-1 mutant phenotypes were not rescued by overexpression of Pck1 or Pck2. In addition, osmotic stabilization, which suppressed loss of Pck1 function in budding yeast (25Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), could not suppress both the temperature- and FK506-sensitive phenotypes (data not shown). It is also unlikely that a requirement for inositol triphosphate causes the synthetic lethality, because theplc1 null mutant is not sensitive to FK506 (data not shown). These results suggest that PI(4,5)P2 itself serves as an important regulator of cellular events related to calcineurin. It will be important in future studies to identify downstream components of PI(4,5)P2-mediated signaling pathway responsible for the overlapping function with calcineurin. It has been suggested that PI(4,5)P2regulates the actin cytoskeleton via its binding to various actin-binding proteins (27Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol.

In the present study, phalloidin staining of its3-1 mutant cells revealed a random distribution of cortical actin patches at restrictive temperature (Fig.7 A). Notably, disorganized actin cytoskeleton has been previously identified in budding yeast mss4 mutants (20Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15787-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,21Homma K. Terui S. Minemura M. Qadota H. Anraku Y. Kanaho Y. Ohya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15779-15786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mss4 and Its3 PI(4)P5K are involved in the organization of actin cytoskeleton in a similar regulatory mechanism. Interestingly, marked disorganization of actin patches inits3-1 mutants was also induced by the addition of FK506 (Fig. 7 A), suggesting involvement of calcineurin in actin cytoskeleton organization. When its3-1 mutant cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature or to the media containing FK506, the actin ring formation was unaffected, even when actin patches were severely disorganized. Thus, its3-1 mutation is not defective in actin ring formation, but does seem to be defective in the actin patch formation. These results suggest that there may be some intrinsic difference in actin dynamics between actin patches and ring which renders actin patches more sensitive to loss of PI(4,5)P2. As described in a previous study (4Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disruption of Ppb1 calcineurin or incubation with FK506 resulted in the appearance of abnormally septated and branched cells. In the present study, we also showed that the addition of FK506 to the culture media increased the percentage of septated cells up to 45% 15 h after drug addition. From these observations, together with examination of microtubule distribution, it has been suggested that the progression of cytokinesis was delayed and the positioning of septation became abnormal in calcineurin null mutant (4Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise,its3-1 mutant cells had a septation index approximately twice that seen in wild-type cells at the permissive temperature, and showed a dramatic increase (from 24 to 50%) in the index upon shift to the restrictive temperature (Fig. 8 B). These observations, together with the enriched localization of GFP-Its3 PI(4)P5K and GFP-PH at septum of dividing cells indicate that Its3 PI(4)P5K and PI(4,5)P2 are implicated for efficient cytokinesis. Furthermore, addition of FK506 to the culture media dramatically increased the septation index of its3-1 mutant cells, and the septation index reached nearly 100% only 6 h after drug addition. These results suggest that PI(4)P5K and calcineurin coordinately regulate cytokinesis. The G281D mutation resulted in a drastic change in its subcellular distribution (Fig. 9 B). The mutant Its3 was no longer localized to plasma membrane, indicating that proper localization of Its3 protein is deteriorated in the its3-1 mutant. This mislocalization may lead to the reduced level of PI(4,5)P2in the its3-1 mutant, presumably due to substrate unavailability or inaccessibility. Based on these results, we propose that a membrane localization of Its3 is the crucial event in cytokinesis. Recently, Vancurova et al. (33Vancurova I. Choi J.H. Lin H. Kuret J. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) purified and characterized PI(4)P5K from the plasma membranes of S. pombe. They also provided evidence that PI(4)P5K is phosphorylated and inactivated by Cki1, theS. pombe homologue of casein kinase I. Phosphorylation by Cki1 in vitro decreased the activity of PI(4)P5K, and overexpression of Cki1 in S. pombe resulted in a reduced synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and in a lower activity of PI(4)P5K associated with the plasma membrane. From the results they concluded that PI(4)P5K is a target of Cki1 in S. pombe and that Cki1 is involved in the regulation of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating PI(4)P5K. Robinson et al.(34Robinson L.C. Bradley C. Bryan J.D. Jerome A. Kweon Y. Panek H.R. Mol. Biol.

Taken together, our present results showing the genetic interaction between calcineurin and PI(4)P5K raise the intriguing possibility that Ppb1 calcineurin may directly or indirectly activate Its3 PI(4)P5K through dephosphorylation.

In rat femoral osteoblasts held in whole cell clamp there is a robust NMDA current but little if any response to l-glutamate. We have investigated expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in these cells. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we have detected expression of mGluR1b (but not mGluR1a, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Blockade of mGluRs with (±)-α-methyl-carboxyphenyl-glycine resulted in an enlarged l-glutamate-induced current that resembled the response to NMDA. Conversely, prior stimulation of mGluRs withtrans-(±)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD; mGluR agonist) reduced the NMDA-induced current by 77%. Monitoring of [Ca2+]i showed that NMDA induced a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i, which was dependent upon [Ca2+]o. Treatment with 1S,3R-ACPD generated an initial transient that was independent of [Ca2+]o, followed by a sustained, [Ca2+]o-dependent phase, a response consistent with phospholipase C-mediated mobilization of stored Ca2+. Investigations of the interaction between the two receptors confirmed inhibitory modulation of the NMDA receptor-induced rise in [Ca2+]i by mGluRs. Parathyroid hormone, which also activates phospholipase C in osteoblasts, had a similar inhibitory effect on the NMDA receptor-induced [Ca2+]i response. Elevation of [Ca2+]i mediated by mGluR activation was reduced by subsequent stimulation of NMDA receptors.

Bone. 1999; 25: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Antagonists of NMDA receptors modulate the activities of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the bone cells responsible for deposition and resorbtion of bone matrix (10Chenu C. Serre M.C. Raynal C. Burt-Pichat B. Delmas D.P. Bone. 1998; 22: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Peet N.M. Grabowski P.S. Laketic-Ljubojevic I. Skerry T.M.

These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated signaling occurs in bone, in a manner analogous to glutamatergic transmission between neurons, and that it contributes to regulation of bone matrix (19Skerry T.M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1999; 17: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The NMDA receptor is part of a complex glutamatergic system in the central nervous system, comprising several receptor types. Glutamate receptors can be divided into iGluRs (including the NMDA type found in bone) and mGluRs. mGluRs are G-protein-linked receptors that stimulate PLC (group 1 mGluRs) or inhibit adenyl cyclase (group 2 and group 3 mGluRs) (20Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). There is believed to be “cross-talk” between the different glutamate receptor subtypes, primarily by mGluRs acting to regulate activity of iGluRs (20Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). To date, only iGluRs, primarily the NMDA-type, have been detected in bone cells (10Chenu C. Serre M.C. Raynal C. Burt-Pichat B. Delmas D.P. Bone. 1998; 22: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Patton J.A. Genever G.P. Birch A.M. Suva J.L. Skerry T.M. Bone. 1998; 22: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).The first electrophysiological study of the action of glutamate on bone-derived cells used the human osteoblast-like MG-63 cell line. Bath-applied l-glutamate and NMDA had very similar effects on these cells, with both agonists markedly increasing membrane conductance (21Laketic-Ljubojevic I. Suva J.L. Maathuis J.M.F. Sanders D. Skerry T.M. Bone. 1999; 25: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, during our studies on NMDA-induced currents in femoral explant-derived osteoblasts of rat (15Gu Y. Genever P.G. Skerry T.M. Publicover S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 2000; 523: P155Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we made the surprising observation that the responses to NMDA andl-glutamate differed markedly. Cells that showed a well developed response to bath-applied NMDA gave only a very small current upon application of l-glutamate. This finding suggests the expression in femoral osteoblasts of a second type of glutamate receptor, which negatively modulates the NMDA receptor/channel. We have therefore looked for mGluRs in rat femoral osteoblasts and examined the effects of their activation on osteoblastic NMDA receptor/channels. We report that mGluR-1b receptors are expressed in these cells, that their activation mobilizes stored Ca2+ within the cell, and that they negatively regulate the activity of the osteoblastic NMDA receptor/channel.RESULTSReverse Transcription PCRTo investigate the possible expression of mGluRs in rat femoral explant-derived osteoblasts, reverse transcription PCR was carried out using primers directed against rat mGluR1a, mGluR1b, mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4, mGluR5, and mGluR6. Products of the appropriate size were detected with all six primer pairs in rat brain (Fig.1, a–d). mGluR1 and mGluR5 occurred as both a and b subtypes. Using rat femoral osteoblast cDNA, we detected the presence of message for mGluR1b of appropriate size (Fig. 1 a; 378 bp) but no other mGluR types. Control reactions carried out with total osteoblast RNA gave no product. Sequencing showed that osteoblast mGluR1b product was identical to the rat brain mGluR1b sequence.The intensity of the band for mGluR1b product generated from osteoblast cDNA appeared weaker than that for the brain (Fig. 1 a;n = 10). To confirm this difference, the cDNA templates from osteoblasts and from brain were serially diluted in 10-fold steps (down to 10−4) before carrying out the PCR reaction. The level of dilution necessary to prevent detectable formation of a product from osteoblast cDNA was 10−2–10−3, but a dilution of 10−3–10−4 of the brain cDNA was required (Fig. 1 e). Similar results were obtained in each of three separate experiments.Recent findings suggest that the NMDAR-2C subunit may be required for inhibitory modulation of the NMDA receptor by mGluRs (Ref. 26Pizzi M. Boroni F. Moraitis K. Bianchetti A. Memo M. Spano P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2489-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). PCR using femoral osteoblast cDNA and NMDAR-2C primers gave a product of the appropriate size (359 bp), the sequence of which was identical to the relevant portion of the rat brain NMDAR-2C sequence.ElectrophysiologyCurrents Induced by NMDA andl-GlutamateFunctional NMDA receptors are present in approximately 25% of femoral osteoblasts in primary culture (15Gu Y. Genever P.G. Skerry T.M. Publicover S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 2000; 523: P155Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Addition of 100 μm NMDA plus 10 μm glycine to the inflow of the recording chamber induced prolonged, slowly desensitizing inward currents with a mean peak amplitude of 77.8 ± 7.4 pA (mean ± S.E.; n = 9). When the same cells were superfused, with 100 μm l-glutamate plus 10 μm glycine, currents were very small, often appearing as little more than an increase in noise. Mean glutamate current amplitude was 17.4 ± 0.9 pA (n = 9; p < 0.00002 compared with effect of NMDA; Fig. 2 a). The effect of l-glutamate plus 10 μm glycine was investigated in a further 20 cells in which the action of NMDA was not measured. Currents greater than 20 pA were never seen.Figure 2Modulation of NMDA receptor currents by mGluR activation. a, blockade of mGluRs restores NMDA receptor current. Left and center panels shows whole cell currents elicited by 100 μm NMDA and 100 μm l-glutamate (shaded bars; both co-applied with 10 μm glycine) respectively, in the same cell. The response to NMDA was completely inhibited by 100 nm (+)-MK-801 (filled bar). Whenl-glutamate was reapplied, in the presence of 500 μm (±)MCPG (right panel, open bar), the response was greatly enhanced, reaching a peak similar to that seen with NMDA. The (±)MCPG-enhanced response tol-glutamate was blocked by 100 nm (+)-MK-801.Scale bar shows 60 pA and 80 s. Similar data were obtained from three other cells. b, stimulation of mGluRs inhibits the NMDA receptor current.

Similar data were obtained from three other cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of an mGluR Antagonist on the Currents Induced byl-GlutamateTo investigate the possible involvement of mGluR receptors in the differing effects of NMDA andl-glutamate, we used the mGluR antagonist (±)MCPG. After superfusion with NMDA and l-glutamate (both with 10 μm glycine), we reapplied l-glutamate plus 10 μm glycine in the presence of 500 μm(±)MCPG. Inclusion of (±)MCPG converted the small currents induced by 100 μm l-glutamate (18.5 ± 2.7 pA;n = 4) to larger responses (87.5 ± 18.7 pAn = 4; p < 0.025 compared withl-glutamate alone) that were similar in amplitude to those evoked by NMDA (89.0 +18.0 pA; n = 4; p> 0.2). This glutamate-induced current was blocked by 100 nm (+)-MK-801 (Fig. 2 a).Effect of an mGluR Agonist on the Currents Induced by NMDABecause blockade of mGluR receptors enabled glutamate to induce inward currents similar to those evoked by NMDA, we investigated the effect of the mGluR agonist 1S,3R-ACPD on the NMDA response. 100 μm NMDA and 10 μmglycine were applied briefly to confirm the presence of an NMDA current and to determine peak current amplitude (65.5 ± 12.0 pA;n = 4). When NMDA and glycine were reapplied to the cells in combination with 300 μm1S,3R-ACPD, the peak current amplitude was reduced to 15.0 +2.2 pA. (n = 4; p < 0.02 compared with amplitude in the absence of 1S,3R-ACPD; Fig. 2 b).[Ca2+]i Changes in Stimulated CellsEffect of NMDA100 μm NMDA plus 10 μm glycine induced a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i (n = 10). This response was reversed, in a dose-dependent manner, by (+)-MK-801 (Fig. 3 a). When Ca2+-free medium was used (0 Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA), no response to NMDA was seen (Fig. 3 a;n = 5).Figure 3Elevation of [Ca2+]iupon stimulation of NMDARs and mGluRs. a, left panel, addition of 100 μm NMDA (with 10 μm glycine; shaded bar) to the cuvette caused a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i. This effect was reversed by (+)-MK-801 (filled bars) in a dose-dependent manner. Similar data were obtained in four other experiments. Right panel, application of 100 μm NMDA (with 10 μm glycine) to cells bathed in Ca2+-free medium caused no increase in [Ca2+]i. Similar data were obtained in four other experiments. Scale bar shows Δratio 340/380 and time in seconds for both traces. b, left panel, application of 300 μm 1S,3R-ACPD (shaded bar) caused a [Ca2+]i peak followed by a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (see also Fig. 4 b). Similar results were obtained in two other experiments. Right panel, application of 300 μm 1S,3R-ACPD to cells bathed in Ca2+-free medium caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, which then fell back to control levels within 100 s. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments. Scale bar shows Δratio 340/380 and time in seconds for both traces.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Elevation of [Ca2+]i Induced by 1S,3R-ACPDIn Ca2+-containing medium, 300 μm 1S,3R-ACPD induced a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, lasting approximately 90 s, followed by a sustained plateau (Fig. 3 b; n= 7). When 1S,3R-ACPD was applied in Ca2+-free saline, a similar transient was seen, but [Ca2+]i then fell to levels similar to those before 1S,3R-ACPD addition (Fig. 3 b;n = 3). Addition of 75 nm ionomycin, to deplete internal stores of Ca2+, caused a small, sustained rise in [Ca2+]i. Subsequent addition of 1S,3R-ACPD did not cause an elevation of [Ca2+]i (data not shown).Interactions between NMDA Receptors, mGluR1b Receptors, and PTH Receptors in Modulating [Ca2+]iTo observe interactions between the two types of glutamate receptors in their modulation of [Ca2+]i, we investigated the effects of sequential additions of agonists. Upon addition of 100 μm NMDA and 10 μm glycine to the cuvette, a sustained increase in [Ca2+]iwas observed, as described above (n = 5). When 200 μm 1S,3R-ACPD was added to the cuvette, the elevated [Ca2+]i fell within 1–2 min to a value approximately midway between the peak response and that before addition of NMDA, and thereafter continued to fall more slowly (Fig. 4 a). When (±)MCPG and (+)-MK-801 were then added together, [Ca2+]ifell, within 5 min, to levels close to the starting, basal level. However, it was noticeable that, when these antagonists were added, there was an initial increase in [Ca2+]i, lasting approximately 90 s, before the level fell (Fig. 4 a). Similar results were obtained in four other experiments.Because the effect of activation of mGluR1b is believed to be exerted through stimulation of Gq and PLC (20Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of PTH, which is also able to activate this pathway (27Civitelli R. Reid I.R. Westbrook S. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E660-E667PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schwindinger W.F. Fredricks J. Watkins L. Robinson H. Bathon J.M. Pines M. Suva L.J. Levine M.A. Endocrine. 1999; 8: 201-209Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After application of NMDA the [Ca2+]i response was allowed to develop, and 100 nm PTH was then added to the cuvette. The effect of PTH was similar to that of 1S,3R-ACPD, causing [Ca2+]ito fall rapidly to a point approximately midway between the basal and NMDA-enhanced levels (Fig. 4 a). Similar results were obtained in two other experiments.We also investigated whether prior addition of 1S,3R-ACPD would blunt the response to subsequent activation of NMDA receptors. Fig. 4 b shows the results obtained when glutamate plus 10 μm glycine was applied after stimulation of mGluRs. 300 μm1S,3R-ACPD caused an initial [Ca2+]i transient followed by a sustained plateau. Subsequent addition of 100 μm l-glutamate and 10 μm glycine (stimulating both NMDA receptors and mGluRs) reduced[Ca2+]i (Fig. 4 b; n = 5). When (±)MCPG was added to block mGluRs, [Ca2+]i rose again to a sustained plateau (Fig.4 b). Similar results were obtained in three other experiments.DISCUSSIONThe data described here are, to our knowledge, the first evidence that bone cells express mGluRs. PCR analysis of cDNA from cultured femoral osteoblasts indicates that these cells express exclusively the type 1b mGluR. Stimulation of group 1 mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) activates PLC and consequent generation of IP3 and diacylglycerol, although an increase in [cAMP] has been reported (20Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). In accordance with the predicted linkage of mGluR1b to PLC, we observed an elevation of [Ca2+]i upon exposure of the cells to 1S,3R-ACPD. The initial phase of this response was not sensitive to [Ca2+]o and thus reflects mobilization of stored Ca2+. A subsequent, sustained phase of the [Ca2+]i response to 1S,3R-ACPD required extracellular Ca2+ and probably reflects capacitative Ca2+influx. The occurrence of capacitative influx in osteoblasts has been proposed on the basis of the effects of thapsigargin and A23187 (29Wiemann M. Busselberg D. Schirrmacher K. Bingmann D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 63: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,30Wiemann M. Schirrmacher K. Busselberg D. Calcif.

Genever P.G. Skerry T.M. Publicover S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 2000; 523: P155Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were not seen during superfusion with l-glutamate. We report here that blockade of mGluRs with (±)MCPG restored the NMDAR current, and the effect of NMDA was strongly inhibited by 1S,3R-ACPD, confirming that the difference between the effects of NMDA and l-glutamate was the result of inhibitory cross-talk between mGluRs and NMDARs. Fluorimetric measurements showed that the action of NMDA to elevate [Ca2+]i was also subject to mGluR modulation, being partially suppressed by 1S,3R-ACPD.The majority of previous studies have demonstrated enhancement of NMDA responses upon activation of mGluRs (31Bleakman D. Rusin K.I. Chard P.S. Glaum S.R. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 192-196PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kelso S.R. Nelson T.E. Leonard J.P. J. Physiol.

Rowan M.J. Anwyl R. Nature. 1994; 367: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but inhibitory effects mediated through group 1 (PLC-linked) mGluRs have also been reported (35Courtney M. Nicholls G.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Collwell C.S. Levine M.S. Neuroscience. 1994; 17: 441-464Google Scholar, 37Pizzi M. Galli P. Consolandi O.

(Lond. ). 1997; 499: 721-732Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The inhibitory pathway varies, being via generation of diacylglycerol and protein kinase C activation (mimicked by 4β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; Ref. 35Courtney M. Nicholls G.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or by a staurosporine-resistant mechanism (38Yu S.P. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.T. Buisson A. Choi D.W. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1997; 499: 721-732Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The nature of mGluR-mediated modulation of NMDARs may be determined by expression of NMDAR-2 subtypes. Pizzi et al. (37Pizzi M. Galli P. Consolandi O. Arrighi V. Memo M. Spano P.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar) observed a neuroprotective action of mGluR 1/5 activation in cerebellar granule cells. This effect was exerted through a protein kinase C-mediated, inhibitory effect of group 1 mGluR stimulation on glutamate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i (37Pizzi M. Galli P. Consolandi O. Arrighi V. Memo M. Spano P.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar). Pizzi et al. reported that this effect correlated specifically with expression of NMDAR-2C. In NMDAR-2C-depleted neurons, both group 1 mGluR-activation and protein kinase C stimulationenhanced NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx (26Pizzi M. Boroni F. Moraitis K. Bianchetti A. Memo M. Spano P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2489-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our finding that NMDAR-2C is expressed in rat osteoblasts, where the influence of mGluR activation is inhibitory, is in accord with this idea. NMDAR-2D is also known to be expressed in bone cells (11Patton J.A. Genever G.P. Birch A.M. Suva J.L. Skerry T.M. Bone. 1998; 22: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).It has been reported that compounds that interact with mGluRs may also act at NMDARs, primarily as antagonists in the presence of subsaturating doses of agonist (39Contractor A. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The modulation of NMDA currents and [Ca2+]i responses, by mGluR ligands, reported here might therefore reflect a direct action on the NMDAR. However, we consider this most unlikely for the following reasons: (i) We have measured currents induced in osteoblasts by both 100 μmand 1 mm NMDA (in the presence of saturating doses of glycine as used in this study) and observed no significant difference in current amplitude. 3Y. Gu and S. J. Publicover, unpublished observations. We are therefore confident that 100 mm NMDA is a saturating or nearly saturating dose. (ii) At the doses used in our experiments (100 μm NMDA, 10 μm glycine), 1S,3R-ACPD may have a minor inhibitory effect (up to15%) on the amplitude of NMDA currents (39Contractor A. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We observed 75–80% inhibition of the response to NMDA. (iii) At the NMDA receptor agonist dosages that we employed, (±)MCPG, like 1S,3R-ACPD, may act as a weak antagonist of the NMDA receptor (39Contractor A. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, (±)MCPG enhanced the response of the osteoblastic NMDA receptor, consistent with a reduction of mGluR-mediated inhibition of NMDARs. (iv) PTH, which stimulates Gq similarly to activation of mGluR1b (20Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 28Schwindinger W.F. Fredricks J. Watkins L. Robinson H. Bathon J.M. Pines M. Suva L.J. Levine M.A. Endocrine. 1999; 8: 201-209Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), has an effect on [Ca2+]i that is strikingly similar to that of 1S,3R-ACPD. This observation is consistent with actions of both 1S,3R-ACPD and PTH to modulate [Ca2+]i through their activation of PLC, rather than a direct effect of 1S,3R-ACPD on the NMDA receptor. We conclude that our data reflect actions of these compounds on the mGluR1b receptor not direct effects on the NMDAR.NMDARs Inhibit the Response to mGluR ActivationAs well as inhibition of NMDA currents by activation of mGluRs, our measurements of [Ca2+]i also suggest that NMDAR activation may inhibit mGluR receptor-induced Ca2+ signaling. Whenl-glutamate was applied to cells 250 s after 1S,3R-ACPD (during the [Ca2+]o-dependent phase of the response), [Ca2+]i fell to a lower level than in the presence of 1S,3R-ACPD alone. An inhibitory effect of NMDAR activation on PLC has been described previously in CA1 neurons (40Morrisett R.A. Chow C.C. Sakaguchi T. Shin C. McNamara J.O. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar effect in cerebral cortex was irreversible, possibly reflecting NMDA-induced cellular damage (41Challis R.A. Mistry R. Gray D.W. Nahorski S.R. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When (±)MCPG and (+)-MK-801 were added to cells in which both NMDARs and mGluRs were stimulated (with NMDA and 1S,3R-ACPD), there was an initial increase in [Ca2+]i, lasting approximately 90 s before [Ca2+]i returned to control levels. This brief elevation of [Ca2+]i probably reflects a difference in the rate at which blockade of the two receptor-mediated pathways becomes effective, such that one becomes temporarily released from inhibition. The mGluR-mediated signal may persist because of a delay between blockade of mGluRs by (±)MCPG and the return of IP3 and diacylglycerol to resting levels. Alternatively, because the action of (+)-MK-801 on NMDARs is by open channel block (42Huettner J.E. Bean B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), blockade of NMDARs may proceed relatively slowly after application of the drug. However, in the present study the effect of (+)-MK-801 was normally complete within 10–20 s (Figs. 2 and 3).Functional SignificanceThe cells that we have used in this study are a primary culture derived from a load-bearing bone. These cells maintain osteoblastic characteristics in culture, including expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and osteocalcin (22Pitsillides A. Rawlinson S.C.F. Suswillo R.F.L. Bourrin S.

Where such homologs are secreted by parasites into their environment in the mammalian host, it seems likely that they play an important role in mimicking or interfering with host molecules, to ensure the long term survival of the parasite. Many of these homologs are derived from ancestral gene families shared between host and parasite, while others may have evolved convergently as adaptations to the parasitic mode of life. One parasite with remarkable longevity in vertebrate tissues is the nematode Toxocara canis. Although the life cycle is completed only in the definitive canine host, larval stages are capable of infecting a vast range of organisms, including humans in whom it causes visceral and ocular larva migrans (6Glickman L.T. Lewis J.W. Maizels R.M. Toxocara and Toxocariasis: Epidemiological, Clinical and Molecular Perspectives. Institute of Biology, London1993: 3-10Google Scholar). The immune system is singularly ineffective against the larvae, due in part to the parasite's ability to shed its surface coat when under attack from antibodies and/or leukocytes (7Smith H.V.

Parasitol. 1992; 75: 72-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, larvae release prodigious quantities of heavily glycosylated Toxocaraexcretory/secretory (TES)1antigens, which can be collected by in vitro cultivation (11Maizels R.M. de Savigny D.

Prominent among these antigenic components are the TES-120 glycoproteins (15Page A.P. Hamilton A.J. Maizels R.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a closely migrating set ofO-glycosylated proteins, which are major constituents of both the larval surface coat and the TES antigens (10Page A.P.

The structures of the predominant O-glycans on TES glycoproteins have been determined as two closely related novel trisaccharides, 2-O-Me-Fuc(α1→2)4-O-Me-Gal(β1→3)-GalNAc and 2-O-Me-Fuc(α1→2) Gal(β1→3)-GalNAc (17Khoo K.-H.

Maizels R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The protein product of Tc-muc-1 encodes a small protein with a signal peptide but no trans-membrane domain, indicating that it may fall into the category of a secreted mucin (20Gendler S.J.

However, surface labeling and monoclonal antibody studies have also established thatTc-MUC-1 is present on the extracellular surface coat of the larval parasite (10Page A.P. Rudin W. Fluri E.

Tc-MUC-1 contains a C-terminal pair of six-cysteine 36-amino acid domains originally termed the NC6 (nematode-six-cysteine) motif (19Gems D.H. Maizels R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A similar motif has recently been identified in non-nematode proteins (24Daub J. Loukas A. Pritchard D. Blaxter M.L. Parasitology. 2000; 120: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) such as cnidarian potassium channel blocking toxins (25Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct.

Science. 1998; 282: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The discovery of a mucin-like surface coat/secreted product of tissue-dwelling nematodes provides intriguing parallels with transformed mammalian cells, which may express aberrant mucin forms and gain metastatic potential as a result (29Bresalier R.S.

Although there is no sequence homology between nematode and vertebrate mucins, both groups combine diverse repetitive Ser/Thr-rich tracts with flanking cysteine-rich domains (21Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 32Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Live adult T. canis were recovered from naturally infected dogs, and female worms were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing penicillin (100 units·ml−1), streptomycin (100 μg·ml−1), gentamicin (25 μg·ml−1), and amphotericin B (2.5 μg·ml−1) for 5 days. Culture media were replaced daily, and eggs liberated into the media were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Eggs were hatched and infective larvae were maintained in vitro in serum-free RPMI 1640, as described previously (33Page A.P. Richards D.T. Lewis J.W. Omar H.M. Maizels R.M. Parasitology. 1991; 103: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Spent tissue culture medium containing material released by live parasites was collected and concentrated using an Amicon 10 ultraconcentrator (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C. This material is referred to as TES product. A cDNA library made from mRNA of T. canis infective larvae cloned into the λ-phage vector Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene) was a generous gift from Dr. C. Tripp and Dr. R. Grieve (Heska Corp., Fort Collins, CO). From this library, 261 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated in our laboratory (34Tetteh K.K.A. Loukas A. Tripp C. Maizels R.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cDNAs for Tc-muc-1 (19Gems D.H. Maizels R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and an additional three mucin genes were identified. Plasmids were generated from each of these clones, and the inserts were sequenced in full using a combination of vector-derived and gene-specific primers. All of the ESTs encoding the mucins were truncated at the 5′ end. True 5′ ends of each cDNA were therefore isolated from the cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction using a combination of gene-specific and nematode spliced leader 1 (SL-1) (22Gems D.H.

Sequencing was performed using the AmpliTaq DyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) and an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Analyses of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were performed using the MacVector 6.0 software program (Oxford Molecular). Data base searches were performed using the BLAST server to search a nonredundant set of data bases (36Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were performed using the GCG PILEUP program (Genetics Computer Group) and Boxshade server. The translated protein sequence was analyzed using the SignalP program in order to identify a putative signal peptide and corresponding cleavage point (37von Heijne G.

Primers were designed to clone regions encoding the SXC domains 1–2 of Tc-MUC-1 and SXC domains 1–2 of Tc-MUC-3, as these segments showed most divergence in protein sequence. The resulting amplicons were cloned into the T-ended expression vector pET-29T (Novagen), and the ligated products were transformed into competent Escherichia colistrain XL1-blue, which lacks the T7 RNA polymerase gene; plasmids from cells carrying the insert were then transformed into E. colistrain BL21 carrying the DE3 episome, which possesses T7 RNA polymerase. Both recombinant proteins were soluble only in the presence of 6 m urea and were purified using a metal chelation resin (His Bind Resin; Novagen) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Urea was removed by stepwise dialysis against Tris-buffered saline. BALB/c mice were immunized with either rTc-MUC-1 or rTc-MUC-3 (10 μg) emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant followed by two boosts at days 28 and 42 with 10 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, administered via the subcutaneous route. Sera were collected at day 49. Recombinant proteins (0.5 μg) and TES products (2.5 μg) were electrophoretically separated, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, then probed with sera from mice immunized with the respective recombinant proteins and with normal mouse serum (diluted 1:1,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:2,000; Bio-Rad). Incubation times were all for 60 min, separated by four 5-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween. Blots were developed using the chemiluminescent substrate ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Four micrograms of TES products were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Stains-all (Bio-Rad) and the bands corresponding to TES-120 identified. Approximately 210 μg of TES products were then carboxymethylated with 50 μCi of iodo[2-14C]acetic acid; 53 μg of the labeled TES products were applied to a Q-Sepharose column (15 μm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to strong anion exchange (SAX) chromatography. Fractions were eluted using a gradient of 0–1m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20% acetonitrile. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and three fractions containing TES-120 were subjected to further purification by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a C18 column (MZ-Analysen Technik, Germany). Fractions were eluted using a gradient of 3–100% buffer B (0.9% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) in buffer A (0.11% trifluoroacetic acid in water). Proteins in both SAX and RP-HPLC fractions were detected at 220 nm using tryptophan fluorescence (excitation 295 nm/emission >310 nm). A total of seven fractions were analyzed for total amino acid composition, and for mass values by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Three fractions contained sufficient material for proteolytic digestion with trypsin and Asp-N proteases. Peptides were purified on RP-HPLC and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. Where quantities of peptide permitted, N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by Edman degradation.

We therefore constructed separate alignments of SXC domains -1 and -2 of Tc-MUC-1 with BgK (Protein Data Bank code 1BGK) and ShK (Protein Data Bank code1ROO).

Moreover, several additional ESTs corresponded to related but distinct genes. All were truncated, so full-length clones were isolated from the cDNA library and fully sequenced. These novel apomucins were designated Tc-muc-2, Tc-muc-3, andTc-muc-4, and their predicted protein sequences are schematically represented in Fig. 1.Figure 1Schematic representation of four T. canis mucin predicted proteins.

The mature proteins are all combinations of two distinct modules, one being the mucin-like Ser-/Thr-rich tract which acts as a locus for O-glycosylation, and the other being pairs of 36-amino acid SXC domains. All proteins contain C-terminal paired SXC motifs, while Tc-MUC-3 also contains two N-terminal units. The predominance of either Ser/Thr in the repeat regions varies between proteins: Tc-MUC-1 is Ser-rich, while the rest have varying repetitive units of Thr, Gly, Pro, and Ala, all with a predominance of Thr. The cysteine-rich SXC domains show a high level of conservation, with the N-terminal Tc-MUC-3 sequence being the most diverse. The C-terminal domains of Tc-MUC-1, -2, and -4 share between 86% and 97% identity with each other (Fig. 2). The N-terminal SXC domains ofTc-MUC-3 are less similar to the C-terminal domains of both itself (58%) and the other three proteins (67–70%), while the C-terminal SXC domains of Tc-MUC-3 share between 65–68% identity with the other proteins (Fig. 2). The high level of amino acid identity betweenTc-MUC-1, -2, and -4 (Fig. 2) makes it unlikely that a specific antiserum could distinguish between these proteins. Although the Ser/Thr-rich repeat units of each protein are distinct,O-glycosylation of this tract in vivo may render antisera raised to recombinant constructs useless for recognizing the native proteins. However, the N-terminal SXC region ofTc-MUC-3 bears sufficient differences from the other mucins to raise specific antibodies to this protein. At the same time, we generated antibody to the SXC domains of Tc-MUC-1. TES products, secreted in vitro by live larval parasites, were then separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. This showed that antiserum raised to Tc-MUC-3 SXC domains 1–2 (rTc-MUC-3) recognized a higher molecular weight band of the TES-120 family (Fig. 3), confirming thatTc-MUC-3 is indeed a secreted glycoprotein. The antiserum raised to recombinant Tc-MUC-1 SXC domains (rTc-MUC-1) was, as expected, less specific in its recognition of TES-120 proteins, binding to multiple bands most of which were of lower apparent molecular weight than the band recognized by anti-rTc-MUC-3 serum (Fig. 3). TES-120 components, which migrate in 5–25% gradient SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa, were then fractionated by sequential ion-exchange and RP-HPLC. Fig. 4 A shows the protein profile of unfractionated TES products on SDS-PAGE, as revealed by Stains-all, which produces a distinct blue staining of TES-120, reflecting its high carbohydrate content. SAX chromatography was then used to separate TES-120 (fractions 4–6) from the remaining TES proteins (fractions 7 and 8) (Fig. 4 B). Each of the TES-120 fractions were then separated using reverse-phase HPLC, resulting in samples containing proteins of distinct mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 C). Each of the fractions shown in Fig. 4 C was subjected, without proteolytic degradation, to mass spectrometric determination of molecular weight and amino acid compositional analysis. Table Isummarizes these results, in which four distinct molecular masses are defined. In each case, the true mass is less than half the apparent molecular weight on SDS-PAGE, attributable to the high carbohydrate content. Fraction 4.2, which displays the largest band on SDS-PAGE, has the highest mass (53.7 kDa), and is threonine/alanine-rich with little serine. In contrast, fraction 5.2 contains the smallest protein (39.7 kDa) (Fig. 5) and is markedly serine-rich (23–25 mol %) and is histidine-free (data not shown). Two further species, of 47.8 and 45.0 kDa, are in fractions 5.3 and 6.1 (Fig. 5), respectively, but are similar with respect to threonine/alanine abundance.Table IAmino acid and mass analysis of seven fractions of TES-120 proteinsFractionMass presentMol %Putative gene productSerThrAla4.253.7628234.339.8, 47.92512135.239.7231415Tc-MUC-15.347.8181717Tc-MUC-26.145.082222Tc-MUC-36.239.5, 47.8819186.339.4, 47.972116 Open table in a new tab Sufficient material was available in some fractions to perform proteolysis with trypsin and Asp-N followed by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation of N-terminal residues. From fraction 5.2, the major tryptic fragment was found to derive from a region with identical peptide sequence between Tc-MUC-1 and Tc-MUC-2, but two Asp-N peptides gave masses consistent with Tc-MUC-1 and not with Tc-MUC-2, in each case due to a single amino acid difference (Fig. 6). One of these residues (Thr-117 in Tc-MUC-1) was confirmed by Edman degradation (Table II). Thus, the previously described Tc-MUC-1 protein can be assigned to the 39.7-kDa component of fraction 5.2, on the basis of peptide mass and sequence, and the remarkably high serine content (33% from gene sequence; 23–25% in compositional analysis).Table IIPeptide sequences and mass analysis from purified mucinsPeptideSequenceMassCorresponds toPredicted massProtein 5.2 Tryptic peptideTCNIC3672.6Tc-MUC-1 136–1663671.0 5.2.T.7Tc-MUC-2 142–1723671.0 AspN peptideTPLCF3396.1Tc-MUC-1 117–1433395.8 5.2.N.2 AspN peptideDCANFV3499.6Tc-MUC-1 148–1763499.0 5.2.N.7Protein 5.3 Tryptic peptideCALTCG(F)C999.1Tc-MUC-2 175–182991.3 5.3.T.7 Tryptic peptideTCNICSC3672.2Tc-MUC-1 136–1663671.0 5.3.T.9Tc-MUC-2 142–1723671.0 AspN peptideMPLCFVQPYSRAIQGRCR3426.7Tc-MUC-2 123–1493425.9 5.3.N.4 AspN peptideDCANFV3473.7Tc-MUC-2 154–1823472.9 5.3.N.9Protein 6.1 Tryptic peptideNot determined1796.4Tc-MUC-3 80–941795.9 6.1.T.1 Tryptic peptideNot determined1481.8Tc-MUC-3 208–2191481.6 6.1.T.2 Tryptic peptideNot determined3652.4Tc-MUC-3 228–2583651.9 6.1.T.3 Tryptic peptideNot determined1090.4Tc-MUC-3 261–2691090.4 6.1.T.4Peptides 5.2.N.2 and 5.3.N.4 were generated by AspN cleavage but did not commence with D.

Tc-MUC-2 is assigned to the 47.8-kDa component on the grounds of identical peptide mass and sequence, supported by the high threonine/alanine content of deduced sequence and purified protein. Moreover, the relatively high level of expression ofTc-MUC-2 (3/261 cDNAs) is consistent with the predominance of secreted mucins among the total protein synthetic profile of T. canis larvae. Tc-MUC-3 is assigned to the 45.0-kDa component, which migrates on SDS-PAGE with a higher apparent molecular weight than either Tc-MUC-1 or Tc-MUC-2 (Fig. 4) on the basis of selective antibody reactivity, and the presence of four proteolytic peptides with masses that match the deduced amino acid sequence (TableII). The difference in molecular weight between the precursor peptide and mature mucin is significantly lower for Tc-MUC-3 (TableIII), indicating that this may be less heavily glycosylated than the other two secreted mucins.Table IIIAssignation of mucin genes and proteinsMucin geneMassPredicted peptide mol.wtHPLC fraction no.aa compositionPeptide sequencePeptide massAntibody confirmationSerThrAlakDaMr%Tc-muc-139.715,7475.2331310YesYesYesTc-muc-247.816,1515.332923YesYesNoTc-muc-345.026,0126.172515NoYesYesTc-muc-4ND 3-aND, not determined.16,920ND23918NoNoNo3-a ND, not determined.

https://openalex.org/W2116011728,"Mutations of the tumor suppressor protein APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) are linked to familiar and sporadic human colon cancer. Here we describe a novel interaction between the APC protein and the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL carrying five PDZ protein-protein interaction domains. Exclusively, the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) of PTP-BL is binding to the extreme C-terminus of the APC protein, as determined by yeast two-hybrid studies. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis we established a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 8.1 x 10(-9) M. We find that a naturally occurring splice insertion of five amino acids (PDZ2b) abolishes its binding affinity to the APC protein. The in vivo interaction between PTP-BL and the APC protein was shown by coprecipitation experiments in transfected COS cells. Furthermore, in cultured epithelial Madine Carnine Kidney cells the subcellular colocalization was demonstrated for the nucleus and also for the tips of cellular extensions. The interaction of the APC protein with a protein tyrosine phosphatase may indirectly modulate the steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylations of associated proteins, such as beta-catenin playing a major role in the regulation of cell division, migration and cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2316819217,"Unlike cellular mRNA, retroviral mRNA bypasses the tight coupling of the splicing and nuclear export steps to allow the export of intron-containing viral RNA transcripts to the cytoplasm. Two distinct nuclear export pathways for retroviral mRNA have been described: a CRM-1 dependent pathway mediated by the HIV-1 Rev protein and the Rev Response Element (RRE), and a CRM-1 independent pathway mediated by the Constitutive Transport Element (CTE) of type D retroviruses. Two CTE-binding proteins, RNA helicase A (RHA) and Tap, have been implicated in the nuclear export of CTE-containing RNA. Recently, we reported that expression of RRE-containing RNA could also be mediated by a cellular protein, Sam68, independently of Rev. Here we report evidence that Sam68, RHA and Tap cooperate in the nuclear export of both CTE- and RRE-containing RNA. RHA binds to Sam68 and to Tap both in vivo and in vitro. Over-expression of Sam68 activates both RRE- and CTE-regulated reporter gene expression in human cells and in quail cells in the presence of human Tap. This activation was competitively inhibited by the nuclear transport domain (NTD) of RHA and a transdominant negative mutant of Tap. Conversely, the activation of CTE by Tap in quail cells was inhibited by a transdominant mutant of Sam68 and NTD. We propose that both HIV and type D retroviruses may access the same constitutive RNA nuclear export pathway involving RHA, Tap and Sam68, even though HIV also utilizes the Rev protein for more efficient nuclear export. it is likely that this constitutive export pathway is also used by cellular mRNA, but at a different interface with the splicing process."
https://openalex.org/W1966969821,"The potential role of the bcl-2 relative bcl-w as a physiological regulator of apoptosis in intestinal epithelia has been investigated. Immunoblots for bcl-w with new monoclonal antibodies revealed that it was expressed in the small intestine and colon, among other murine tissues, as well as in six human tumour cell lines of epithelial origin, including two colon carcinoma lines. To assess whether bcl-w regulates either spontaneous or damage-induced apoptosis in the small intestine or colon, apoptosis in intestinal crypts of bcl-w -/- and wild-type mice was quantified microscopically on a cell positional basis. Spontaneous apoptosis within crypt epithelia was not significantly increased by loss of bcl-w, in either the small intestine or midcolon. However, after treatment with the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil or with gamma-radiation, the bcl-w-null animals exhibited substantially more apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts in both tissues. The greatest enhancement of apoptosis attributable to the absence of bcl-w (up to sixfold) occurred in the small intestine. Hence, bcl-w is an important determinant of damage-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelia, and unlike bcl-2, which regulates only colonic apoptosis, plays a major role in small intestinal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2148547695,"G2A is a heptahelical cell surface protein that has recently been described as a potential tumor suppressor, based on its ability to counteract transformation of pre-B cells and fibroblasts by Bcr-Abl, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. We have isolated cDNAs encoding G2A in the course of screening libraries for clones that cause oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. When expressed at high levels in NIH3T3 cells by retroviral transduction, G2A induced a full range of phenotypes characteristic of oncogenic transformation, including loss of contact inhibition, anchorage-independent survival and proliferation, reduced dependence on serum, and tumorigenicity in mice. When expressed by transfection, G2A greatly enhanced the ability of a weakly oncogenic form of Raf-1 to transform NIH3T3 cells. These results demonstrate that G2A is potently oncogenic both on its own and in cooperation with another oncogene. Expression of G2A in fibroblasts and endothelial cells resulted in changes in cell morphology and cytoskeleton structure that were equivalent to those induced by the G protein subunit Galpha13. Transformation of NIH3T3 cells via G2A expression was completely suppressed by co-expression of LscRGS, a GTPase activating protein that suppresses signaling by Galpha12 and Galpha13. Hyperactivity of Galpha12 or Galpha13 has previously been shown to result in activation of Rho GTPases. G2A expression resulted in activation of Rho, and transformation via G2A was suppressed by a dominant negative form of RhoA. These results indicate that G2A may be directly coupled to Galpha13, and that it is the activation of this Rho-activating Galpha protein which is responsible for the ability of G2A to transform fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2145894605,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family proteins were originally identified as cytokine-induced negative regulators of cytokine signaling. We show that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibit interleukin (IL)-4-dependent signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) activation of and subsequent gene induction. By contrast, SOCS-2 and cytokine-inducible Src homology domain 2 (SH2)-containing protein up-regulate these processes. IL-4 initiates transmembrane signaling through two types of receptor complexes comprising the IL-4Rα subunit and the associated Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) as common essential components. We demonstrate that both SOCS-1- and SOCS-3-mediated down-regulation of IL-4 signaling is due to an inhibition of the receptor associated Jak1 activity. The SOCS proteins contain an amino-terminal region of variable length and primary structure, a central SH2 domain, and a carboxyl-terminal conserved motif termed SOCS-box. We show that the SH2 domains of SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein are functionally redundant in regulating the IL-4-dependent Jak-Stat signaling. The Pre-SH2 domains of SOCS-2 and SOCS-3 confer the specificity of their regulatory function. Importantly, the Pre-SH2 domain of SOCS-3 alone can inhibit IL-4 signaling. The SH2-proximal 25 amino acids of SOCS-3 are sufficient for this inhibition, and the Thr residue at position 24 and the Phe residue at position 25 are individually indispensable for its inhibitory function. Thus, the Thr-Phe motif in the Pre-SH2 domain plays a critical role in SOCS-3-mediated inhibition of the IL-4-dependent Jak-Stat signaling, likely by regulating the mode of SOCS-Jak interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2314334585,"We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of p204, a member of the Ifi 200 gene family, inhibits growth, delays G0/G1 progression into S phase, and impairs E2F-mediated transcriptional activity. In this study, we show that p204 directly binds the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in vivo to exert its activity. Transient p204 overexpression in Rb+/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) inhibits cell proliferation, but does not affect cell growth in MEF derived from Rb-/- mice. Two human cell lines, Saos2 and C33A, bearing an inactive pRb, but not primary human embryo fibroblasts, are resistant to the p204 antiproliferative activity. p204 contains two 200 amino acid motifs, designated as type a or b domains, each containing a canonical Rb binding motif (LXCXE). When dominant-negative mutants at the Rb binding motif were transfected in Rb+/+ MEF, p204 lost its ability to inhibit cell growth, delay cell transition from G1 to S phase, and impair DNA synthesis. Moreover p204 overexpression in Rb+/+ MEF led to a significant decrease of both DHFR and PCNA proteins, two S phase markers. By contrast, this effect was not observed when Rb+/+ MEF were transfected with a p204 mutated at both Rb binding sites. Finally, overexpression of the LXCXE p204 mutant rendered Rb+/+ MEF resistant to the IFN-alpha antiproliferative activity, in comparison to the untransfected Rb+/+ MEF. As expected, Rb-/- cells were unsensitive to the IFN-alpha induced growth inhibition. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that (i) p204 contributes to the IFN-alpha antiproliferative activity and (ii) the primary target of p204 leading to efficient G1 arrest as well as to blockade of DNA replication from G1 phase is the pRb regulatory system."
https://openalex.org/W2323824213,"In addition to protein kinase A (PKA), cAMP regulates the activity of cAMP-gated channels and Rap1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors. We tested the hypothesis that the targets of cAMP might also include regulators of the Ras protooncogene. In rat thyroid cells, thyrotropin (TSH) stimulates proliferation through a cAMP-mediated pathway that requires Ras activity. Interference with Ras impairs DNA synthesis stimulated by TSH as well as cAMP elevating agents and analogs, demonstrating that the requirement for Ras lies down-stream of cAMP. Although cAMP stimulates proliferation, microinjection of the purified PKA catalytic subunit failed to do so, suggesting that factors in addition to PKA are required for cAMP-stimulated cell cycle progression. When added to thyroid cells expressing human Ha-Ras, TSH rapidly and markedly increased the proportion of GTP-bound Ras. Ras activity was increased within 1 min of TSH addition, maximal at 5-15 min, and declined to basal levels 30-60 min after hormone treatment. Cyclic AMP elevating agents elicited similar effects on Ras, indicating that TSH activates Ras through a cAMP-mediated pathway. Although cAMP-mediated, Ras activation by TSH and cAMP was independent of PKA activity. Moreover, cAMP-stimulated Ras activation was not impaired by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that cAMP activates targets in addition to PKA in thyroid cells, and that these targets may include regulators of Ras. The ability of cAMP elevating agents to activate Ras in addition to PKA may explain the inability of the PKA catalytic subunit to stimulate DNA synthesis in thyroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2327276821,"We analysed the regulation of G1-phase progression in relation to cytokine receptor signalling in HepG2 hepatoma cells, stably transduced with the IL-10 receptor after stimulation with Oncostatin M (OSM), IL-6, Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and IL-10. All cytokines induced STAT3 phosphorylation to approximately the same level, but only OSM, and to a lesser extent IL-6, induced STAT5 phosphorylation. The cytokines also stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in the order of decreasing effectiveness: OSM > IL-6 > LIF > IL-10. The same order of activity of the cytokines was observed on inhibition of DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle. These processes were accompanied by a decrease in cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity, and enhanced accumulation of p27kip1. The level of p27kip1 mRNA expression was unaffected by the cytokines, and maintenance of the elevated level of p27kip1 occurred independently of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of proteasomal activity increased the level of p27kip1 in the unstimulated cells to the same level as in OSM-treated cells. Inhibition of MEK activation completely abrogated OSM and IL-6 induced p27kip1 accumulation, while expression of dominant negative STAT5 decreased the OSM and IL-6 mediated inhibition of DNA-synthesis and partially inhibited p27kip1 accumulation."

There were no distinct differences in phenotype between the antisense and wild type plants during vegetative period under normal growth light intensities.

Furthermore, analysis of isolated thylakoids demonstrated that the oxygen-evolving rate in antisense plants decreased by 50% compared with the wild type. This was found to be due to up to 40% of D1 and D2 reaction center proteins of PSII disappearing in the transgenic plants. The absence of the PsbW protein also altered the contents of other PSII proteins to differing extents. These results show that in the absence of the PsbW protein, the stability of the dimeric PSII is diminished and consequently the total number of PSII complexes is greatly reduced.

Thus the nuclear encoded PsbW protein may play a crucial role in the biogenesis and regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. photosystem II light harvesting complex II phenyl-p-benzoquinone products of thepsbA and psbD genes, respectively chlorophyll-binding proteins encoded by the psbB andpsbC genes, respectively the first and second PSII plastoquinone electron acceptor 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Photosystem II (PSII)1of higher plants catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and the reduction of plastoquinone to plastoquinol. The PSII supracomplex consists of almost 30 different subunits of which two, the D1 and D2 proteins, bind most, if not all, of the cofactors needed for primary and secondary electron transfer reactions. The D1, D2, and the inner antenna proteins, CP43 and CP47, bind chlorophylla, and constitute together with the extrinsic proteins the PSII core. The PSII core in turn is surrounded by the outer antenna, light harvesting complex II (LHCII) which binds both chlorophylla and b (1–5). Both biochemical studies (6Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) supporting the idea that the dimer is the natural state of PSII. Both the monomeric and the dimeric forms of PSII have been found to contain several low molecular mass (<7 kDa) proteins (6Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J.

Fig. 1 shows the Arabidopsis PsbW protein sequence dealt with in this work. The PsbW protein was found to have only a single membrane span, with 14 and 20 amino acids stretching out to the stromal and lumenal sides of the membrane, respectively (Fig. 1). The orientation of the PsbW protein in the thylakoid membrane is opposite to other transmembrane PSII reaction center proteins with its N terminus at the lumenal side and the C terminus at the stromal side (13Irrgang K.-D.

Res. 1997; 53: 45-53Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Localization studies showed that the PsbW protein is not present in PSI, but is instead tightly associated with the PSII reaction center (13Irrgang K.-D. Shi L.-X. Funk C. Schröder W.P. J. Biol.

This was further supported by the finding that the PsbW protein undergoes degradation under photoinhibitory conditions. The extent and pattern of degradation was similar to that of the D1 protein except that it was not phosphorylated before degradation (16Hagman Å. Shi L.-X. Rintamäki E. Andersson B. Schröder W.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12666-12671Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protein is expressed in dark-grown seedlings, i.e. it is synthesized before other PSII reaction center proteins, and the protein level increases upon illumination (14Lorkovic Z.J. Schroder W.P.

In order to obtain insights into the function of the PsbW protein in the photosynthetic process, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing an antisense construct of psbW. In this report we present the functional analysis of a nuclear-encoded low molecular mass protein in PSII from higher plants. The data demonstrate that the PsbW protein is involved in the stabilization of dimeric PSII complexes inArabidopsis. The genomic fragment encoding A. thaliana PsbW (18Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P.

The construct was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by triparental mating (19Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plants were transformed by an influorescence infiltration method (20Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris Sci. 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar). Transgenic plants (T1) were selected on kanamycin-containing Murashige and Skoog (21Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53296) Google Scholar) plates, transferred into soil, and allowed to self-pollinate to produce T2 seeds. The T1 plants were also verified by Southern and Northern blot analyses. The wild type and the T2 A. thaliana (Colombia) transgenic seeds were placed on wet filter paper and incubated at 4 °C for 3 days. The cold-treated seeds were sown in a mixture containing soil, bead, and vermiculite with the ratio of 1:1:2. The seedlings were grown under white light (90 or 180 μmol of photons m−2 s−1), and the light/dark cycle was 8/16 h. Plants were also grown hydroponically (22Norén H. Svensson P. Andersson B. Biosci. Rep. 2000; 19: 499-510Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For biochemical studies, leaves were harvested before plant flowering. Isolation of thylakoid membranes from A. thaliana was carried out according to Norén et al. (22Norén H. Svensson P. Andersson B. Biosci. Rep. 2000; 19: 499-510Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. One gram of A. thaliana leaves was homogenized with 40 ml of preparation medium (300 mm sorbitol, 20 mm Tricine, pH 8.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, and 5 mmdithiothreitol). The slurry was filtered through 4 layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 5 mm MgCl2to lyse the chloroplasts. After 30 s the same volume of double concentrated resuspension medium (600 mm sorbitol, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, and 20 mm KCl) was added. The thylakoid membranes were reisolated at 1000 × g for 1 min, washed once with resuspension medium, and resuspended in the same medium. For measurement of chlorophyll concentration, samples were diluted in 80% acetone, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and measured spectroscopically (23Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4608) Google Scholar). A continuous sucrose gradient containing 0.03% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was prepared by the freeze and thaw method described by Eshaghi et al. (9Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that the sucrose gradients were buffered with 25 mmHepes, pH 7.6. The solubilization of thylakoid membranes byn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside detergent and centrifugation were carried out exactly as in Ref. 9Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Schägger and von Jagow (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10449) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The polyacrylamide gel contained 6m urea and the Tris-Tricine running buffer was used. The proteins on polyacrylamide gels were either transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 76: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44724) Google Scholar) or stained with silver (26Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out using a semidry blotting system (Millipore). A polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbit against the N-terminal 15-mer oligopeptide of PsbW protein and purified using protein A-Sepharose chromatography (13Irrgang K.-D. Shi L.-X. Funk C. Schröder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunodecorations were visualized using the alkaline phosphatase system with CDP-Star substrate (BioLabs). Quantification of immunoblots was performed by laser scanning densitometry. Oxygen-evolution activity of PSII was measured using a Clark-type electrode in reaction medium (0.1 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) at 20 °C under saturating light. Potassium ferricyanide (2 mm), phenyl-p-benzoquinone (PpBQ, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mm), 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone (1 mm), and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (0.1 mm) were supplied as electron acceptors. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured directly on intact leaves after 15 min dark adaptation using a Walz PAM-200. Flash-induced oxygen oscillation patterns were measured with a modified Joliot-type electrode at 20 °C (27Schröder W.P. Åkerlund H.-E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 848: 359-363Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The flow medium contained 30 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and 10 mm KCl. The samples were dark adapted on the electrode for 3 min and the polarization voltage of 700 mV was switched on 30 s before a train of short (10 μs) Xenon flashes separated by 500 ms were given. The flash-induced oxygen yield (Y n) was measured and normalized to the average yield on flashes 3–6. Eight independent lines of transgenic A. thaliana expressing the antisensepsbW gene were produced and analyzed. Northern blotting demonstrated that the antisense construct of psbW was highly expressed in the transgenic plants and the level of psbWmRNA was dramatically reduced (not shown) and consequently the translated PsbW protein was greatly reduced as well. In one of the different plant lines the level of PsbW protein was reduced to less than 4% of wild type PsbW protein (TableI). A 96% reduction of the PsbW protein is very close to a total knock-out and hence provides an excellent system for further functional analyses. These low levels of PsbW protein were detected at different developmental stages of the plants indicating that the antisense gene was constitutively expressed, resulting in low levels of PsbW protein expression, through the whole life of the plant. The T2 plants were grown directly in soil, each individual plant was tested by Western blotting before any further analyses were performed. This showed that the transgene was segregated 3:1 (not shown), as expected for T2 plants and that both heterozygous and homozygous plants had decreased levels of PsbW protein.Table IThe contents of PsbW protein in wild type and transgenic plantsWestern blotting of thylakoid membranes was performed using antibody raised against the PsbW protein. The relative content was quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Western blotting of thylakoid membranes was performed using antibody raised against the PsbW protein. The relative content was quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Despite the 96% reduction in PsbW protein levels, no drastic change in phenotype of the antisense plants as compared with the wild type occurred (Fig. 2). In addition, growth of the plants under two different light regimes, 90 and 180 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 for at least 50 days and on two types of growth media (soil and hydroponic culture), did not result in phenotypic changes in the antisense plants (Fig. 2). However, the antisense plants flowered about 2 weeks earlier than the wild type, which indicated a certain kind of stress. When steady state oxygen evolving rates of isolated thylakoid membranes were measured in the presence of different electron acceptors, a dramatic effect was observed. Using PpBQ as an electron acceptor only 50% of activity was present in thylakoids from antisense plants (TableII), and the oxygen evolving activity supported by 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone was only 38% of the wild type activity. Also, oxygen evolving activities supported by other electron acceptors, such as ferricyanide and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol decreased significantly.Table IIPpBQ-supported oxygen evolutionμmol O2/mgChl·hRelative activityWT128 ± 19100%−PsbW67 ± 851 ± 6Thylakoid membranes were isolated and the steady-state oxygen evolution was measured with a Clark-type electrode at 20 °C and saturating light.

PpBQ (0.1 mm) was used as electron acceptor. Values are means ± S.E. (n = 5). We analyzed the structural conformation of PSII in the transgenicArabidopsis plants. A new direct method was applied for the isolation of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes, i.e. PSII dimer complexes (9Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from thylakoids of wild type and antisenseArabidopsis plants. In this method, the isolated thylakoids are briefly solubilized byn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and then applied onto a sucrose gradient. By density gradient centrifugation the main complexes of the thylakoid membrane can be separated without affecting their intactness. In Fig. 3, the pattern of chlorophyll-containing bands from thylakoids of the wild type plant shows strong similarities to that from spinach thylakoids (9Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The upper and middle bands contain LHCII and PSI, respectively, while the third, somewhat diffuse band contains the LHCII-PSII supercomplexes (PSII in dimeric form). When thylakoids from antisense plants were treated in the same way, the PSII dimer supracomplex could not be detected (Fig. 3). Even if the ratio of detergent to chlorophyll was decreased, no dimeric PSII band could be detected in the antisense plant (not shown). Instead, an increased chlorophylla/b ratio was detected in the lower part of the LHCII band, which is the location of the monomeric PSII (6Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This experiment clearly shows that in the absence of the PsbW protein, no dimeric supracomplex of PSII can be isolated. The electron transfer within the PSII complex of the psbWantisense Arabidopsis plants was analyzed by measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence and by flash oxygen measurements. The chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of both intact leaves and isolated thylakoids (not shown) showed that F 0was slightly higher, and Fv/Fm was somewhat lower (Fig.4) in the transgenic plant compared with the wild type plant. However, no dramatic effects were observed, showing that electron transfer in the PSII complexes lacking the PsbW protein was not seriously affected. Moreover, the measurement of flash oxygen evolution from isolated thylakoid membranes did not indicate any significant effects caused by the antisense gene (Fig.5). This suggests that the lack of the PsbW protein does not alter energy transfer within the PSII complex and that the remaining PSII complex is functionally active.Figure 5Oxygen yield pattern measurements.Dark-adapted wild type (filled circle and solid line) and transgenic Arabidopsis (open circle and dashed line), detected with a Joliot-type electrode after illumination with a train of 15 flashes separated 500 ms, no electron donors or acceptors were added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If electron transport in PSII complexes is nearly normal, what causes the 50% decrease of the steady state oxygen evolution? Analyses of the chlorophyll content showed a small decrease of 0.2 in the chlorophyll a/b ratio in the transgenic plants indicated a loss of some chlorophyll a which lead us to assume that PSII core proteins must diminish. The decreased chlorophylla/b ratio suggested a change of the chlorophyll acontent, e.g. a reduced amount of PSII core proteins. To test this, immunoblotting using various antibodies raised against PSII proteins was performed. We found that the total levels of the different PSII proteins in thylakoid membrane preparations from PsbW antisense plants had changed (Table III). The most affected proteins were the PSII reaction center proteins, D1 and D2, of which up to 40% disappeared. The amounts of oxygen-evolving enhancer proteins, PsbO and PsbP, were reduced by 20 and 40%, respectively. The inner antenna proteins CP43 and PsbS decreased by 30 and 40%, respectively. Two low molecular mass proteins, cytochromeb 559 which is associated with the reaction center and PsbX located in PSII core, were less affected (75 and 90% remained, respectively). In contrast to the proteins mentioned above, LHCII proteins were in fact slightly increased (8%). These results clearly demonstrated that the amount of PSII core complexes decreased by about 40%, but the antenna complex remained intact. Since the PSII core contains mainly chlorophyll a, this explains the decrease in the chlorophyll a/b ratio. It is consistent, too, with the fact that no bleaching occurred in the transgenic plants as the major part of chlorophyll pigment in plants is bound to the antenna complex, which was not drastically affected. Consequently, the decreased oxygen evolution rate was caused by a lower number of functional PSII centers.Table IIIThe contents of PSII proteins in wild type and transgenic plantsWestern blotting of thylakoid membranes was performed using antibodies raised against D1, D2, CP43, PsbS, LHCII, PsbO, PsbP, Cytb 559, and PsbX protein. The relative contents were quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Values are mean ± S.E. (n = 5). Western blotting of thylakoid membranes was performed using antibodies raised against D1, D2, CP43, PsbS, LHCII, PsbO, PsbP, Cytb 559, and PsbX protein. The relative contents were quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Values are mean ± S.E. (n = 5). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with a 96% reduction in PsbW protein level did not show any drastic phenotype changes, which indicated that the PsbW protein is not directly involved in electron transfer within the PSII complex. However, when isolated thylakoids from these plants were analyzed with respect to steady state oxygen evolution, a reduction of PSII oxygen evolution of 50–60% (depending on the electron acceptor used) was observed. The remaining PSII complexes seemed to work normally as no drastic changes could be detected by flash oxygen evolution or chlorophyll fluorescence measurements when compared with thylakoids from wild typeArabidopsis. The decreased oxygen evolution in the transgenic Arabidopsisthylakoids lacking PsbW protein was instead found to be due to the reduced amount of the PSII core proteins D1, D2, and CP43, which decreased by roughly 40%. Also the extrinsic proteins PsbO and PsbP proteins decreased, whereas the LHCII antenna was not affected. It is interesting to note that oxygen evolution seems to be somewhat more affected by the absence of the PsbW protein compared with the protein content of the PSII core complex. This could simply be due to variations using Western blots for protein quantification, but it could also indicate an unidentified role of the PsbW protein in PSII. Further experiments are in progress to answer this question by using radiolabeled-DCMU for PSII quantification. No dimeric PSII complexes could be isolated or detected in the PsbW antisense thylakoids, which suggests that the PsbW protein is essential for the stabilization of the dimeric PSII complex. The functional role of the dimeric organization of PSII is not yet fully understood. However, our results show that if the PSII dimeric form is not formed or is not stable enough, the amount of functional PSII is reduced. This suggests that the stability of the dimeric form of PSII is higher than the monomeric form and thus the formation of dimers could be a way of protecting the complex from being attacked by proteases. On the other hand, when the complex is damaged by strong light for instance, the complex monomerize, the D1 and PsbW protein are removed, and the degradation/repair can start. When the degradation process is complete a newly synthesized PsbW protein will again combine the two monomers to become a stable functional PSII dimer. Our finding that the absence of the PsbW protein dramatically decreases the amount of functional PSII dimers, and the fact that the PsbW protein is a nuclear-encoded protein in higher plants, allows for the interesting speculation that this could be a way for the plant cell nucleus to control the photosynthetic activity in the partly autonomous chloroplast. How can a single α-helix transmembrane protein be crucial for the dimerization of such large protein complexes? There are some reports suggesting various factors that could indeed contribute to the dimerization of PSII. In addition to D1, D2, CP43, and CP47, the PSII core contains the low molecular weight polypeptides PsbE, PsbF, PsbH, PsbI, PsbK, PsbL, PsbTc, and PsbW (6Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.

Recent crystallographic data on the oxygen-evolving core PSII dimer suggested that the connector region between the two monomers might be attributed to the small PSII subunits (12Hankamer B. Morris E.P. Barber J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The PsbL, PsbK, and PsbH were suggested to be involved in dimer stabilization (8Zheleva D.

Recent data has also suggested a function for phosphatidylglycerol in the dimerization process of PSII (28Kruse O. Hankamer B. Konczak C. Gerle C. Morris E. Radunz A. Schmid G.H. Barber J. J. Biol.

The PsbH has a positively charged N terminus at the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and this could be the site of interaction with the negatively charged C terminus of PsbW (Fig. 1). This interaction would then stabilize the PSII dimer. The exact mechanism by which the PsbW protein promotes PSII dimerization is not clear. However, as the PsbW protein is found in the monomeric PSII (6Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the protein seems to be involved both in guiding the assembly of monomeric PSII complexes and in stabilization of the dimeric PSII. Interconversion between the PSII dimer and monomers has been implicated in the D1 protein repair cycle (37Baena-González E. Barbato R. Aro E.M. Planta. 1999; 208: 196-204Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and this process could be controlled by reversible phosphorylation of PsbH at its N terminus. In its phosphorylated form PsbH cannot interact with PsbW and consequently the PSII dimer will monomerize. PsbW itself is not phosphorylated, but PSII damage under photoinhibitory conditions results in the degradation of D1 and PsbW proteins at a similar rate and extent (16Hagman Å. Shi L.-X. Rintamäki E. Andersson B. Schröder W.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12666-12671Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A trEMBL data base search revealed that roughly 10% of the total entries were proteins with a molecular mass below 7 kDa. Several of these are single α-helix transmembrane proteins lacking prosthetic groups, very similar to the PsbW protein. The results presented here for the PsbW protein give an incitement to search for low molecular mass proteins in other protein complexes and to analyze their possible involvement in complex oligomerization.

https://openalex.org/W2007926623,"High level activation of p53-dependent transcription occurs following cellular exposure to genotoxic damaging agents such as UV-C, while ionizing radiation damage does not induce a similarly potent induction of p53-dependent gene expression. Reasoning that one of the major differences between UV-C and ionizing radiation damage is that the latter does not inhibit general transcription, we attempted to reconstitute p53-dependent gene expression in ionizing irradiated cells by co-treatment with selected transcription inhibitors that alone do not activate p53. p53-dependent transcription can be dramatically enhanced by the treatment of ionizing irradiated cells with low doses of DRB, which on its own does not induce p53 activity. The mechanism of ionizing radiation-dependent activation of p53-dependent transcription using DRB is more likely due to inhibition of gene transcription rather than prolonged DNA damage, as the non-genotoxic and general transcription inhibitor Roscovitine also synergistically activates p53 function in ionizing irradiated cells. These results identify two distinct signal transduction pathways that cooperate to fully activate p53-dependent gene expression: one responding to lesions induced by ionizing radiation and the second being a kinase pathway that regulates general RNA Polymerase II activity."

The homology consists of a novel Nmi/IFP 35 domain (NID) of 90–92 amino acids that is repeated in tandem in each protein and mediates Nmi-Nmi protein interactions and subcellular localization. In a yeast two-hybrid screen with a fragment of Nmi protein containing both NIDs, we identified an interaction between Nmi and IFP 35.

Nmi and IFP 35 proteins associate into a high molecular mass complex of 300–400 kDa as determined by native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The association of Nmi and IFP 35 into a complex can be demonstrated in multiple cell lines and is not dependent on treatment with IFN. Short term and long term cultures of transfected HEK293 cells suggest that Nmi and IFP 35 proteins stabilize each other through complex formation. IFP 35 appears to be more labile because Nmi was stable in the absence of IFP 35, whereas IFP 35 was degraded in the absence of Nmi. A deletion analysis revealed that Nmi must interact with IFP 35 to prevent its degradation and that the amino terminus of Nmi is required, but not sufficient, for this function. Inhibition of the proteasome, but not other proteases, led to increased levels of IFP 35. Thus, we have shown that Nmi and IFP 35 associate into a protein complex, that IFP 35 is degraded in a proteasome-mediated process, and that a novel function of Nmi is to prevent IFP 35 degradation.

Zervos A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Nmi, which has homology to coiled-coil proteins, was implicated in binding to Myc family members and other transcription factors (1Bao J. Zervos A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar). Myc proteins mediate cell growth, transformation, and apoptosis by functioning as activators or repressors of transcription through interaction with other proteins (2Peukert K. Staller P.

Although Nmi was also shown to interact with c-Myc and N-Myc in mammalian cells, a role for Nmi in the modulation of Myc function has not yet been documented. A portion of Nmi (from amino acids 102–288) was noted to have homology with IFP 35, an interferon (IFN)1-inducible protein (1Bao J. Zervos A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar,9Bange F.-C. Vogel U. Flohr T. Kiekenbeck M. Denecke B. Bottger E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the homologous region consists of a novel Nmi/IFP 35 domain (NID) of approximately 90–92 amino acids that is repeated in tandem in each protein and mediates Nmi-Nmi protein interactions and subcellular localization (10Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the homology between Nmi and IFP 35, we showed that Nmi was also IFN-inducible (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that of the numerous cell lines tested (derived from tumors of the liver, kidney, T-cell, B-cells, prostate, uterus, and cervix), all expressed endogenous Nmi and that Nmi was IFN-inducible (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Among normal tissues that were investigated, we found that the highest levels of Nmi protein were in the thymus, spleen, and liver (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because IFNs have pleiotropic effects including the ability to restrict the growth of cells or induce apoptosis, the finding that Nmi was IFN-inducible suggested that it might be important for IFN function (12Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 13). More recently, Nmi was also isolated in a two-hybrid screen using a portion of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5b, as bait (14Zhu M.-h. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). STAT proteins function as activators of transcription when cytokine signaling pathways induce their translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (15Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Nmi was shown to interact with all STAT proteins except STAT2 (14Zhu M.-h. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Two regions of Nmi, corresponding to residues 57–99 and 143–202, could bind to STAT proteins (14Zhu M.-h. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although Nmi lacks an intrinsic activation domain, it enhanced the association of CBP/p300 co-activator proteins with STAT1 and STAT5 leading to augmentation of transcription from interleukin-2 and IFN-γ-inducible promoters (14Zhu M.-h. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Nmi and IFP 35 associate into a high molecular mass complex (HMMC). Significantly, the association of Nmi and IFP 35 into a complex leads to stabilization of IFP 35 via inhibition of a proteasome-mediated pathway, thus defining a novel function for Nmi. The entire NMI cDNA or various fragments were cloned into the two-hybrid vector pAS1, to produce Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) fusions to Nmi (16Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Fragments containing the amino terminus of Nmi activated transcription in yeast, excluding their use as bait. A Gal4-Nmi () construct (anEcoRI-BamHI fragment of NMI expressing amino acids 58–307 from Nmi) did not activate transcription and was therefore used for library screening. Protein extracts prepared from Y153 transformed with the Gal4-Nmi () construct were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-Nmi antibody to confirm that the expected Gal4DBD/Nmi () fusion protein was produced. The Gal4DBD/Nmi () was used to screen a human lymphoblastoid cDNA library expressed from the pACT vector (16Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Y153 expressing the fusion protein were transformed with the pACT library and plated in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazole to select for His3-expressing cells (16Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). 25 of 500,000 colonies that were screened grew in the presence of 3-aminotriazole and tested positive for β-galactosidase. DNA sequence was obtained from the 5′ end of each clone. Other pAS1 fusion constructs expressing various fragments of NMI have been previously described: NID1/2 constructs express Nmi amino acids 92–307, NID1 constructs express amino acids 92–192, and NID2 constructs express amino acids 192–307 (10Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cytospins were prepared from Jurkat cells (treated with or without 1000 units/ml of IFN-α for 24 h). The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min followed by acetone for 10 min. Nmi was detected using an affinity purified anti-Nmi antibody and Alexa 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit as described previously (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). IFP 35 was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-IFP 35 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst, 0.05 μg/ml for 1 min. Cells were visualized using a fluoresence microscope equipped with Hoechst, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Texas red filters. Images were obtained by optical sectioning followed by deconvolvement and processed using Adobe Photoshop (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation from transfected HeLa S3 cells, 2.5 × 105 cells/well were plated in six-well plates, grown overnight and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were washed with PBS and induced with 1000 units/ml IFN-γ in cultivation medium for 24 h. Cells were washed once with PBS, detached by using trypsin/EDTA, pelleted, and washed twice with PBS. Cells (2 × 107cells/ml) were lysed for 1 h in lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. 50 μl of supernatant, 50 μl of lysis buffer, and 1.4 μl of anti-FLAG antibody (2.8 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under mild shaking. 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose equilibrated in lysis buffer was added and incubated for an additional 1 h. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, boiled in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer, electrophoresed on 9.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted on nitrocellulose, probed with anti-FLAG and monoclonal anti-IFP 35 antibody, and developed using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system. For immunoprecipitation from Jurkat cells, 10 million cells (with or without 1000 units/ml of IFN-α treatment for 24 h) were lysed in 1 ml of buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors as described (17Wong C. Naumovski L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, 1 μl of rabbit anti-Nmi (1–67) or 1 μl of preimmune serum was added to 450-μl aliquots of supernatant for 1 h followed by protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and boiled in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on two 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-Nmi or anti-IFP 35 antibodies. Jurkat cells (∼106cell/ml in 250 ml) either treated or not treated with IFN-α (1000u/ml) were collected by centrifugation (1000 g for 5 min) and washed twice with cold PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenizing buffer (HB: 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitors). A Dounce homogenizer with a tightly fitting pestle was used for the homogenization, and cell disruption was evaluated by phase contrast microscopy. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of HB. Both the supernatant and the resuspended pellet were centrifuged again as before. Both pellets from this spin were combined and suspended in 1 ml of HB supplemented with 2 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2. The subcellular fraction was further washed three times, and the final sample was labeled nuclear fraction (N). The supernatants collected from the above step were combined and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was washed three times with HB and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the subcellular fraction was labeled mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction (ML). The supernatants collected from the above step were combined and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed once again and labeled microsomal fraction (Micro). The resulting supernatant after removal of the microsomal fraction was labeled S-100. Samples of Jurkat cells (with or without IFN-α treatment, 1000 units/ml for 24 h) were lysed by Dounce homogenization in HB. High speed (100,000 × g) spin supernatants were loaded on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (either 4, 6, or 10% gel) that were run at low voltage in a cold room. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with the antibodies specified in the text or figures. Jurkat cell supernatants at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml were filtered through a 0.22 μm Millipore filter and loaded on a Superdex 200 column (HR 10/30; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with PBS at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. The column was calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). HEK293 cells were transfected with the plasmids specified in the text and figures using standard calcium phosphate precipitation techniques. Lysates were prepared and blotted as described above. Proteasome inhibitors MG-132 (final concentration, 10 μm) and lactocystin (final concentration, 10 μm), calpain inhibitor E64D (final concentration, 10 μm), and lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) were added to cells for 14 h prior to harvest for protein analysis. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify Nmi-interacting proteins. The Gal4 DBD was fused to either full-length Nmi or various portions of the Nmi protein. We found that Nmi (1–67) or Nmi () fused to Gal4DBD activated transcription in yeast and could not be used for screening but a construct containing Nmi amino acids 58–307 did not activate transcription and was therefore used for library screening. The Nmi 58–307 construct retains both NID repeats that we previously determined were necessary for strong Nmi/Nmi interactions (10Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 25 interacting clones were identified from a screen of 500,000 cDNAs. Sequence analysis showed that four of them were Nmi, demonstrating that the two-hybrid screen was working appropriately. Two clones contained the entire Nmi coding region, the third clone begins at Nmi amino acid 94, and the fourth at Nmi amino acid 144 (Fig.1 A). Six interacting clones were derived from the IFP 35 gene (9Bange F.-C. Vogel U. Flohr T. Kiekenbeck M. Denecke B. Bottger E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the clones was missing a large portion of the leucine zipper region (three leucines of five) suggesting that an intact L-Zip region is not required for the interaction in yeast (Fig. 1 B). Each of the IFP 35 clones contained the two NID repeats previously identified in Nmi and IFP 35. To delineate the region of Nmi important for this interaction, we used Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusions to truncated Nmi constructs expressing NID1/2, NID1, or NID2. Two hybrid interactions between those constructs and the clone of IPF 35 missing three of five leucines in the L-Zip region were ascertained and revealed that both NID repeats are necessary for strong interactions between the proteins (Table I). Intact amino terminus of neither protein are required for the interaction because the amino-terminal truncation of IFP 35 interacts strongly with Nmi amino acids 92–307 (Table I).Table IInteraction between Nmi and IFP 35 in yeast two-hybrid assayNmi92–307 NID1/2Nmi92–192 NID1Nmi192–307 NID2IFP 35 1-aIFP35 construct is missing 21 amino acids including three of five amino-terminal leucines.ACT-IFP35 1-aIFP35 construct is missing 21 amino acids including three of five amino-terminal leucines.Strong 1-bInteractions were scored using alacZ reporter and were determined using color intensity.NoneWeakStrong1-a IFP35 construct is missing 21 amino acids including three of five amino-terminal leucines.1-b Interactions were scored using alacZ reporter and were determined using color intensity. Open table in a new tab We then determined whether the amino-terminal truncated IFP 35 could homodimerize as has been described for the intact protein (9Bange F.-C. Vogel U. Flohr T. Kiekenbeck M. Denecke B. Bottger E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang X. Johansen L.M. Tae H.-J. Taparowsky E.J. Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The truncated L-Zip IFP 35 clone was used to construct a Gal4DBD domain fusion to test interaction with Act-L-Zip truncated IFP 35. A strong interaction was observed, suggesting that an intact L-Zip region is not necessary for homodimerization (Table I). Our yeast two-hybrid data suggest that IFP 35 can homodimerize with itself and heterodimerize with Nmi through NID repeats. Two hybrid interactions were confirmed by studies in mammalian cells. Both Nmi and IFP 35 are cytoplasmic proteins that are found in punctate granular structures when cells are induced with IFN (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Meyerdierks A. Denecke B. Rohde M. Taparowsky E.J. Bottger E.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To determine whether they reside in the same structure, immunofluoresence microscopy with optical sectioning was performed to demonstrate co-localization. Jurkat cells were untreated or treated with IFN, fixed, and probed with antibodies against Nmi (rabbit polyclonal) and IFP 35 (mouse monoclonal) and secondary reagents. The cells not treated with IFN showed little staining for Nmi or IFP 35 (data not shown). In IFN-treated cells, IFP 35 and Nmi appeared in granular structures as described previously (Fig. 2,A and B). Dual exposures of Nmi (red) and IFP 35 (green) show that the majority of large granules stain yellow (Fig. 2, C and D), demonstrating that the proteins co-localize. Some of the smaller and fainter granules did not appear to co-localize (Fig. 2, C and D). IFP 35 and Nmi also co-localize in IFN-treated HeLa, SW 1573 WISH, and SK-N-SH cells (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts of transfected HeLa cells. HeLa S3 cells were transfected with an expression construct coding for FLAG-tagged Nmi or the vector alone. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was used to precipitate FLAG-tagged Nmi, and monoclonal anti-FLAG and monoclonal anti-IFP 35 antibody were used for detection in Western blotting. IFP 35 was coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Nmi, whereas the vector transfected cells showed no co-immunoprecipitation of IFP 35 (Fig. 3 A,lanes 7 and 8). Co-immunoprecipitations were also performed on extracts from untreated and IFN-treated Jurkat cells. Rabbit antiserum directed against the first 67 amino acids of Nmi, termed anti-Nmi(1–67), was used for the immunoprecipitation, and anti-Nmi(1–67) and anti-IFP 35 were used for detection by Western blotting. Both Nmi and IFP 35 were detectable in the untreated samples, and they increased significantly in the IFN-treated samples (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 1 and 6). Preimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate Nmi or co-immunoprecipitate IFP 35 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 9). Immune serum directed against Nmi(1–67) immunoprecipitated Nmi and co-immunoprecipitated IFP 35 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5and 10). Note on the Western blot that rabbit anti-Nmi (1–67) does not detect IFP 35 because they do not share homology in the amino-terminal regions. Probing the immunoprecipitates with anti-IFP 35 revealed the presence of IFP 35 only when Nmi was immunoprecipitated with the immune serum. These results show that the association between Nmi and IFP 35 is not dependent on IFN treatment. We previously showed that Nmi appears cytoplasmic by immunofluoresence but that some Nmi protein fractionates with crude nuclear preparations after IFN treatment (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We examined the subcellular fractionation profile of both Nmi and IFP 35 more carefully to determine whether they co-fractionated as would be expected for proteins in a complex. We fractionated Jurkat cells into nuclear, mitochondrial/lysosomal, microsomal, and S-100 fractions. Analysis of β-glucuronidase and succinate iodonitrotetrazolium violet reductase, which are markers for lysosomes and mitochondria, showed the enzyme activities in distinct fractions (not shown). 10 μg of protein from each sample was subjected to Western blotting with anti-Nmi, anti-IFP 35 and anti-tubulin antibodies as a control. Following IFN treatment, we found a significant increase of Nmi protein in mitochondrial/lysosomal and microsomal fractions (Fig.4 A). IFP 35 showed a similar pattern to that of Nmi both before and after IFN treatment (Fig.4 B). Tubulin was found mainly in the S-100 fraction, as expected (Fig. 4 C). IFP 35 is reported to be in a HMMC of 200–440 kDa and Nmi in a HMMC of approximately 300 kDa (10Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Meyerdierks A. Denecke B. Rohde M. Taparowsky E.J. Bottger E.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We reasoned that Nmi and IFP 35 would be in the same complex because the proteins co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate. We examined complex formation by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Supernatant fractions from Jurkat cells with and without IFN treatment were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting after running 6 or 10% native polyacrylamide gels (n>4). As we previously reported, Nmi is found in a HMMC of approximately 300 kDa (Fig.5 A). The blot was stripped, shown to be free of signal, and reprobed with anti-IFP 35, which was found to be in the same molecular mass band with a similar shape when the films were superimposed (Fig. 5 B). To rule out an artifact of blotting, a previously unprobed blot was cut in half, and one side was probed with anti-Nmi and the other with anti-IFP 35, which showed that each was in a HMMC. When the blots were aligned, the HMMC had the same mobility (data not shown). On the native gel blots of the Jurkat cell extracts, we found no evidence for free monomeric proteins for either Nmi or IFP 35, indicating that the vast majority of Nmi and IFP 35 were in a HMMC. To show more definitively that both proteins are in the same complex, we treated Jurkat cell extracts (prepared from cells treated with IFN or untreated) with an antibody specific for Nmi or a preimmune serum obtained from the same rabbit prior to immunization. The proteins were then separated on native gels and probed with an anti-IFP 35 antibody. The preimmune antibody did not shift the IFP 35-containing complex, whereas the anti-Nmi antibody caused a large shift of the IFP 35 complex into two higher molecular mass bands (Fig.6 A). Using a chicken anti-Nmi antibody, we were able to demonstrate that the anti-Nmi antibody also supershifted the Nmi-containing complex as would be expected (Fig.6 B). These results imply that the vast majority of Nmi and IFP 35 are complexed with each other. To confirm the native gel blots and the gel shift, we resolved the complex from Jurkat cells by FPLC. Fractions were screened by slot blotting, and those containing Nmi and IFP 35 proteins were subjected to Western blotting. We found that Nmi eluted in fraction 13 without IFN treatment but in fraction 12 after IFN treatment (Fig.7). Similarly, IFP 35 eluted in fraction 13 without IFN treatment but in fraction 12 after IFN treatment (Fig.7). As a control, the IFN-inducible protein MxA did not show a shift in the peak of the elution profile after IFN treatment. The altered elution profile suggests that some characteristic (composition or modification) of the Nmi/IFP 35 complex may change after IFN treatment, although this difference cannot be detected by native gel electrophoresis. The molecular mass of the complex was approximately 300–400 kDa, consistent with the data obtained from native gel electophoresis. HMMC was also assessed in multiple other cells lines including HEK293EBNA (embryonal kidney), 041 (Li-Fraumeni fibroblast), SW620 (colon carcinoma), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), and Raji (Burkitts leukemia) using native gel electrophoresis. HMMC containing Nmi was detected in each of the cell lines with or without IFN treatment (in SW620 cells not treated with IFN, Nmi complex could only be detected after prolonged ECL exposure) (Fig.8). In HEK293EBNA cells, the Nmi HMMC appeared as a doublet with or without IFN treatment, and there was also a lower molecular mass band that represents free Nmi outside of the HMMC (Fig. 8). To determine the correlation with IFP 35 expression and complex formation, we probed a duplicate blot for the presence of IFP 35. We found IFP 35 in a HMMC of the same size as that seen in Jurkat cells in each of the cell lines except the HEK293EBNA where IFP 35 was almost undetectable with or without IFN treatment (Fig. 8). It is notable that the only cell line that has Nmi outside of the HMMC also contains very low levels of IFP 35, suggesting that higher levels of IFP 35 are required to enhance the amount of Nmi in a HMMC. Also notable is that Nmi or IFP35 complex did not appear inducible in either HEK293EBNA or HT1080 cells after IFN treatment. Probing the same samples for the IFN-inducible STAT1 protein showed that STAT1 was up-regulated in all IFN-treated cell lines (Fig. 8). 293T cells, which express little endogenous Nmi or IFP 35 (similar to the 293EBNA cells in Fig. 8), were transfected with HA-IFP35 or co-transfected with HA-IFP35 and Nmi. Lysates were analyzed for complex formation using native gel electrophoresis and anti-IFP 35 antibody. In the absence of transfected Nmi, no HA-IFP 35 was found in a HMMC (Fig. 9 A, lane 2); however, in the presence of Nmi, IFP 35 was found in a HMMC (Fig. 9 A, lane 3). The size of the HMMC is consistent with that found in normal Raji cells induced with IFN (Fig.9 A, lane 1). Complex formation after transfection of Nmi or IFP 35 or co-transfection with both was also demonstrated with an anti-Nmi antibody. In the absence of transfected Nmi, Nmi cannot be detected in a HMMC (Fig. 9 B, lane 2). Co-transfection with both Nmi and IFP 35 leads to detectable complex formation (Fig.9 B, lane 3). Transfection with Nmi in the absence of IFP35 leads to an indistinct pattern, suggesting that Nmi may multimerize but cannot form a discrete complex when IFP 35 is not expressed (Fig. 9 B, lane 4). The size of the HMMC appears to be the same as that of the endogenous complex found in Jurkat cells not stimulated with IFN (Fig. 9 B, lane 1). These results suggest that co-transfection of Nmi and IFP 35 is sufficient to form a HMMC. An interaction between Nmi and IFP 35 may stabilize one or both proteins. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with an HA epitope-tagged IFP 35 (expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter) and an empty vector (CEP4) or with HA-IFP 35 and increasing amounts of a CEP4-Nmi. We found that the transfection with the Nmi-expressing vector significantly increased the levels of HA-IFP 35 compared with the empty vector (Fig. 10 A,panel α-HA). Because HA-IFP 35 cannot be detected without Nmi transfection, pulse-chase experiments to determine the half-life of IFP 35 in the absence of Nmi could not be performed. It is unlikely that Nmi is acting at a transcriptional level or stabilizing proteins in general because it did not increase the amount of green fluorescent protein expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 10 A, panel α-GFP). A similar experiment was done to determine whether IFP 35 expression can stabilize Nmi. Cells were co-transfected with Nmi and an empty vector (pDCR) or with Nmi and increasing amounts of pDCR-HA-IFP 35. We found that the transfection with IFP 35 expressing vector increased the levels of Nmi compared with the empty vector (Fig. 10 B,panel α-Nmi). The increase in expression of Nmi was not as dramatic as the increase in expression of IFP 35 (Fig.10 A), suggesting that IFP 35 may be the more labile component of the complex. Transfection with IFP 35 did not increase the expression of co-transfected green fluorescent protein (Fig.10 B, panel α-GFP). HEK293 cells were transfected with combinations of CEP4 and pDCR, Cep4-Nmi and pDCR, CEP4 and pDCR-HA-IFP 35, or CEP4-Nmi and pDCR-HA-IFP 35 and selected with hygromycin and G418 for 2–3 weeks to establish long term cultures. Extracts of the pools were probed with anti-Nmi and anti-IFP 35 antibodies (Fig. 11 A). Nmi was expressed in cells transfected with the combination of CEP-Nmi and pDCR and CEP-Nmi and pDCR-IFP. However, IFP 35 was detected only when pDCR-IFP 35 was co-transfected with CEP-Nmi (Fig. 11 A). These results are consistent with the transient transfections showing that IFP 35 is unstable in the absence of Nmi. To determine whether IFP 35 expression could be restored by coexpressing Nmi, we transiently transfected the HEK293 cells stably transfected with pCEP4 and pDCR-IFP 35, HEK293(CEP/pDCR-IFP 35), with CEP4-Nmi, control plasmids, and a deletion derivative of Nmi lacking the first 73 amino acids (NΔ73). Nmi and NΔ73 were expressed to similar levels, but increased amounts of IFP 35 were only detected when the cells were transfected with full-length Nmi (Fig.11 B). As a control, HEK293 cells stably transfected with CEP4 and pDCR vectors did not express IFP 35 after transient transfection with Nmi (Fig. 11 B). To determine whether the amino terminus of Nmi is sufficient to stabilize IFP 35, we transfected various derivatives expressing the amino terminus of Nmi into the HEK293(CEP/pDCR-IFP 35) cells. Derivatives expressing the first 68, 92, or 125 amino acids of Nmi did not stabilize IFP 35, demonstrating that the amino terminus of Nmi is necessary but not sufficient to stabilize IFP 35 (Fig. 11 C). Furthermore, an Nmi derivative lacking both NID repeats, which are essential for the Nmi/IFP 35 interaction, did not stabilize IFP 35, suggesting that an interaction between the two proteins is necessary for the stabilization (Fig.11 C). Because many unstable proteins are degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway, we determined whether IFP 35 was degraded in a proteasome-mediated process. We treated cultures of HEK293(CEP/pDCR-IFP 35) with protease inhibitors MG132, lactocystin, E64D, or chloroquine. IFP 35 expression increased significantly only after treatment with proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactocystin (Fig. 11 D). Treatment of HEK293(CEP/pDCR) cells did not result in detectable endogenous IFP 35 protein (Fig. 11 D). Therefore, when IFP 35 is expressed without concurrent expression of Nmi, it is rapidly degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway. Using the yeast two-hybrid system with a portion of Nmi containing both NID repeats as bait, we identified interacting clones that expressed Nmi or IFP 35. A strong interaction between Nmi and IFP 35 required both NID repeats. The interaction between Nmi and IFP 35 is significant because both Nmi and IFP 35 1) contain NID repeats, which mediate Nmi homodimerization (10Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); 2) are up-regulated by IFNs, with the majority of protein appearing in extranuclear cytoplasmic structures (11Lebrun S.J. Shpall R. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Meyerdierks A. Denecke B. Rohde M. Taparowsky E.J. Bottger E.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); and 3) are components of high molecular mass complexes (10Lee N.D. Chen J. Shpall R.L. Naumovski L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Meyerdierks A. Denecke B. Rohde M. Taparowsky E.J. Bottger E.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We showed that Nmi and IFP 35 proteins interact in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies. The interaction does not appear to be dependent on treatment of cells with IFN because interactions can be demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and high molecular mass complex formation in the absence of IFN treatment of cells. Prior to IFN treatment, Nmi and IFP 35 are found primarily in the cytoplasmic (S-100) fraction, whereas after IFN treatment, there is a significant increase of the proteins in the mitochondrial/lysosomal and microsomal fractions. The association of Nmi and IFP 35 proteins with mitochondrial/lysosomal and microsomal fractions does not imply a physical interaction of Nmi or IFP 35 with mitochondria, lysosomes, or microsomes but rather suggests that the fractionation properties of the proteins change after IFN treatment. Indeed, IFP 35 does not appear to associate with mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, endosomes, or Golgi complex (19Meyerdierks A. Denecke B. Rohde M. Taparowsky E.J. Bottger E.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nmi and IFP 35 associate into a HMMC, the Nmi/IFP 35 Complex (NIC), of approximately 300–400 kDa as demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. NIC can be demonstrated with or without IFN treatment of cells that express Nmi and IFP 35 proteins. NIC can be reconstituted in HEK293 cells (expressing low or undetectable levels of endogenous Nmi and IFP) after transfection with Nmi and IFP 35 expression vectors. Our ability to reconstitute a complex indistinguishable from that seen in normal cells by co-expressing Nmi and IFP 35 suggests either that Nmi and IFP 35 are the only components of the NIC or that the other subunits are constitutively expressed. Interestingly, when Nmi is overexpressed without concomitant overexpression of IFP 35, it is found in a diffuse pattern rather than in a distinct band as demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis. These results imply that Nmi is associating with itself or numerous other cellular proteins but that IFP 35 is necessary for association of Nmi into a discrete complex. Transient transfection of expression vectors for Nmi and IFP 35 demonstrated that Nmi and IFP 35 can co-stabilize each other through complex formation. IFP 35 appears to be the more labile of the two proteins. Although Nmi can be readily detected in transiently transfected and stably selected HEK293 cells in the absence of IFP 35 expression, IFP 35 can only be detected in both transient transfections and stably selected cells when Nmi is co-expressed. The inability to detect IFP 35 in cultures of cells transfected with an IFP 35 expression vector is due to degradation of the protein for the following reasons. First, transfection with an Nmi expressing vector restores IFP 35 expression. Second, a deletion analysis revealed that the amino terminus of Nmi is required but not sufficient to increase the level of IFP 35. Expression of a deletion derivative of Nmi lacking the NID repeats, which are necessary for Nmi to interact with IFP 35, also did not increase levels of IFP 35 protein, suggesting that Nmi has to bind to IFP 35 to stabilize it. Third, inhibition of the proteasome, but not other proteases, led to increased levels of IFP 35, suggesting that Nmi inhibits degradation of IFP 35 through a proteasome-mediated pathway. It is possible that the amino terminus of Nmi is required to physically impede the association of IFP 35 with the proteasomal degradation machinery. Thus, we have shown that Nmi and IFP 35 form a protein complex, that IFP 35 is a labile protein degraded in a proteasome-mediated process, and that a novel function of Nmi is to prevent IFP 35 degradation. The association of Nmi and IFP 35 into a proteasome-resistant complex may serve to amplify the physiologic effects of IFN treatment. Because complex formation between Nmi and IFP 35 increases the amount of both proteins, it is likely that complex formation will potentiate the function of Nmi or IFP 35 (or both) rather than acting to sequester or down-regulate their function(s). Because IFP 35 appears to be extremely labile (often undetectable except after IFN treatment), we favor a model in which Nmi stabilizes IFP 35 and enhances IFP 35 function. This would be similar to the situation where elongin BC complex prevents proteasome-mediated degradation of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (20Schoenfeld A.R. Davidowitz E.J. Burk R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8507-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was being revised, Zhou et al. (21Zhou X. Liao J. Meyerdierks A. Feng L.

They also found that IFP 35 is phosphorylated and that complex formation correlates with IFP 35 dephosphorylation (21Zhou X. Liao J. Meyerdierks A. Feng L. Naumovski L. Bottger E.C. Omary M.B. J.

The proteasomal degradation of many important cellular proteins including c-Myb, keratins, and Bcl-2 is modulated by their phosphorylation status (22Bies J. Feikova S. Bottaro D.P. Wolff L.

Therefore, IFP 35 levels and Nmi/IFP 35 complex formation and function may be regulated by both phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation.

https://openalex.org/W1996200002,"Although telomerase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases in accordance with degree of histological undifferentiation, it is unknown whether the level of telomerase activity in HCC reflects of the degree of activity in individual cells or the frequency of telomerase-positive HCC cells. Non-cancerous liver tissues exhibit low but significant levels of telomerase activity, but the nature of telomerase-positive cells in these tissues is unclear. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical staining using specific antibody against telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) protein in 15 HCC samples and 13 adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues. There were hTERT-positive hepatocytes, though very low frequency, in non-cancerous liver tissues. The frequencies in hTERT positive hepatocytes were very well correlated with clinicopathological parameters and telomerase activity levels: the average frequencies of chronic hepatitis was 0.2%, liver cirrhosis 0.2%, well-differentiated HCC 3.0%, moderately differentiated HCC 28%, and poorly differentiated HCC 95%. The intensity of staining varied among cells within a given specimen, and correlation with degree of histological undifferentiation was less obvious. Portions of migrating lymphocytes and biliary epithelial cells were also hTERT-positive. These findings indicate that the up-regulation of telomerase activity with degree of undifferentiation of HCC is mainly due to the increase in frequency of hTERT positive HCC cells."

Characterization of the intermediate states is central to the understanding of protein stability and folding. Such intermediate states will provide useful information on the range of contexts in which the same amino acid sequence will fold into a stable structure and should reveal which interactions are driving the folding process (2Kay M.S.

Generally, proteins in vitro can be transformed into the MG state at low pH or in moderate concentrations of the chemical denaturants or at high temperatures (10Dabora J.M. Pelton J.G. Marqusee S. J.

Many of the members belonging to the all β-barrel structural class are known to be involved in the regulation of key cellular processes (19Buchanan S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, very little information exists on the folding pathways of these proteins. In an attempt to fill this lacuna, in the present study, we have embarked on understanding the equilibrium unfolding pathway of the human acidic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-1).hFGF-1 is a 16-kDa, all β-sheet, heparin-binding protein that is involved in a wide array of cellular processes regulating cell proliferation (20Lozano R.M. Pineda-Lucena A. Gonzalez C. Jimenez M.A. Cuevas P. Redondo-Horcajo M. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4982-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). hFGF-1 is devoid of disulfide bonds and possesses a single tryptophan residue, which could be effectively used as a probe to monitor the conformational changes occurring in the protein under various physical conditions. The secondary structural elements in the protein include 12 β-strands arranged antiparallely into a β-barrel structure (Fig. 1 and Refs. 21Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T.

All these structural features render hFGF-1 as a paradigm to understand the folding/unfolding pathways of all β-barrel proteins.In the present study, using various biophysical techniques including multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we identify and characterize, a stable intermediate state in the GdnHCl-induced unfolding pathway of hFGF-1.

All experiments were performed at 20 °C.Protein Expression and PurificationResidues are numbered as per their position in the primary structure of the 154-amino acid hFGF-1. Expression vector for the truncated form of the human FGF-1 (hFGF-1, residues 15–154) was constructed and inserted between theNdeI and BamHI restriction sites in pET20b. The plasmid containing the hFGF-1 insert was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The expressed protein was purified on heparin-Sepharose column using a NaCl gradient (0–1.5m). The protein was desalted by ultra filtration using an Amicon set-up. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE. The authenticity of the sample was further verified by electron spray mass analysis. The concentration of the protein was estimated from the extinction co-efficient value of the protein at 280 nm.Preparation of Isotope-enriched hFGF-1Uniform15N isotope labeling was achieved using M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl. To realize maximal expression yields, the composition of the M9 medium was modified by the addition of a mixture mixture of vitamins. The expression host strainE. coli. BL21(DE3)pLysS is a vitamin B1-deficient host, and hence the medium was supplemented with thiamine (vitamin B1). Protein expression yields were in the range of 25–30 mg/liter of the isotope enriched medium. The extent of 15N labeling was verified by electron spray mass analysis.Steady State Fluorescence MeasurementsAll fluorescence spectra were collected on a Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorimeter at 2.5- or 10-nm resolution, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were made at a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. ANS binding affinity to hFGF-1 at various concentrations of the denaturant was monitored with the excitation wavelength set at 390 nm. The emission was monitored between 450 and 600 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 5 nm. The concentration of the dye (ANS) and the protein used were 200 and 1 μm, respectively.Circular DichroismAll CD measurements were made on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm-pathlength quartz cell. Each spectrum was an average of five scans. The concentration of the protein used was 0.5 mg/ml. Necessary background corrections were made in all spectra.Equilibrium Unfolding and Data AnalysisEquilibrium unfolding data obtained were converted to plots ofF u, fractions of the protein in the unfolded state, versus denaturant concentration using the following equation.Pu=(XD−(XF+mF[D])/(XU+mU[D])−(XU+mF[D])Equation 1 where X D is the value of the spectroscopic property measured at denaturant concentration ([D]).X F and X U represent intercepts, and m F and m Uare the slopes of the folded and unfolded base lines of the data, respectively, and were obtained from the linear least square fits of the base lines. In the case of urea-induced unfolding, a two-state (folded ↔ unfolded) transition was assumed, and the free energy of unfolding by the denaturant (G u) at concentration ([D]) is related to F U by transformation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. It is assumed that the free energy of unfolding, ΔG u, has a linear dependence on the concentration of the denaturant ([D]).ΔGu=ΔG(H2O)+m [D]Equation 2 where ΔG(H2O) and m are the intercept and slope, respectively, in the plot of ΔG u versus concentration of the denaturant. m is the measure of the co-operativity of the unfolding reaction and ΔG(H2O) is the difference in the free energy between the folded and unfolded states of the protein in the absence of any denaturant.Size Exclusion ChromatographyAll gel filtration experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a superdex-100 column using a AKTA FPLC device (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with 2 bed volumes of the buffer (10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm of ammonium sulfate) containing appropriate concentrations of GdnHCl. The flow rate of the eluent was set at 1 ml/min. Protein peaks were detected by their 280 nm absorbance. The concentration of the protein used was about 1 mg/ml.Stopped Flow FluorescenceKinetic measurements of protein refolding or unfolding were performed using a SF-61 stopped flow spectrofluorimeter (Hi-Tech Scientific Co). For measuring changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (of Trp121) at different concentrations of GdnHCl, an excitation wavelength of 280 nm was routinely used with a monochromater slit width of 4 nm. All folding and unfolding reactions were performed at 25 °C. Unfolding reactions involved mixing of hFGF-1 with 10-fold excess of GdnHCl to yield a final protein concentration of about 1.0 μm. The kinetics associated with refolding involved mixing one volume of unfolded protein with 10 volumes of the refolding buffer (100 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm of ammonium sulfate).The kinetics data were analyzed by plotting the refolding and unfolding rates as a function of denaturant concentration in semilogarithmic plots (Chevron plots) as per the following equations.lnku=lnkuw+mu[D]Equation 3 lnkf=lnkfw+mf[D]Equation 4 where k u and k frepresent the observed rate constants for the unfolding and refolding reactions in various concentrations of the denaturant ([D]), respectively. k uw and k fware the rate constants of unfolding and refolding extrapolated to zero denaturant concentration. m u andm f are slopes of the unfolding and refolding reactions.Proteolytic Digestion AssayDigestion experiments were carried out by incubating hFGF-1 under appropriate buffer conditions with trypsin in a 1:50 ratio. The protease action was stopped by heating the mixture (protein + trypsin) at 90 °C for 10 min. The products of the protease reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The degree of cleavage was measured by estimating the intensity of the band (on SDS-PAGE) corresponding to hFGF-1 (remaining after trypsin digestion) using a scanning densitometer. The intensity of the band corresponding hFGF-1 not treated with the enzyme was considered as a control for 100% protection against trypsin action.NMR ExperimentsAll NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer at 20 °C. A 5 mm inverse probe with a self-shielded z-gradient was used to obtain all gradient-enhanced1H-15N HSQC spectra (23Palmer III, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar, 24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarimen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). 15N decoupling during acquisition were accomplished using the GARP sequence (25Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). 2048 complex data points were collected in the 1H dimension of the 1H-15N HSQC experiments. In the indirect 15N dimension of the spectra, 512 complex data points were collected. The HSQC spectra were recorded at 32 scans at all concentrations of GdnHCl. The concentration of the protein sample was 0.5 mm in 95% H2O and 5% D2O (containing 100 mm phosphate and 100 mm of ammonium sulfate). 15N chemical shifts were referenced using the consensus ratio of 0.0101329118 (26Wishart D.S.

All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using UXNMR and Aurelia software.Hydrogen-Deuterium ExchangeFor hydrogen-deuterium exchange, the hFGF-1 samples were rapidly exchanged by ultrafiltration (on a Amicon set-up) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (containing 100 mm of ammonium sulfate) prepared in 99.9% D2O at 5 °C. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange was monitored by collecting 1H-15N HSQC spectra with 512 points in the t 1 (evolution period) and 256 points in the t 2 (detection period). There is increasing evidence that the refolding of monomeric proteins in vitro proceeds along pathways involving the formation of partially folded, intermediate states (1Dobson C. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Characterization of the intermediate states is central to the understanding of protein stability and folding. Such intermediate states will provide useful information on the range of contexts in which the same amino acid sequence will fold into a stable structure and should reveal which interactions are driving the folding process (2Kay M.S. Ramos C.H. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Park S.H. O'Neal K.T. Roder H.

The molten globule (MG)1 is a well known example of a partially folded equilibrium state (6Ptitsyn O.B. Pain R.H. Semisotonov G.V. Zerovnik E. Razgulyaev O.I.

MG states have been proposed to be involved in a number of physiological processes, such as protein recognition by chaperones, release of protein ligands, and protein translocation across bio-membranes (11Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). Generally, proteins in vitro can be transformed into the MG state at low pH or in moderate concentrations of the chemical denaturants or at high temperatures (10Dabora J.M. Pelton J.G. Marqusee S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 285: 279-291Google Scholar, 12Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although MG states have been identified and characterized in the folding/unfolding pathways of several proteins, most of these proteins belong to structural class of all α or α+β (1Dobson C. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are only few examples wherein proteins belonging to the all β-sheet class are shown to exist in a MG state(s) (7Liu Z. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M.

In all known structures of the all β-barrel type, the β-sheet is twisted to form a β-barrel, such that the last β-strand is hydrogen bonded to the first one. Many of the members belonging to the all β-barrel structural class are known to be involved in the regulation of key cellular processes (19Buchanan S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, very little information exists on the folding pathways of these proteins. In an attempt to fill this lacuna, in the present study, we have embarked on understanding the equilibrium unfolding pathway of the human acidic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-1). hFGF-1 is a 16-kDa, all β-sheet, heparin-binding protein that is involved in a wide array of cellular processes regulating cell proliferation (20Lozano R.M. Pineda-Lucena A. Gonzalez C. Jimenez M.A. Cuevas P. Redondo-Horcajo M. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4982-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). hFGF-1 is devoid of disulfide bonds and possesses a single tryptophan residue, which could be effectively used as a probe to monitor the conformational changes occurring in the protein under various physical conditions. The secondary structural elements in the protein include 12 β-strands arranged antiparallely into a β-barrel structure (Fig. 1 and Refs. 21Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar and 22Pineda-Lucena A. Jimenez M.A. Lozano R.M. Nieto J.L. Santoro J. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 162-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All these structural features render hFGF-1 as a paradigm to understand the folding/unfolding pathways of all β-barrel proteins. In the present study, using various biophysical techniques including multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we identify and characterize, a stable intermediate state in the GdnHCl-induced unfolding pathway of hFGF-1. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of a detailed structural characterization of an equilibrium intermediate in the unfolding pathway of an all β-barrel protein.

https://openalex.org/W2324617025,"Notch genes encode a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptors that are involved in many distinct cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Notch function has been shown to be required both during development and in adult life. Moreover, several studies on spontaneous human tumors and in experimental models demonstrate that three of the four mammalian Notch genes can act as oncogenes. The mechanism by which Notch proteins induce neoplastic transformation is not known. In order to determine the early signaling events mediated by Notch during cellular transformation we constructed several inducible alleles of Notchic by fusing portions of Nic to the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor. Here we show that Notchic-ER chimeras are conditionally activated by 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) in a dose-dependent manner. Clonal RKE cell lines expressing Notchic-ER chimeras display hormone-dependent transformation in vitro. Transformation mediated by Notchic-ER is reversible and chronic stimulation is necessary for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. In response to hormone activation Notchic-ER chimeras become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate in the nucleus of the cell; indicating that both phosphorylation and nuclear localization are required for Notch transforming activity."

Biol. 1997; 17: 4979-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The domain is needed for Py large T Ag to promote dephosphorylation of p130 at Thr-986 (15Sheng Q. Love T.M. Schaffhausen B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5280-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recognition of homology between the N-terminal domains of T antigens and Escherichia coli DnaJ, including the invariant HPD motif, led to the hypothesis that T antigens possess the function of J domains, which help recruit chaperones to assist T antigens with their various functions (16Kelley W.L. Landry S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 277-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Confirming this hypothesis, hsp70 chaperones were found to be associated with the T antigens (4Sheng Q. Denis D. Ratnofsky M. Roberts T.M. DeCaprio J.A. Schaffhausen B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9410-9416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Pipas J.M.

Virol. 1989; 63: 3961-3973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Pallas D.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of murine polyomavirus T antigens displays sequence identity to the N-terminal J domain of E. coli DnaJ and human HDJ-1 of only 18 and 19%, respectively (see data below). The N termini of SV40 and polyomavirus T antigens can nonetheless substitute for the E. coli J domain to form functional chimeric DnaJ proteins (20Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (and data below). The J domain of the human DnaJ homologs, HSJ1 or DNAJ2, can substitute for the N terminus of SV40 T Ag to support viral replication (12Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Pipas J.M. Silver P.A. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. DeCaprio J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1098-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The N termini of the T antigens of polyomavirus and SV40 share the capacity of DnaJ-like chaperones to stimulate the ATPase activity of the hsp70 class of chaperones (21Riley M.I. Yoo W. Mda N.Y. Folk W.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Srinivasan A. McClellan A.J. Vartikar J. Marks I. Cantalupo P. Li Y. Whtye P. Rundell K. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4761-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Since the 79-residue N-terminal domain of polyomavirus T antigens, encoded by exon I, has properties consistent with a J domain, it is referred to as polyomavirus J domain (PyJ). The invariant HPD motif of the J domains is essential to their stimulation of ATP hydrolysis and substrate binding by hsp70 chaperones (23Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R305-R308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In fact, allele-specific suppressors of a mutation of the HPD motif indicate that the J domain of E. coli DnaJ makes contact with DnaK at a cleft within its ATPase domain (24Suh W.C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, HPD mutations of Py middle T Ag have no effect on cellular transformation, whereas several other N-terminal mutations do (6Glenn G.M. Eckhart W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3726-3729Crossref Google Scholar, 7Campbell K.S. Auger K.R. Hemmings B.A. Roberts T.M. Pallas D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeras of SV40 large T Ag with N terminus replaced by yeast orE. coli J domains fail to support viral DNA replication, transformation, and liberation of E2F from p130, whereas a chimera using the J domain of JC virus is functional (25Sullivan C.S. Tremblay J.D. Fewell S.W. Lewis J.A. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that virus-specific activities, independent of the HPD motif, reside within the N-terminal J domain of T antigens. Where might these virus-specific functions map in the structure of PyJ relative to regions critical for recognition and stimulation of hsp70s? Locating sites of lesions in the PyJ structure that impair functions unique to T antigens, such as cell transformation, can suggest features in the tertiary structure that support these viral functions. Such structural features of PyJ may help account for T Ag recognition and inhibition of PP2A. Comparison of the high precision NMR structure of PyJ, divergent in sequence, with the NMR structures of the J domains of E. coli DnaJ and human HDJ-1 (26Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.-U. McColl D.J. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also suggests a minimum of structural elements needed for J domain interactions with hsp70s. We employed the in vivo complementation assay developed by Kelley and Georgopoulos (20Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), who generously provided the reporter strain WKG190 and the E. coli DnaJ (residues 1–376) expression plasmid pWKG90 modified to H71T. The E. coli J domain (residues 1–70) was replaced with an NcoI/KpnI PCR fragment encoding the PyJ (residues 1–79) using ctagcaccatggatagagttctgagc and ccggtaccgttcctcgctccgccgtt as primers. The reverse primer added to the C-terminal end six residues unique to tiny T Ag, i.e. NGGARN, for the full 85 residues of tiny T Ag (21Riley M.I. Yoo W. Mda N.Y. Folk W.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The point mutants V4D, L13V, Q32E, and Q32K were made with GeneEditor (Promega). Expression of J chimeras was induced with 33 mm arabinose. The permissive temperature used was 28 °C, and the restrictive temperatures used were 14 and 42 °C. A synthetic PyJ gene sequence, i.e. for residues 1–79, was designed using codons frequently used in highly expressedE. coli genes (29Andersson S.G.E. Kurland C.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 198-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences flanking the coding region of exon I of PyJ were added to fuse a six-histidine tag to the C terminus and NcoI or BamHI restriction sites with CG tails to assist subcloning. The resulting sequence is as follows: 1 gcggatccat ggaccgtgtt ctgtcccgtg ctgacaaaga acgtctgctg gaactgctga aactgccgcg tcagctgtgg ggtgacttcg gtcgtatgca gcaggcttac aaacagcagt ccctgctgct gcacccggac aaaggtggtt cccacgctct gatgcaggaa ctgaactccc tgtggggtac cttcaaaacc gaagtttaca acctgcgtat gaacctgggt ggtaccggtt tccagcacca ccaccaccac cactgaggat ccgc 274. This synthetic gene coding for PyJ was constructed in a one-step PCR using four template/primer oligonucleotides at 20 nm and two standard primers to drive the reaction (30Casimiro D.R. Toy-Palmer A. Blake R.C., II Dyson J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6640-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were chosen that are composed of approximately one-fourth of the coding sequence, with overlaps of 18–19 nucleotides to allow a stringent annealing temperature of 55 °C during PCR. The primers are composed of (i) nucleotides 1–77, (ii) reverse complement of nucleotides 60–146, (iii) nucleotides 129–216, (iv) reverse complement of nucleotides 198–274, (v) nucleotides 1–19, and (vi) the reverse complement of nucleotides 256–274. The conditions used for the high fidelity PCR with usingTaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were low MgCl2 concentration of ∼1.5 mm, short cycling steps, i.e. 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, and a relatively small number of 20–25 cycles. The PCR fragment was subsequently cloned intoNcoI/BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen) and sequenced to confirm accuracy. PyJ was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) host using the T7 expression system (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). We used the following protocol to reduce the plasmid instability known to be a problem of this expression system. Prior to the day of overproduction, 10 μl of frozen host bacteria were diluted into 50 ml of M9 medium, supplemented as described below, containing 200 μg/ml fresh ampicillin. Cultures were incubated overnight at room temperature without shaking to avoid reaching saturation and maintain selective pressure. The next day theE. coli were pelleted, and the supernatant medium containing β-lactamase was discarded. The bacteria were resuspended and inoculated into 1 liter of fresh, supplemented M9 medium. The E. coli cultures were grown to an A 600of ∼0.25 where an additional 400 μg/ml ampicillin was added. Cells were then grown to an A 600 of ∼0.9 and induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for about 1.5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −70 °C until further processed. M9 medium supplemented with Celtone to 10% (v/v) proved cost-effective for labeling PyJ, supporting growth and PyJ expression level nearly equal that obtained in LB medium. When15N- or 15N/13C-labeled protein was desired, 15NH4Cl (Isotec or Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), d-glucose-U-13C6(Martek Biosciences), and 15N or15N/13C-enriched Celtone (Martek Biosciences) was used. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl) with 2 mm imidazole and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were disrupted using a French press operating at 16,000 pounds/square inch. The extract was partially cleared by centrifugation twice at 10,000 ×g for 10 min followed by 30,000 × g for 2 h. The His-tagged PyJ domain was then affinity purified from the extract by adding 2 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer to the supernatant and gently mixing overnight at 4 °C. This prolonged mixing, near the binding capacity of the affinity resin, improved the yield and purity of PyJ. The agarose was placed in a disposable column (Pierce), rinsed with 20 volumes lysis buffer, washed with 20 volumes of lysis buffer, pH 6.5, containing 50 mmimidazole, and eluted in lysis buffer, pH 6.5, with 500 mmimidazole. Purity of PyJ was verified using Tricine gels (21Riley M.I. Yoo W. Mda N.Y. Folk W.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once dialyzed and concentrated, PyJ was sufficiently pure for analysis by NMR but was susceptible to gradual proteolysis after a month. To improve long term stability (>6 months), fractions containing PyJ were subjected to gel filtration using a 200-ml S220HR Sephacryl column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH) and 25 mm NaCl. Fractions containing PyJ were thoroughly lyophilized, redissolved by adding water (e.g. 5 ml), dialyzed three times against 10 mm phosphate, pH 6, 100 mm KCl, and concentrated to the desired volume (e.g. 2.0 ml) with Centricon YM3 (Amicon). The PyJ solution was adjusted to pH 6 and dialyzed less than 1 h against 10 mm phosphate, pH 6.0, 10 mm KCl, and either 7 or 99% (v/v) D2O. To forestall protein precipitation, glycine-d 5 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was then added to 100 mm. PyJ was further concentrated with a Centricon YM3 (Amicon) to 0.7 ml for NMR analysis. Addition of the protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was critical to prevent gradual proteolysis. NMR experiments were performed at 303 K on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer using a 5-mm probe (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) or 8-mm probe (Nalorac Corp., Martinez, CA) tuned to 15N, 13C, and 1H frequencies and equipped with shielded pulsed field gradient coils. Compositions of NMR samples of PyJ were 1.7 mm (U-15N; 93% H2O), 1.5 mm(U-13C/15N; 93% H2O), 2.0 mm (U-13C/15N; 99% D2O), 0.6 mm (15% 13C, 93% H2O), and 3.9 mm(U-13C/15N; 93% H2O). NMR spectra were processed and interpreted with SYBYL TRIAD 6.3 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Backbone and side chain assignments of PyJ employed double and triple resonance NMR experiments in 1H2O as follows: HNCA (32Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar), HN(CO)CA (32Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar), HN(CA)HA (33Olejniczak E.T. Xu R.X. Petros A.M. Fesik S.W. J. Magn.

Reson. 1988; 78: 588-593Google Scholar) (τm = 80 ms) and 13C-separated FSCT-HSMQC-NOESY (τm = 100 ms; 13C carrier of 76 ppm) (43Van Doren S.R. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 193-198Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Spectra in D2O were also used, namely13C-separated FSCT-HSMQC-NOESY (τm = 100 ms;13C carrier of 76 ppm) and HCCH-TOCSY (aromatic13C carrier of 126.5 ppm). Stereospecific assignments of leucine and valine methyl groups were obtained using selective, partial enrichment with 13C (44Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). PyJ structure calculations were based on NOE-derived distance restraints, φ, ψ, and χ1 torsion angle restraints, and 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts. The 846 NOE restraints were obtained from the15N- and 13C-separated NOESY spectra mentioned above, as well as from a novel three-dimensional NOESY-CT-HSQC (τm = 200 ms) spectrum of 3.9 mm13C/15N PyJ in 93% H2O. The spectrum has high 13C resolution by way of the13C constant time period of the sequence. Its excellent water suppression was achieved using gradient-based coherence selection. Its longer NOESY mixing time of 200 ms was chosen for regions of slower NOE buildup, due to shorter internal correlation times, such as the HPD loop and the nearby ends of helices II and III. Demonstration of this experiment will be described elsewhere. NOE intensities were classified as weak, medium, and strong, corresponding to upper bounds of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively. The sum of the van der Waals radii of two protons was used as the lower bound of each NOE restraint. 44 φ angle restraints were obtained from 3JHNHa values measured from a three-dimensional HNCA-J spectrum (45Madsen J.C. Sorensen O.W. Sorensen P. Poulsen F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 239-244Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These φ angles were restrained to −65 ± 25° for3JHNHa <5 Hz and to −65 ± 30° for 5 Hz <3JHNHa <5.5 Hz. No3JHNHa values higher than 5.5 Hz were observed. Restraints on 58 ψ torsion angles and an additional 29 φ torsion angles were derived from TALOS interpretation of 13Cα,13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1HN chemical shifts of PyJ, using a data base of chemical shifts and structural motifs from a set of proteins characterized at high resolution both by x-ray and NMR methods (46Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The torsion angle restraints from TALOS were used with upper and lower bounds of at least 2.5 standard deviations when predictions were clear. The13Cα and 13Cβ secondary chemical shifts for all 79 native residues of PyJ were used in refining the structure because of their relationship to φ and ψ torsion angles (47Kuszewski J. Qin J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 106: 92-96Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments of Hβ protons and identifications of χ1 rotameric states were derived from HNHB (48Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 636-641Google Scholar), HACAHB-COSY (49Grzesiek S. Kuboniwa H. Hinck A.P. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5312-5315Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar),13C-separated FSCT-HSMQC-NOESY, and15N-separated NOESY-HSQC. χ1 torsion angles were restrained to one of the following values: −67 ± 25°, 64 ± 25°, or 184 ± 25° for clearly defined side chain rotamers not subject to averaging. Determination of the secondary structure of PyJ enabled identification of hydrogen bonding partners in regions of regular α-helix. Amide groups were considered to be donors of hydrogen bonds if their signals were observed in15N-separated HSQC after 30 min of H-D exchange at pH 6.0, 303 K. Distance restraints representing 12 hydrogen bonds were derived from H-D exchange experiments. N-O and NH-O distance restraints were created for slow exchanging amide protons found only in these regions. The upper and lower bounds of N-O restraints were set to 3.5 and 2.5 Å, respectively. The NH-O restraints employed upper and lower limits of 2.5 and 1.5 Å, respectively. Structure calculations in CNS 1.0 (50Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) employed torsion angle dynamics (TAD) to generate each starting structure (51Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 124: 154-164Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar) followed by conventional simulated annealing (SA) in Cartesian space to refine each structure (52Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). TAD at high temperature excels in exploration of conformational space and in boosting convergence rate (51Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 124: 154-164Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Distances to methyl protons, aromatic ring protons, and non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons were computed using ther −6 summation method (53Fletcher C.M. Jones D.N.M. Diamond R. Neuhaus D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 292-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The default force constants of the TAD/SA protocol implemented in CNS were used. In order to improve convergence rate, the numbers of steps in each of the three stages of molecular dynamics of the TAD/SA protocol were increased as follows: high temperature (T = 50,000 K) TAD used 4000 steps; the TAD cooling stage used 2000 steps; and the SA cooling stage used 6000 steps of Cartesian dynamics. Of 100 structures computed, 47 were accepted that meet the following criteria: no NOE violations larger than 0.5 Å, no dihedral angle violations larger than 5°, total energies less than 205 kcal/mol, and van der Waals energies (using quartic repulsive potential) less than 60 kcal/mol. The quality of the structures was analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR (54Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). Electrostatic surface properties of PyJ and other J domains were investigated with GRASP (55Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). r.m.s.d., secondary structure, surface exposure, hydrogen bonding, and other parameters of protein structure were measured and illustrated using MOLMOL (56Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates and NMR structural restraints were deposited at the Rutgers Protein Data Bank under accession code1faf. Chimeras of theE. coli DnaJ chaperone were constructed by substituting the wild-type PyJ domain, i.e. all 85 residues of tiny T Ag or various mutant PyJ domains for the E. coli J domain (residues 1–70). The ability of the chimeras to promote viability of a hypersensitive E. coli strain with DnaJ disrupted was tested at extremes of high and low growth temperature (20Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The chimera with wild-type PyJ domain can restore growth at the restrictive temperatures of 42 and 14 °C equally well as the native E. coli J domain (Table I). A chimera substituting residues 1–79 shared by all Py T antigens gave similar results. The chimera with the V4D mutant PyJ domain supports modestly reduced growth of the E. coli at low temperature and dramatically reduced growth at high temperature. The Q32K PyJ mutant chimera, substituting the consensus positive charge, confers growth equivalent to the native Dna J control and wild-type PyJ chimera (Table I). The Q32E mutant chimera, substituting charge opposite the consensus, dramatically reduces growth at both high and low temperature. The L13V PyJ mutant chimera is almost as deficient in restoring growth as the negative control lacking any source of DnaJ.

The present studies demonstrate that TPA treatment of U-937 leukemia cells is associated with release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3 and induction of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. By contrast, the TUR cell variant, which is deficient in PKCbeta, failed to respond to TPA with release of cytochrome c and induction of the caspase-3 cascade. Moreover, stable overexpression of PKCbeta in TUR cells reconstituted sensitivity to TPA-induced cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3. The results also demonstrate that treatment of cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk blocks both TPA-induced apoptosis and monocytic differentiation. Similar results were obtained in U-937 cells stably expressing the CrmA caspase inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that TPA induces cytochrome c release by a PKCbeta-dependent mechanism and that activation of caspase-mediated signaling is required for induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype."

Although the extracellular space contains high concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium ions, the voltage-dependent calcium channel provides a selective means for a high throughput of calcium ions.

The experimental procedure known as scanning cysteine accessibility method (SCAM)1 has been extensively applied to study short regions of the secondary structure of membrane bound proteins to elucidate secondary structure (22Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). SCAM is based on the fact that known protein secondary structures, such as an α-helix or β-sheet, contain amino acids that are exposed to the extracellular space. The periodicity of these exposed amino acids, as determined by the secondary structure of the region, provide a means by which overall secondary structure can be determined. Akabas et al. (22Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) demonstrated that by individually changing each amino acid, in a given segment, to cysteine, then adding sulfhydryl-modifying compounds, they could determine which amino acids of the acetylcholine receptor were exposed extracellularly, and subsequently the implied secondary structure of that region.

Among these, the most revealing and detailed studies were done on the potassium channel pore-lining region (39Kürz L.L. Zühlke R.D. Zhang H.-J. Joho R.H. Biophys.

Importantly, these findings were recently confirmed by x-ray crystallographic studies (41Pascual J.M. Shieh C.-C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1055-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,42Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar), and clearly demonstrated the relevance of this method in determining unknown secondary structure. To examine the secondary structure of the voltage-dependent calcium channel pore, we systematically introduced cysteine mutations within consecutive positions in all four pore-lining segments of a calcium channel. These mutants were expressed in Xenopusoocytes and their sensitivities to methanethiosulfonate compounds were determined. Based on the accessibility to sulfhydryl modification, we established a secondary structure for the pore-lining segments and made observations that provide an initial spatial arrangement of the selectivity filter in the pore. Amino acids that reside within the pore of the human heart calcium channel (HHT-1) (52Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke R.J. Weghuis D.O. Klockner U. Wakamori M.

Fragments from these constructs were then cleaved using the unique restriction sites MfeI (1732) and ClaI (2663) and ligated into the full-length HHT-1 cDNA. Substitution by serine for the endogenous pore cysteine residue, Cys330, was performed in the same manner as the individual cysteine mutants for motif I. The motif II mutations, T669C, V670C, F671C, Q672C, I673C, L674C, T675C, G676C, E677C, D678C, W679C, and N680C, were subcloned into a BamHI (2498)/BsaAI (4550) cassette of the full-length HHT-1 cDNA and sequenced.

Complementary RNA synthesis was accomplished by employing the T7 mMessage mMachineTM (Ambion). The resultant transcripts were quantified spectrophotometrically, diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl, and verified by formaldehyde-based agarose gel electrophoresis. cRNAs were injected into freshly isolated, defolliculated stage V-VIXenopus laevis oocytes in an approximate mass ratio of 2:1:1 for α1:α2/δ:β3, respectively. The total concentration of cRNA injected into each oocyte was 1 μg/μl. After 2–4 days of incubation at 19 °C, in physiological solution containing (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, 0.5 theophylline, pH 7.5, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, whole cell currents were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. The currents were measured in a solution, containing (in mm): 40 Ba(OH)2, 50 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 niflumic acid, 2 KOH, 5 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Voltage and current electrodes had a tip resistance of 0.5–1.5 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes that exhibited a large calcium-activated chloride channel conductance were injected with 50 nl of 40 mmK4-BAPTA solution (potassium BAPTA, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.05) (59Stühmer W. Parekh A.B. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recordings. Plenum Press, New York1995: 341-356Google Scholar). Whole cell leakage and capacitive currents were subtracted using the P/4 protocol. Currents were digitized at 1 kHz after being filtered at 1 kHz. The pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition (version 5.6) and analysis (version 6.03). The peak current amplitude of wild-type channels was determined through examining the channels current-voltage relationship (data not shown). The potential which delivered peak current for the wild-type was 20.00 ± 5.14 mVs. The voltage pulse was applied every 10 s from a holding potential of −80 mV to a test potential of +20 mV; the duration of the pulse was 80 ms. The current was determined to have reached steady-state when there was less than a 10% increase or decrease in current amplitude after 5 min. After whole cell Ba2+ currents reached steady-state, methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) were perfused into the bath solution surrounding the oocytes for 2 min (4 ml/min). The MTS compounds were freshly diluted from a 100 mm stock solution into the 40 mmBa2+ solution to a final concentration of 3 mm. The voltage pulse was applied as described previously. The percent difference between the control current amplitude and the current amplitude after the addition of the MTS compound was determined for each individual oocyte. The results have been expressed as an average of the decrease in the peak current potential for each mutant. To perform SCAM on calcium channels, we made systematic individual mutations converting each amino acid in the pore-lining segments into a cysteine residue (except those that are cysteine residues in the wild-type channel, i.e. Cys330 and Cys1383) as depicted in Fig.1. Each of the mutated channels, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, produced measurable Ba2+ currents when tested using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp method. However, several of the mutants did express smaller currents when compared with wild-type. This behavior was predominately found in the selectivity filter and in motif II mutants. Current-voltage relationships for each of the pore mutants and HHT-1 demonstrated that the replaced amino acids caused no significant changes in the half-activation of the channel or in the peak current potential (data not shown). The native L-type calcium channel carries cysteine residues at the outer mouth of the pore, thus treatment of the wild-type channel with methanethiosulfonates may result in inhibition of the current. In order to determine whether the endogenous cysteines in the neighborhood of the pore-lining segments contributed to the inhibition of the calcium channel, we replaced the three cysteines in the pore region, Cys330, Cys1383, and Cys1396, with serines and tested for sensitivity to each of the three MTS compounds. The HHT-1 channel exhibited mild sensitivity, 20–30% current reduction, to all three of the MTS compounds. However, the current reduction of 2C → S (C1383S and C1396S) and 3C → S (C330S, C1383S, and C1396S), upon addition of MTSET, was 24 and 14%, respectively. While showing a moderate decrease in sensitivity, a two-tailed Student's t test analysis did not reveal a significant difference between the degree of MTS inhibition for these channels (Fig. 2 A). This also means that the above cysteine residues are not located in the narrowest section of the pore. Thus, sulfhydryl modification at these residues does not impose a sufficient degree of block to prevent the ion permeation. Testing these mutants with MTSES led to the same pattern of inhibition as that of MTSET (Fig. 2 B). However, MTSEA provided consistently higher inhibition of the wild-type and mutant channels than that found for the other two MTS compounds (Fig.2 C). This effect can be attributed to the promiscuous membrane permeation of this MTS compound (43Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharm. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As a result, we felt to preserve the integrity of the channel and because the endogenous cysteines did not produce significant block, all subsequent mutations were made in the wild-type HHT-1. In previous SCAM studies, reversible reduction of the disulfide bond formed between the cysteine residue and the MTS compound using dithiothreitol (DTT) (39Kürz L.L. Zühlke R.D. Zhang H.-J.

The effect that DTT would have on the modified calcium channel was unknown. To make an attempt to reverse the reaction of the MTS compounds, we used four different concentrations of DTT. Histograms depicting the current remaining after addition of MTSET compound and the subsequent perfusion of four different concentrations of DTT are shown in Fig. 3 A. When oocytes expressing the wild-type channel were superfused with a bath solution containing 3 mm MTSET, current reduction of about 20% was observed. Upon exchanging the bath solution with different concentrations of DTT, we observed a slight reversion of current block at 1 mm concentration, however, we were not able to sustain this reduction with increasing DTT concentrations (Fig. 3 A). In fact, high concentrations of DTT, 20 and 50 mm, significantly decreased the current remaining, instead of reducing MTS block. Since the overall effects of DTT were not substantial, even at concentrations of 1 mm, we concluded that upon disulfide bond formation the region is sterically hindered, therefore reduction cannot occur. The test of the E334C mutation, a well exposed site for extracellular attack by all three MTS compounds, confirmed that once the -SH site was reacted with a bulky MTS compound DTT cannot reduce the S-S bond (Fig.3 B). Upon addition of 5 mm and 50 mmDTT, there was a significant decrease in the current remaining (p < 0.05), suggesting that the integrity of the channel has been compromised. Currents expressed by mutants in which amino acids in the SS2 segment of motif I were systematically changed into cysteine residues were tested for block by the MTS compounds. Application of MTSET to mutants in motif I that represent a stretch of six amino acids in the SS2 segment (TMEGWT, which includes the MEGW signature sequence for this motif) resulted in a block of calcium channel currents for every second introduced cysteine residue (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of the same mutant channels with MTSES exhibited a similar pattern and percentage of block as that observed for MTSET (data not shown). The pattern of block that begins at T332C and appears substantial for every second amino acid, while the intermittent ones are only slightly blocked, resembles a secondary structure in which every second position is sterically hindered. This type of structure can be best described by a β-pleated sheet-like arrangement of the amino acids in this region. The MTSEA compound shows surprisingly high block with all of the mutants in motif I, again an effect that can best be explained by the high membrane permeability of this compound (data not shown). None of the individual motif I SS1 segment cysteine mutant channels (TVFQCI) exhibited substantial reduction of barium current by MTSET (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4 A). However, Q329C showed a significant degree of block by both MTSES (36%,p < 0.04, n = 5) and MTSEA (45%,p < 0.04, n = 7), possibly suggesting the presence of an α-helix. This latter observation is consistent with the simulated structural model for Ca2+ channels (48Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1995; 50: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar) and also with that determined by x-ray crystallography for the inner pore-helix in the KcsA channel (42Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). Three of the individual cysteine residue substitutions in the SS2 region of motif II had current inhibited by MTSET (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4 B); E677C, D678C, and W679C, a pattern resembling a “random coil,” because it lacks the necessary characteristics of defined structures, such as an α-helix or a β-sheet. Of these residues, only two in the SS2 region had currents reduced by MTSES, D678C (42%, p < 0.02,n = 9) and W679C (52%, p < 0.001,n = 8) (data not shown). All of the mutants in the SS2 region, with the exception of T675C, had a high degree of current inhibition by MTSEA (data not shown), which is consistent with the high membrane permeability of this compound. From the motif II SS1 mutant channels, only I673C exhibited significant current reduction by MTSES (39%, p < 0.004, n = 4) (data not shown), and none of these channels had currents inhibited by MTSET (Fig. 4B) or MTSEA (data not shown). For the individual cysteine mutant channels in the motif III SS2 region, an increased degree of block by MTSET was obtained after amino acid T1084C. The extent of current block is maximal at W1088C (87%,p < 0.001), then quickly decreases (Fig.4 C). The same pattern of block was observed upon addition of MTSES (Fig. 5 B). This pattern is typically assigned a random coil structure. All of the mutants between T1084C and E1090C were sensitive to inhibition by MTSEA showing various degrees of block (T1084C, 81% and E1090C, 41%,p < 0.001–0.04, n = 6–17) (Fig.5 C) without a definable pattern for secondary structures, again a characteristic that is typical for MTSEA. MTSET application to the motif III SS1 mutant channels was able to block currents from F1080C (51%, p < 0.001, n = 8) and T1081C (42%, p < 0.01, n = 14) (Fig.4 C). Currents from T1081C were also blocked by both MTSES (46%, p < 0.001, n = 12) and MTSEA (88%, p < 0.001, n = 9) (Fig. 5,B and C, respectively), again possibly suggesting the presence of an α-helical turn in this region. The amino acid substitutions from the SS2 region of motif IV resulted in only two neighboring amino acids (G1386C and E1387C) which demonstrated large current block by MTSET (66 and 73%, respectively, p < 0.001, n = 7) (Fig.4 D). Interestingly, the two amino acid positions showed little or no block (that is significantly greater than wild-type) by MTSES (data not shown). The mutant channels from positions T1385C to Q1390C all had large current inhibition upon addition of MTSEA (data not shown). Most of the amino acid positions in the SS1 region of motif IV, encompassing a stretch from L1379C to A1384C, were insensitive to the MTS compounds. Only F1381C had a significant current reduction by MTSET (38%, p < 0.04, n = 9) (Fig.4 D), while L1380C and F1381C both had currents blocked by MTSES (34 and 36%, respectively, p < 0.05,n = 5–6) and the current from R1382C was inhibited by MTSEA (50%, p < 0.02, n = 5) (data not shown). The selectivity filter amino acids for each of the four motifs should be exposed in the pore vestibule, since these glutamates bind to the calcium ion. All four of the selectivity filter amino acids, E334C, E677C, E1086C, and E1387C, demonstrated significant current reduction upon the addition of MTSET, 61, 62, 41, and 73%, respectively, in comparison to wild-type (p < 0.03). The substitutions E334C and E1086C showed currents that were inhibited by MTSES, 64 and 50%, respectively (p < 0.001). In contrast, barium currents through E677C and E1387C were not significantly sensitive to sulfhydryl modification by MTSES when compared with wild-type (20 and 27%, respectively, p> 0.05) (Fig. 6). As expected, all four selectivity filter amino acids demonstrated significant current reduction upon addition of MTSEA; 79% (E334C), 88% (E677C), 59% (E1086C), and 84% (E1387C) (p < 0.001). The removal of endogenous cysteine amino acids in the pore region of the voltage-dependent calcium channel did not have a significant effect on the inhibition of channel current by the MTS compounds. The three different wild-types tested, HHT-1, 2C → S, and 3C → S all had 15–25% block when the MTS compounds were added to the bath, with the exception of MTSEA which demonstrated a 50% block on 3C → S. This latter observation suggests a conformational change in the channel structure upon removal of the three endogenous pore cysteines. The observed higher degree of block could be a result of an increase in the size of the pore of the channel or potentially exposing another endogenous cysteine residue that is hidden in the native channel conformation. The secondary structure of the pore region was heretofore thought to be uniform for all four motifs. Our present results, however, indicate that they are strikingly distinct. We employed the Scanning Cysteine Accessibility Method to decipher the topology of Ca2+ channel pore-lining segments. The pore region of motif I, based on the intermittent block by the MTS compounds, reveals a secondary structure best described as a β-pleated sheet. The pore region of motifs II and III displayed a sequential block encompassing three and four amino acids, similar to the structural arrangement which is consistent with the presence of a random coil, whereas motif IV, exhibits periodicity in its block by the MTS compounds, strongly suggesting the presence of at least an α-helical turn in this region. Our data supports the findings of Schetz and Anderson (49Schetz J.A. Anderson P.A.V. Biol. Bull. 1993; 185: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) who determined that the motif IV pore region lacks the amino acids necessary to make a p-bend. Their study indicates that there is a 100% probability of a p-bend in motifs I, II, and III, which is in agreement with the findings of a β-sheet, and two random coils, respectively. These observations establish structural substance for the assumed, impaired 4-fold symmetry of the four selectivity filter glutamates. The high number of conserved amino acids residues in the pore regions of all known calcium channels lend credence to the applicability of this data to all calcium channels, with the possible exception of the low-voltage activated T-type channels. The size and charge of the MTS compounds are important in analyzing the results of this study. The positively charged MTSET, even though it is the largest of the three compounds utilized, is able to block all four of the selectivity filter amino acids by at least 40%. The negatively charged MTSES has the same effect on the selectivity filter amino acids from motifs I and III, however, the results for motifs II and IV indicate that MTSES does not bind these amino acids. One possible explanation is that the pore regions of motifs II and IV are deeper in the membrane than those of motifs I and III, thus these latter two glutamates may be hindering the MTSES compound from reaching deeper into the membrane by repulsing the negatively charged compound. The dramatic decrease of channel current upon addition of MTSEA was expected. This compound is freely membrane permeable and has the potential to bind to cysteines from the outside or inside of the membrane (43Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharm. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This allows MTSEA to block channel current even if the introduced cysteine residue is hidden from the bath solution surrounding the oocyte. An important structural implication originating from this SCAM study is the involvement of sequential amino acid residues in high percentage block in each pore-lining segment. In motif I, six residues, in motif II and IV, three and two, respectively, while in motif III a stretch of five amino acids responded to MTS treatment with substantial current reduction. Therefore, our results are similar to those found for the voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels, having three or more consecutive amino acids demonstrating large block (greater than 50%). Thus, these residues are structurally part of a highly distorted 4-fold symmetry that runs quasi-parallel with the imagined axis of the pore (Fig. 7). Such an arrangement contradicts an earlier model that assumed the narrowest point of the pore is at the selectivity filter glutamates. The model depicted in Fig. 7 does not exclude the possibility that the four glutamates form the high affinity selectivity filter potentially coordinating one or more Ca2+ ions. The model does, however, introduce the possibility that the polypeptide backbone carbonyl groups coordinate additional Ca2+ ions, thus supporting the multiple occupancy theory. In this aspect, perhaps the motif I SS2 segment provides the most important contribution. An additional purpose of this study was to investigate the structural relationship between the Na+, K+, and Ca2+ voltage-gated ion channels. It is clear that despite the close homology in the pore regions of this family of channels, the selectivity filters of the individual channels are able to differentiate between the ions with high fidelity. Heinemann et al. (50Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 51Heinemann S.H. Schlief T. Mori Y. Imoto K. Brazilian J. Med. Res. 1994; 27: 2781-2802PubMed Google Scholar) investigated this principle by conferring Ca2+ ion selectivity onto the sodium channel. However, the obverse of this procedure, conferring Na+selectivity onto the calcium channel, has been unsuccessful. This indicates that there are more extensive requirements for Ca2+ channel selectivity than just the 4 glutamate residues. The present study revealed that the secondary structures of the pore regions of Na+ and Ca2+ voltage-gated channels are not identical. Furthermore, since a random coil is less strictly structured than an α-helix or a β-sheet, the presence of these more rigid structures may be necessary for the selectivity observed in Ca2+ channels. Removal of these elements, as in the experiments by Heinemann et al. (50Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 51Heinemann S.H. Schlief T. Mori Y. Imoto K. Brazilian J. Med. Res. 1994; 27: 2781-2802PubMed Google Scholar) results in the formation of a non-selective ion channel. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the secondary structure of the pore-lining regions of Ca2+ channels is critical to the Ca2+selectivity and dissecting the structure is key to understanding the mechanisms by which calcium moves through the pore. We thank Drs. Gabor Mikala for providing the 2C → S α1 subunit for these studies and Mark Strobeck for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2326795245,"By immunoscreening with an antibody raised against a plasma membrane protein, we have cloned a growth suppressor gene, Gros1 and assigned it to short arm of human chromosome 1. Two alternatively spliced forms of the gene encoding 84- and 41-kDa (carboxy-terminus truncated) proteins were cloned. The two transcripts, 4.4 and 2.7 kb, were expressed weakly in most of the human tissues, with a high expression of the smaller transcript in placenta, ovary and testis. Normal human fibroblasts in culture showed two transcripts, with a higher level of expression of the 4.4 kb transcript. Transformed cells on the other hand showed predominant expression of the 2.7 kb transcript. Two Gros1 transcripts were also detected in most of the mouse tissues. Stable transfection of the mouse cDNA encoding the 85-kDa protein into NIH3T3 cells resulted in their slow growth and reduced colony-forming efficiency. Stable clones expressing antisense RNA on the other hand exhibited higher colony forming efficiency. While our data implied that Gros1 is a novel growth suppressor gene on human chromosome 1, an independent study has recently characterized its rat-homolog as a leucine proline-enriched novel basement membrane-associated proteoglycan leprecan. We describe here cloning, expression and biological activity analysis implying that this novel proteoglycan is a potential growth suppressor on chromosome 1p31, frequently altered in many malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2319526902,"The MDM2 oncoprotein binds to p53 and abrogates p53-mediated G1 arrest and apoptosis. We show that MDM2 over-expression accelerates cell cycle progression of RPMI2650 cells by overcoming the negative effect of endogenous wild type p53 at the G1/S checkpoint. The interaction with p53 and transcription inhibition are necessary but not sufficient. The RING finger domain of MDM2 is also required for the positive effect of MDM2 on the cell cycle. Surprisingly, several point mutants in the zinc binding sites of the RING finger are fully competent for cell cycle stimulation even though they abolish MDM2-directed degradation of p53 and MDM2 E3-ligase activity. In contrast, alterations in and around the cryptic nucleolar localization sequence (KR motif) inhibit MDM2-mediated cell cycle progression as well as p53 degradation and MDM2 E3 ligase activity. We found that all the RING mutants decrease inhibition of both p53 dependent reporters and endogenous p21CIP1/WAF1/SDI1. These results indicate that the RING finger of MDM2 has a role in the regulation of the cell cycle that is independent of p53 degradation and endogenous p21CIP1/WAF1/SDI1 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2318763653,"ETO (MTG8) was first described due to its involvement in the (8;21) translocation frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemias. In the t(8;21) the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 is fused to ETO on chromosome 8. The resultant hybrid protein is comprised of the DNA binding domain of AML-1 and the majority of ETO. This study examines the subnuclear distributions of ETO, AML-1B and AML-1/ETO proteins fused to green fluorescence protein in living cells using fluorescence microscopy. Further, we identified a 40 amino acid portion of ETO (amino acids 241-280) that was sufficient to cause nuclear import of green fluorescent protein. Mutational analysis demonstrated that lysine 265 and/or arginine 266 were required for nuclear import of ETO, but that the surrounding basic residues were not critical. ETO interacted with the nuclear import proteins importin-alpha and beta in vitro, and mutations in ETO that abolish nuclear localization also abolished the in vitro interaction with importin-alpha and beta. These data suggest that ETO enters the nucleus via an importin-mediated pathway. Additionally, ETO and AML-1/ETO co-localized to punctate nuclear bodies distinct from those containing promyelocytic leukemia protein. Nuclear body formation was dependent upon a region of ETO N-terminal to the nuclear localization signal. Thus, ETO and AML-1/ETO reside in potentially novel subnuclear compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2333392844,"We studied the ability of F9 teratocarcinoma cells to arrest in G1/S and G2/M checkpoints after gamma-irradiation. Wild-type p53 protein was rapidly accumulated in F9 cells after gamma-irradiation, however, this was followed not by a G1/S arrest but by a short and reversible delay of the cell cycle in G2/M. In order to elucidate the reasons of the lack of G1/S arrest in F9 cells, we investigated the expression of p53 downstream target Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. In spite of p53-dependent activation of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene promoter and p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA accumulation upon irradiation, the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was not detected by either immunoblot or immunofluorescence techniques. However, the cells treated with a specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin revealed the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein both in non-irradiated and irradiated cells. Therefore we suggest that p21WAF1/CIP1 protein is degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism in F9 cells and the lack of G1/S arrest after gamma-irradiation is due to this degradation. We also examined the expression and activity of cell cycle regulatory proteins: G1- and G2-cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. In the absence of functional p21WAF1/CIP1 inhibitor, the activity of G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes was insufficiently inhibited to cause a G1 arrest, whereas a decrease of cdc2 and cyclin B1-associated kinase activities was enough to contribute to a reversible G2 arrest following gamma-irradiation. After gamma-irradiation, the majority of F9 cells undergo apoptosis implying that wt-p53 likely triggers pro-apoptotic gene expression in DNA damaged cells. Elimination of defected cells might ensure maintenance of genome integrity in the remaining cell population."
https://openalex.org/W2325337835,"The middle T oncogene of murine polyomavirus (PymT) rapidly transforms and immortalizes murine embryonic endothelial cells (EC), leading to the formation of vascular tumors in newborn mice, by recruitment of host, non-transformed EC. These tumors are reminiscent of human vascular tumors like cavernous hemangioma, Kaposi's sarcoma or those characterizing Kasabach-Merrit syndrome. Here we investigate the in vitro and in vivo behavior of human primary umbilical cord vein EC expressing PymT. While PymT has been unable to transform human fibroblasts in earlier experiments or controls done here, mT expressing EC (PymT-EC) derived by infection with pLX-PymT retrovirus induce hemangiomas in nu/nu mice. These tumors contain not only human cells but also recruited mouse EC as shown by the presence of human and murine CD31 positive EC. In vitro analysis shows that PymT-EC retain endothelial specific markers like CD31, Von Willebrand factor, and VE-cadherin, and reach the confluence without signs of overgrowth. They are also responsive to vascular endothelial growth factor-A. However, their proliferation rate is increased. The balance between urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is modified; RNA and catalytic activity for the former are elevated while PAI-1 RNA is reduced. In contrast with murine model, where the PymT EC cells become immortal, the effects induced by PymT in human EC are transient. After 12–15 passages, human PymT EC stop proliferating, assume a senescent phenotype, and lose the ability to induce hemangiomas. At the same time both the amount of middle T protein and the level of activation of pp60c-src lower."
https://openalex.org/W2145036259,"The x-ray crystal structure of the heterodimeric carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from <i>Escherichia coli</i> has identified an intermolecular tunnel that connects the glutamine binding site within the small amidotransferase subunit to the two phosphorylation sites within the large synthetase subunit. The tunneling of the ammonia intermediate through the interior of the protein has been proposed as a mechanism for the delivery of the ammonia from the small subunit to the large subunit. A series of mutants created within the ammonia tunnel were prepared by the placement of a constriction via site-directed mutagenesis. The degree of constriction within the ammonia tunnel of these enzymes was found to correlate to the extent of the uncoupling of the partial reactions, the diminution of carbamoyl phosphate formation, and the percentage of the internally derived ammonia that is channeled through the ammonia tunnel. NMR spectroscopy and a radiolabeled probe were used to detect and identify the enzymatic synthesis of <i>N</i>-amino carbamoyl phosphate and <i>N</i>-hydroxy carbamoyl phosphate from hydroxylamine and hydrazine. The kinetic results indicate that hydroxylamine, derived from the hydrolysis of γ-glutamyl hydroxamate, is channeled through the ammonia tunnel to the large subunit. Discrimination between the passage of ammonia and hydroxylamine was observed among some of these tunnel-impaired enzymes. The overall results provide biochemical evidence for the tunneling of ammonia within the native carbamoyl phosphate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2333534752,"We have identified a gene encoding a member of the Csk family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in the early-diverging metazoan Hydra. In situ hybridization analysis of the distribution of RNA from the Hydra Csk gene indicates that it is expressed in most of the epithelial cells of the adult polyp and in gametogenic cells. Comparison of the expression pattern of Hydra Csk with that of STK, the Hydra Src gene orthologue, reveals that the two genes are largely co-expressed. Such co-expression is consistent with a role for Hydra Csk in regulation of STK activity. This possibility was tested directly by coexpressing Hydra Csk with STK in yeast. Co-expression suppressed the growth inhibition seen when STK alone is expressed in yeast. Suppression was dependent on the presence of the putative regulatory tyrosine in the carboxyl-terminal tail of STK. Phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis confirmed that expression of Csk resulted in suppression of STK kinase activity. Taken together these data indicate that the regulatory circuit involving Src and Csk PTKs was established prior to the divergence of the phylum Cnidaria from the rest of the metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2070659557,"It has been established that in the case of inducible NO synthase (NOS), a functionally active homodimer is assembled from the heme-deficient monomeric apo-NOS <i>in vitro</i> by the addition of heme, whereas the heme-deficient neuronal isoform (apo-nNOS) is at best only partially activated. In the current study we have discovered that reactive oxygen species, which can be removed by the addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase, destroy the heme and limit the activation of apo-nNOS <i>in vitro.</i> With the use of these improved conditions, we show for the first time that heme insertion is a rapid process that results in formation of a heme-bound monomeric nNOS that is able to form the ferrous-CO P450 complex but is unable to synthesize NO. A slow process requiring more than 90 min is required for dimerization and activation of this P450 intermediate to give an enzyme with a specific activity of approximately 1100 nmol of NO formed/min/mg of protein, similar to that of the native enzyme. Interestingly, the dimer is not SDS-resistant and is not the same dimer that forms <i>in vivo</i>.

Transport of glucose into mammalian cells is the rate-limiting step for its utilization and accordingly is a highly regulated process. Maintenance of a constant blood glucose level is essential for cellular homeostasis. In kidney, glucose is reabsorbed from the urinary filtrate by the action of several types of glucose transporters arranged in series along the proximal tubule. These function together in polarized epithelial cells to mediate transepithelial transport of glucose. SGLT1(Na+/glucose) cotransporters in the apical membrane catalyze active glucose transport into the cell driven by the Na+ gradient (1Wright E.M. Hager K.M. Turk E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Glucose diffuses passively out of the cell into the circulation via basolateral GLUT facilitative transporters (2Silverman M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 757-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). High affinity glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT1 located in late proximal tubule scavenge the remainder of filtered glucose not reabsorbed in early proximal tubule (3Lee W.S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12032-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SGLT1 is also expressed in small intestine where it mediates absorption of dietary glucose and galactose (3Lee W.S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol.

Most of our current information concerning the regulation of SGLT1 expression has been obtained from studies using the polarized epithelial cell line LLC-PK1, derived from porcine kidney (5Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SGLT1 is expressed in this cell line as shown by cDNA cloning and Northern blot analysis (6Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6491-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is highly regulated by the cell growth and differentiation state (5Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yet S.F. Kong C.T. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell. PhysioL. 1994; 158: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11919-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) exert opposing effects on SGLT1 mRNA stability and steady-state levels in confluent cultures. Activation of PKA results in SGLT1 message stabilization (9Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20536-20542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas PKC activation by phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate (TPA) results in rapid degradation of the SGLT1 message (8Shioda T. Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11919-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PKA-stimulated message stabilization was associated with a protein phosphorylation-dependent binding of cytoplasmic protein(s) to a uridine-rich sequence (URE) in the 3′-UTR (10Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23996-24003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Changes in SGLT1 mRNA half-life elicited by PKA activation correlate well with changes in steady-state levels of the transporter (9Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20536-20542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicating that message stability is a major determinant of expression level. In the present study, we identify a cis-regulatory domain within the URE of the SGLT1 mRNA 3′-UTR that binds a 38-kDa nucleocytoplasmic protein and is required for PKA-mediated stabilization of this message. Our approach was to map the minimal protein-binding site using an in vitro assay of PKA-stimulated RNA-protein complex formation. This in vitroassay was also used to characterize key RNA sequence specificity determinants and identify a mutation that prevents protein binding. Thein vivo effects of this mutation, placed in the context of the URE, on cAMP-mediated message stabilization were then tested by inserting it into a β-globin reporter minigene construct and transfecting it into LLC-PK1 cells. Results from this analysis, in combination with deletion studies, demonstrate that the SGLT1 URE contains distinct sequence domains that convey instability to the stable β-globin message as well as a regulatory domain that acts to stabilize the message in response to PKA activation. [α-32P]Uridine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Nucleotide triphosphates were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RNA polymerases T3 and T7 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). RNase T1 (aspergillus oryzae) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and phosphatase (potato acid, type III) were obtained from Sigma. Plasmids pTet-tTAk, pUHC13-3, and pT3/T7α18 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and pSVneo was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The porcine renal cell line LLC-PK1 clone G8 was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 0.37% sodium bicarbonate, and 24 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, as described previously (11Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 104cells/cm2 and grown for 4 days (postconfluent state) in this medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml), and then IBMX (final concentration, 1 mm) was added to the indicated samples with medium change. Unless otherwise stated, cells were harvested at 96 h after addition of IBMX with one medium change at 72 h after treatment. Monolayers of cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride as modified from Schreiber et al. (12Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic supernatants were removed and recentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove any paticulate material. The pellets were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A and then were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate. The nuclear extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and stored in aliquots at −85 °C. The protein concentration of cytosolic and nuclear extracts was determined by the Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) as described by Atkins and Tuen (13Atkins R.E. Tuen R.S. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 496-499PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]uridine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol). The renal SGLT1 cDNA plasmid pPSGT-B1 (6Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6491-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. David Rhoads (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). All nucleotide numbers refer to the pig SGLT1 sequence (GenBankTMaccession number M34044) reported by Ohta et al. (6Ohta T. Isselbacher K.J. Rhoads D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6491-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasmid 3UTR2 is a 1317-bp EcoRV/HindIII fragment of pPSGT-B1 subcloned into the pBluescript II SK(−) vector. Plasmid p3UTR2Δ7 was generated from 3UTR2 by deleting a 443-bpBamHI/AvaII fragment. A sense 3UTR2 RNA transcript was synthesized fromStuI-linearized 3UTR2 using T3 RNA polymerase and contained 435 nucleotides (nt) of the pig SGLT1 3′-UTR (nucleotides 2263–2697) and 69 nt of pBluescript SK(−). Plasmid 3UTR2Δ7 was linearized withStuI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to yield a transcript of 178 nt containing 122 nt of the pig SGLT1 3′-UTR (nucleotides 2576–2697) and 56 nt of pBluescript. Plasmids 122-ntBam and 122-nt m2/Bam (see below) were linearized with BbsI and transcribed with T3 polymerase to yield wild-type and mutant 120-nt transcripts, respectively, that lack pBluescript sequence in the riboprobe. Shorter probes containing sequences within this 122-nt SGLT1 3′-UTR region (2576–2697) and the homologous human probe HSGLT were synthesized from synthetic double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide templates that contained a minimal T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG at their 5′ end. Single-stranded oligonucleotides (2 μg/μl) were dissolved in TE buffer, pH 7.6, and then NaCl was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. Equal volumes of sense and antisense oligonucleotides were mixed and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min and then incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 300 mm, and double-stranded DNA was precipitated in ethanol at −70 °C overnight. Pellets were washed with 80% ethanol, dissolved in TE buffer, pH 7.6, at 1 μg/μl, and stored at −20 °C. Sense strand RNA transcripts were synthesized from synthetic double-stranded DNA templates using T7 RNA polymerase, 5 μm α-[32P]uridine triphosphate, 3000 Ci/mmol, and 0.5 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP. The sequences of the RNA probes used in the present study are summarized in Fig. 1. After transcription, RNase-free DNase (RQ1 DNase, Promega) was added, and mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C to remove template DNA. Then 20 μg of yeast tRNA was added as carrier, followed by dilution with diethylpropylcarbonate-treated water to a final volume of 100 μl. Labeled transcripts were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated twice with 2 m ammonium acetate in 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol at −80 °C for at least 1 h. The final pellet was washed with 80% ice-cold ethanol, air-dried, dissolved in diethylpropylcarbonate-treated water, stored at −20 °C, and used as soon as possible. The integrity of the transcripts was verified by electrophoresis on 6% acrylamide urea gels. To synthesize unlabeled transcripts in quantity for competition experiments, transcription reactions were performed by the same procedure described above except [32P]UTP was replaced by 1 mm UTP, and the total volume of each reaction mixture was increased to 100 μl. Also, the RNA transcripts were precipitated without addition of carrier yeast tRNA, and the concentration was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm. Radiolabeled RNA probe binding to protein was determined by the UV cross-linking assay described previously (14You Y. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, either cytosolic or nuclear cell extracts (40 or 20 μg, respectively) were incubated with 0.2 ng of32P-labeled RNA probe (105 cpm) at room temperature for 15 min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg/ml heparin, and 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The reaction mixtures were then digested with RNase T1 (20 units/ng RNA) for 30 min at room temperature. The RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked by exposing reaction mixtures on ice to 120,000 μJ short-wave radiation (254 nm) in a UV cross-linker 1800 (Stratagene) for 7 min. Samples were boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol and then resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C using an intensifying screen. Cytoplasmic proteins, 40–60 μg, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using an ABN model SD 1000 electrotransfer unit. The membrane was washed twice for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then protein renaturation was carried out by incubating the filter with a solution containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 3–16 h. The filter was then incubated with a blocking solution containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA for 2–3 h at room temperature. The indicated sense32P-labeled RNA probe was added to 2–5 ml of blocking solution to a final concentration of 0.5–1 × 106cpm/ml and incubated with the filter on a rocker at room temperature for 60 min. The blot was gently washed three times for 5 min each with a solution containing 50 mm NaCl and 12 mmHEPES, pH 7.6. The blot was then air-dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Nuclear extracts (105.6 mg of protein) were prepared from five roller bottles of IBMX-treated confluent cells and then fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Proteins precipitated between 30 and 60% ammonium sulfate were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min, dialyzed overnight against 0.4 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate with one buffer change, and then applied to a 123-ml diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DE52) column equilibrated with 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was eluted in a gradient of 0.2–0.6 mKCl at a flow rate of 0.48 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected beginning after 20 ml of elution, and 10 μl of each fraction was assayed for RNA binding using the UV cross-linking assay. Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads were washed three times with binding buffer TEN500 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl). Biotinylated RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase as described above except transcription mixtures contained 5 mm each of ATP, GTP, and UTP, 2.5 mm CTP, and 2.5 mm biotin-14 CTP. The indicated biotinylated RNA probe (200 pmol) was then complexed with 1 mg of beads in two volumes of TEN500 buffer by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocker. Then the RNA-streptavidin complexed beads were washed three times with wash buffer TEN1000 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 m NaCl). Confluent LLC-PK1 cells on two 15-cm dishes were treated with 1 mm IBMX for 72 h and then switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium deficient in methionine, cysteine, and cystine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm IBMX. After 1 h culture in 35S-deficient medium, 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine was added at a final concentration of 100 μCi/ml, and incubation was continued for an additional 5 h before preparation of a nuclear extract. The extract was first precleared of nonspecific binding proteins by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated beads equilibrated in nuclear extraction buffer B for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker. The precleared supernatant was then incubated with the specific RNA-streptavidin-complexed beads 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker. The supernatant was removed, and beads were washed three times with nuclear extraction buffer B. Then the protein-RNA-streptavidin-coupled beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min to release bound proteins and analyzed by SDS-PAGE together with prestained molecular weight markers. Gels were soaked in Autofluor (National Diagnostics, Somerville, NJ). Dried gels were exposed to Kodak MR film at −80 °C for 2–3 days. The β-globin reporter plasmid pTet-BBB (15Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which expresses β-globin under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter, was obtained from Dr. Ann-Bin Shyu (University of Texas-Houston Medical School, Houston, TX). To test the influence of the 435-nt U-rich sequence element (3UTR2; Fig. 1) on the stability of the β-globin message, 3UTR2 was inserted into a uniqueBglII site of pTet-BBB located in the 3′-UTR of β-globin. Plasmid p3UTR2/Bam was prepared from p3UTR2 (10Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23996-24003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by digestion with StuI and religation in the presence of excessBamHI linker, d(CGGGATCCCG), from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Similarly, plasmid 122-nt Bam was prepared from p3UTR2Δ7 using the above strategy. 3UTR2/Bam was digested with BamHI, and a 450-bp fragment was recovered and inserted into the unique BglII site in pTet-BBB to create pTet-BBB + 3UTR2. Plasmids p3UTR2/Bam and p122nt/Bam were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis to construct p3UTR2 m2/Bam and p122nt m2/Bam which contained a TT → GG substitution at nucleotides 2622–2623. Polyacrylamide gel-purified 50 bp complimentary oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTT TGC TTT ATG GTT GGT TAA CTT TTT CTT ATG GCT GCA CAA GTA CAA CC-3′ and 5′-GGT TGT ACT TGT GCA GCC ATA AGA AAA AGT TAA CCA ACC ATA AAG CAA AC-3′ from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) were used for site-directed mutagenesis. These were designed to achieve the required melting temperature in the presence of the AT-rich template and 2 mismatched nucleotides. The reaction was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. After 16 cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension, products were digested with DpnI to remove the original template strands, then cooled to 4 °C prior to transformation of super competent XL-1 Blue cells. p3UTR2 m2/Bam was cut withBamHI to release a 450 bp fragment which was inserted into the BglII site in pTet-BBB to create pTet-BBB + 3UTR2 m2. pTet-BBB + 47 nt was constructed by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides of the sequence 5′-CGG GAT CCT TTT GTT TTA TAA TGT TTG CTT TAT TTT TGG TTA ACT TTT TCT TAT GGA TCC G-3′, which contains the 47-nt sequence of pig SGLT1 3′-UTR (residues 2597–2643) flanked byBamHI linkers on both ends. After digestion withBamHI, this fragment was ligated into the uniqueBglII site of pTet-BBB. Automated sequencing was used to confirm the sequence and correct orientation of all constructs. LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing the tetracycline-regulated transactivator (pTet-tTA) were obtained by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection as follows. The transfection mixture (final volume, 1.2 ml) contained 20 μg of DNA in 558 μl of H2O (2 μg of pTet-tTA, 0.4 μg of pSV2neo as selectable marker, and 17.6 μg of pT7/T3α-18 as carrier DNA), 558 μl of 2× HBS (0.274 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mmglucose, 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.02) and 84 μl of 2m CaCl2. After 20–30 min of precipitation, the mixture was added to a 10-cm dish of cells at 80% cell confluence. After exposure to the DNA precipitate for 16–20 h, cells were then washed and fed with fresh medium. Two days later, cells were split 1:5 into fresh medium containing 500 ng/ml tetracycline and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Cells were maintained in the selection medium for 3–4 weeks with medium change every 3–4 days. Individual G418-resistant clones were isolated by trypsinization within a glass cylinder and expanded by growth in the selective medium. Transactivator activity of each stably transfected clone was screened by transient transfection with pUHC13-3 (Life Technologies, Inc.), a luciferase reporter plasmid responsive to the tetracycline-regulated transcriptional activator (pTA), into duplicate dishes of each isolated clone, using calcium-phosphate precipitation as described above. All dishes received 1.2-ml aliquots of the precipitation mixture containing 2 μg of pUHC13-3 and 18 μg of pT3/T7α-18 carrier DNA. After 16–20 h, DNA was removed, and fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added to each dish. Tetracycline was then added to one dish of each duplicate to a final concentration of 500 ng/ml. Titration studies using concentrations of tetracycline between 0 and 125 ng/ml tetracycline indicated that 30 ng/ml tetracycline was sufficient to prevent detectable luciferase expression from pUHC13-3 (data not shown). Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and monolayers were assayed for tetracycline-regulated luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (E1500; Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's directions. Stable transfectant clonal cell line LLC-TAK-B7 exhibited a 50-fold increase in luciferase activity at 48 h after removal of tetracycline and was chosen as the host cell line for tetracycline-regulated ectopic gene expression. The kinetics of reappearance of luciferase activity following the removal of tetracycline were also analyzed. After a 3-h lag, luciferase activity increased linearly for 16 h, reaching 50–60% of maximum at 15 h after the removal of tetracycline (data not shown). The calcium phosphate transfection method described above was modified as follows to introduce β-globin reporter plasmid plasmids pTetBBB and its derivatives into LLC-TAK-B7 with increased efficiency. LLC-TAK-B7 cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/cm2 on 10-cm dishes and grown overnight in medium containing 500 ng/ml tetracycline and 500 μg/ml G418. After 15–18 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium containing tetracycline and G418. After 1 h, 0.24 ml of a calcium phosphate transfection mixture containing 2 μg of β-globin reporter plasmid, 18 μg of carrier DNA, and 80 μg of CalPhos Maximizer (CLONTECH) was added for 4 h. Transient transfection experiments using the luciferase reporter plasmid pUHC13-3 indicated that addition of CalPhos Maximizer produced an 18-fold increase in luciferase activity per dish with greatly improved cell viability and required only 4 h of exposure of cells to the DNA precipitate compared with the 24 h of DNA exposure required in the absence of this component. Cells were washed twice and then given fresh medium containing 30 ng/ml tetracycline and 500 μg/ml G418 with or without 1 mm IBMX. After 24 h, the medium was removed, cells were washed twice then given fresh medium without tetracycline but the addition of 1 mm IBMX where indicated. As a control, 500 ng/ml tetracycline was added to one dish to suppress transcription from the plasmid. After a 15-h pulse of expression from the plasmid, transcription was terminated by addition of 500 ng/ml tetracycline. At the indicated times, monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cytoplasmic RNA was extracted (16Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) to determine the kinetics of mRNA decay. Plasmid pGAPDH was a gift from Dr. Dennis L. Foss, University of Minnesota, and consists of 865 bp of porcine GAPDH coding sequence (GenBankTMaccession number U48832) in vector pGEM-T. The plasmid was linearized with HindIII and antisense RNA transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP. Plasmid pBSSK(−) β-globin was created by subcloning rabbit β-globin cDNA (GenBankTM accession number V00879) into theEcoRV site of pBluescript SK(−). The resulting plasmid was linearized with HindIII and 32P-labeled antisense RNA transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase. Cytoplasmic RNA (10 μg) was denatured and fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Samples of 0.5 μg of 123-bp DNA ladder were also included as molecular weight markers. A poly(A)− sample was prepared from the zero time sample by hybridization with oligo(dT) and digestion of the double-stranded region with ribonuclease H. Samples were transferred by pressure to a Bright Star nylon membrane (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a PosiBlot apparatus (Stratagene) and cross-linked using a StratalinkerTM 1800 (Stratagene). Membranes were prehybridized 3 h at 55 °C as described previously (7Yet S.F. Kong C.T. Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Cell. PhysioL. 1994; 158: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and then hybridized with antisense RNA probes for β-globin and GAPDH, 3 × 106 dpm/ml each, at 55 °C overnight. Membranes were washed twice for 15 min at room temperature and then for 1 h at 55 °C and 30 min at 65 °C. All wash solutions contained 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. If necessary, background was reduced by a second 65 °C wash or by a brief 68 °C wash. Quantitation of radioactivity was performed using an Instant ImagerTM (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Filters were also exposed to X-Ray film at −85 °C using an intensifying screen. Following analysis with RNA probes, molecular weight markers were detected by hybridization with 123-bp DNA ladders labeled with α[32P]CTP by the random prime method. A 122-nt uridine-rich region (nucleotides 2576–2697) in the 3′-UTR of porcine SGLT1 mRNA (Fig. 1) has been implicated in the stabilization of this message after PKA activation (10Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23996-24003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For this analysis, 32P-labeled sense RNA transcripts within a uridine-rich region of the SGLT1 3′-UTR were utilized. After binding, digestion of unprotected RNA with ribonuclease T1, and covalent cross-linking of the RNA-protein complex catalyzed by UV irradiation, labeled RNA-protein complexes were visualized after resolution by SDS-PAGE. The 122-nt RNA fragment recognized a cytoplasmic RNA binding activity that was stimulated after treatment of cells with cAMP elevating agents such as forskolin or IBMX (10Peng H. Lever J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23996-24003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Stimulation was blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89 and was dependent on protein phosphorylation. We investigated the possibility that nuclear RNA-binding proteins may also bind the SGLT1 URE sequence. A 47-nt RNA probe (nucleotides 2597–2643), consisting of a uridine-rich domain within the 122-nt region, formed a single 50-kDa complex using either nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts (Fig.2 A).

https://openalex.org/W2095215358,"Mutations in the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor (TGFbetaRII) have been found in various malignant tumors, suggesting that loss of TGFbeta signaling plays a causal role in late-stage cancer development. To test whether loss of TGFbetaRII is involved in early-stage carcinogenesis, we have generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative TGFbetaRII (deltabetaRII) in the epidermis. These mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogenesis protocols at both early and late stages. In the current study, parameters for cell cycle progression and chromosome instability were analysed in deltabetaRII tumors. DeltabetaRII papillomas showed an increased S phase in flow cytometry. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and mitotic indices in deltabetaRII papillomas also showed a threefold increase compared to papillomas developing in non-transgenic mice. When papillomas further progressed to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), both control and deltabetaRII SCC showed similar BrdU labeling indices and percentages of S phase cells. However, deltabetaRII SCC cells showed a sixfold increase in the G2/M population. Mitotic indices in deltabetaRII SCC also showed a threefold increase compared to non-transgenic SCC. Consistent with a perturbed cell cycle, deltabetaRII papillomas and SCC showed reduced expression of the TGFbeta target genes p15 (INK4b), p21 (WAF-1) and p27 (Kip1), inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). However, most deltabetaRII papilloma cells exhibited normal centrosome numbers, and deltabetaRII SCC exhibited a similar extent of centrosome abnormalities compared to control SCC (35-40% cells). Most of deltabetaRII SCC exhibited diploid chromosome profiles. These data indicate that inactivation of TGFbetaRII accelerates skin tumorigenesis at early stages by the acceleration of loss of cell cycle control, but not by increased chromosome instability."
https://openalex.org/W1997779814,"A key difference among the three structurally similar pRB family members is that only pRB is a tumor suppressor. Identification of distinctive functional differences between pRB and p107/p130 therefore holds promise for a better understanding of the tumor suppression mechanisms of pRB. Enigmatically, pRB and p107 have been shown to have indistinguishable growth suppression activities when studied in the pRB-deficient Saos-2 cell system. In this study, we discovered that, when expressed at physiologically relevant levels, pRB and p107 had distinctive effects in causing growth suppression. pRB induced cellular p130 levels while p107 repressed them. p107, but not pRB, blocked cells inside S phase in addition to G1 arrest. In contrast, no qualitative differences were identified in their abilities to repress the expression of a set of suspected pRB/E2F repression target genes. These results indicate that pRB and p107 possess different growth suppression effects, despite the fact that they have similar E2F repression effects."
https://openalex.org/W2330512446,"Interleukin 3-dependent bone marrow and Ba/F3 cells present constitutive Fas expression. A dose dependent increase in Fas surface expression was induced in these cells by X-ray irradiation. Using primary cell cultures and established cell lines derived from p53-null mice (p53-/-), we demonstrated that the increase in Fas expression upon X-ray irradiation is dependent on the presence of at least one wild-type p53 allele. Fas induction by X-ray irradiation was negatively modulated by IL-3; an earlier Fas induction was observed in the absence of IL-3 or at low IL-3 concentrations. However, IL-3 withdrawal in non-irradiated cells did not induce an increase in Fas expression. X-ray irradiation of Ba/F3 cells induced the expression of functional Fas receptors. Therefore, in IL-3-dependent cells, IL-3 regulates the rate of Fas expression, which is correlated with the degree of apoptosis observed in X-irradiated cells. Finally, we demonstrate that IL-3 controls the degree of Fas expression induced by irradiation through a p53-mediated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2321845217,"The A-myb transcription factor shows a restricted tissue distribution and is cell cycle regulated. Furthermore its deregulation has profound effects on the growth and/or differentiation of the cells in which it is normally expressed. We have therefore characterized its promoter. A 12 kb genomic clone was isolated that comprises the first exon, part of the first intron as well as upstream regulatory sequences. Multiple transcription start sites have been identified which operate in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells and the upsteam region was shown to have promoter, activity. The boundaries of the minimal promoter region (-183-14), of a positive upstream (-538-183) and a negative downstream regulatory region (NRE) (+83+374) have been defined. The NRE is promoter- and orientation-independent but position specific. The A-myb minimal promoter is GC-rich, does not contain any TATA box but has a functional CCAAT box. The CCAAT box and minimal promoter is highly conserved in the corresponding murine sequence. The CCAAT box efficiently binds the NF-Y complex and its mutation decreases basal promoter activity by 50%. Two Sp1 binding sites are present upstream from the CCAAT box which can bind Spl and contribute to A-myb promoter activity by 70 and 30%, respectively. The two Sp1 sites and CCAAT box together contribute to over 80% of A-myb basal promoter activity and are therefore the major regulatory elements. Finally, we show that the promoter is cell cycle regulated and that the SP1 and CCAAT elements are required for S phase induction."
https://openalex.org/W2312260937,"The similarity of the catalytic domains of Raf and Src family members suggests that functions of homologous residues may be similar in both kinase families. A tryptophan residue, W260, in the WEI region of the Src family kinase Hck has an important role in regulating ATP binding. We tested the hypothesis that the tryptophan, W342, in the WEI region of c-Raf may have a similar role to the W260 of Hck. Mutation of W260 to A in Hck activates kinase activity, but we found that mutation of W342 to A in c-Raf inactivates the kinase activity. Mutating W342 to aspartate (D), lysine (K) or histidine (H) also inactivated c-Raf whether assayed as a purified immunoprecipitate or when recruited to the plasma membrane. A constitutively active c-Raf can be generated by mutating two regulatory tyrosines to aspartate. When placed into this active c-Raf mutant, mutation of W342 to D, K or H enabled phosphorylation and activation of the c-Raf substrate MEK at the plasma membrane but not in an immunoprecipitation assay. We conclude that (1) Tryptophan has a different role in the WEI regions of c-Raf and Hck, (2) W342 is not directly involved in MEK binding as both positive and negative residues at 342 are permissive for MEK activation at the membrane in a constitutively active c-Raf mutant, (3) Factors at the membrane are capable of potentiating activation of c-Raf containing mutated W342 in a hyperactivated c-Raf, but not in a wild type c-Raf and (4) There is a stringent structural requirement for W at residue 342 in c-Raf."
https://openalex.org/W2323910359,"The v-erbA oncoprotein (P75gag-v-erbA) can repress thyroid hormone receptor induced transcriptional activation of target genes. A central question is how hormone responsive elements in a target gene determine the transcriptional regulation mediated by P75gag-v-erbA. We addressed this with receptors chimeric between P75gag-v-erbA and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) by testing their regulatory activities on thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) differing in the sequence of the consensus core recognition motif AGGTCA. We report here that enhances, TR dependent transcriptional activation is conferred by P75gag-v-erbA when the thymidine in the half site recognition motif is exchanged for an adenosine. The enhancement was independent of the DNA binding region of P75gag-v-erbA, whereas increased expression of corepressor abolished the enhancing effect. The data indicate that the enhancement results from an impaired DNA binding by the oncoprotein combined with an effective scavenging of corepressors. Our data thus suggest the P75gag-v-erbA indirectly can contribute to enhancement of thyroid hormone induced gene expression."
