https://openalex.org/W1995013658,"A gene for somatostatin, a mammalian peptide (14 amino acid residues) hormone, was synthesized by chemical methods. This gene was fused to the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene on the plasmid pBR322. Transformation of E. coli with the chimeric plasmid DNA led to the synthesis of a polypeptide including the sequence of amino acids corresponding to somatostatin. In vitro, active somatostatin was specifically cleaved from the large chimeric protein by treatment with cyanogen bromide. This represents the first synthesis of a functional polypeptide product from a gene of chemically synthesized origin."

In addition, the subiculum sends subcortical efferents to the septum and diencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W1999529939,"Transmission electron microscopic techniques were used to study the spatial distribution of replicons and the ultrastructure of chromatin in the S phase genome of cellular blastoderm Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We observed chromatin exhibiting distinct bifurcations along each fiber during the initial 20 min of the first cell cycle of blastulation. We interpreted the “bubble-like” configurations produced by adjacent bifurcations as intermediate structures in chromatin replication (that is, replicons). We observed homologous ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fiber arrays on both chromatid arms within some replicons, implying DNA sequence homology and reinforcing the identification of such arms as daughter chromatid fibers. We did not observe replicon configurations on chromatin obtained from embryos staged at more than 20 min into cellular blastulation. Daughter chromatid fibers, however, were identified by the presence of identical RNP fiber arrays on chromatid strands arranged in parallel on the electron microscope grid. We examined the distribution of replicon structures on the cellular blastoderm genome and compared it with electron microscopic data on DNA replication in cleavage embryos ( Blumenthal et al., 1973 Blumenthal A.B. Kriegstein H.J. Hogness D.S. The units of DNA replication in Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes. in: Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol.38. 1973: 205-233 Google Scholar ). S phase is completed in slightly < 4 min during cleavage, or approximately one fifth the time required for DNA synthesis in cellular blastoderm embryos. The mean distance separating adjacent replication origins at cellularization was estimated to be 10.6 kilobases (kb), a value 35% greater than the 7.9 kb inter-origin average determined for cleavage embryos. In contrast to the near-simultaneous activation of replication origins during cleavage replication, we observed that replication origins are not activated synchronously at cellular blastulation. We concluded that the marked increase in the duration of S phase is effected by a reduction in the frequency of replication activation events which occur asynchronously during genome replication at cellularization. We found that the ultrastructure of newly replicated chromatin exhibited a morphology indistinguishable from nucleosomal chromatin. Unreplicated chromatin fibers separating adjacent replicons also exhibit spherical subunits. We inferred that the spherical structures on replicating chromatin are nucleosomes and concluded that histones are not disassociated from the DNA significantly prior to DNA replication, and that a very rapid reassociation of nucleosomes occurs on both daughter DNA molecules following replication."

This may reflect a disinhibition of brainstem pathways which steer the arm and hand straight to a visual target."

https://openalex.org/W1601779634,"GTP and hormones activate, synergistically, adenylate cyclase in purified plasma membranes from rat adipocytes. Addition of chelating reagents (EDTA or ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) or thiol-reducing reagents (dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol) results in marked inhibition of enzyme activity without altering the synergistic stimulatory effects of GTP and hormones. The inhibitory effects of the reagents required the presence of GTP, indicating that inhibition involves a GTP-dependent process. This process is separate from the GTP-dependent process responsible for activation of the enzyme since it is selectively abolished by pretreatment of fat cell membranes with trypsin. It is suggested that inhibition and activation of fat cell adenylate cyclase by GTP occur through distinct regulatory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2042552868,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, a hypothalamic tripeptide that stimulates the secretion of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone in mammalian species and is widely distributed throughout the brain of vertebrates, is present in the skin of the frog (Rana pipiens) in concentrations twice that found in the hypothalamus of this amphibian. A skin extract shows biologic activity appropriate to its immunoreactive content. Apart from the brain and spinal cord, immunoreactive thyrotropin-releasing hormone is found only in the blood and retina in significant concentrations. The results imply that frog skin is a huge endocrine organ that synthesizes and secretes this hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1553080809,"Palmityl-CoA inhibits free liver glycogen synthase; the concentration required for half-maximum inhibition is 3 to 4 micrometer. Almost complete inhibition was observed at 50 micrometer. Palmityl-CoA inhibition is associated with dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme into monomers, and binding of palmityl-CoA to the monomers. Glycogen-bound enzyme is also inhibited by palmityl-CoA, resulting in dissociation of the enzyme into monomers and concomitant release of the enzyme from the primer glycogen. Palmityl-CoA inhibition of the enzyme is partially reversed by the glycogen synthase activator, glucose-6-P, whereas sodium lauryl sulfate-inhibited enzyme is not reactivated by glucose-6-P. Sodium lauryl sulfate inhibition results in the dissociation of the tetramer into the monomers. Bovine serum albumin and cyclodextrin can prevent palmityl-CoA inhibition only when they are added prior to palmityl-CoA addition. The possible physiological role of palmityl-CoA in glucose homeostasis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1602281090,"The principal initial product of metabolism of 13N-labeled ammonium by Anabaena cylindrica grown with either NH4+ or N2 as nitrogen source is amide-labeled glutamine. The specific activity of glutamine synthetase is approximately half as great in NH4+-grown as in N2-grown filaments. After 1.5 min of exposure to 13NH4+, the ratio of 13N in glutamate to 13N in glutamine reaches a value of approximately 0.1 for N2- and 0.15 for NH4+-grown filaments, whereas after the same period of exposure to [13N]N2, that ratio has reached a value close to unity and is rising rapidly. During pulse-chase experiments, 13N is transferred from the amide group to glutamine into glutamate, and then apparently into the alpha-amino group of glutamine. Methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, inhibits the formation of glutamine. In the presence of the inhibitor, direct formation of glutamate takes place, but accounts for only a few per cent of the normal rate of formation of that amino acid; and alanine is formed about as rapidly as glutamate. Azaserine reduces formation of [13N]glutamate approximately 100-fold, with relatively little effect on the formation of [13N]glutamine. Aminooxyacetate, an inhibitor of transaminase reactions blocks transfer of 13N to aspartate, citrulline, and arginine. We conclude, on the basis of these results and others in the literature, that the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway mediates most of the initial metabolism of ammonium in A. cylindrica, and that glutamic acid dehydrogenase and alanine dehydrogenase have only a very minor role."

https://openalex.org/W1915505471,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1; purine nucleoside:orthophosphate ribosyltransferase) from fresh human erythrocytes has been purified to homogeneity in two steps with an overall yield of 56%. The purification involves DEAE-Sephadex chromatography followed by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose/formycin B. This scheme is suitable for purification of the phosphorylase from as little as 0.1 ml of packed erythrocytes. The native enzyme appears to be a trimer with native molecular weight of 93,800 and the subunit molecular weight of 29,700 +/- 1,100. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme under denaturing conditions revealed four major separable subunits (numbered 1 to 4) with the same molecular weight. The apparent isoelectric points of subunits 1 to 4 in 9.5 M urea are 6.63, 6.41, 6.29, and 6.20, respectively. The different subunits are likely the result of post-translational modification of the enzyme and provide an explanation of the complex native isoelectric focusing pattern of purine nucleoside phosphorylase from erythrocytes. Three of the four subunits are detectable in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels of crude hemolysates. Knowing the location of the subunits of purine nucleoside phosphorylase in a two-dimensional electropherogram allows one to characterize the purine nucleoside phosphorylase in crude cell extracts from individuals with variant or mutant purine nucleoside phosphorylase as demonstrated in a subsequent communication. Partial purification of the phosphorylase from 1 ml of erythrocytes on DEAE-Sephadex increases the sensitivity of detection of the subunits to the 0.3% level."
https://openalex.org/W2079706056,"Transcription at two heat shock loci in Drosophila melanogaster, in subdivisions 87A and 57C, was investigated by hybridization in situ with 3H-labeled messenger, nuclear RNA and whole cell RNA from cells cultured at elevated temperature. What appears to be the same 9 x 10(5) dalton heat shock message hybridizes at both sites. At 87a, little additional hybridization is obtained with nuclear or whole cell RNA. In contrast, at 87C the saturation level of hybridization by nuclear and whole cell RNA is much higher than that obtained with the message alone. This evidence for extensive hybridization at 87C but not at 87A by RNA distinct from the message is confirmed by the finding that excess nonradioactive message competes away most of the hybridization by 3H-labeled nuclear and whole cell RNA at the latter locus but not at the former. The noncompetable RNA migrates on an electrophoretic gel as a heterogeneous population of molecules, extending to sizes both larger and smaller than the message. These and other observations lead to the conclusion that a 87A transcription includes little more than sequences complementary to the 9 x 10(5) dalton message, while at 87C, there are sequences complementary to the same message and extensive additional sequences complementary to other species of RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2028648233,"By means of flow microfluorometry, the protein and nucleic acid contents of individual bacterial cells may be measured at the rate of several thousand cells per second. Accumulation of such information over a few minutes yields the composition distribution of the microbial population. These distributions have been determined at different times during batch growth of Bactillus subtilis, and the results indicate that the variance of cell composition decreases as the population passes through the exponential into the stationary phase. The relative abundance of endospores and vegetative cells as well as the protein distributions of these subpopulations may be readily determined from flow microfluorometry data. Experimental access to such details of microbial population dynamics should foster improved understanding of cell growth, spore germination, and spore formation kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1511205796,"A procedure has been developed to separate the subunits of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase rapidly and in good yield. The method involved the use of a blue dextran-Sepharose column which bound the beta' subunit. A phosphocellulose column was used to separate the alpha and beta subunits. During purification, the enzyme eluted from the DNA-cellulose column in three separate forms in the order alpha2betabeta'deltaomega1,alpha2betabeta'omega1, and alpha2betabeta'omega1sigma. Subunit reconstitution studies with RNA polymerase subunits from wild type and a rifampicin-resistant mutant indicated that the largest polypeptide was responsible for rifampicin resistance. Thus, this subunit is referred to as beta. The mobility of the subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cannot be used as the sole criterion for designating the functions of the subunits of RNA polymerase."

Results obtained with the dithionite-reduced derivatized product upon combined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy are consistent with structures of the stereoisomers of 9,11,15-trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid. A portion of the material formed by reduction of the enzyme product with dithionite reacts positively in a radioimmunoassay against rabbit anti-prostaglandin F2alpha antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2107177579,"We have studied the structure and replication of mitochondrial DNA from Drosophila melanogaster embryos, larvae, adult flies and two established tissue culture lines. The most striking observation is that the organism maintains at least two stable, distinct closed circular forms of mitochondrial DNA throughout development of the early embryo and in the adult fly. The major closed circular monomeric form comprises approximately 75% of the population and has a normal number of superhelical turns. In contrast, closed circular mitochondrial DNA isolated from Drosophila tissue culture cells is comprised almost entirely of molecules with the low superhelix density. We have been unable to detect the D loop form of mitochondrial DNA present in other eucaryotic systems, and find by electron microscope and pulse-chase labeling techniques that the time required to replicate Drosophila mitochondrial DNA is very short (less than 15 min) compared to the mouse L cell system (greater than 1 hr). We conclude that Drosophila mitochondrial DNA utilizes a replication mechanism different from that of other higher eucaryotes. We postulate that the maintenance of markedly different topological forms of mitochondrial DNA is most probably related to different demands for replication and transcription of the genome in these sources."
https://openalex.org/W1551162909,"Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, purifed to better than 98% purity from derepressed Bacillus subtilis, exists as a tetramer and as a dimer of apparently identical subunits with a molecular weight of 50,000 each. The enzyme contains 3 atoms of iron and 2 atoms of inorganic sulfide per subunit and has a yellow-brown color. The absorption spectrum is not altered by dithionite, but exposure to oxygen causes inactivation and partial bleaching of the visible spectrum. Thus, the Bacillus amidotransferase exhibits novel structural features and a new reaction type of proteins of the iron-sulfur group."
https://openalex.org/W2076576830,"Deficiencies that delete two heat-induced puffs in Drosophila melanogaster have been isolated. Two deficiencies delete the puff arising from 87C1, and one deletes the two puffs at 87A and 87C1. Homozygotes for these deletions can be recognized by their abnormal, transparent malpighian tubules. The influence on heat-induced protein synthesis of deleting one or both of these puffs has been examined. Unexpectedly, deleting only the 87C1 puff has no apparent effect. Deleting both the 87A and 87C1 puffs eliminates synthesis of a 71,000 dalton protein. We map a coding locus for the 71,000 dalton heat-induced protein to 87A7-B3, a seven band region which also contains a heat-induced puff. The roles of the 87A and 87C1 puffs in coding for heat-induced proteins are discussed in the light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2018378086,"Cloned MPC 11 mouse plasmacytoma cells synthesize a complete kappa light chain and also a kappa light chain constant region fragment. Partial amino terminal sequences of the in vitro forms of these two proteins have been determined. Both in vitro products contain typical light chain leaders; leaders are defined as the amino terminal sequences present on in vitro products but absent from the in vivo products found in living cells. The in vitro form of the MPC 11 complete light chain contains a leader sequence plus variable and constant region sequences. The in vitro form of the MPC 11 light chain constant region fragment contains a different leader sequence attached directly to a complete constant ragion sequence and has no variable region sequences. Thus the MPC 11 light chain fragment is not a degradation product of the MPC 11 complete light chain (or of any other complete light chain) and must be coded by a separate gene. The results reveal two unusual features of MPC 11 cells: first, expression of a unique variant light chain gene coding the light chain constant region fragment, and second, expression of two different kappa light chain genes (coding the complete light chain and the variant constant region fragment) in a single cell. In addition, evidence is provided that the in vitro forms of kappa light chains, three of which are presented here for the first time, include a minimum of three partially homologous but quite different leader sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2058986562,"The amounts of sepiapterin and red pteridine eye pigments (drosopterins) in Drosophila melanogaster are known to be reduced in the purple mutant and restored to normal by a suppressor mutation. We show here that sepiapterin synthase activity is 30 percent of normal in pr and prbw, two naturally occurring alleles of purple, and is restored to nearly normal levels by the suppressor su(s)2. A heterozygote of two newly induced alleles of pr has even lower enzyme activity (less than 10 percent). The sepiapterin synthase activity is proportional to the number of wild-type pr alleles in flies when one and two copies of the allele are present and is higher in three-than in two-dose flies. We hypothesize that the purple locus may be a structural gene for sepiapterin synthase in Drosophila."

The probability of acquiring a vector-borne disease, and the severity of that disease increases with the number of fly bites an animal receives2–4. Bait animals placed in groups are known to attract fewer individual mosquitoes per bait individual than are bait animals placed singly3,5. Mean group size of the mangabey, Cercocebus albigena is about 13 in Kibale Forest, Uganda, and the mean group size of Colobus badius and Cercopithecus ascanius are 50 and 35 respectively6. Associations of groups of these species are likely to reduce significantly the number of dipteran bites individual monkeys receive1,7. Other explanations proposed for primate polyspecific associations include increased food location abilities, and increased predator detection and avoidance8,9. I report here the correlation of the temporal occurrence of C. albigena polyspecific associations with the activity of biting and sucking flies, C. albigena feeding and other activities, and the temporal occurrence of attacks by the crowned eagle-hawk (Stephanoaetus coronatus) (eagles are the only known predator of these monkeys).

https://openalex.org/W1608142637,"Preliminary evidence suggested that phosphate or borote destabilize iron-ovotransferrin-nitrilotriacetate complexes in the absence of added bicarbonate. The iron-ovotransferrin-EDTA complex was prepared in the absence of bicarbonate, and a number of anions, including phosphate, sulfate, and citrate, were found to perturb the visible absorbance (lambdamax = 490 nm) of this complex. Other anions, such as chloride, nitrate, and perchlorate, had little or no effect on the spectrum. Also, when bicarbonate was added to a solution of the iron-transferrin-EDTA complex (A515 = 0.45), within 2 min, the visible absorbance had decreased to A515 = 0.13. Slowly a new peak appeared (lambdamax = 470 nm), evidently the iron-transferrin-CO3 complex. When these spectral changes were monitored in detail, the lack of an isosbestic point indicated the existence of one or more intermediates in the conversion of iron-transferrin-EDTA complex to the iron-transferrin-CO3 complex. Experiments using ternary complexes containing either 59Fe or [14C]EDTA show that both iron and EDTA nearly completely dissociate from the protein (most likely concomitantly within 2 min after bicarbonate is added. These observations are best explained by a paradigm which includes anion binding to the apoprotein. It is clear that there is an intimate relationship between anions and the binding of iron chelates by transferrin."
https://openalex.org/W12232001,"The hydroxylaminolysis of the penicilloyl moiety from [14C]penicillin G binding component (PBC) complexes of the Bacillus subtilis D-alanine carboxypeptidase and of the mixture of PBC's of Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by denaturation of the complexes by heat (55 degrees), detergent (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate), or trichloroacetic acid. The kinetics of inhibition by denaturation were comparable to those of the inhibition of [14C]penicillin G binding to the PBC's and of carboxypeptidase activity of the B. subtilis enzyme under identical denaturing conditions. These data establish that the hydroxylaminolysis is an enzymatically catalyzed process suggesting that penicillin G is bound to an enzymatically active site. Treatment of the denatured [14C]penicillin G-carboxypeptidase complex with sodium borohydride or at pH 12 resulted in the release of the penicilloyl moiety. These results are consistent with a carboxylic ester bond for the penicilloyl-PBC instead of a thiolester linkage as was initially presumed."
https://openalex.org/W172782915,Nonpolar substrates of microsomal UDP-glucuronyl-transferase partition between the hydrophobic phase of the microsomal membrane and the bulk aqueous phase in a suspension of microsomes in water. Partitioning of estrone into the membranes was measured in the studies presented and was extensive. Comparison of the rate of conjugation of estrone and the rate of its release from microsomes into the bulk aqueous phase showed that the pool of estrone within the membrane is the substate for UDP-glucuronyl-transferase. The rate of conjugation of estrone was 6-fold greater than the rate of release of estrone from the membrane into the aqueous phase. Several additional experiments showed that the rate of glucuronidation of estrone did not depend on the amount of estrone in the bulk aqueous phase. It is concluded that the microsomal membrane serves to concentrate nonpolar substrates of UDP-glucuronly-transferase. The phospholipid region of the microsomal membrane also may be a co-factor of UDP-glucuronyltransferase in the sense that binding of estrone to the membrane restricts its orientation in a manner that facilitates catalysis.
https://openalex.org/W1491174311,"The nucleotide sequence of a phage T4-coded low molecular weight RNA, previously designated polyacrylamide gel band epsilon, has been determined. This RNA can be arranged in the cloverleaf configuration common to tRNAs, with an anticodon sequence, U-C-U, which corresponds to the arginine-specific codons A-G-A and A-G-G; it is therefore assumed to be an arginine tRNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of this RNA species is: pG-U-C-C-C-G-C-U-G-G-U-G-U-A-A-U-Gm2'-G-A-D-A-G-C-A-U-A-C-G-A-U-C-C-U-U-C-U-A-A-G-psi-U-U-G-C-G-G-U-C-C-U-G-G-T-psi-C-G-A-U-C-C-C-A-G-G-G-C-G-G-G-A-U-A-C-C-AOH. The nucleotide sequence was determined by analysis of RNA, uniformly labeled in vivo, according to the conventional techniques. In addition, RNA synthesized in vitro in the presence of alpha-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates was analyzed through the use of nearest neighbor sequencing techniques. Although a unique sequence could not be determined by this latter analysis, restrictions on the sequence imposed by nearest neighbor data and secondary structure common to tRNA molecules allowed prediction of the correct nucleotide sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1481997981,"Abstract We have shown that bacteriophage T5-induced DNA polymerase replicates short primer-templates (400 to 600 nucleotides long) at a rapid rate initially, followed by a slower rate sustained for much longer periods (Das, S. K., and Fujimura, R. K. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8700-8707). In order to explain the slower steady rate and the results of polymer-challenge experiments, we conjectured the presence of a formed by the enzyme with the primer-template at the end of the primer elongation process. In this communication we present evidence which indicates that the presumed complex shows a first order kinetics of decay with a half-life of 3.5 min at 37 degrees. Energies of activation for the steady phase of synthesis and the decay of the dead-end complex were both found to be about 23 kcal/mol. This indicates that the dissociation of the aforesaid complex might be the rate-limiting step during the steady phase of synthesis. Correlation between the salt-induced reduction in the half-life of the complex and the increase in the steady rate of synthesis is in agreement with the above mentioned possibility."
