https://openalex.org/W3013642847,"Fruits of the sea The origins of marine resource consumption by humans have been much debated. Zilhão et al. present evidence that, in Atlantic Iberia's coastal settings, Middle Paleolithic Neanderthals exploited marine resources at a scale on par with the modern human–associated Middle Stone Age of southern Africa (see the Perspective by Will). Excavations at the Figueira Brava site on Portugal's Atlantic coast reveal shell middens rich in the remains of mollusks, crabs, and fish, as well as terrestrial food items. Familiarity with the sea and its resources may thus have been widespread for residents there in the Middle Paleolithic. The Figueira Brava Neanderthals also exploited stone pine nuts in a way akin to that previously identified in the Holocene of Iberia. These findings add broader dimensions to our understanding of the role of aquatic resources in the subsistence of Paleolithic humans. Science , this issue p. eaaz7943 ; see also p. 1422"

Conflicting data has been examined regarding the association between AIs administration and the clinical psychological features in BC survivors (BCSs).As psychological symptoms often occur in such chronic diseases, our study aimed at exploring anxious and depressive symptoms and the perceived quality of life (QoL) in BCSs assessed for osteoporosis.The total sample consisted of a clinical sample of 51 outpatient postmenopausal women, diagnosed with BC, and a control group composed of 51 healthy postmenopausal women. All recruited participants were evaluated through the clinical gold standard interview and completed the following self-rating scales: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory II edition, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, which were administered at baseline and after 6 months in BCSs in AIs treatment, compared with controls. Moreover, all participants were assessed for vitamin D status, bone mineral density (BMD) and subclinical vertebral fractures. Data regarding age, age at menopause, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits and alcohol consumption was collected.BCSs (n = 51) showed higher anxious and depressive symptoms, and lower perceived QoL vs. controls (n = 51) (p<0.05 for all). After 6 months of treatment with AIs, BCSs showed significant reduction of anxious and depressive symptoms and a significantly higher perceived QoL for both physical and mental components, vs. controls.The improvement of clinical psychological features and perceived QoL was associated with AIs treatment in women being treated with, for early breast cancer. Further studies are needed to obtain a deeper comprehension of the correlation between clinical psychological and physical features in BCSs."

Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is an infectious pathogen that causes severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised adults for which no effective treatment or vaccine is currently available. In this study, variations in metabolite levels at different time points post-HRSV infection of epithelial cells were studied by untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of methanol cell extracts. Numerous metabolites were significantly upregulated after 18 hours post-infection, including nucleotides, amino acids, amino and nucleotide sugars, and metabolites of the central carbon pathway. In contrast, most lipid classes were downregulated. Additionally, increased levels of oxidized glutathione and polyamines were associated with oxidative stress in infected cells. These results show how HRSV infection influences cell metabolism to produce the energy and building blocks necessary for virus reproduction, suggesting potential therapeutic interventions against this virus."

The small molecule inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 pathways have been an encouraging drug development strategy because of good affinity and oral bioavailability without immunogenicity and immunotoxicities of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. In this study, we studied the effects of PCC0208025 (BMS202), a small molecule inhibitor of PD-L1, on PD-1/PD-L1 binding and the cytokines secretion in human CD3 + cells in vitro . We also investigated the antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of PCC0208025 and the pharmacokinetics properties in B16-F10 melanoma-bearing mice. The results showed that PCC0208025 inhibited the PD-1/PD-L1 proteins binding, and rescued PD-L1-mediated inhibition of IFN-γ production in human CD3 + T cells in vitro . Furthermore, in B16-F10 melanoma-bearing mice, PCC0208025 presented the antitumor effects, enhanced IFN-γ levels in plasma, increased the frequency of CD3 + CD8 + T and CD8 + IFN-γ + T and the ratios of CD8 + /Treg, and deceased the CD4 + CD25 + CD127 low/− (Treg) number in tumor. Pharmacokinetics study found that PCC0208025 was absorbed and distributed into the tumors with much higher concentrations than those of the blockade against PD-1/PD-L1 binding. Our work suggests that PCC0208025 exhibited anti-tumor effects through inhibiting Treg expansion and increasing cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells by the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 binding, which may provide the pharmacological basis to develop small molecule inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 binding for PCC0208025 as a lead compound."
https://openalex.org/W3013068630,"Food and feeds contaminated with mycotoxins have been a threat to the rearing industry by causing some of the most fatal toxic reactions not only in the farm animals but also in humans who consume them. Toxicity to juvenile goats was induced by feed contamination with T-2 toxin (at 10 and 20 ppm dosage; group I and II, respectively). The toxicity impact was assessed on days 15 and 30 post treatment with respect to growth performance, oxidative stress, apoptotic studies and detailed pathomorphology. The study revealed that apart from the obvious clinical toxicosis (weakness, lethargy, and retardation in growth), the toxin fed groups also exhibited significant haematological (reduced hemoglobin, total leukocyte and thrombocyte counts) and biochemical changes (increased levels of oxidative stress markers with concomitant decrease in levels of serum and tissue catalase and superoxide dismutase). The pathomorphological and histological alterations suggested that the liver and intestine were the most affected organs. Ultra-structurally, varying degrees of degeneration, cytoplasmic vacuolations and pleomorphic mitochondria were observed in the hepatocytes and the enterocytes of the intestine. Kidney also revealed extensive degeneration of the cytoplasmic organelles with similar condensation of the heterochromatin whereas the neuronal degeneration was characterized by circular, whirling structures. In addition, the central vein and portal triad of the hepatocytes, cryptic epithelial cells of the intestine, MLNs in the lymphoid follicles, PCT and DCT of the nephronal tissues and the white pulp of the spleen exhibited extensive apoptosis. In this study, it was also observed that the expression of HSPs, pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly upregulated in response to the toxin treatment. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of T-2 toxicosis in goats employs oxidative, apoptotic and inflammatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3013964994,"Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from either loss of insulin producing cells, insufficient insulin action, or both. Knowledge can play an important role in preventing diabetes mellitus and its complications. There is limited information regarding knowledge and related factors regarding diabetes mellitus among non-diabetic adult community members in the study area. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine knowledge and associated factors towards diabetes mellitus among non-diabetes community members of Gondar city. Methods Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on non-diabetic community members from July 1–29, 2019 in Gondar city. The participants were selected randomly from each households. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. EpiData version 3.1 was used for data entry and SPSS version 20 was used for data processing and analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated for most variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors. A variable was considered significantly associated at p-value<0.05. Result A total of 633 study subjects participated in this study with a mean age of 36.12 (± 12.87) years. Of these study participants, 572 had awareness about diabetes mellitus and 51.4% (95% CI: 47.4%, 55.8%) had good knowledge. Being male [Adjusted odds ratio = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.48)], monthly income of 3000–5000 birr [Adjusted odds ratio = 1.88 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.41)], monthly income of ≥5001 birr [Adjusted odds ratio = 2.37 (95% CI: 1.17, 4.78)], previous training on diabetes mellitus [Adjusted odds ratio = 4.37 (95% CI; 3.04, 7.37)], being grade 9–12 [Adjusted odds ratio = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.09, 8.66)], having college and above educational qualification [Adjusted odds ratio = 3.70 (95% CI: 1.26, 10.85)] were significantly associated with good knowledge towards diabetes mellitus. Conclusion The level of knowledge regarding diabetes mellitus was low among study participants which indicates a need for health education intervention. Previous training on diabetes mellitus, educational status and average monthly income and being male were the factors associated with good knowledge of participants about diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W3013088443,"Wheat grain yield is usually decomposed in the yield components: number of spikes / m2, number of grains / spike, number of grains / m2 and thousand kernel weight (TKW). These are correlated one with another due to yield component compensation. Under optimal conditions, the number of grains per m2 has been identified as the main determinant of yield. However, with increasing occurrences of post-flowering abiotic stress associated with climate change, TKW may become severely limiting and hence a target for breeding. TKW is usually studied at the plot scale as it represents the average mass of a grain. However, this view disregards the large intra-genotypic variance of individual grain mass and its effect on TKW. The aim of this study is to investigate the determinism of the variance of individual grain size. We measured yield components and individual grain size variances of two large genetic wheat panels grown in two environments. We also carried out a genome-wide association study using a dense SNPs array. We show that the variance of individual grain size partly originates from the pre-flowering components of grain yield; in particular it is driven by canopy structure via its negative correlation with the number of spikes per m2. But the variance of final grain size also has a specific genetic basis. The genome-wide analysis revealed the existence of QTL with strong effects on the variance of individual grain size, independently from the other yield components. Finally, our results reveal some interesting drivers for manipulating individual grain size variance either through canopy structure or through specific chromosomal regions."
https://openalex.org/W3013760047,"Preterm delivery is both a traumatizing experience for the patient and a burden on the healthcare system. A condition distinguishable by its phenotype in prematurity is cervical insufficiency, where certain cases exhibit a strong genetic component. Despite genomic advancements, little is known about the genetics of human cervix remodeling during pregnancy. Using selected gene approaches, a few studies have demonstrated an association of common gene variants with cervical insufficiency. However, until now, no study has employed comprehensive methods to investigate this important subject matter. In this study, we asked: i) are there genes reliably linked to cervical insufficiency and, if so, what are their roles? and ii) what is the proportion of cases of non-syndromic cervical insufficiency attributable to these genetic variations? We performed next-generation sequencing on 21 patients with a clinical presentation of cervical insufficiency. To assist the sequencing data interpretation, we retrieved all known genes implicated in cervical functioning through a systematic literature analysis and additional gene searches. These genes were then classified according to their relation to the questions being posed by the study. Patients’ sequence variants were filtered for pathogenicity and assigned a likelihood of being contributive to phenotype development. Gene extraction and analysis revealed 12 genes primarily linked to cervical insufficiency, the majority of which are known to cause collagenopathies. Ten patients carried disruptive variants potentially contributive to the development of non-syndromic cervical insufficiency. Pathway enrichment analysis of variant genes from our cohort revealed an increased variation burden in genes playing roles in tissue mechanical and biomechanical properties, i.e. collagen biosynthesis and cell-extracellular matrix communications. Consequently, the proposed idea of cervical insufficiency being a subtle form of collagenopathy, now strengthened by our genetic findings, might open up new opportunities for improved patient evaluation and management."

The cells of these species are surrounded by protective cell walls rich in long-chain mycolic acids. These fatty acids are conjugated to the disaccharide trehalose on the cytoplasmic side of the bacterial cell membrane. They are then transported across the membrane to the periplasm where they act as donors for other reactions. We have previously shown that transient acetylation of the glycolipid trehalose monohydroxycorynomycolate (hTMCM) enables its efficient transport to the periplasm in Corynebacterium glutamicum and that acetylation is mediated by the membrane protein TmaT. Here, we show that a putative methyltransferase, encoded at the same genetic locus as TmaT, is also required for optimal hTMCM transport. Deletion of the C. glutamicum gene NCgl2764 (Rv0224c in M. tuberculosis) abolished acetyltrehalose monocorynomycolate (AcTMCM) synthesis, leading to accumulation of hTMCM in the inner membrane and delaying its conversion to trehalose dihydroxycorynomycolate (h2TDCM). Complementation with NCgl2764 normalized turnover of hTMCM to h2TDCM. In contrast, complementation with NCgl2764 derivatives mutated at residues essential for methyltransferase activity failed to rectify the defect, suggesting that NCgl2764/Rv0224c encodes a methyltransferase, designated here as MtrP. Comprehensive analyses of the individual mtrP and tmaT mutants and of a double mutant revealed strikingly similar changes across several lipid classes compared with WT bacteria. These findings indicate that both MtrP and TmaT have nonredundant roles in regulating AcTMCM synthesis, revealing additional complexity in the regulation of trehalose mycolate transport in the Corynebacterineae.

Recently, we identified a new trehalose monocorynomycolate (TMCM) glycolipid species in C. glutamicum, which contains an acetyl group on the corynomycolate chain. This species, termed acetyl-trehalose monocorynomycolate (AcTMCM), required expression of the putative acetyltransferase, TmaT (NCgl2759) (Fig. 1). Genetic deletion of tmaT significantly reduced the rate of corynomycolate transport across the inner membrane and subsequent conversion to h2TDCM, indicating that AcTMCM is the major substrate transported by C. glutamicum CmpL1/4 (NCgl0228/NCgl2769) (Fig. 1) (28Yamaryo-Botte Y.

Specifically, we show that disruption of a putative methyltransferase gene, NCgl2764, which is located in the tmaT locus, also leads to the accumulation of hTMCM on the cytoplasmic site of the inner membrane and defects in the synthesis of h2TDCM.

The mutant also accumulated trehalose monoketocorynomycolates (ketoTMCM), had supressed synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and alanylated diacylglycerols (Ala-DAG), and lacked a class of acyl-PG–like lipids, mirroring the general lipid phenotype of a tmaT mutant. Mutation analysis provided further support for NCgl2764 having methyltransferase activity, revealing unexpected complexity in the regulation of corynomycolate transport across the inner membrane of these bacteria. We have previously identified a genetic locus in C. glutamicum that harbors a number of genes involved in regulating cell wall synthesis. This locus is conserved in all Corynebacterineae (15Lea-Smith D.J. Pyke J.S. Tull D. McConville M.J. Coppel R.L. Crellin P.K.

NCgl2764 is functionally uncharacterized but is predicted to encode a protein of 257 residues, sharing 49% identity and 86% similarity with M. tuberculosis Rv0224c (Fig. S1). NCgl2764/Rv0224c is annotated as a cytoplasmic methyltransferase based on weak similarity with a range of methyltransferases and the presence of conserved residues essential for activity (see below). To investigate the function of this gene/protein, a two-step recombination strategy was used to create the NCgl2764 mutant (Fig. 3). Sequences flanking the gene were PCR-amplified and cloned into the suicide vector pK18mobsacB (32McKean S. Davies J. Moore R. Identification of macrophage induced genes of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis by differential fluorescence induction.Microbes Infect. 2005; 7 (16046166): 1352-136310.1016/j.micinf.2005.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which carries a kanamycin resistance gene (aph) and Bacillus subtilis sacB gene conferring sensitivity to sucrose. This plasmid was introduced into C. glutamicum 13032, and a NCgl2764 deletion mutant, designated ΔNCgl2764, was isolated, and gene deletion was confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). The ΔNCgl2764 mutant formed small colonies relative to the wildtype (WT) parent on agar plates and displayed an extended lag-phase in liquid BHI medium, although it ultimately achieved a final cell density comparable with the WT parent strain (Fig. 3C). A similar growth phenotype was observed following loss of tmaT (i.e. ΔNCgl2759) but not other genes (i.e. ΔNCgl2760) in this locus (28Yamaryo-Botte Y. Rainczuk A.K. Lea-Smith D.J.

Complementation and control strains were created to determine whether the growth defect was due solely to disruption of NCgl2764. To complement the mutant, ΔNCgl2764 was transformed with pSM22:NCgl2764, a plasmid carrying a full-length NCgl2764 gene plus 203 bp of upstream sequence. The empty pSM22 vector (32McKean S. Davies J. Moore R. Identification of macrophage induced genes of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis by differential fluorescence induction.Microbes Infect. 2005; 7 (16046166): 1352-136310.1016/j.micinf.2005.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was also introduced into ΔNCgl2764 as a control. Growth curves indicated that introduction of pSM22:NCgl2764 into the ΔNCgl2764 mutant restored normal lag phase and growth, whereas the empty pSM22 vector did not (Fig. 3C). Corynebacterial mutants with defects in cell wall synthesis and integrity characteristically display increased sensitivity to antibiotics. To test the condition and permeability of the cell wall in the ΔNCgl2764 mutant, the strains were cultured on agar media and exposed to paper discs impregnated with a variety of antibiotics. The sensitivity of the strains was assessed by the size of zones of inhibition (ZOI) around the discs. For low-molecular-weight antibiotics (<500 g/mol), the ΔNCgl2764 mutant displayed significantly larger ZOIs than the WT parent (p < 0.05) and complemented strains (Fig. 4). The increases in zone diameter were particularly apparent for the β-lactam class antibiotics amoxicillin, cefoxitin, and imipenem, suggesting increased access of the drugs to the peptidoglycan layer. Increased sensitivity to drugs targeting cytoplasmic processes (RNA and protein synthesis) was also observed. Clustering of the NCgl2764 gene with cell wall biosynthesis genes, together with the altered growth rate and increased antibiotic sensitivity in the ΔNCgl2764 strain, suggested a role for the encoded protein in cell wall biosynthesis. HPTLC analysis of lipid extracts of WT and ΔNCgl2764 bacteria revealed major differences in the abundance of several different cell wall lipid classes (Fig. 5A). In particular, the ΔNCgl2764 mutant accumulated a lipid species during logarithmic growth (15Lea-Smith D.J. Pyke J.S. Tull D. McConville M.J. Coppel R.L. Crellin P.K.

The accumulation of hTMCM in ΔNCgl2764 was associated with a concomitant decrease in levels of h2TDCM, relative to WT (Fig. 5A). Levels of both species were restored following complementation of the mutant with pSM22:NCgl2764, but not with empty pSM22. These data suggest that NCgl2764 is required for efficient conversion of hTMCM to h2TDCM. To determine whether the M. tuberculosis ortholog, Rv0224c, could functionally complement the mutant, we constructed a pSM22:Rv0224c plasmid and introduced it into the ΔNCgl2764 mutant. hTMCM and h2TDCM levels in the Rv0224c complemented line were unchanged compared with the original mutant (Fig. S3), suggesting that Rv0224c is unable to substitute for NCgl2764. Although the two proteins share significant sequence similarity, including two glycine residues essential for methyltransferase function (see below and Fig. S1), the Rv0224c homolog may lack sequence motifs required for protein–protein interactions essential for activity in C. glutamicum. To measure rates of glycolipid turnover in WT and mutant lines, bacteria were pulse-labeled with [14C]acetate, then suspended in BHI medium (chase), and sampled at various time points. Cell wall lipids were then separated by HPTLC, and labeled species were detected by autoradiography (Fig. 5B). Label was rapidly incorporated into hTMCM and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) species during the pulse and subsequently into h2TDCM in the 5-min chase in WT cells. In contrast, the label was not incorporated into h2TDCM in the ΔNCgl2764 strain throughout the 60-min chase period, demonstrating a significant delay in its synthesis. Interestingly, in contrast to the orcinol-stained samples (Fig. 5A), no accumulation of [14C]hTMCM was observed in the ΔNCgl2764 mutant, implying that the high steady-state levels of hTMCM (Fig. 5A) reflect reduced rate of turnover of hTMCM rather than excess production of this glycolipid. Interestingly, incorporation of 14C-label into PG lipids was also reduced in the ΔNCgl2764 mutant, similar to the phenotype of the tmaT mutant (29Klatt S. Brammananth R. O'Callaghan S.

Here, we developed an enzyme assay to measure the kinetic parameters of the PGK1-catalyzed forward reaction. The Km values for 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (1,3-BPG, the forward reaction substrate) were 4.36 μm (yeast PGK1) and 6.86 μm (human PKG1). The Km values for 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG, the reverse reaction substrate and a serine precursor) were 146 μm (yeast PGK1) and 186 μm (human PGK1). The Vmax of the forward reaction was about 3.5- and 5.8-fold higher than that of the reverse reaction for the human and yeast enzymes, respectively. Consistently, the intracellular steady-state concentrations of 3-PG were between 180 and 550 μm in cancer cells, providing a basis for glycolysis to shuttle 3-PG to the serine synthesis pathway. Using siRNA-mediated PGK1-specific knockdown in five cancer cell lines derived from different tissues, along with titration of PGK1 in a cell-free glycolysis system, we found that the perturbation of PGK1 had no effect or only marginal effects on the glucose consumption and lactate generation. The PGK1 knockdown increased the concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and 1,3-BPG in nearly equal proportions, controlled by the kinetic and thermodynamic states of glycolysis.

PGK1 catalyzes a step at the middle of glycolysis and produces ATP and 3-PG (a precursor for serine). Given the high glycolytic rate, PGK1 activity accounts for a large part in maintaining the energy homeostasis and serine biosynthesis.

The mixed reports indicated a vague understanding of the mechanism by which PGK1 regulates glycolysis. As the rate control of glycolysis is fundamentally a question of kinetics and thermodynamics of glycolysis, we sought to investigate the effect of perturbing PGK1 on glycolysis with respect to thermodynamics and related kinetics. To investigate the above-mentioned questions, we sought to know the kinetics of PGK1. PGK1 catalyzes a reversible reaction, and its reverse-reaction kinetics is known, but its forward reaction kinetics is unknown because there are no available methods for research. Some studies reported that the forward reaction activity of PGK1 could be measured by the production of NADH, with a reaction mixture containing GA3P, β-NAD, and ADP (13Hu H. Zhu W. Qin J. Chen M. Gong L. Li L. Liu X. Tao Y. Yin H. Zhou H. Zhou L. Ye D. Ye Q. Gao D.

Li L. Liu X. Tao Y. Yin H. Zhou H. Zhou L. Ye D. Ye Q. Gao D. Acetylation of PGK1 promotes liver cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.Hepatology. 2017; 65 (27774669): 515-52810.1002/hep.28887Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Chen X. Zhao C.

This method may tell the difference of the NADH generation rate with or without PGK1, but it cannot accurately measure the activity of PGK1 nor the kinetic parameters. Therefore, we developed a method to accurately measure the forward reaction kinetics of PGK1. We designed a coupled-enzyme assay to measure the forward-reaction rate of PGK1. In a reaction mixture containing GA3P, NAD, and Pi, by adding excessive amounts of GAPDH, Reaction 1 would rapidly reach equilibrium.GA3P+NAD+Pi↔GAPDH1,3-BPG+NADHReaction 1 The equilibrium of the reactions is monitored at 340 nm, which increases at first and then remains stable (Fig. 1), which is indicative of the equilibrium state. By adding ADP and PGK1 into the reaction mixture, we initiate Reaction 2 (Fig. 1).1,3-BPG+ADP↔PGK13-PG+ATPReaction 2 Consumption of 1,3-BPG immediately disrupts the equilibrium state of Reaction 1, thus driving GA3P and NAD to 1,3-BPG and NADH. The rate of NADH generation can be readily spectrophotometrically monitored. According to Reactions 1 and 2, we could derive the following equations: 1) the number of 3-PG molecules generated = the numbers of 1,3-BPG molecules consumed; 2) the number of 1,3-BPG molecules consumed = the numbers of GA3P molecules consumed; 3) the number of GA3P molecules generated = the numbers of NADH molecules generated; and 4) therefore, NADH generation rate = turnover rate of 1,3-BPG to 3-PG catalyzed by PGK1. Therefore, the initial rate of PGK1 could be accurately measured. For measurement, based on the equilibrium of Reaction 1, we set serial concentrations of GA3P, which gave rise to the serial concentrations of 1,3-BPG (Fig. 2A). Then we determined the Km and Vmax values of human and yeast PGK1 (Fig. 2, B and C). The Km values for 1,3-BPG were 4.36 μm (yeast) and 6.86 μm (human); the Km values for 3-PG were 146 μm (yeast) and 186 μm (human), and the Vmax of the forward reaction (from 1,3-BPG to 3PG) was about 3.5-fold (human) and 5-fold (yeast) higher than that of the reverse reaction (Fig. 2D), indicating that the enzyme favors the forward reaction. By setting 1,3-BPG at a saturating concentration (about 50 μm) and varying the ADP concentrations (0.02 to 2 mm), we obtained the Km value for ADP (Fig. 2D). We sought to explore the physiological meaning of the kinetic parameters of PGK1 in glycolysis. The low Km for 1,3-BPG, the high Km for 3-PG, and the much higher rates of the forward reaction than those of the reverse reaction are the biochemical bases to maintain a low concentration of 1,3-BPG and a high concentration of 3-PG in cells. Indeed, cellular 3-PG concentrations were kept at relatively high concentrations, between 0.18 and 0.55 mm (depending on the cell lines) (Table 1). 3-PG is a precursor for serine synthesis. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which catalyzes the first step for de novo serine synthesis, has the Km value of 0.26 mm for 3-PG (29Fan J. Teng X. Liu L. Mattaini K.R. Looper R.E. Vander Heiden M.G. Rabinowitz J.D. Human phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase produces the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10 (25406093): 510-51610.1021/cb500683cCrossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Keeping a high cellular 3-PG concentration is very important for this molecule to shuttle to serine synthesis, because the specific activity (at saturating concentration of 3-PG) of PHGDH in cancer cell is very low. The activity was undetectable even using 0.15 mg of cell lysate protein in our assay system, whereas the HK activity could be accurately determined using 0.03 mg of cell lysate protein.Table 1Intracellular Glc and glycolytic intermediate concentration (mm) in cells with or without PGK1 knockdownMetabolites (mm)GlcG6PF6PFBPDHAPGA3P3PG2PGPEPPyrADPATPNADNADHHeLa-NC5.56 ± 0.0370.56 ± 0.070.12 ± 0.080.38 ± 0.0350.75 ± 0.040.05 ± 0.020.28 ± 0.040.09 ± 0.030.10 ± 0.0140.20 ± 0.030.71 ± 0.123.80 ± 0.580.68 ± 0.110.033 ± 0.005HeLa-siPGK15.52 ± 0.030.57 ± 0.10.14 ± 0.110.65 ± 0.002***1.28 ± 0.08***0.09 ± 0.03*0.28 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.030.61 ± 0.073.10 ± 0.540.66 ± 0.120.035 ± 0.008MGC80–3-NC3.9 ± 0.070.43 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.030.28 ± 0.010.58 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.050.10 ± 0.0660.15 ± 0.0040.27 ± 0.020.59 ± 0.0143.74 ± 0.210.58 ± 0.040.039 ± 0.004MGC80–3-siPGK13.96 ± 0.110.44 ± 0.050.11 ± 0.020.55 ± 0.014***1.17 ± 0.1***0.096 ± 0.04*0.14 ± 0.070.078 ± 0.040.15 ± 0.0010.21 ± 0.02*0.83 ± 0.0624.54 ± 0.80.78 ± 0.120.048 ± 0.005RKO-NC5.2 ± 0.470.31 ± 0.0150.11 ± 0.0110.37 ± 0.0340.47 ± 0.040.043 ± 0.0030.55 ± 0.070.066 ± 0.0280.06 ± 0.030.56 ± 0.046.7 ± 0.1911.3 ± 0.541.45 ± 0.030.16 ± 0.01RKO-siPGK15.2 ± 0.140.29 ± 0.10.13 ± 0.0370.50 ± 0.04*0.77 ± 0.091**0.073 ± 0.005**0.43 ± 0.120.085 ± 0.0170.049 ± 0.0130.48 ± 0.076.9 ± 0.2511.5 ± 0.641.45 ± 0.060.16 ± 0.003SK-HEP-1-NC3.88 ± 0.240.29 ± 0.0280.078 ± 0.0220.24 ± 0.0370.55 ± 0.0470.045 ± 0.0060.49 ± 0.090.13 ± 0.0450.23 ± 0.0640.51 ± 0.0960.77 ± 0.059.3 ± 0.070.93 ± 0.0010.025 ± 0.003SK-HEP-1-siPGK13.4 ± 0.180.35 ± 0.050.11 ± 0.0320.39 ± 0.035**0.8 ± 0.045**0.066 ± 0.009*0.52 ± 0.110.13 ± 0.0540.29 ± 0.0220.51 ± 0.100.77 ± 0.059.9 ± 0.420.72 ± 0.550.029 ± 0.003A549-NC4.2 ± 0.040.21 ± 0.040.038 ± 0.0030.14 ± 0.030.28 ± 0.030.021 ± 0.0020.22 ± 0.0440.071 ± 0.030.084 ± 0.040.64 ± 0.0660.84 ± 0.05710.7 ± 0.251.78 ± 0.0330.28 ± 0.009A549-siPGK13.7 ± 0.05***0.177 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.0130.20 ± 0.035*0.54 ± 0.08***0.042 ± 0.003***0.21 ± 0.0520.069 ± 0.0180.085 ± 0.0310.625 ± 0.0140.9 ± 0.06911.1 ± 0.561.78 ± 0.0380.28 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab HK2 knockdown reduced HK activity by ∼50%, glucose consumption by ∼40%, and lactate generation by ∼50% (Fig. 3A). However, HK2 knockdown did not significantly reduce the 3-PG concentration (Fig. 3B) and serine synthesis, as manifested by the analysis of the serine isotopologues (Fig. 3C). The m + 0 serine species is provided by the culture medium, and m + 3 serine isotopologue was generated from [13C6]glucose through 3-PG. The consumption rate of m + 0 serine was comparable between control cells and HK2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3C, left panel), and the percentages of extracellular and intracellular m + 0 and m + 3 serine species were also comparable between control cells and HK2 knockdown (Fig. 3C, middle and right panels). A fraction of serine was further used for glycine synthesis. The consumption rate of glycine (m + 0, which is provided by culture medium) is comparable between control and HK2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3D, left panel) and so were the percentages of extracellular and intracellular glycine (m + 2, which is derived from m + 3 serine) (Fig. 3D, middle and right panels). These data support that glucose carbon shuttling to serine and glycine was not significantly affected by HK2 knockdown, and even HK2 knockdown reduced the glycolysis rate to lactate by 50%. Taken together, the kinetic parameters of PGK1 are associated with a stable steady-state concentration of 3-PG in cancer cells, which is around the Km value of PHGDH, underlying a sound biochemical basis for glycolysis to shuttle to the de novo serine synthesis pathway.

These chemical species are short-lived in biological settings, and detecting them in these conditions and diseases requires the use of molecular probes that form stable, easily detectable, products. The chemical mechanisms and limitations of many of the currently used probes are not well-understood, hampering their effective applications. Boronates have emerged as a class of probes for the detection of nucleophilic two-electron oxidants. Here, we report the results of an oxygen-18–labeling MS study to identify the origin of oxygen atoms in the oxidation products of phenylboronate targeted to mitochondria. We demonstrate that boronate oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, peroxymonocarbonate, hypochlorite, or peroxynitrite involves the incorporation of oxygen atoms from these oxidants. We therefore conclude that boronates can be used as probes to track isotopically labeled oxidants. This suggests that the detection of specific products formed from these redox probes could enable precise identification of oxidants formed in biological systems. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the mechanism of conversion of the boronate-based redox probes to oxidant-specific products.

Because of the short lifetime of most ROS in biological settings, detection and quantitative analyses of those species have remained a challenge, and development of new probes for redox biology is an active area of research. Most chemical probes used for the detection of cellular oxidants lack selectivity toward a single species. For example, dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH), dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR123), and Amplex Red undergo two-electron oxidation to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein, rhodamine, and resorufin, respectively, and nitro blue tetrazolium undergoes four-electron reduction to diformazan, without incorporation of the reactive species detected into the product formed (Fig. 1). This often leads to ambiguity regarding the identity of the species detected and prevents tracking of the oxidants using isotope-labeling approach. ROS detection and their unambiguous identification in biological systems requires the use of chemical probes, which upon reaction form species-specific product(s) (14Hardy M. Zielonka J. Karoui H.

Resistance of boronates to heme-catalyzed oxidation makes them good candidates for the detection of oxidants in the in vivo settings. Boronate-based probes are oxidized more than a thousand times faster by HOCl and nearly a million times faster by ONOO− than by H2O2 (kH2O2 ∼ 1 m−1s−1; kHOCl ∼ 104m−1s−1; kONOO− ∼ 106m−1s−1), and the reaction typically involves a minor pathway, with the formation of ONOO−-specific product(s) (7Zielonka J.

Recently, it has been reported that peroxymonocarbonate, the product of the reaction of H2O2 with CO2, reacts with coumarin boronic acid nearly 50 times faster than H2O2 (kHCO4− ∼ 102m−1s−1) (10Truzzi D.R.

Although the identities of the oxidation, chlorination, and nitration products of boronate probes have been established in many cases, and the reaction mechanisms have been proposed, the origin of oxygen atoms in the oxidation and nitration products of boronate probes has not been experimentally determined. Understanding the mechanisms of formation of the oxidation products is required for their rigorous use as specific ROS markers in the in vitro and in vivo settings. Also, the potential for selective monitoring of the specific oxidizing species, through use of isotopically labeled oxidant and monitoring isotopic labeling of the specific products, remains to be explored. Here, we report on the incorporation of an oxygen atom from the biologically relevant two-electron oxidants, including H2O2, HCO4−, HOCl, and ONOO− in the oxidation and nitration products of the mitochondria-targeted phenyl boronate probe (oMitoPhB(OH)2) (Fig. 2). In addition, we demonstrate the involvement of oxygen atoms from superoxide in the formation of the hydroxylated product, 2-OH-E+, during oxidation of hydroethidine by O2̇̄ (Fig. 3), corroborating the proposed mechanism of the conversion of HE into 2-OH-E+.Figure 3Conversion of HE into 2-OH-E+ by O2̇̄.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have investigated the incorporation of oxygen atoms from different biologically relevant nucleophilic oxidants (Fig. 1) capable of oxidizing boronate probes into the products formed. We chose oMitoPhB(OH)2 as a model boronate probe (Fig. 2) because its reactivity toward H2O2, HOCl, and ONOO− has been studied previously in detail and the products characterized (49Zielonka J.

To demonstrate the formation of 18O-labeled superoxide, we have also tracked the incorporation of the 18O atom into the hydroxylation product of hydroethidine. Upon oxidation by H2O2, a conversion of oMitoPhB(OH)2 into the phenolic product (oMitoPhOH) occurs (Fig. 4). H2O2 oxidizes the phenylboronate substrate into a phenoxyboronate intermediate that, upon hydrolysis, yields the phenolic product and boric acid. To determine whether the phenolic oxygen atom derives from H2O2 or water, we performed the oxidation of oMitoPhB(OH)2 by H216O2 in H218O and by H218O2 in H216O (Fig. 5). The product detected in the presence of H216O2 showed the molecular mass of oMitoPh16OH (m/z = 369); in the presence of H218O2, the product had a molecular mass of 371 (Fig. 5, a and b), attributed to oMitoPh18OH. Liquid chromatography with tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analyses indicated no formation of oMitoPh18OH during the oxidation of the probe by H216O2 in H218O, whereas it was the predominant product in the presence of H218O2 (Fig. 5c). We conclude that during oxidation of boronates by H2O2, the oxygen atom in the phenolic product derives exclusively from H2O2 and not from water.Figure 5Incorporation of an oxygen atom into the phenolic product during the oxidation of oMitoPhB(OH)2 by H2O2. a, chemical structures of the products. b, online mass spectra of the products. c, LC-MS/MS traces of the phenolic products containing 16O (left panel) or 18O (right panel).

Allostery extensively regulates the activities of key enzymes within biosynthetic pathways to meet metabolic demand for their end products. Here, we have examined a critical enzyme, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS), at the gateway to aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which shows extremely complex dynamic allostery: three distinct aromatic amino acids jointly communicate occupancy to the active site via subtle changes in dynamics, enabling exquisite fine-tuning of delivery of these essential metabolites. Furthermore, this allosteric mechanism is co-opted by pathway branchpoint enzyme chorismate mutase upon complex formation. In this study, using statistical coupling analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, isothermal calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray crystallography analyses, we have pinpointed a critical node within the complex dynamic communication network responsible for this sophisticated allosteric machinery. Through a facile Gly to Pro substitution, we have altered backbone dynamics, completely severing the allosteric signal yet remarkably, generating a nonallosteric enzyme that retains full catalytic activity. We also identified a second residue of prime importance to the inter-enzyme communication with chorismate mutase. Our results reveal that highly complex dynamic allostery is surprisingly vulnerable and provide further insights into the intimate link between catalysis and allostery.

Proteins are dynamic molecules that exert functionally important motions over both long (milliseconds to seconds) and short (femptoseconds to microseconds) time scales. Protein structures and conformational dynamics are tuned for the delivery of complex protein roles. Allostery, where a signal initiated by ligand binding is communicated to elicit a remote functional response, exploits conformational dynamics (1Goodey N.M. Benkovic S.J.

Such ability to communicate between sites and deliver control on activity is essential for biosynthetic enzymes.

A similar scenario was also observed in another type II enzyme, i.e. the DAH7PS from Corynebacterium glutamicum (19Burschowsky D. Thorbjørnsrud H.V. Heim J.B. Fahrig-Kamarauskaite J.R.

In this study, we aimed to pinpoint the precise molecular mechanism that governs the communication networks that allow for such sophisticated allosteric control of the gatekeeper enzyme for aromatic biosynthesis. Using type II MtuDAH7PS as a reference, sequence correlations and key residue roles were explored, illuminating a crucial point in the internal dynamic pathway that is responsible for propagation of allosteric signal. We report a variant enzyme with interrupted signal at this crucial point that is completely lacking any allosteric response yet maintains full catalytic capacity. Type II DAH7PS utilizes internal dynamic networks to facilitate allostery, thus it is not possible to pinpoint residues involved in the network purely based on structural inspection. Due to the functional importance of allostery, such networks are expected to be conserved and thus to have coevolved, so that information regarding the internal dynamic communication pathway lies in the correlations between residues in the sequences of type II DAH7PS. Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) has been demonstrated to identify successfully groups of residues that have coevolved to preserve function or structural integrity of enzyme families (20Rivoire O. Reynolds K.A. Ranganathan R. Evolution-based functional decomposition of proteins.PLoS Comp.

We employed SCA to investigate sequence co-variations within the type II DAH7PS family that may reflect important communication pathways that are preserved due to functional importance, such as allostery, through the course of evolution. In SCA, the correlation matrix of residue conservations is computed from a multiple sequence alignment of the protein family, and analyzed by spectral decomposition using independent component analysis (20Rivoire O.

Independent components (IC) are then identified, which represent conserved, differentially evolving functional units in protein families. The ICs that show inter-correlations are further grouped into protein sectors, which in other enzyme families, have been shown to correspond to distinct functional roles (20Rivoire O. Reynolds K.A.

A total of 4217 amino acid sequences of type II DAH7PS were included in the initial multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Pairwise identities between the sequences in the alignment were analyzed and showed a distribution with an average identity value of 50% (Fig. S1). The initial MSA was then processed by removing highly gapped positions and sequences, and mapping position numbers to the reference sequence (MtuDAH7PS in this case) (20Rivoire O. Reynolds K.A.

A weighting factor was then applied to correct for the biasing effects of sequences with high identities, and the effective number of sequences in this processed MSA was calculated to be 510, which indicates the sequences in the processed MSA are sufficient to give good estimates of amino acid frequencies that are representative of the protein family (20Rivoire O.

The correlations of positional conservations in the processed MSA of type II DAH7PS were analyzed by SCA. Eleven ICs were identified, which were further grouped into three protein sectors (Fig. S2). To examine possible functional roles for these protein sectors, residues identified in each protein sector were mapped onto the structure of MtuDAH7PS, and the locations of protein sectors and ICs were examined. Sector 1 contains 119 residues, and consists of ICs 1, 7, and 8 (Fig. 2A). Residues in ICs 1 and 8 are mostly located near the center of the barrel hosting the active site (Fig. S3). Interestingly, IC 1 contains a number of residues in the active site that are known to play a role in substrate binding, such as Lys-306, Arg-337, Arg-126, Arg-284 for PEP binding, and Arg-135, Ser-136, Tro-280, Glu-248, and Lys-133 for E4P binding (14Webby C.J.

Synergistic allostery: a sophisticated regulatory network for the control of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

IC 1 also contains residues of the Phe-specific binding site, including Phe-91, Pro-56, and Tyr-173. Residues in IC 7 appear to form a potential pathway between known allosteric binding sites for Trp and Phe (Fig. 2B), and contains residues of the Trp-binding site (Ala-192, Leu-107, and Leu-194). The locations and functional roles of residues of Sector 1 suggest that it likely contributes to the communication between the allosteric ligand sites, and to the active sites within the DAH7PS tetramer. Sector 2 contains 136 residues, which include residues in the Tyr-specific binding site (Arg-256, Leu-271, and Leu-259), the Trp-binding site (Lys-123, Val-111, Ala-241, and Val-197), and the Phe-specific binding site (Asn-175). It also includes a number of DAH7PS residues that contribute to the DAH7PS-CM interface (as observed in MtuDAH7PS-CM complex structure), such as Arg-213, Asp-389, Arg-344, and Glu-451 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to Sector 1, residues in Sector 2 tend to be clustered on the exterior of the catalytic barrel. Sector 2 consists of ICs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11. Residues in ICs 3, 4, 5, and 11 do not appear to form a linked pathway between any known functional sites of type II DAH7PS (Fig. S4). However, residues in IC 2 appear to connect the allosteric ligand sites to the interface that is formed between DAH7PS and CM upon complexation (Fig. 3B). It is possible that residues in Sector 2 play a role to facilitate the communication between type II DAH7PS and CM upon complex formation, with major contributions from IC 2. Sector 3 contains 49 residues and consists of ICs 6, 9, and 10 (Fig. S5), which are mostly located between helices and β-sheets. Most of the residues identified in Sector 3 do not belong to any known functional sites on DAH7PS, thus the functional role of Sector 3 is yet unclear. Previous SCA studies on other protein families have also identified protein sectors with unknown apparent functional roles (7Hartmann M. Schneider T.R. Pfeil A. Heinrich G. Lipscomb W.N. Braus G.H. Evolution of feedback-inhibited β/α barrel isoenzymes by gene duplication and a single mutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100 (12540830): 862-86710.1073/pnas.0337566100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, co-evolved residues could be identified for structural or functional importance (20Rivoire O. Reynolds K.A. Ranganathan R. Evolution-based functional decomposition of proteins.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2016; 12: e100481710.1371/journal.pcbi.1004817Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Teşileanu T. Colwell L.J. Leibler S. Protein sectors: statistical coupling analysis versus conservation.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2015; 11: e100409110.1371/journal.pcbi.1004091Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on the observed locations of Sector 3, it likely contributes to maintaining of structural-fold of type II DAH7PS family. SCA identified groups of residues that may play an important role in the communication pathways between the different functional sites in type II DAH7PS. In particular, both IC 7 in Sector 1 and IC 2 in Sector 2 form potential communication pathways connecting different sites, and interestingly, strong cross-sector correlations are also observed between IC 7 and IC 2 (Fig. S6), indicating the cross-talk between different internal residue networks and the level of complexity of the whole signal propagation mechanism. To further interrogate the communication pathways in MtuDAH7PS without physically changing any binding sites, we substituted Gly-190 from IC 7 with a proline residue using site-directed mutagenesis, with the intention to alter the dynamic properties within the predicted allosteric communication pathway (Fig. 4A). Gly-190 is located in close proximity to the bound Trp ligand (∼13 Å) but is not directly involved in the binding of Trp. Gly-190 is remote from the active site with a distance of ∼30 Å to the active site Mn2+ ion (Fig. 4B). The G190P substitution did not alter the catalytic features of the enzyme. Kinetic assay results indicated MtuDAH7PSG190P displayed highly similar kinetic characteristics compared with the WT enzyme, with comparable Km and kcat values (Table 1). Furthermore, MtuDAH7PSG190P retained the ability to activate MtuCM, demonstrating that the inter-enzyme interaction was intact (Table 1) (16Munack S. Roderer K. Ökvist M. Kamarauskaite J.

Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data. The platform is available as a MATLAB software package at https://data.caltech.edu/records/1287."
https://openalex.org/W3013663908,"Ecology studies showed that esophageal and gastric cancers are directly correlated with the consumption of processed foods. The carcinogenicity of traditional Chinese fermented foods such as douchi (fermented black beans or fermented black soybeans) is due to the presence of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds, which are derived from biogenic amines. Among the various biogenic amines that can act as precursors of N-nitroso compounds, histamine and tyramine are considered to be the most toxic and are of public health concern when present in food. We have examined some douchi products on the market, and significant amounts of histamine and tyramine were found. The use of fermentation starters generated by subculturing fermented products with unknown microbiota would induce the risk of biogenic amines. As the microbiota used in fermentation is a crucial factor in determining the biogenic amines of fermented food, it is hypothesized that the possible harmful effects of douchi can be minimized through the use of fermentation starters composed of probiotic bacteria. This is the first study to investigate the potential of using probiotic bacteria in manufacturing douchi. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) were used to ferment black beans in this study, and no tyramine was detected in black bean samples incubated with these three strains anaerobically at 37°C or 20°C. The starter culture strains, temperature and presence of oxygen during the incubation period were found to be critical to the generation of biogenic amines. The findings of this study can provide evidence-based insights and warrant further investigations on the potential of reducing the harmful compounds in food fermented with probiotic bacteria as well as the sensory evaluation of douchi fermented with probiotic bacteria."

From the perspective of innovation value chains, we divided patent innovation activities into three stages: knowledge innovation stage, applied research stage and patent commercialization stage. The panel data from 64 universities directly managed by the Ministry of Education from 2009 to 2017 were used and several conclusions were drawn: 1) In the initial stage of knowledge innovation, the fundamental research fund plays a crucial promoting role, and knowledge innovation achievements are mainly published academic papers. 2) In the applied research stage, the knowledge innovation in the early stage and the fund investment in R&D activities have a significant positive effect on the patent output of universities, but the personnel investment has a negative effect. 3) In the final stage of patent commercialization, preliminary research results have a positive impact on patent commercialization, whose marginal effect depends on the industry-university-research relationship, external competition and reputation of the university. The evidence showed that there is a feedback channel between university patent commercialization and knowledge innovation, and new knowledge generated by the interaction with the outside world in the process of patent commercialization was transmitted to the subject of knowledge innovation through this channel, forming a virtuous dynamic cycle. By analysing the driving factors of the value chain of patent innovation in colleges and universities, we provided empirical evidence for the operation mechanism and policy formulation of college patents in China."
https://openalex.org/W3013409907,"Background Small sample sizes combined with multiple correlated endpoints pose a major challenge in the statistical analysis of preclinical neurotrauma studies. The standard approach of applying univariate tests on individual response variables has the advantage of simplicity of interpretation, but it fails to account for the covariance/correlation in the data. In contrast, multivariate statistical techniques might more adequately capture the multi-dimensional pathophysiological pattern of neurotrauma and therefore provide increased sensitivity to detect treatment effects. Results We systematically evaluated the performance of univariate ANOVA, Welch’s ANOVA and linear mixed effects models versus the multivariate techniques, ANOVA on principal component scores and MANOVA tests by manipulating factors such as sample and effect size, normality and homogeneity of variance in computer simulations. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated the highest power when variance between groups was equal or variance ratio was 1:2. In contrast, Welch’s ANOVA outperformed the remaining methods with extreme variance heterogeneity. However, power only reached acceptable levels of 80% in the case of large simulated effect sizes and at least 20 measurements per group or moderate effects with at least 40 replicates per group. In addition, we evaluated the capacity of the ordination techniques, principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to capture patterns of treatment effects without formal hypothesis testing. While LDA suffered from a high false positive rate due to multicollinearity, PCA, RDA, and PLS-DA were robust and PLS-DA outperformed PCA and RDA in capturing a true treatment effect pattern. Conclusions Multivariate tests do not provide an appreciable increase in power compared to univariate techniques to detect group differences in preclinical studies. However, PLS-DA seems to be a useful ordination technique to explore treatment effect patterns without formal hypothesis testing."

The protein has an essential role in inflammation process and various human diseases. It has the ability to bind to unsaturated fatty acids including Arachidonic acid, Oleic acid and etc., which could be considered as a major carrier for fatty acids. In this study we aimed to appraise the thermodynamics and structural changes of Calprotectin in presence of Arachidonic acid/Oleic acid) using docking and molecular dynami simulation method. To create the best conformation of Calprotectin-Oleic acid/Arachidonic acid complexes, the docking process was performed. The complexes with the best binding energy were selected as the models for molecular dynamics simulation process. Furthermore, the structural and thermodynamics properties of the complexes were evaluated too. The Root Mean Square Deviation and Root Mean Square Fluctuation results showed that the binding of Arachidonic acid/Oleic acid to Calprotectin can cause the protein structural changes which was confirmed by Define Secondary Structure of Proteins results. Accordingly, the binding free energy results verified that binding of Oleic acid to Calprotectin leads to instability of S100A8/A9 subunits in the protein. Moreover, the electrostatic energy contribution of the complexes (Calprotectin-Oleic acid/Arachidonic acid) was remarkably higher than van der Waals energy. Thus, the outcome of this study confirm that Oleic acid has a stronger interaction with Calprotectin in comparison with Arachidonic acid. Our findings indicated that binding of unsaturated fatty acids to Calprotectin leads to structural changes of the S100A8/A9 subunits which could be beneficial to play a biological role in inflammation process."
https://openalex.org/W3013990109,"Background Breast milk is the optimal choice for feeding premature babies. However, the prevalence rate of extrauterine growth restriction in preterm infants remains high. Objectives The purpose of this study was to analyze the macronutrients present in human milk and the correlation with the growth of in-hospital preterm infants. Methods This prospective study is based on data from 99 in-hospital preterm infants younger than 37 weeks of gestational age on an exclusively human milk diet. Infants who had previously received parenteral nutrition were eligible, but they had to have reached full enteral feeding at the time that the samples were taken. A total of 3282 samples of raw human milk or donor pasteurized milk were collected. The levels of lactose, protein, fat, and energy in the samples were measured using a Miris human milk analyzer. The primary outcome was weight growth velocity (g/kg/day) which was obtained using two-point approach. Results The mean (±standard deviation) macronutrient composition per 100 mL of milk was 7.2 (±0.3) g of lactose, 1.1 (±0.2) g of true protein, 3.5 (±0.9) g of fat, and 66.9 (±6.5) kcal of energy. The protein concentration in human milk had a positive, significant correlation with body weight gain, with a coefficient of 0.41 (p < 0.001). After adjusting for gestational age, postmenstrual age, small-for-gestational age, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus or congestive heart failure, duration of total parenteral nutrition support, bottle feeding or use of orogastric tube, and ventilator support, total daily protein intake was associated with body weight growth (p < 0.001). Conclusion Both the protein concentration in human milk and the daily total protein intake had a positive correlation with the body weight gain of premature infants. Routine analysis of breast milk and individualized fortification might be indicated to optimize the growth of preterm infants."

The three most efficacious treatments were selected to study their effect on meat quality parameters and sensory attributes. The inoculum included five native STEC serogroups (O26, O103, O111, O145 and O157). The treatments applied were 0.5% LA, 0.04% CA, 0.5 kGy LDI, 2 kGy HDI, LDI+LA and LDI+CA. Beef trimmings were divided into two groups; one was inoculated with high (7 log CFU/g) and the other with low (1 log CFU/g) level of inoculum. Efficacy was assessed by estimating log reduction and reduction of stx- and eae-positive samples after enrichment, respectively. Results showed that treatments with organic acids alone were not effective in reducing STEC populations. For high inoculum samples, the most effective treatment was HDI followed by LDI+LA and LDI alone or combined with CA. For low inoculum samples, the most effective treatment was HDI followed by LDI alone or combined with organic acids. Concerning meat quality parameters and sensory attributes, irradiation treatments (LDI and HDI) caused minimal changes, while LDI+LA modified them significantly compared with the control. Therefore, based on our results, no benefits were observed after combining organic acids with gamma irradiation."

Here we retrospectively analyzed correlations between OSCE and CBT scores and CC performance. Methods Ethical approval was obtained from our institutional review board. We analyzed correlations between OSCE and CBT scores and CC performance in 94 medical students who took the OSCE and CBT in 2017 when they were 4th year students, and who participated in the basic CC in 2018 when they were 5th year students. Results Total scores for OSCE and CBT were significantly correlated with CC performance (P<0.001, each). More specifically, medical interview and chest examination components of the OSCE were significantly correlated with CC performance (P = 0.001, each), while the remaining five components of the OSCE were not. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the OSCE and CBT play important roles in predicting CC performance in Japanese medical education context. Among OSCE components, medical interview and chest examination were suggested to be important for predicting CC performance."

No differences in the proportion of virus-related reads were found in both groups (p > 0.05). A variety of viral DNA genomes were identified, mostly representative of three viral families: Anelloviridae, Circoviridae and Smacoviridae. Besides, a number of novel unclassified circular Rep-encoding single stranded DNA (CRESS DNA) viruses were also identified. These findings suggest that the presence of such viral genomes in sows’ sera bears no correlation with stillbirths’ occurrence; it seems likely that these constitute part of the normal serum microbiome of sows at farrowing."

Three groups of 150 fish each were injected with either 1) an oil-adjuvanted, inactivated whole cell autovaccine, 2) adjuvant only or 3) PBS (negative control). Approximately 660 degree days post vaccination, the fish were challenged with 9x105 cfu bacteria/fish by intraperitoneal injection and monitored for a further 28 days. Protection against infections was measured by lack of/reduced bacterial loads both by bacterial re-isolation and immunohistochemistry as well as absence of clinical signs/pathology. Significantly less L. garvieae (p<0.03) was re-isolated from either the adjuvant only or control groups compared to the vaccinated group. Furthermore, a significantly high amount (p<0.001) of anti-L. garvieae specific antibodies were observed in the vaccinated group compared to the adjuvant only or control groups at time of challenge. This coincided with protection against infection measured by absence/reduced L. garvieae re-isolation from internal organs, reduced clinical signs and lack of pathology in this group. In the adjuvant only and control groups, bacteria were re-isolated from the kidney, liver, spleen, brain and eyes during the first 14 days. The findings suggest that oil-based vaccines can protect tilapia against L. garvieae infection through an antibody mediated response."
https://openalex.org/W3013429164,"Background Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD) is caused by leukocytes, specifically T cells within a transfused blood product. Currently, the prevention of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease is performed by irradiation of blood products. With a sufficient reduction of leukocytes, the risk for TA-GvHD can be decreased. With consistent advances in current state-of-the-art blood filters, we herein propose that double filtration can sufficiently reduce leukocytes to reduce the risk for TA-GvHD. Materials Thirty RBC concentrates were filtered with leukocyte filters, followed by storage at 1–6 oC for 72 hours, and then a second filtration was performed. Residual leukocytes in the double-filtered RBC units (n = 30) were assessed with flow cytometric methods, and an additional assay with isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n = 6) was done by both flow cytometric methods and an automated hematology analyzer. Quality of the RBCs after filtration was evaluated by hematological and biochemical tests. In vitro T cell expansion was performed using anti-CD3/CD28-coated Dynabeads or anti-CD3 (OKT3). In vivo experiment for GvHD was performed by using NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Results Double-filtered blood products showed residual leukocyte levels below detection limits, which calculated to be below 1200–2500 cells per blood unit. In vitro expansion rate of T cells showed that 6x103 and 1x103 cell-seeded specimens showed 60.8±10.6 fold and 10.2±9.7-fold expansion, respectively. Cell expansion was not sufficiently observed in wells planted with 1x102 or 10 cells. In vivo experiments showed that mice injected with 1x105 or more cells cause fatal GvHD. GvHD induced inflammation was observed in mice injected with 1x104 or more cells. No evidence of GvHD was found in mice injected with 103 cells. Conclusions Our study suggests that additional removal of contaminating lymphocytes by a second leukodepletion step may further reduce the risk for TA-GvHD."
https://openalex.org/W3013523247,"The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in liver cancer have attracted much attention in recent years. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-520b is downregulated in MHCC-97H cells, a liver cancer cell line with high potential of metastasis, compared with MHCC-97L cells which has a low potential of metastasis. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of miR-520b could inhibit liver cancer cell migration, while silencing its expression resulted in increased migration. Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) was identified as a direct and functional new target of miR-520b. This regulation was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. In addition, our results showed that overexpression of the MLK3 expression partially reversed the effect of miR-520b on liver cancer cell migration, indicating that MLK3 contributes to the migration in liver cancer. The newly identified miR-520b/MLK3 axis partially elucidates the molecular mechanism of liver cancer cell migration and represents a new potential therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment."

The first case to cross the border into Uganda in June 2019 demonstrates the importance of better understanding border dynamics in a context of Ebola. This paper adopts a political economy approach to contextualize epidemic response programs conducted in moderate- and high-risk border districts in Uganda, through a qualitative study with 287 participants. To that end, our aim was to describe the historical underpinnings of the borderlands context; the role of livelihood strategies in constraining risk avoidance decisions; and the dynamics of trust in authority figures, including health workers. This paper reports that border communities are highly connected, for a variety of social and economic reasons. These daily realities are in direct opposition to guidance to limit travel during an active Ebola epidemic. We argue that an ability to limit movement is constrained by the economic need to seek livelihood strategies wherever that may be. Moreover, border regions are populated by communities with long-standing distrust in authority figures, particularly in fishing areas. This distrust spills over with consequences for Ebola prevention and control activities. This research indexes the importance of tailoring Ebola programming and policies to consider the political and economic dynamics of borderlands."
https://openalex.org/W3013070768,"Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that mainly affects optic nerves and spinal cord. Besides, loss of motor and cognitive function has been reported as important symptoms of disease.Here we investigated the mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic alterations in NMO patients and evaluate their correlation with disease progress, disability and cognitive impairment.The individuals (12 controls and 12 NMO) were assessed for disease severity by expanded disease status scale (EDSS), cognitive function via symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) and fine motor disability by 9-hole peg test (9-HPT). We have measured Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), SIRT3, mitochondrial complex I, complex IV, aconitase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGD) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, SIRT1, pyruvate, lactate and cytochrome c (Cyt c) were determined in plasma.Our results exhibited increased 9-HPT time in NMO patients. 9-HPT results correlated with EDSS; and SDMT negatively correlated with disease duration and number of attacks in patients. Investigation of PBMCs of NMO patients exhibited a decrease of mitochondrial complex I and IV activity that was significant for complex IV. Besides, complex I activity was negatively correlated with 9-HPT time in NMO group. In the plasma samples, a correlation between pyruvate to lactate ratio and EDSS in NMO patients was found and a negative correlation between Cyt c concentration and SDMT was detected.Our data support the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction occurred in the CNS and the peripheral blood may contribute to disease progress, disability level and the cognitive impairment in NMO patients."
https://openalex.org/W3013846464,"Background Beijing is a national and international hub potentially containing a broad diversity of HIV variants. Previous studies on molecular epidemiology of HIV in Beijing pooled together samples from residents and non-residents. Pooling residents and non-residents has potentially introduced bias and undermined a good assessment and the intervention among the autochthonous population. Here, we aimed to define HIV subtype diversity and investigate the TDR in Beijing residents exclusively. Methods We analyzed the demographic, clinical, and virological data collected between 2001 and 2016 from residents in Beijing. A population-based sequencing of the HIV pol gene was carried out using plasma specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed in order to classify sequences into their corresponding subtypes using an automated subtyping tool, the Context-Based Modeling for Expeditious Typing (COMET). Furthermore, the drug resistance mutations were determined using the World Health Organization list for surveillance of TDR mutations. Results Data on TDR were available for 92% of 2,315 individuals with HIV infection, of whom 7.1% were women. The bioinformatic analysis of HIV strains from this study revealed that a combined 17 subtypes were circulating in Beijing, China between 2001 and 2016. The most common ones were CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and subtype B in Beijing during this period. The overall prevalence of TDR was 4.5% (95% confidence intervals[CI]: 3.6%–5.4%), with a declining trend over the period of spanning 2001 through 2016. In-depth class-specific analysis revealed that the prevalence of TDR for the nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6–1.5), 0.9% (95% CI:0.6–1.4) for non-NRTIs and 2.8% (95% CI:2.1–3.5) for protease inhibitors. The prevalence of TDR was lower in individuals infected with the CRF07_BC HIV strain than those infected with CRF01_AE. Conclusions Our data showed that the HIV epidemic in Beijing displayed a high genetic heterogeneity and a low and declining prevalence of TDR. In sharp contrast to Europe and North America, the declining trend of TDR between 2001 through 2016 was noticed while there was a widespread distribution of antiretroviral treatment in Beijing, China."
https://openalex.org/W3014006251,"Background It is unclear if the intakes of different types of protein have changed over time. Objective We delineated trends in types of protein (beef, pork, lamb or goat, chicken, turkey, fish, dairy, eggs, legumes, and nuts and seeds) in US children (2-<12 years) and adolescents (12–19 years) from 1999 to 2010. Methods We used 6 repeated cross-sectional surveys (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010, n≥1,665 for children; n≥1,156 for adolescents) to test for linear trends in the intake of types of protein (grams per kilogram of body weight) among children and adolescents, and according to sociodemographic groups and participation in food assistance programs. Results Among children, pork intake (0.76 to 0.51 g/kg) decreased, but chicken (0.98 to 1.28 g/kg), all poultry (1.18 to 1.55 g/kg), egg (0.63 to 0.69 g/kg), and legume (0.35 to 0.54 g/kg) intake increased (all P<0.05). Among adolescents, beef intake decreased (0.92 to 0.67 g/kg) whereas chicken (0.59 to 0.74 g/kg) and all poultry (0.72 to 0.86 g/kg) intake increased from 1999 to 2010 (all P<0.01). Participants of the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) increased the intake of chicken and dairy (all P<0.05) over time whereas no significant trend was observed for income-eligible non-participants. Fish intake did not change in any age group, and recommended types of protein (poultry, fish, nuts and seeds) declined among children of lower socioeconomic status. Conclusions Intake of recommended types of protein increased among children, adolescents and WIC participants. However, subgroup analyses suggest socioeconomic disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3013275572,"Background Beginning August 2017, we conducted a prospective case-control investigation in Monterrey, Mexico to assess the association between Zika virus (ZIKV) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Methods For each of 50 GBS case-patients, we enrolled 2–3 afebrile controls (141 controls in total) matched by sex, age group, and presentation to same hospital within 7 days. Results PCR results for ZIKV in blood and/or urine were available on all subjects; serum ZIKV IgM antibody for 52% of case-patients and 80% of controls. Subjects were asked about antecedent illness in the two months prior to neurological onset (for case-patients) or interview (for controls). Laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection alone (PCR+ or IgM+) was not significantly different between case-patients and controls (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.45–3.54) but antecedent symptomatic ZIKV infection [a typical ZIKV symptom (rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis) plus laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection] was higher among case-patients (OR: 12.45, 95% CI: 1.45–106.64). GBS case-patients with laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection were significantly more likely to have had typical ZIKV symptoms than controls with laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection (OR: 17.5, 95% CI: 3.2–96.6). This association remained significant even when only GBS case-patients who were afebrile for 5 days before onset were included in the analysis, (OR 9.57 (95% CI: 1.07 to 85.35). Conclusions During ZIKV epidemics, this study indicates that increases in GBS will occur primarily among those with antecedent symptomatic ZIKV."
https://openalex.org/W3013794367,"Airborne fungi and their ecological functions have been largely ignored in plant invasions. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to characterize the airborne fungi in the canopy air of the invasive weed Ageratina adenophora. Then, representative phytopathogenic strains were isolated from A. adenophora leaf spots and their virulence to A.adenophora as well as common native plants in the invaded range was tested. The fungal alpha diversities were not different between the sampling sites or between the high/low part of the canopy air, but fungal co-occurrences were less common in the high than in the low part of the canopy air. Interestingly, we found that the phytopathogenic Didymellaceae fungi co-occurred more frequently with themselves than with other fungi. Disease experiments indicated that all 5 Didymellaceae strains could infect A. adenophora as well as the 16 tested native plants and that there was large variation in the virulence and host range. Our data suggested that the diverse pathogens in the canopy air might be a disease infection source that weakens the competition of invasive weeds, a novel phenomenon that remains to be explored in other invasive plants."
https://openalex.org/W3014026731,"Purpose To evaluate the spatial registration and correlation of liver and tumor histopathology sections with corresponding in vivo CT and MRI using 3D, liver-specific cutting molds in a woodchuck (Marmota monax) hepatic tumor model. Methods Five woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus following inoculation at birth and with confirmed hepatic tumors were imaged by contrast enhanced CT or MRI. Virtual 3D liver or tumor models were generated by segmentation of in vivo CT or MR imaging. A specimen-specific cavity was created inside a block containing cutting slots aligned with an imaging plane using computer-aided design software, and the final cutting molds were fabricated using a 3D printer. Livers were resected two days after initial imaging, fixed with formalin or left unfixed, inserted into the 3D molds, and cut into parallel pieces by passing a sharp blade through the parallel slots in the mold. Histopathology sections were acquired and their spatial overlap with in vivo image slices was quantified using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Results Imaging of the woodchucks revealed heterogeneous hepatic tumors of varying size, number, and location. Specimen-specific 3D molds provided accurate co-localization of histopathology of whole livers, liver lobes, and pedunculated tumors with in vivo CT and MR imaging, with or without tissue fixation. Visual inspection of histopathology sections and corresponding in vivo image slices revealed spatial registration of analogous pathologic features. The mean DSC for all specimens was 0.83+/-0.05. Conclusion Use of specimen-specific 3D molds for en bloc liver dissection provided strong spatial overlap and feature correspondence between in vivo image slices and histopathology sections."
https://openalex.org/W3013190991,"The accurate and rapid identification of insect pests is an important step in the prevention and control of outbreaks in areas that are otherwise pest free. The potato-tomato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli (Šulc, 1909) is the main vector of 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' on potato and tomato crops in North America and New Zealand; and is considered a threat for introduction in Europe and other pest-free regions. This study describes the design and validation of the first species-specific TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR assay, targeting the ITS2 gene region of B. cockerelli. The assay detected B. cockerelli genomic DNA from adults, immatures, and eggs, with 100% accuracy. This assay also detected DNA from cloned plasmids containing the ITS2 region of B. cockerelli with 100% accuracy. The assay showed 0% false positives when tested on genomic and cloned DNA from 73 other psyllid species collected from across Europe, New Zealand, Mexico and the USA. This included 8 other species in the Bactericera genus and the main vectors of 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' worldwide. The limit of detection for this assay at optimum conditions was 0.000001ng DNA (~200 copies) of ITS2 DNA which equates to around a 1:10000 dilution of DNA from one single adult specimen. This assay is the first real-time PCR based method for accurate, robust, sensitive and specific identification of B. cockerelli from all life stages. It can be used as a surveillance and monitoring tool to further study this important crop pest and to aid the prevention of outbreaks, or to prevent their spread after establishment in new areas."
https://openalex.org/W3013264949,"The sulphur-rich and acidic vent waters of a shallow hydrothermal vent field next to Kueishan Island in Taiwan provide a specific and generally toxic environment. Among only a few aquatic organisms able to survive there, the grapsoid crab Xenograpsus testudinatus is the dominant species with a high population density in the vent area. Here we study the gender-specific distribution, morphological traits, and relationship of wet weight vs. carapace width of this crab. A total of 1120 individuals including 831 male and 289 female (included 15 ovigerous) were examined during August and September in 2011 and May and September in 2012. Except in August 2011, there are no significant differences in the distribution of X. testudinatus in the hydrothermal vent area from the vent spout during most months. Among crabs, the weight of male (6.87 ± 2.90 g) was significantly heavier than that of females (4.17 ± 1.25 g) (p < 0.001, Student's t-test). As for the wet weight of crabs, significant differences were noted in both the length of chela and the width of carapace between males and females. Sexual dimorphism of X. testudinatus is evident in three morphological traits. Pearson's correlation showed a significant and positive correlation (p < 0.001) of wet weight, width of carapace and length of chela of the two sexes. Ovigerous crabs (shortest carapace width: 1.93 cm) were present in the specimen collected from August 2011 and May 2012. The ovigerous crabs were not found in the samples collected from September in both years 2011 and 2012, indicating that reproduction may have ceased during the period of sampling. The present results suggested that the reproductive period of X. testudinatus was before September. The distribution pattern and sexual dimorphism of X. testudinatus provided a better understanding of the idiobiology of this dominant metazoan in the hydrothermal vent area."
https://openalex.org/W3013561044,"Trust between couples is a prerequisite for stable and satisfactory romantic relationships. However, there has been no valid research tool to assess partner-specific trust behavior including costly investments in the trustworthiness of the romantic partner. We here present a comprehensive validation of the newly developed Trust Game for Couples (TGC) by means of various self-report and implicit relationship-related measures. The TGC operationalizes trust by measuring an individual’s willingness to invest his or her own financial resources in pro-relationship attitudes of their romantic partner (collected by dichotomous responses to relationship-relevant items, e.g., answering yes to “I am absolutely sure that I love my partner”). Thirty-five healthy couples between 20 and 34 years completed the TGC in an interactive (both partners present), but anonymous setting (no information on the partner’s responses revealed). Trust, as measured by the TGC, correlates positively with self-reported trust, satisfaction, and felt closeness in the relationship, but not with general interpersonal trust, confirming both its convergent and discriminant validity. In addition to explicit criteria for construct validity, implicit measures of partner valence and confidence explained variance in the TGC, demonstrating that it constitutes an economical measure of implicit and explicit ingredients of trust between couples. In sum, the TGC provides a novel, specific behavioral tool for a sensitive assessment of trust in dyadic relationships with potential for numerous research fields."
https://openalex.org/W3013988156,"INTRODUCTION Smoking is a strong risk factor for disease severity in Crohn's disease (CD) and cessation improves outcomes. The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) predicts cessation success with pharmacotherapy: varenicline doubles cessation over nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for normal, but not metabolizers. Varenicline side effects are heightened in slow metabolizers. Methods using NMR to optimize cessation pharmacotherapy have not been evaluated in CD. AIMS We aim to determine the prevalence of smoking in a CD population and then assess these smokers' attitudes toward a personalized metabolism-informed care (MIC) approach to cessation. METHODS In this observational study, we surveyed 1098 patients visiting an inflammatory bowel disease center about their smoking history. We then evaluated a subgroup of individuals with CD (n = 32) who participated in a randomized controlled trial of smoking cessation using MIC versus usual care. For MIC, medication selection was informed by the NMR (normal ≥0.31 vs. slow <0.31). The primary outcomes were intervention satisfaction and match rates between NMR and medication choice. RESULTS The baseline prevalence of smoking in our CD population was 13%. Intervention participants reported high rates of satisfaction (85%) and chose a medication that matched their NMR result more often in the MIC group (100% vs. 64%, p = 0.01). Six of 16 (37.5%) patients prescribed varenicline discontinued due to side effects. CONCLUSION MIC produced high rates of satisfaction and matching between NMR and medication in CD patients, supporting patient acceptance and feasibility of precision smoking cessation in this population. To reduce smoking in CD, therapies such as MIC are needed to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3013387721,"Social experience, particularly aggression, is considered a major determinant of consistent inter-individual behavioural differences between animals of the same species and sex. We investigated the influence of pre-adult aggressive experience on future behaviour in male, last instar nymphs of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. We found that aggressive interactions between male nymphs are far less fierce than for adults in terms of duration and escalation. This appears to reflect immaturity of the sensory apparatus for releasing aggression, rather than the motor system controlling it. First, a comparison of the behavioural responses of nymphs and adults to mechanical antennal stimulation using freshly excised, untreated and hexane-washed antennae taken from nymphs and adults, indicate that nymphs neither respond to nor produce sex-specific cuticular semiochemicals important for releasing aggressive behaviour in adults. Second, treatment with the octopamine agonist chlordimeform could at least partially compensate for this deficit. In further contrast to adults, which become hyper-aggressive after victory, but submissive after defeat, such winner and loser effects are not apparent in nymphs. Aggressive competition between nymphs thus appears to have no consequence for future behaviour in crickets. Male nymphs are often attacked by adult males, but not by adult females. Furthermore, observations of nymphs raised in the presence, or absence of adult males, revealed that social subjugation by adult males leads to reduced aggressiveness and depressed exploratory behaviour when the nymphs become adult. We conclude that social subjugation by adults during pre-adult development of nymphs is a major determinant of consistent inter-individual behavioural differences in adult crickets."
https://openalex.org/W3013390956,"The gradient vector flow (GVF) is an effective external force to deform the active contours. However, it suffers from high computational cost. For efficiency, the virtual electric field (VEF) model has been proposed, which can be implemented in real time thanks to fast Fourier transform (FFT). The VEF model has large capture range and low computation cost, but it has the limitations of sensitivity to noise and leakage on weak edge. The recently proposed CONVEF (Convolutional Virtual Electric Field) model takes the VEF model as a convolutional operation and employed another convolution kernel to overcome the drawbacks of the VEF model. In this paper, we employ an edge stopping function similar to that in the anisotropic diffusion to further improve the CONVEF model, and the proposed model is referred to as MCONVEF (Modified CONVEF) model. In addition, a piecewise constant approximation algorithm is borrowed to accelerate the calculation of the MCONVEF model. The proposed MCONVEF model is compared with the GVF and VEF models, and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate its superiority in terms of noise robustness, weak edge preserving and deep concavity convergence."
https://openalex.org/W3013434997,"Interferon-regulated myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB) is an interferon-induced GTPase belonging to the dynamin superfamily. It inhibits infection with a wide range of different viruses, including HIV-1, by impairing viral DNA entry into the nucleus. Unlike the related antiviral GTPase MxA, MxB possesses an N-terminal region that contains a nuclear localization signal and is crucial for inhibiting HIV-1. Because MxB previously has been shown to reside in both the nuclear envelope and the cytoplasm, here we used bioinformatics and biochemical approaches to identify a nuclear export signal (NES) responsible for MxB's cytoplasmic location. Using the online computational tool LocNES (Locating Nuclear Export Signals or NESs), we identified five putative NES candidates in MxB and investigated whether their deletion caused nuclear localization of MxB. Our results revealed that none of the five deletion variants relocates to the nucleus, suggesting that these five predicted NES sequences do not confer NES activity. Interestingly, deletion of one sequence, encompassing amino acids 505–527, abrogated the anti-HIV-1 activity of MxB. Further mutation experiments disclosed that amino acids 515–519, and Pro-515 in particular, regulate MxB oligomerization and its binding to HIV-1 capsid, thereby playing an important role in MxB-mediated restriction of HIV-1 infection. In summary, our results indicate that none of the five predicted NES sequences in MxB appears to be required for its nuclear export.

A schematic representation of these five deletions is shown in Fig. 1A. These five mutants, WT MxB, or N-terminal (residues 1–25) deletion were transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, MxB was localized at the nuclear envelope and in the form of cytoplasmic puncta/granules, whereas the N-terminal (residues 1–25) deletion, lacking the NLS, was dispersed in the cytoplasm.

Thus, this study investigated whether CRP, FGA, FGB, FGG, PON1, and EDNRA gene variants affected plasma hs-CRP, fibrinogen levels, and thickness of carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Nineteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CRP, FGA, FGB, FGG, PON1, and EDNRA genes were examined in 480 participants from 160 families. Carotid IMT was measured by ultrasound. Generalized linear models with generalized estimating equation were utilized to consider the dependence of subjects within families. In the recessive model, homozygotes for the minor alleles of rs1800789, rs1800790 and rs4220 SNPs in FGB gene indicated a reduced risk of IMT (Exp. β = 0.89, 0.89, 0.88), which remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Significant interaction effects between CRP SNP rs1130864 and rs3093059 and gender for IMT were observed with a significant association in men only. Men carrying minor-minor genotype of CRP SNP rs1130864 and rs3093059 had 0.70- and 0.78-fold lower IMT than men carrying minor-major/major-major genotype. We also observed that the interaction of CRP SNP rs1130864 and rs3093059 with obesity on IMT, hs-CRP and fibrinogen levels. These results support the hypothesis that inflammatory genes are involved in atherosclerosis, most likely via complex gene-gender and gene-obesity interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3013808468,"In order to remedy the current problem of having been buffeted by competing requirements for both protection sensitivity and quick reaction of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission lines simultaneously, a new intelligent fault identification method based on Random Forests (RF) for HVDC transmission lines is proposed. S transform is implemented to extract fault current traveling wave of 8 frequencies and calculate the fluctuation index and energy sum ratio, in which the wave index is used to identify internal and external faults, and energy sum ratio is used to identify the positive and negative pole faults occurred on the transmission line. The intelligent fault identification model of RF is established, and the fault characteristic sample set of HVDC transmission lines is constructed by using multi-scale S transform fluctuation index and multi-scale S-transform energy sum ratio. Training and testing have been carried out to identify HVDC transmission line faults. According to theoretical researches and a large number of results of simulation experiments, the proposed intelligent fault identification method based on RF for HVDC transmission lines can effectively solve the problem of protection failure caused by inaccurate identification of traditional traveling wave wavefront or wavefront data loss. It can accurately and quickly realize the identification of internal and external faults and the selection of fault poles under different fault distances and transitional resistances, and has a strong ability to withstand transitional resistance and a strong ability to resist interference."
https://openalex.org/W3006222780,"Foot orthoses are one of the most used strategies by healthy runners in injury prevention and performance improvement. However, their effect on running kinematics throughout an intense prolonged run in this population is unknown. Moreover, there is some controversy regarding the use of custom-made versus prefabricated foot orthoses. This study analysed the effect of different foot orthoses (custom-made, prefabricated and a control condition) on spatio-temporal and angular (knee flexion and foot eversion) kinematic parameters and their behaviour during an intense prolonged run. Twenty-four recreational runners performed three similar tests that consisted of running 20 min on a treadmill at 80% of their maximal aerobic speed, each one with a different foot orthosis condition. Contact and flight time, and stride length and stride rate were measured every 5 min by an optical measurement photoelectric cell system. Knee flexion and foot eversion kinematic parameters were measured by two high-speed cameras. No significant differences were found between the different foot orthoses in any of the time points studied and between the interaction of foot orthosis and behaviour over time, in any of the variables studied (P > 0.05). The use of custom-made and prefabricated foot orthoses during an intense prolonged run does not produce changes in spatio-temporal and kinematic parameters in healthy runners. These results suggest that a healthy runner maintains its ideal movement pattern throughout a 20 minute prolonged run, regardless the type of foot orthosis used."
https://openalex.org/W3013593004,"Purpose Identify how higher Body Mass Index (BMI) and weight discrimination are associated with romantic relationship formation and termination in young adults, and if the association was consistent for males and females. Methods First-year students (N = 1096) at entry to university (Time 1) provided BMI and self-reports of weight discrimination and romantic relationship status (in a relationship vs single); 550 were successfully resampled four months later (Time 2). Logistic generalized estimating equations (GEEs) examined if Time 1 relationship status was predicted by BMI and weight discrimination. Logistic GEEs were used to determine if Time 1 BMI and weight discrimination predicted Time 2 relationship status for the strata of students in, and out, of a relationship at Time 1. Results At baseline, students were less likely to be in a relationship if they had a higher BMI (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.92, 0.96) or reported weight discrimination (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.90). When stratified by gender, the association between higher BMI and weight discrimination with relationship status was only observed for females. Longitudinally, a BMI-based selection effect was observed for romantic relationship formation, but not termination. Of the students who were single at Time 1, each one unit higher baseline BMI decreased the odds of the student transitioning to a relationship by 9% at Time 2 (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85, 0.96). When stratified by gender the association of higher BMI decreased odds of relationship formation was only significant for females. No weight discrimination differences for selection in or out of a romantic relationship were observed. Conclusions These findings suggest a weight-related selection effect for romantic relationship initiation, but not termination, in young female adults with lower BMIs. Weight discrimination was not associated with romantic relationship initiation or termination in this sample."
https://openalex.org/W3013383989,"Background Concern has been raised about consequences of including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation in readmission and mortality measures. Methods We calculated unadjusted and hospital-specific 30-day risk-standardized mortality (RSMR) and readmission (RSRR) rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of AMI or HF discharged between July 2010 and June 2013. Hospitals were compared before and after excluding LVAD and heart transplantation patients. LVAD indication was measured. Results In the AMI mortality (n = 506,543) and readmission (n = 526,309) cohorts, 1,166 and 1,016 patients received an LVAD while 3 and 2 had a heart transplantation, respectively. In the HF mortality (n = 1,015,335) and readmission (n = 1,254,124) cohorts, 789 and 931 received an LVAD, while 212 and 202 received a heart transplantation, respectively. Less than 2% of hospitals had either ≥6 patients who received an LVAD or, independently, had ≥1 heart transplantation. The AMI mortality and readmission cohorts used 1.8% and 2.8% of LVADs for semi-permanent/permanent indications, versus 73.8% and 78.0% for HF patients, respectively. The rest were for temporary/external indications. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without LVAD patients versus hospitals with ≥6 LVADs was 14.8% and 14.3%, and RSRR was 17.8% and 18.3%, respectively; the HF cohort RSMR was 11.9% and 9.7% and RSRR was 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without versus with heart transplantation patients was 14.7% and 13.9% and RSRR was 17.8% and 17.7%, respectively; in the HF cohort, RSMR was 11.9% and 11.0%, and RSRR was 22.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Estimations changed ≤0.1% after excluding LVAD or heart transplantation patients. Conclusion Hospitals caring for ≥6 patients with LVAD or ≥1 heart transplantation typically had a trend toward lower RSMRs but higher RSRRs. Rates were insignificantly changed when these patients were excluded. LVADs were primarily for acute-care in the AMI cohort and chronic support in the HF cohort. LVAD and heart transplantation patients are a distinct group with differential care requirements and outcomes, thus should be considered separately from the rest of the HF cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3013857760,"The quantitative understanding of human behavior is a key issue in modern science. Recently, inhomogeneous human activities have been described by bursts (consecutive activities separated by long periods of inactivity) and characterized by fat-tailed inter-event time (interval between two activities) distributions. However, the dynamics between number of activities and activity duration are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed 133 million toll-free call records from China to study the dynamics between call frequency and call duration. We confirmed that both call frequency and call duration exhibit circadian cycles and weekly cycles. By analyzing intraday patterns of these two metrics, we found the opposite volatility and clustered distributions. Results of clustering analysis showed that calling activity to toll-free numbers can be clustered into four clusters. In the ""Work"" cluster, the distribution of call duration was significantly different from that in the other clusters. The corresponding time of ""Work"" cluster was much shorter than estimates based on common sense. Intraday patterns and clustering results showed that both call frequency and call duration are primarily related to circadian cycles, the nature of human beings, and that work is a secondary factor that affects these variables. Moreover, we found a strong positive correlation between call frequency and call duration, as well as polarization of joint probability. The polarization indicates two extremes in inhomogeneous calling activity to toll-free numbers, i.e., either people are very busy or very idle. The empirical probability of the extreme was approximately four times that of random probability. Our findings may have great usage for studying the dynamics of inhomogeneous human behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3012984610,"The representation of number symbols is assumed to be unique, and not shared with other ordinal sequences. However, little research has examined if this is the case, or whether properties of symbols (such as spatial complexity) affect ordinal learning. Two studies were conducted to investigate if the property of spatial complexity affects learning ordinal sequences. In Study 1, 46 adults made a series of judgements about two novel symbol sets (Gibson and Sunúz). The goal was to find a novel symbol set that could be ordered by spatial complexity. In Study 2, 84 adults learned to order nine novel symbols (Sunúz) with a paired comparison task, judging which symbol was ‘larger’ (whereby the larger symbol became physically larger as feedback), and were then asked to rank the symbols. Participants were assigned to either a condition where there was a relationship between spatial complexity and symbol order, or a condition where there was a random relationship. Of interest was whether learning an ordered list of symbols would be facilitated by the spatial complexity of the novel symbols. Findings suggest spatial complexity affected learning ability, and that pairing spatial complexity with relational information can facilitate learning ordinal sequences. This suggests that the implicit cognitive representation of number may be a more general feature of ordinal lists, and not exclusive to number per se."
https://openalex.org/W3013068107,"Voice power is an important concept in daily life of voice hearers and in the support and therapy for voice hearers who seek help. Therefore, the ability to examine voice power differentials between a voice and a voice hearer is essential. The present study aimed to collect data on voice power differentials and to further validate the Voice Power Differential Scale (VPD). 105 participants aged ≥ 18 with an ICD10 F2-diagnosis that included hearing voices were included in this study. Internal consistency was good (alpha = 0.792), as well as test-retest-reliability (r = 0.855) and correlations with other constructs were generally as expected. The VPD questionnaire results correlated negatively with the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised’s (BAVQ-R) items of Benevolence and Engagement-emotion. It correlated positively with Omnipotence and Resistance-emotion, as well as with Negative Content on the Psychotic Symptoms Rating-Scale (PSYRATS). Unexpectedly, no correlations were found with overall severity and command hallucinations. The Voice Power Differential Scale is an important tool for assessing and formulating a voice hearer’s experience when they seek treatment or support for their verbal auditory hallucinations. The results of this study enrich the on-going discussion about the importance of voice power for voice hearers."
https://openalex.org/W3013659750,"Psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt explores the bias most of us harbor without knowing it. In cleverly designed experiments, she and her Stanford University team have shown how social conditions can interact with the workings of our brain to generate unconscious bias in our responses to other people, especially in the context of race. Such bias stems from our brain9s tendency to categorize things—a useful function in a world of infinite stimuli, but one that can lead to discrimination and worse, particularly in times of hurry or stress. Eberhardt hasn9t shied away from some of the most painful questions in U.S. race relations, such as the role of implicit bias in police shootings. And she has worked with police departments to reduce the influence of bias in their encounters with the public."
