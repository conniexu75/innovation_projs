https://openalex.org/W2745129199,"The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) is one of the most frequently used diagnostic self-report scales for screening, diagnosis and severity assessment of anxiety disorder. Its psychometric properties from the view of the Item Response Theory paradigm have rarely been investigated. We aimed to close this gap by analyzing the GAD-7 within a large sample of primary care patients with respect to its psychometric properties and its implications for scoring using Item Response Theory.Robust, nonparametric statistics were used to check unidimensionality of the GAD-7. A graded response model was fitted using a Bayesian approach. The model fit was evaluated using posterior predictive p-values, item information functions were derived and optimal predictions of anxiety were calculated.The sample included N = 3404 primary care patients (60% female; mean age, 52,2; standard deviation 19.2) The analysis indicated no deviations of the GAD-7 scale from unidimensionality and a decent fit of a graded response model. The commonly suggested ultra-brief measure consisting of the first two items, the GAD-2, was supported by item information analysis. The first four items discriminated better than the last three items with respect to latent anxiety.The information provided by the first four items should be weighted more heavily. Moreover, estimates corresponding to low to moderate levels of anxiety show greater variability. The psychometric validity of the GAD-2 was supported by our analysis."

In the present study, the indigenous tea rhizobacteria were isolated from seven tea estates of Darjeeling located in West Bengal, India. A total of 150 rhizobacterial isolates were screened for antagonistic activity against six different fungal pathogens i.e. Nigrospora sphaerica (KJ767520), Pestalotiopsis theae (ITCC 6599), Curvularia eragostidis (ITCC 6429), Glomerella cingulata (MTCC 2033), Rhizoctonia Solani (MTCC 4633) and Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC 284), out of which 48 isolates were antagonist to at least one fungal pathogen used. These 48 isolates exhibited multifarious antifungal properties like the production of siderophore, chitinase, protease and cellulase and also plant growth promoting (PGP) traits like IAA production, phosphate solubilization, ammonia and ACC deaminase production. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and BOX-PCR analysis based genotyping clustered the isolates into different groups. Finally, four isolates were selected for plant growth promotion study in two tea commercial cultivars TV-1 and Teenali-17 in nursery conditions. The plant growth promotion study showed that the inoculation of consortia of these four PGPR isolates significantly increased the growth of tea plant in nursery conditions. Thus this study underlines the commercial potential of these selected PGPR isolates for sustainable tea cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W2743318669,"Traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) affect millions of people worldwide; the majority of whom are in the chronic phase of their injury. Unfortunately, most current treatments target the acute/subacute injury phase as the microenvironment of chronically injured cord consists of a well-established glial scar with inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) which acts as a potent barrier to regeneration. It has been shown that CSPGs can be degraded in vivo by intrathecal Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) to produce a more permissive environment for regeneration by endogenous cells or transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subacute phase of injury. Using a translationally-relevant clip-contusion model of cervical spinal cord injury in mice we sought to determine if ChABC pretreatment could modify the harsh chronic microenvironment to enhance subsequent regeneration by induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NSCs (iPS-NSC). Seven weeks after injury-during the chronic phase-we delivered ChABC by intrathecal osmotic pump for one week followed by intraparenchymal iPS-NSC transplant rostral and caudal to the injury epicenter. ChABC administration reduced chronic-injury scar and resulted in significantly improved iPSC-NSC survival with clear differentiation into all three neuroglial lineages. Neurons derived from transplanted cells also formed functional synapses with host circuits on patch clamp analysis. Furthermore, the combined treatment led to recovery in key functional muscle groups including forelimb grip strength and measures of forelimb/hindlimb locomotion assessed by Catwalk. This represents important proof-of-concept data that the chronically injured spinal cord can be 'unlocked' by ChABC pretreatment to produce a microenvironment conducive to regenerative iPS-NSC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2743831342,"Many researchers have called for implementation of active learning practices in undergraduate science classrooms as one method to increase retention and persistence in STEM, yet there has been little research on the potential increases in student anxiety that may accompany these practices. This is of concern because excessive anxiety can decrease student performance. Levels and sources of student anxiety in three introductory biology lecture classes were investigated via an online survey and student interviews. The survey (n = 327) data revealed that 16% of students had moderately high classroom anxiety, which differed among the three classes. All five active learning classroom practices that were investigated caused student anxiety, with students voluntarily answering a question or being called on to answer a question causing higher anxiety than working in groups, completing worksheets, or answering clicker questions. Interviews revealed that student anxiety seemed to align with communication apprehension, social anxiety, and test anxiety. Additionally, students with higher general anxiety were more likely to self-report lower course grade and the intention to leave the major. These data suggest that a subset of students in introductory biology experience anxiety in response to active learning, and its potential impacts should be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2744025130,"Background In 2013, Kenya transitioned into a devolved system of government with a central government and 47 semi-autonomous county governments. In this paper, we report early experiences of devolution in the Kenyan health sector, with a focus on public county hospitals. Specifically, we examine changes in hospital autonomy as a result of devolution, and how these have affected hospital functioning. Methods We used a qualitative case study approach to examine the level of autonomy that hospitals had over key management functions and how this had affected hospital functioning in three county hospitals in coastal Kenya. We collected data by in-depth interviews of county health managers and hospital managers in the case study hospitals (n = 21). We adopted the framework proposed by Chawla et al (1995) to examine the autonomy that hospitals had over five management domains (strategic management, finance, procurement, human resource, and administration), and how these influenced hospital functioning. Findings Devolution had resulted in a substantial reduction in the autonomy of county hospitals over the five key functions examined. This resulted in weakened hospital management and leadership, reduced community participation in hospital affairs, compromised quality of services, reduced motivation among hospital staff, non-alignment of county and hospital priorities, staff insubordination, and compromised quality of care. Conclusion Increasing the autonomy of county hospitals in Kenya will improve their functioning. County governments should develop legislation that give hospitals greater control over resources and key management functions."
https://openalex.org/W2743643698,"Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), a widespread glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), is crucial for ecosystem functioning and ecological restoration. In the present study, an investigation was conducted to comprehensively analyze the effects of heavy metal (HM) contamination on AMF status, soil properties, aggregate distribution and stability, and their correlations at different soil depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 cm). Our results showed that the mycorrhizal colonization (MC), hyphal length density (HLD), GRSP, soil organic matter (SOM) and soil organic carbon (SOC) were significantly inhibited by Pb compared to Zn at 0-20 cm soil depth, indicating that HM had significant inhibitory effects on AMF growth and soil properties, and that Pb exhibited greater toxicity than Zn at shallow layer of soil. Both the proportion of soil large macroaggregates (>2000 μm) and mean weight diameter (MWD) were positively correlated with GRSP, SOM and SOC at 0-20 cm soil depth (P < 0.05), proving the important contributions of GRSP, SOM and SOC for binding soil particles together into large macroaggregates and improving aggregate stability. Furthermore, MC and HLD had significantly positive correlation with GRSP, SOM and SOC, suggesting that AMF played an essential role in GRSP, SOM and SOC accumulation and subsequently influencing aggregate formation and particle-size distribution in HM polluted soils. Our study highlighted that the introduction of indigenous plant associated with AMF might be a successful biotechnological tool to assist the recovery of HM polluted soils, and that proper management practices should be developed to guarantee maximum benefits from plant-AMF symbiosis during ecological restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2743371000,"Clostridium perfringens can induce necrotic enteritis of chickens, which causes large economic losses every year. Bacillus licheniformis, a probiotic, can inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, thereby improving the health status of chickens. However, from a microbial ecology perspective, the mechanisms by which alterations to the gut microbiota improve health remain unknown. In this study, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to investigate the cecal microbiota of a negative control group (NC), a C. perfringens and Eimeria challenge group with fishmeal supplementation (PC), a group supplemented with fishmeal and infected with coccidia (FC), and group PC with B. licheniformis supplementation (BL). We found that the health status of C. perfringens-challenged chickens was compromised, and that B. licheniformis improved the growth of the chickens challenged with pathogens. Microbial diversity analysis and taxonomic profiling of groups NC, PC, and FC revealed a disturbed cecal microflora of the birds with C. perfringens. We also characterized the microbiota of the chickens in the BL group using several methods. Principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that, compared with group PC, the bacterial community structure of group BL was more similar to that of group NC. Linear discriminant analysis with effect size revealed less differentially represented bacterial taxa between groups BL and NC than between groups PC and NC. In addition, groups BL and NC appeared to have similar overrepresented microbial taxa (such as Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Megamonas, and Akkermansia) compared with group PC. Finally, a phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis indicated that large differences existed between group PC and groups NC and BL. In conclusion, pre-treatment with B. licheniformis reduced the disturbance of the cecal microbiome induced by challenge with C. perfringens and other factors in broiler chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2743280972,"The site of Parkhaus Opéra is located on the north-eastern shore of Lake Zürich (Switzerland) and was documented during a rescue excavation in 2010 and 2011 by the Office for Urbanism, City of Zürich. Two charred bread-like objects were found in late Neolithic Layer 13 of the pile-dwelling, and are investigated using a novel set of analyses for cereal-based foodstuffs. Tissue remains of barley and wheat were identified, as well as a schizocarp of celery (cf. Apium graveolens), providing the first evidence for the use of bread condiments in the Neolithic. Cereal particle sizes were recorded and used to draw conclusions regarding milling and sieving of the raw material. Gas bubbles in the charred objects were measured in order to evaluate possible leavening of the dough. The outcomes of this research significantly advance the understanding of the production traits of cereal-based food during the Neolithic. The analytical techniques proposed by this study open up new possibilities for systematic and consistent investigations of cereal-based archaeological foodstuffs."
https://openalex.org/W2743877546,"Background: Cardiac fibroblasts, together with cardiomyocytes, occupy the majority of cells in the myocardium and are involved in myocardial remodeling. The lysophospholipid mediator sphigosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates functions of cardiovascular cells through multiple receptors including S1PR1–S1PR3. S1PR1 but not other S1P receptors was upregulated in angiotensin II-induced hypertrophic hearts. Therefore, we investigated a role of S1PR1 in fibroblasts for cardiac remodeling by employing transgenic mice that overexpressed S1PR1 under the control of α-smooth muscle actin promoter. In S1PR1-transgenic mouse heart, fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts were hyperplastic, and those cells as well as vascular smooth muscle cells overexpressed S1PR1. Transgenic mice developed bi-ventricular hypertrophy by 12-week-old and diffuse interstitial fibrosis by 24-week-old without hemodynamic stress. Cardiac remodeling in transgenic mice was associated with greater ERK phosphorylation, upregulation of fetal genes, and systolic dysfunction. Transgenic mouse heart showed increased mRNA expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Isolated fibroblasts from transgenic mice exhibited enhanced generation of angiotensin II, which in turn stimulated IL-6 release. Either an AT1 blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prevented development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, systolic dysfunction and increased IL-6 expression in transgenic mice. Finally, administration of anti-IL-6 antibody abolished an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, a major signaling molecule downstream of IL-6, in the transgenic mouse heart and prevented development of cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice. These results demonstrate a promoting role of S1PR1 in cardiac fibroblasts for cardiac remodeling, in which angiotensin II—AT1 and IL-6 are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2744722702,"To determine if a multi-analyte cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) peptide signature can be used to differentiate Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and normal aged controls (NL), and to determine if this signature can also predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, analysis of CSF samples was done on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The profiles of 320 peptides from baseline CSF samples of 287 subjects over a 3–6 year period were analyzed. As expected, the peptide most able to differentiate between AD vs. NL was found to be Apolipoprotein E. Other peptides, some of which are not classically associated with AD, such as heart fatty acid binding protein, and the neuronal pentraxin receptor, also differentiated disease states. A sixteen-analyte signature was identified which differentiated AD vs. NL with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, which was better than any combination of amyloid beta (1–42), tau, and phospho-181 tau. This same signature, when applied to a new and independent data set, also strongly predicted both probability and rate of future progression of MCI subjects to AD, better than traditional markers. These data suggest that multivariate peptide signatures from CSF predict MCI to AD progression, and point to potentially new roles for certain proteins not typically associated with AD."
https://openalex.org/W2742289640,"Background and aim Little is known about population-based epidemiology and disease burden of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, incidence, comorbidity and direct medical cost of AIH in South Korea. Methods The data was from the nationwide, population-based National Health Insurance Service claims database and the Rare Intractable Disease registration program. Age and gender-specific prevalence rates were calculated, and data on comorbidity, diagnostic tests, prescribed drugs, and medical costs were retrieved for patients registered under the disease code K75.4 (AIH) from 2009 to 2013. Results A total of 4,085 patients with AIH were identified between 2009 and 2013 with a female-to-male ratio of 6.4. The age-adjusted prevalence rate was 4.82/100,000 persons and gender adjusted prevalence rates were 8.35 in females and 1.30 in males. The age-adjusted calculated incidence rate was 1.07/100,000 persons (gender-adjusted 1.83 in females and 0.31 in males). Ascites, variceal bleeding, and hepatocellular carcinoma were found in 1.4%, 1.3%, and 2.2% of the patients, respectively. Forty-six patients (1.1%) underwent liver transplantation during the study period. Case-fatality was 2.18%. Corticosteroid and azathioprine were prescribed in 44.1% and 38.0% of prevalent patients with AIH in 2013, respectively. The nationwide total direct medical cost was less than 4.0 million USD, and the average cost for each patient was 1,174 USD in 2013. Conclusion This is the first report on the nationwide epidemiology of AIH in Korea, and it showed a lower prevalence than that of Western countries with considerable disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W2745200634,"Prostate cancer (PCa) becomes a leading cause of death in males nowadays. Recent reports showed that androgen-responsive long non-coding RNAs played important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of PCa. In this study, we focused on a special transcript of GAS5 (ENST00000456293.5, GAS5-007), which was reported as a tumor suppressor. Here, we demonstrated GAS5-007 was reduced by androgen treatment and inhibited by AR. Next, we explored the expression level of GAS, finding the expression of it in PCa tissue was higher than normal tissue in both public databases and human tissue samples. Functional analysis of GAS5 showed it was related to regulating translational elongation, protein biosynthesis, and transcription. Moreover, we observed GAS5-007 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle and promoted cell apoptosis of PCa. We also constructed a GAS5-miRNA network to explain the different roles of different GAS5 transcripts in PCa. This study provides novel insights to identify potential diagnostic biomarker and therapy target for prostate cancer in clinical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2743291168,"To determine if Sa roughness data from measuring one central location of unpolished and polished enamel were representative of the overall surfaces before and after erosion.Twenty human enamel sections (4x4 mm) were embedded in bis-acryl composite and randomised to either a native or polishing enamel preparation protocol. Enamel samples were subjected to an acid challenge (15 minutes 100 mL orange juice, pH 3.2, titratable acidity 41.3mmol OH/L, 62.5 rpm agitation, repeated for three cycles). Median (IQR) surface roughness [Sa] was measured at baseline and after erosion from both a centralised cluster and four peripheral clusters. Within each cluster, five smaller areas (0.04 mm2) provided the Sa roughness data.For both unpolished and polished enamel samples there were no significant differences between measuring one central cluster or four peripheral clusters, before and after erosion. For unpolished enamel the single central cluster had a median (IQR) Sa roughness of 1.45 (2.58) μm and the four peripheral clusters had a median (IQR) of 1.32 (4.86) μm before erosion; after erosion there were statistically significant reductions to 0.38 (0.35) μm and 0.34 (0.49) μm respectively (p<0.0001). Polished enamel had a median (IQR) Sa roughness 0.04 (0.17) μm for the single central cluster and 0.05 (0.15) μm for the four peripheral clusters which statistically significantly increased after erosion to 0.27 (0.08) μm for both (p<0.0001).Measuring one central cluster of unpolished and polished enamel was representative of the overall enamel surface roughness, before and after erosion."
https://openalex.org/W2743738400,"Nature has provided us with a wide spectrum of disease healing phytochemicals like Artonin E, obtained from the root bark of Artocarpus elasticus. This molecule had been predicted to be drug-like, possessing unique medicinal properties. Despite strides made in chemotherapy, prognosis of the heterogenous aggressive triple negative breast cancer is still poor. This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of inhibition of Artonin E, a prenylated flavonoid on MDA-MB 231 triple negative breast cancer cell, with a view of mitigating the hallmarks displayed by these tumors. The anti-proliferative effect, mode of cell death and the mechanism of apoptosis induction were investigated. Artonin E, was seen to effectively relinquish MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells of their apoptosis evading capacity, causing a half-maximal growth inhibition at low concentrations (14.3, 13.9 and 9.8 μM) after the tested time points (24, 48 and 72 hours), respectively. The mode of cell death was observed to be apoptosis with defined characteristics. Artonin E was seen to induce the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic caspases initiators of apoptosis. It also enhanced the release of total reactive oxygen species which polarized the mitochondrial membrane, compounding the release of cytochrome c. Gene expression studies revealed the upregulation of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand and proapoptotic genes with down regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and proteins. A G2/M cell cycle arrest was also observed and was attributed to the observed upregulation of p21 independent of the p53 status. Interestingly, livin, a new member of the inhibitors of apoptosis was confirmed to be significantly repressed. In all, Artonin E showed the potential as a promising candidate to combat the aggressive triple negative breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2744178619,"Introduction Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is one of the major modifiable contributors to antimicrobial resistance. There is currently no validated survey tool available to assess knowledge and confidence of medical students in infectious diseases (ID) compared to other diseases states, and little is known about this topic. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey of final year medical students attending universities around Australia was conducted between August and September, 2015. A survey unique from other published studies was developed to survey satisfaction in education, confidence and knowledge in ID, and how this compared to these factors in cardiovascular diseases. Results Reliability and validity was demonstrated in the survey tool used. Students were more likely to rate university education as sufficient for cardiovascular diseases (91.3%) compared to ID (72.5%), and were more confident in their knowledge of cardiovascular diseases compared to ID (74.38% vs. 53.76%). Students tended to answer more cardiovascular disease related clinical questions correctly (mean score 78%), compared to questions on antimicrobial use (mean score 45%). Conclusions Poor knowledge and confidence amongst final year medical students in Australia were observed in ID. Antimicrobial stewardship agenda should include the provision of additional training in antimicrobial prescribing to the future medical workforce."
https://openalex.org/W2742643627,"The ubiquitination pathway regulates growth, development, and stress responses in plants, and the U-box protein family of ubiquitin ligases has important roles in this pathway. Here, 64 putative U-box proteins were identified in the Medicago truncatula genome. In addition to the conserved U-box motif, other functional domains, such as the ARM, kinase, KAP, and WD40 domains, were also detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the M. truncatula U-box proteins grouped them into six subfamilies, and chromosomal mapping and synteny analyses indicated that tandem and segmental duplications may have contributed to the expansion and evolution of the U-box gene family in this species. Using RNA-seq data from M. truncatula seedlings subjected to three different abiotic stresses, we identified 33 stress-inducible plant U-box genes (MtPUBs). Specifically, 25 salinity-, 15 drought-, and 16 cold-regulated MtPUBs were detected. Among them, MtPUB10, MtPUB17, MtPUB18, MtPUB35, MtPUB42, and MtPUB44 responded to all three stress conditions. Expression profiling by qRT-PCR was consistent with the RNA-seq data, and stress-related elements were identified in the promoter regions. The present findings strongly indicate that U-box proteins play critical roles in abiotic stress response in M. truncatula."
https://openalex.org/W2744310593,"Mass mortality that is acompanied by reddish browning of the soft tissues has been occurring in cultured pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata martensii. The disease is called Akoya oyster disease (AOD). Although spreading pattern of the disease and transmission experiments suggest that the disease is infectious, the causative agent has not yet been identified. We used shotgun and 16S rRNA-based metagenomic analysis to identify genes that are present specifically in affected oysters. The genes found only in diseased oysters were mostly bacterial origin, suggesting that the causative agent was a bacterial pathogen. This hypothesis was supported by the inhibition of AOD development in naïve oysters injected with the hemolymph of diseased animals followed immediately with penicillin bath-administration. Further analyses of the hemolymph and mantle specifically and universally detected genes of bacteria that belong to phylum Spirochaetes in diseased pearl oysters but not in healthy oysters. By in situ hybridization or immunostaining, a Brachyspira-like bacterium was observed in the smears of hemolymph from affected oysters, but not from healthy oysters. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA sequences showed that the presumptive causative bacterium was outside of but most closely related to family Brachyspiraceae. We propose ‘Candidatus Maribrachyspira akoyae’ gen. nov, sp nov., for this bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W2744350770,"The oral cavity is home to unique resident microbial communities whose interactions with host immunity are less frequently studied than those of the intestinal microbiome. We examined the stimulatory capacity and the interactions of two oral bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), on Dendritic Cell (DC) activation, comparing them to the effects of the well-studied intestinal microbe Escherichia coli (E. coli). Unlike F. nucleatum and E. coli, P. gingivalis failed to activate DCs, and in fact silenced DC responses induced by F. nucleatum or E. coli. We identified a variant strain of P. gingivalis (W50) that lacked this immunomodulatory activity. Using biochemical approaches and whole genome sequencing to compare the two substrains, we found a point mutation in the hagA gene. This protein is though to be involved in the alteration of the PorSS/gingipain pathway, which regulates protein secretion into the extracellular environment. A proteomic comparison of the secreted products of the two substrains revealed enzymatic differences corresponding to this phenotype. We found that P. gingivalis secretes gingipain(s) that inactivate several key proinflammatory mediators made by DCs and/or T cells, but spare Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and GM-CSF, which can cause capillary leaks that serve as a source of the heme that P. gingivalis requires for its survival, and GM-CSF, which can cause epithelial-cell growth. Taken together, our results suggest that P. gingivalis has evolved potent mechanisms to modulate its virulence factors and dampen the innate immune response by selectively inactivating most proinflammatory cytokines."

The Coordinated Access to Care from Hospital EDs (CATCH-ED) study examined the effectiveness of a brief case management intervention in reducing ED use and improving health outcomes among frequent ED users with mental health or addiction challenges in a large urban centre. Adults (≥18 years of age) who had five or more ED visits in the past 12-months, with at least one visit for mental health or addictions problems were randomized to either brief case management (N = 83) or usual care (N = 83) and followed for 12 months. The primary outcome of effectiveness was the frequency of ED visits during 12 months after study enrolment. Secondary outcomes included days in hospital, mental health and addiction symptom severity and health-related quality of life, measured by the SF-12. Compared to usual care, CATCH-ED participants saw a 14% reduction in frequency of ED visits during the 12-month post-randomization period [rate ratio (RR) = 0.86, 95% CI 0.64-1.15)], however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. There were also no statistically significant differences between the groups at 12 months in the number of days spent in hospital (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.59-2.29), physical (1.50, 95% CI -2.15-5.15) or mental (-3.97, 95% CI -8.13-0.19) component scores of the SF-12, severity of psychiatric symptoms (-0.41, 95% CI -2.30-1.49), alcohol (0.053 95% -0.017-0.12) or drug (-0.0027, 95% CI -0.0028-0.023) use. Compared to usual care, a brief case management intervention did not result in significantly reduced ED use or improved health outcomes among frequent ED users with mental health or addictions challenges in a large urban centre in Canada. Future studies need to evaluate the availability and accessibility of community-based resources for individuals with frequent ED use."
https://openalex.org/W2744276417,"Legumes participate in two important endosymbiotic associations, with phosphorus-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM, soil fungi) and with nitrogen-fixing bacterial rhizobia. These divergent symbionts share a common symbiotic signal transduction pathway that facilitates the establishment of mycorrhization and nodulation in legumes. However, the unique and shared downstream genes essential for AM and nodule development have not been identified in crop legumes. Here, we used ion torrent next-generation sequencing to perform comparative transcriptomics of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) roots colonized by AM or rhizobia. We analyzed global gene expression profiles to identify unique and shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that regulate these two symbiotic interactions, and quantitatively compared DEG profiles. We identified 3,219 (1,959 upregulated and 1,260 downregulated) and 2,645 (1,247 upregulated and 1,398 downregulated) unigenes that were differentially expressed in response to mycorrhizal or rhizobial colonization, respectively, compared with uninoculated roots. We obtained quantitative expression profiles of unique and shared genes involved in processes related to defense, cell wall structure, N metabolism, and P metabolism in mycorrhized and nodulated roots. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that most genes involved in jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling, N metabolism, and inositol phosphate metabolism are variably expressed during symbiotic interactions. These combined data provide valuable information on symbiotic gene signaling networks that respond to mycorrhizal and rhizobial colonization, and serve as a guide for future genetic strategies to enhance P uptake and N-fixing capacity to increase the net yield of this valuable grain legume."

The glaucomatous eyes were subdivided into three groups according to the severity of visual field defect: a preperimetric glaucoma group, an early glaucoma group, and a moderate to advanced glaucoma group. RNFL, GCL, IPL, and GCIPL thicknesses were measured at the level of the macula by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. For functional evaluation, corresponding mean sensitivity (MS) values were measured using 24-2 standard automated perimetry (SAP).RNFL, GCL, IPL, and GCIPL thicknesses were significantly different among 4 groups (P < .001). Macular structure losses were positively correlated with the MS values of the 24-2 SAP for RNFL, GCL, IPL, and GCIPL (R = 0.553, 0.636, 0.648 and 0.646, respectively, P < .001). In regression analysis, IPL and GCIPL thicknesses showed stronger association with the corresponding MS values of 24-2 SAP compared with RNFL and GCL thicknesses (R2 = 0.420, P < .001 for IPL; R2 = 0.417, P< .001 for GCIPL thickness).Segmented IPL thickness was significantly associated with the degree of glaucoma.

https://openalex.org/W2743457445,"Treatment of patients presenting with possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on timely diagnosis and proper risk stratification aided by biomarkers. We aimed at evaluating the predictive value of GDF-15 in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of AMI.Consecutive patients presenting with suspected AMI were enrolled in three study centers. Cardiovascular events were assessed during a follow-up period of 6 months with a combined endpoint of death or MI.From the 1818 enrolled patients (m/f = 1208/610), 413 (22.7%) had an acute MI and 63 patients reached the combined endpoint. Patients with MI and patients with adverse outcome had higher GDF-15 levels compared with non-MI patients (967.1pg/mL vs. 692.2 pg/L, p<0.001) and with event-free patients (1660 pg/mL vs. 756.6 pg/L, p<0.001). GDF-15 levels were lower in patients with SYNTAX score ≤ 22 (797.3 pg/mL vs. 947.2 pg/L, p = 0.036). Increased GDF-15 levels on admission were associated with a hazard ratio of 2.1 for death or MI (95%CI: 1.67-2.65, p<0.001) in a model adjusted for age and sex and of 1.57 (1.13-2.19, p = 0.008) adjusted for the GRACE score variables. GDF-15 showed a relevant reclassification with regards to the GRACE score with an overall net reclassification index (NRI) of 12.5% and an integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) of 14.56% (p = 0.006).GDF-15 is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events in patients presenting with suspected MI. GDF-15 levels correlate with the severity of CAD and can identify and risk-stratify patients who need coronary revascularization."

The CHA-treatment significantly reduced O2-· production rate, H2O2 content, and membrane permeability of nectarine fruit during storage. The key proteins related the nectarine fruit senescence during storage were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF. Level and enzymatic activity of peroxidase were reduced, while both the protein levels and the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-s-transferase and monodehydroascorbate reductase were enhanced in nectarine fruit treated with CHA. In addition, levels of several pathogen-related proteins were also enhanced by CHA-treatment. Taking together, the present study showed that CHA could influence changes in defense related proteins and reduced oxidative damage in nectarine fruit during postharvest ripening."
https://openalex.org/W2743240072,"Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT for the detection of residual disease after (chemo)radiotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and to evaluate the prognostic value of the FDG-PET/CT findings. Methods Patients with HNSCC who underwent FDG-PET/CT after (chemo)radiotherapy were studied retrospectively. Results 104 FDG-PET/CT-scans were performed at a median of 13.2 weeks post-treatment (5.4–19.0 weeks). The diagnostic performance was time dependent with decreasing sensitivity and slightly increasing specificity over time. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV at 9 months after imaging were 91%, 87%, 77% and 95%, respectively. In a logistic regression model, the odds of a correct FDG-PET/CT increased with 33% every additional week after end of therapy (p = 0.01) and accuracy plateaued after 11 weeks (97%; p<0.001). A complete response on FDG-PET/CT was associated with an overall survival benefit (50.7 versus 10.3 months; p<0.001). Residual disease on FDG-PET/CT increased the risk of death 8-fold (p<0.001). Conclusion FDG-PET/CT is able to detect residual disease after (chemo)radiotherapy, with an optimal time point for scanning between 11–12 weeks after therapy. However, a reevaluation is probably necessary 10–12 months after the FDG-PET/CT to detect late recurrences. In addition, FDG-PET/CT can guide decisions about neck dissection and identifies patients with poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2743322440,"Background Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. As previously reported, the serum thrombomodulin is elevated in diseases associated with endothelial injury. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association of serum thrombomodulin level in different pediatric sepsis syndromes and evaluate the relationship with disease severity and mortality. Methods We prospectively collected cases of sepsis treated in a pediatric intensive care unit from June 2012 to July 2015 at Chang Gung Children’s Hospital in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Clinical characteristics and serum thrombomodulin levels were analyzed. Results Increased serum thrombomodulin levels on days 1 and 3 of the diagnosis of sepsis were found in different pediatric sepsis syndromes. Patients with septic shock had significantly increased serum thrombomodulin levels on days 1 and 3 [day 1: median, 6.9 mU/ml (interquartile range (IQR): 5.8–12.8) and day 3: median, 5.8 mU/ml (IQR: 4.6–10.8)] compared to healthy controls [median, 3.4 mU/ml (IQR: 2.3–4.2)] (p = <0.001 and 0.001, respectively) and those with sepsis [day 1: median, 2.9 mU/ml (IQR: 1.8–4.7) and day 3: median, 3 mU/ml (IQR: 1.5–3.5)] and severe sepsis [day 1: median, 3.3 mU/ml (IQR: 1.3–8.6) and day 3: median, 4.4 mU/ml (IQR: 0.5–6)] (p = <0.001 and 0.001, respectively). There was also a significant positive correlation between serum thrombomodulin level on day 1 and day 1 PRISM-II, PELOD, P-MOD and DIC scores. The patients who died had significantly higher serum thrombomodulin levels on days 1 and 3 [day 1: median, 9.9 mU/ml (IQR: 6.2–15.6) and day 3: median, 10.4 mU/ml (IQR: 9.2–11.7)] than the survivors [day 1; median, 4.4 mU/ml (IQR: 2.2–7.5) and day 3: [median, 3.5 mU/ml (IQR: 1.6–5.7)] (p = 0.046 and 0.012, respectively). Conclusion Increased serum thrombomodulin levels were found in different pediatric sepsis syndromes and correlated with disease severity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2743733500,"Purpose The primary aim of this study is to determine the principal somatic and motor determinants for elite climbers. Methods Twenty climbers were examined [age: 28.5±6.1 years].The runners were divided into two groups based on their climbing level, according to the International Rock Climbing Research Association (IRCRA). Elite climbers represented a 8b-8c Rotpunkt (RP) climbing level (n = 6), and advanced climbers represented an 7c+-8a RP level (n = 14). The following measurements were assessed: height, weight, lean body mass, upper limb length, arm span, and forearm, arm, thigh and calf circumference. The BMI, Rohrer ratio, and Ape Index were also measured. The following motor tests were assessed: a specific test for finger strength, an arm strength test, and a test of muscle endurance (hanging from 2.5 and 4 cm ledges). In addition, pull ups were used to measure muscle resistance to fatigue. Results Elite climbers recorded significantly higher values for finger strength than advanced climbers (129.08 vs. 111.54 kg; t(18) = 2.35, p = 0.03) and arm endurance (33.17 vs. 25.75 pull ups; t(18) = 2.54, p = 0.02). In addition, the calf circumference was significantly lower in elite climbers than that in advanced climbers (34.75 vs. 36.93 cm; t(18) = 3.50, p = 0.003). Conclusion The results suggest that elite climbers have greater finger strength and arm endurance than advanced climbers."
https://openalex.org/W2744230390,"Anticoagulant overdose is associated with major bleeding complications. Rapid coagulation sensing may ensure safe and accurate anticoagulant dosing and reduce bleeding risk. Here, we report the novel use of Laser Speckle Rheology (LSR) for measuring anticoagulation and haemodilution status in whole blood. In the LSR approach, blood from 12 patients and 4 swine was placed in disposable cartridges and time-varying intensity fluctuations of laser speckle patterns were measured to quantify the viscoelastic modulus during clotting. Coagulation parameters, mainly clotting time, clot progression rate (α-angle) and maximum clot stiffness (MA) were derived from the clot viscoelasticity trace and compared with standard Thromboelastography (TEG). To demonstrate the capability for anticoagulation sensing in patients, blood samples from 12 patients treated with warfarin anticoagulant were analyzed. LSR clotting time correlated with prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time (r = 0.57–0.77, p<0.04) and all LSR parameters demonstrated good correlation with TEG (r = 0.61–0.87, p<0.04). To further evaluate the dose-dependent sensitivity of LSR parameters, swine blood was spiked with varying concentrations of heparin, argatroban and rivaroxaban or serially diluted with saline. We observed that anticoagulant treatments prolonged LSR clotting time in a dose-dependent manner that correlated closely with TEG (r = 0.99, p<0.01). LSR angle was unaltered by anticoagulation whereas TEG angle presented dose-dependent diminution likely linked to the mechanical manipulation of the clot. In both LSR and TEG, MA was largely unaffected by anticoagulation, and LSR presented a higher sensitivity to increased haemodilution in comparison to TEG (p<0.01). Our results establish that LSR rapidly and accurately measures the response of various anticoagulants, opening the opportunity for routine anticoagulation monitoring at the point-of-care or for patient self-testing."
https://openalex.org/W2745154467,"An intimate interaction between a pair of amino acids, a tyrosine and glycine on neighboring β-strands, has been previously reported to be important for the structural stability of autotransporters. Here, we show that the conservation of this interacting pair extends to nearly all major families of outer membrane β-barrel proteins, which are thought to have originated through duplication events involving an ancestral ββ hairpin. We analyzed the function of this motif using the prototypical outer membrane protein OmpX. Stopped-flow fluorescence shows that two folding processes occur in the millisecond time regime, the rates of which are reduced in the tyrosine mutant. Folding assays further demonstrate a reduction in the yield of folded protein for the mutant compared to the wild-type, as well as a reduction in thermal stability. Taken together, our data support the idea of an evolutionarily conserved 'folding core' that affects the folding, membrane insertion, and thermal stability of outer membrane protein β-barrels."
https://openalex.org/W2745294951,"It is difficult for learning models to achieve high classification performances with imbalanced data sets, because with imbalanced data sets, when one of the classes is much larger than the others, most machine learning and data mining classifiers are overly influenced by the larger classes and ignore the smaller ones. As a result, the classification algorithms often have poor learning performances due to slow convergence in the smaller classes. To balance such data sets, this paper presents a strategy that involves reducing the sizes of the majority data and generating synthetic samples for the minority data. In the reducing operation, we use the box-and-whisker plot approach to exclude outliers and the Mega-Trend-Diffusion method to find representative data from the majority data. To generate the synthetic samples, we propose a counterintuitive hypothesis to find the distributed shape of the minority data, and then produce samples according to this distribution. Four real datasets were used to examine the performance of the proposed approach. We used paired t-tests to compare the Accuracy, G-mean, and F-measure scores of the proposed data pre-processing (PPDP) method merging in the D3C method (PPDP+D3C) with those of the one-sided selection (OSS), the well-known SMOTEBoost (SB) study, and the normal distribution-based oversampling (NDO) approach, and the proposed data pre-processing (PPDP) method. The results indicate that the classification performance of the proposed approach is better than that of above-mentioned methods."
https://openalex.org/W2744060943,"The perivascular niche is critical for intercellular communication between resident cell types in glioblastoma (GBM), and it plays a vital role in maintaining the glioma stem cell (GSC) microenvironment. It is shown in abundant research that different microvascular patterns exist in GBM; and it can be implied that different microvascular patterns are associated with different pathological structures in the perivascular niche. However, the pathological structure of the perivascular niche is still not clear. Here, we investigated the distribution and biological characteristics of different microvascular pattern niches (MVPNs) in GBM by detecting the expression of CD34, CD133, Nestin, α-SMA, GFAP and CD14 in the perivascular niche using multiple -fluorescence. The four basic microvascular patterns are microvascular sprouting (MS), vascular cluster (VC), vascular garland (VG), and glomeruloid vascular proliferation (GVP). By analyzing the proportion of the area of each marker in four types of formations, the results indicated that the expression of CD34, CD133 and Nestin in MS and VC was significantly lower than that in VG and GVP (P<0.05). Furthermore, the results showed that α-SMA expression different in the MS, VC, VG and GVP (P<0.05). However, the expression of GFAP and CD14 in each type of formation exhibited no significant difference (P>0.05). According to the area distributions of different markers, we mapped four precise simulation diagrams to provide an effective foundation for the accurate simulation of glioblastoma in vitro."

The Nutritional and Health Survey in Taiwan (2010) for 1458 junior high school students was geo-mapped for 30 school environs. Facilities for physical activity (fitness centers, gymnasia and sports stadiums, activity centers and parks), sedentary activities (reading material rental shops (RMRS), internet cafes) and food and beverage outlets (FBOs) were calculated as weighted numbers within 1000m of schools. Multiple linear regressions were used to predict BC variable z-scores. For boys, higher fitness center densities and, for girls, gymnasia and sports stadiums were associated with less abdominal fatness. For girls, body mass index, waist circumference (WC) and triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) were greater when RMRS density was higher as was TSF with internet café density. Where there were no FBOs, boys’ WC and TSF were less with more parks, but girls were shorter and WC more adverse. With greater RMRS density and no FBOs, girls still had increased WC/Hip ratio, and less mid-arm muscle circumference. Boys’ findings were more evident after considering puberty. Physical activity facilities (differently by gender), food and beverage outlets absence for boys and low reading material rental shop density for girls increase the likelihood of healthier body composition."
https://openalex.org/W2742961388,"Hedera helix L. is an important traditional medicinal plant in Europe. The main active components are triterpenoid saponins, but none of the potential enzymes involved in triterpenoid saponins biosynthesis have been discovered and annotated. Here is reported the first study of global transcriptome analyses using the Illumina HiSeq™ 2500 platform for H. helix. In total, over 24 million clean reads were produced and 96,333 unigenes were assembled, with an average length of 1385 nt; more than 79,085 unigenes had at least one significant match to an existing gene model. Differentially Expressed Gene analysis identified 6,222 and 7,012 unigenes which were expressed either higher or lower in leaf samples when compared with roots. After functional annotation and classification, two pathways and 410 unigenes related to triterpenoid saponins biosynthesis were discovered. The accuracy of these de novo sequences was validated by RT-qPCR analysis and a RACE clone. These data will enrich our knowledge of triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis and provide a theoretical foundation for molecular research on H. helix."
https://openalex.org/W2744316099,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. We validated the utility of plasma metabolomics analysis in the clinical diagnosis of acute TBI in a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups of 15 rats each: the CCI group and sham group. Blood samples were obtained from the rats within the first 24 h after TBI injury. GC/MS measurements were performed to evaluate the profile of acute TBI-induced metabolic changes, resulting in the identification of 45 metabolites in plasma. Principal component analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis using hierarchical clustering and univariate/multivariate analyses revealed clear differences in the plasma metabolome between the acute CCI group and the sham group. CCI induced distinctive changes in metabolites including linoleic acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, galactose metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Specifically, the acute CCI group exhibited significant alterations in proline, phosphoric acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, galactose, creatinine, L-valine, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the above 8 metabolites in plasma could be used as the potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of acute TBI. Furthermore, this study is the first time to identify the galactose as a biomarker candidate for acute TBI. This comprehensive metabolic analysis complements target screening for potential diagnostic biomarkers of acute TBI and enhances predictive value for the therapeutic intervention of acute TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2743377893,"Microbes, including viruses, influence type 1 diabetes (T1D) development, but many such influences remain undefined. Previous work on underlying immune mechanisms has focussed on cytokines and T cells. Here, we compared two nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse colonies, NODlow and NODhigh, differing markedly in their cumulative T1D incidence (22% vs. 90% by 30 weeks in females). NODhigh mice harbored more complex intestinal microbiota, including several pathobionts; both colonies harbored segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), thought to suppress T1D. Young NODhigh females had increased B-cell activation in their mesenteric lymph nodes. These phenotypes were transmissible. Co-housing of NODlow with NODhigh mice after weaning did not change T1D development, but T1D incidence was increased in female offspring of co-housed NODlow mice, which were exposed to the NODhigh environment both before and after weaning. These offspring also acquired microbiota and B-cell activation approaching those of NODhigh mice. In NODlow females, the low rate of T1D was unaffected by cyclophosphamide but increased by PD-L1 blockade. Thus, environmental exposures that are innocuous later in life may promote T1D progression if acquired early during immune development, possibly by altering B-cell activation and/or PD-L1 function. Moreover, T1D suppression in NOD mice by SFB may depend on the presence of other microbial influences. The complexity of microbial immune regulation revealed in this murine model may also be relevant to the environmental regulation of human T1D."
https://openalex.org/W2743570968,"Recently, we reported cytoskeleton-associated protein2 (CKAP2) as a possible new prognostic breast cancer marker. However, it has not yet been applied in clinic. Therefore, clinical significance of CKAP2 was evaluated in comparison with that of Ki-67 in a cohort of breast cancer patients, and the expression difference was analyzed in cell cycle-arrested cancer and fibroblast cells.A total of 579 early breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Korea between 2001 and 2005 were accrued. CKAP2-positive cell count (CPCC) and Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67LI) were evaluated by immunohistochemcal staining. The immunocytochemical staining patterns of CKAP2 and Ki-67 were analyzed in HeLa and human fibroblast cells after synchronization by double thymidine block.Although there was a significant correlation (R = 0.754, P < 0.001) between CPCC and Ki-67LI, only CPCC was correlated with DFS in overall population (HR, 2.029; 95% CI, 1.012-4.068; P = 0.046) and HER2-negative luminal subgroup (HR, 3.984; 95% CI, 1.350-11.762; P = 0.012) by multivariate analysis. In immunocytochemical staining, more than 50% of serum-starved or non-mitotic cell phase HeLa cells were positive for Ki-67, in comparison to the low CKAP2-positivity, which might explain the prognostic difference between CPCC and Ki-67LI.The current study showed that CPCC but not Ki-67LI is an independent prognostic indicator in early breast cancer, more specifically in HER2-negative luminal breast cancer. The difference between two markers may be related to the lower background expression of CKAP2 in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2743803155,"Background P53; a tumor suppressor gene has known to have a role in a group of human cancers. Its role in breast cancer; one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, is still controversial. The current study is designed to evaluate the prognostic role of p53 mutation in breast cancer. Methods one hundred and eighty five breast cancer patients were studied in this retrospective study. P53 mutation was detected by accumulation of p53 protein in the patients’ pathology samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the protein. The effect of p53 on the final outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival and compared by log-rank test. Prognostic effects analyzed by cox proportional hazard models. Results while the stage of the disease at presentation was not significantly different between p53 positive and negative patients, those with p53 mutation had a significantly poorer outcome in terms of overall and disease-free survival rates (OS and DFS). In a multivariate analysis hazard ratio of p53 mutation was about 5 and 3.8 for OS and DFS respectively. They also had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse. Conclusion It seems that p53 mutation is an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer. Although larger prospective studies are needed to clarify the importance of such a conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2743954044,"The underlying pathology of arsenic-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown. Few studies have evaluated pathways through thrombosis and inflammation for arsenic-related CVD, especially at low-moderate arsenic exposure levels (<100 μg/L in drinking water). We evaluated the association of chronic low-moderate arsenic exposure, measured as the sum of inorganic and methylated arsenic species in urine (ΣAs), with plasma biomarkers of thrombosis and inflammation in American Indian adults (45-74 years) in the Strong Heart Study. We evaluated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between baseline ΣAs with fibrinogen at three visits (baseline, 1989-91; Visit 2, 1993-95, Visit 3, 1998-99) using mixed models and the associations between baseline ΣAs and Visit 2 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) using linear regression. Median (interquartile range) concentrations of baseline ΣAs and fibrinogen, and Visit 2 hsCRP and PAI-1 were 8.4 (5.1, 14.3) μg/g creatinine, 346 (304, 393) mg/dL, 44 (30, 67) mg/L, and 3.8 (2.0, 7.0) ng/mL, respectively. Comparing the difference between the 75th and the 25th percentile of ΣAs (14.3 vs. 5.1 μg/g creatinine), ΣAs was positively associated with baseline fibrinogen among those with diabetes (adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR): 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07) not associated among those without diabetes (GMR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.02) (p-interaction for diabetes = 0.014), inversely associated with PAI-1 (GMR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), and not associated with hsCRP (GMR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.08). We found no evidence for an association between baseline ΣAs and annual change in fibrinogen over follow-up (p-interaction = 0.28 and 0.12 for diabetes and non-diabetes, respectively). Low-moderate arsenic exposure was positively associated with baseline fibrinogen in participants with diabetes and unexpectedly inversely associated with PAI-1.

https://openalex.org/W2739702187,"Allosteric targeting is progressively gaining ground as a strategy in drug design. Its success, however, depends on our knowledge of the investigated system. In the case of the papain-like cysteine peptidase cathepsin K, a major obstacle in our understanding of allostery is represented by the lack of observable conformational change at the active site. This makes it difficult to understand how binding of effectors at known allosteric sites translates into modified enzyme activity. Herein, we address this issue by a computational approach based on experimental data. We analyze the conformational space of the papain-like family and the positioning of cathepsin K within it using principal component analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. We show that human cathepsin L-like endopeptidases (cathepsins L, K, S and V) adopt similar conformations which are distinct from their non-animal counterparts and other related peptidases. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the conformation of cathepsin K is influenced by known allosteric effectors, chondroitin sulfate and the small molecules NSC13345 and NSC94914. Importantly, all effectors affect the geometry of the active site around sites S1 and S2 that represent the narrowest part of the active site cleft and the major specificity determinant in papain-like endopeptidases. The effectors act by stabilizing pre-existing conformational states according to a two-state model and thereby facilitate or hinder the binding of substrate into the active site, as shown by molecular docking simulations. Comparison with other related enzymes shows that similar conformational variability and, by implication, allostery also exist in other papain-like endopeptidases."
https://openalex.org/W2742910488,"Peripheral blood is an attractive source for the discovery of disease biomarkers. Gene expression profiling of whole blood or its components has been widely conducted for various diseases. However, due to population heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of gene expression, certain biomarkers discovered from blood transcriptome studies could not be replicated in independent studies. In the meantime, it’s also important to know whether a reliable biomarker is shared by several diseases or specific to certain health conditions. We hypothesized that common mechanism of immune response in blood may be shared by different diseases. Under this hypothesis, we surveyed publicly available transcriptome data on infectious and autoimmune diseases derived from peripheral blood. We examined to which extent common gene dys-regulation existed in different diseases. We also investigated whether the commonly dys-regulated genes could serve as reliable biomarkers. First, we found that a limited number of genes are frequently dys-regulated in infectious and autoimmune diseases, from which we selected 10 genes co-dysregulated in viral infections and another set of 10 genes co-dysregulated in bacterial infections. In addition to its ability to distinguish viral infections from bacterial infections, these 20 genes could assist in disease classification and monitoring of treatment effect for several infectious and autoimmune diseases. In some cases, a single gene is sufficient to serve this purpose. It was interesting that dys-regulation of these 20 genes were also observed in other types of diseases including cancer and stroke where certain genes could also serve as biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this set of 20 genes could also be used in continuous monitoring of personal health. The rich information from these commonly dys-regulated genes may find its wide application in clinical practice and personal healthcare. More validation studies and in-depth investigations are warranted in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2743418856,"LiDAR technology has firmly contributed to strengthen the knowledge of habitat structure-wildlife relationships, though there is an evident bias towards flying vertebrates. To bridge this gap, we investigated and compared the performance of LiDAR and field data to model habitat preferences of wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) in a Mediterranean high mountain pine forest (Pinus sylvestris). We recorded nine field and 13 LiDAR variables that were summarized by means of Principal Component Analyses (PCA). We then analyzed wood mouse’s habitat preferences using three different models based on: (i) field PCs predictors, (ii) LiDAR PCs predictors; and (iii) both set of predictors in a combined model, including a variance partitioning analysis. Elevation was also included as a predictor in the three models. Our results indicate that LiDAR derived variables were better predictors than field-based variables. The model combining both data sets slightly improved the predictive power of the model. Field derived variables indicated that wood mouse was positively influenced by the gradient of increasing shrub cover and negatively affected by elevation. Regarding LiDAR data, two LiDAR PCs, i.e. gradients in canopy openness and complexity in forest vertical structure positively influenced wood mouse, although elevation interacted negatively with the complexity in vertical structure, indicating wood mouse’s preferences for plots with lower elevations but with complex forest vertical structure. The combined model was similar to the LiDAR-based model and included the gradient of shrub cover measured in the field. Variance partitioning showed that LiDAR-based variables, together with elevation, were the most important predictors and that part of the variation explained by shrub cover was shared. LiDAR derived variables were good surrogates of environmental characteristics explaining habitat preferences by the wood mouse. Our LiDAR metrics represented structural features of the forest patch, such as the presence and cover of shrubs, as well as other characteristics likely including time since perturbation, food availability and predation risk. Our results suggest that LiDAR is a promising technology for further exploring habitat preferences by small mammal communities."
https://openalex.org/W2744481163,"Aim The main aims of the study were to examine whether human neonates’ responses to communication disturbance modelled by the still-face paradigm were stable and whether their responses were affected by their previous experience with the still-face paradigm. Methods The still face procedure, as a laboratory model of interpersonal stress, was administered repeatedly, twice, to 84 neonates (0 to 4 day olds), with a delay of an average of 1.25 day. Results Frame-by-frame analysis of the frequency and duration of gaze, distressed face, crying, sleeping and sucking behaviours showed that the procedure was stressful to them both times, that is, the still face effect was stable after repeated administration and newborns consistently responded to such nonverbal violation of communication. They averted their gaze, showed distress and cried more during the still-face phase in both the first and the second administration. They also showed a carry-over effect in that they continued to avert their gaze and displayed increased distress and crying in the first reunion period, but their gaze behaviour changed with experience, in the second administration. While in the first administration the babies continued averting their gaze even after the stressful still-face phase was over, this carry-over effect disappeared in the second administration, and the babies significantly increased their gaze following the still-face phase. Conclusion After excluding explanations of fatigue, habituation and random effects, a self-other regulatory model is discussed as a possible explanation for this pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2744874834,"The abundant and widespread Common Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is currently declining across much of Europe due to landscape changes caused by agricultural intensification. The proximate mechanisms causing adverse effects to breeding Starlings are unclear, hampering our ability to implement cost-efficient agri-environmental schemes to restore populations to former levels. This study aimed to show how this central foraging farmland bird uses and selects land cover types in general and how use of foraging habitat changes in relation to distance from the nest. We attached GPS-loggers to 17 breeding Starlings at a Danish dairy cattle farm in 2015 and 2016 and analysed their use of different land cover types as a function of distance intervals from the nest and their relative availability. As expected for a central place forager, Starlings increasingly avoided potential foraging areas with greater distance-to-nest: areas ≥ 500 m were selected > 100 times less frequently than areas within 100 m. On average, Starlings selected the land cover category Grazed most frequently, followed by Short Grass, Bare Ground, Meadow and Winter Crops. Starlings compensated for elevated travel costs by showing increasing habitat selection the further they foraged from the nest. Our results highlight the importance of Grazed foraging habitats close to the nest site of breeding Starlings. The ecological capacity of intensively managed farmlands for insectivorous birds like the Starling is decreasing through conversion of the most strongly selected land cover type (Grazed) to the least selected (Winter Crops) which may be further exacerbated through spatial segregation of foraging and breeding habitats."

Then general functions which embody the factors which the shippers will pay attention to when choosing mode and path are formulated. The general functions contain the congestion cost on road, the capacity constraints of railways and freight stations. Based on the general network and general cost function, a user equilibrium flow assignment model is developed to simulate the flow distribution on the general network under the condition that all shippers choose transportation mode and path independently. Since the model is nonlinear and challenging, we adopt a method that uses tangent lines to constitute envelope curve to linearize it. Finally, a numerical example is presented to test the model and show the method of making quantitative analysis of bulk freight modal shift between road and railway."
https://openalex.org/W2742392495,"Background This study investigated the feasibility of using the precordial surface ECG lead interlead QRS dispersion (IQRSD) in the identification of abnormal ventricular substrate in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Methods Seventy-one consecutive patients were enrolled and reclassified into 4 groups: definite ARVC with epicardial ablation (Group 1), ARVC with ventricular tachycardia (VT, Group 2), idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract VT without ARVC (Group 3), and controls without VT (Group 4). IQRSD was quantified by the angular difference between the reconstruction vectors obtained from the QRS-loop decomposition, based on a principal component analysis (PCA). Electroanatomic mapping and simulated ECGs were used to investigate the relationship between QRS dispersion and abnormal substrate. Results The percentage of the QRS loop area in the Group 1–2 was smaller than the controls (P = 0.01). The IQRSD between V1-V2 could differentiate all VTs from control (P<0.01). Group 1–2 had a greater IQRSD than the Group 3–4 (V4-V5,P = 0.001), and Group 1 had a greater IQRSD than Group 3–4 (V6-Lead I, P<0.001). Both real and simulated data had a positive correlation between the maximal IQRSD (γ = 0.62) and the extent of corresponding abnormal substrate (γ = 0.71, both P<0.001). Conclusions The IQRSD of the surface ECG precordial leads successfully differentiated ARVC from controls, and could be used as a noninvasive marker to identify the abnormal substrate and the status of ARVC patients who can benefit from epicardial ablation."
https://openalex.org/W2742687563,"Left-right asymmetric organ development is critical to establish a proper body plan of vertebrates. In zebrafish, the Kupffer’s vesicle (KV) is a fluid-filled sac which controls asymmetric organ development, and a properly inflated KV lumen by means of fluid influx is a prerequisite for the asymmetric signal transmission. However, little is known about the components that support the paracellular tightness between the KV luminal epithelial cells to sustain hydrostatic pressure during KV lumen expansion. Here, we identified that the claudin5a (cldn5a) is highly expressed at the apical surface of KV epithelial cells and tightly seals the KV lumen. Downregulation of cldn5a in zebrafish showed a failure in organ laterality that resulted from malformed KV. In addition, accelerated fluid influx into KV by combined treatment of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine failed to expand the partially-formed KV lumen in cldn5a morphants. However, malformed KV lumen and defective heart laterality in cldn5a morphants were significantly rescued by exogenous cldn5a mRNA, suggesting that the tightness between the luminal epithelial cells is important for KV lumen formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that cldn5a is required for KV lumen inflation and left-right asymmetric organ development."
https://openalex.org/W2742586835,"The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential of a new noninvasive optical measurement of muscle oxygenation (MOx) to identify shock severity in patients with suspected sepsis.We enrolled 51 adult patients in the emergency department (ED) who presented with possible sepsis using traditional Systematic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria or who triggered a ""Code Sepsis."" Noninvasive MOx measurements were made from the first dorsal interosseous muscles of the hand once potential sepsis/septic shock was identified, as soon as possible after admission to the ED. Shock severity was defined by concurrent systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and serum lactate levels. MOx was also measured in a control group of 17 healthy adults.Mean (± SD) MOx in the healthy control group was 91.0 ± 5.5% (n = 17). Patients with mild, moderate, and severe shock had mean MOx values of 79.4 ± 21.2%, 48.6 ± 28.6%, and 42.2 ± 4.7%, respectively. Mean MOx for the mild and moderate shock severity categories were statistically different from healthy controls and from each other based on two-sample t-tests (p < 0.05).We demonstrate that noninvasive measurement of MOx was associated with clinical assessment of shock severity in suspected severe sepsis or septic shock. The ability of MOx to detect even mild septic shock has meaningful implications for emergency care, where decisions about triage and therapy must be made quickly and accurately. Future longitudinal studies may validate these findings and the value of MOx in monitoring patient status as treatment is administered."
https://openalex.org/W2744598050,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important tropical subsistence crop that is severely affected by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) in East Africa. The disease is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Both have a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA genome with a 5’ covalently-linked viral protein, which functionally resembles the cap structure of mRNA, binds to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) or its analogues, and then enable the translation of viral genomic RNA in host cells. To characterize cassava eIF4Es and their potential role in CBSD tolerance and susceptibility, we cloned five eIF4E transcripts from cassava (accession TMS60444). Sequence analysis indicated that the cassava eIF4E family of proteins consisted of one eIF4E, two eIF(iso)4E, and two divergent copies of novel cap-binding proteins (nCBPs). Our data demonstrated experimentally the coding of these five genes as annotated in the published cassava genome and provided additional evidence for refined annotations. Illumina resequencing data of the five eIF4E genes were analyzed from 14 cassava lines tolerant or susceptible to CBSD. Abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and biallelic variations were observed in the eIF4E genes; however, most of the SNPs were located in the introns and non-coding regions of the exons. Association studies of non-synonymous SNPs revealed no significant association between any SNP of the five eIF4E genes and the tolerance or susceptibility to CBSD. However, two SNPs in two genes were weakly associated with the CBSD responses but had no direct causal-effect relationship. SNPs in an intergenic region upstream of eIF4E_me showed a surprising strong association with CBSD responses. Digital expression profile analysis showed differential expression of different eIF4E genes but no significant difference in gene expression was found between susceptible and tolerant cassava accessions despite the association of the intergenic SNPs with CBSD responses."
https://openalex.org/W2745127313,"Objective To estimate the association between a history of periodontitis (PD) and the risk of incident palindromic rheumatism (PR). Methods Using a nationwide, administrative database, this study identified 4,421 newly-diagnosed PR cases from 2007 to 2012 and randomly selected 44,210 non-PR controls matched (1:10) for sex, age and the year of the index date. After adjusting for comorbid diabetes mellitus, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression analysis to quantify the association between a history of PD and the risk of PR. The influences of the lag time and severity of PD were examined by calculating ORs for subgroups of patients based on the time interval between the last PD-related visit and the index date and PD-related cumulative cost and number of visit. Results This study showed an association between a history of PD and incident PR (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.41–1.61). The association remained significant after variation of PD definitions. The magnitude of the association was greater in those with shorter lag time between the latest date of PD diagnosis and PR index date and those who had a higher number of visits for PD or a greater cumulative cost for PD-related visits. After excluding 569 PR patients who developed rheumatoid arthritis after the index date, we found a consistent time- and dose-dependent association between PD and PR risk. Conclusion This study demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent association between PD exposure and PR risk."
https://openalex.org/W2742800144,"In mammals, acoustic communication plays an important role during social behaviors. Despite their ethological relevance, the mechanisms by which the auditory cortex represents different communication call properties remain elusive. Recent studies have pointed out that communication-sound encoding could be based on discharge patterns of neuronal populations. Following this idea, we investigated whether the activity of local neuronal networks, such as those occurring within individual cortical columns, is sufficient for distinguishing between sounds that differed in their spectro-temporal properties. To accomplish this aim, we analyzed simple pure-tone and complex communication call elicited multi-unit activity (MUA) as well as local field potentials (LFP), and current source density (CSD) waveforms at the single-layer and columnar level from the primary auditory cortex of anesthetized Mongolian gerbils. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis was used to evaluate the degree of ""call-specificity"" in the evoked activity. The results showed that whole laminar profiles segregated 1.8-2.6 times better across calls than single-layer activity. Also, laminar LFP and CSD profiles segregated better than MUA profiles. Significant differences between CSD profiles evoked by different sounds were more pronounced at mid and late latencies in the granular and infragranular layers and these differences were based on the absence and/or presence of current sinks and on sink timing. The stimulus-specific activity patterns observed within cortical columns suggests that the joint activity of local cortical populations (as local as single columns) could indeed be important for encoding sounds that differ in their acoustic attributes."
