https://openalex.org/W2095903180,"The mammalian radiation has corresponded with rapid changes in noncoding regions of the genome, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution in mammals. Here, we track the evolution of promoters and enhancers active in liver across 20 mammalian species from six diverse orders by profiling genomic enrichment of H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation. We report that rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes. Most of the recently evolved enhancers arise from ancestral DNA exaptation, rather than lineage-specific expansions of repeat elements. In contrast, almost all liver promoters are partially or fully conserved across these species. Our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences. These results provide important insight into the functional genetics underpinning mammalian regulatory evolution."

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a neuroanatomical region essential for appetitive and consummatory behaviors, but whether individual neurons within the LH differentially contribute to these interconnected processes is unknown. Here, we show that selective optogenetic stimulation of a molecularly defined subset of LH GABAergic (Vgat-expressing) neurons enhances both appetitive and consummatory behaviors, whereas genetic ablation of these neurons reduced these phenotypes. Furthermore, this targeted LH subpopulation is distinct from cells containing the feeding-related neuropeptides, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and orexin (Orx). Employing in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to record activity dynamics from hundreds of cells, we identified individual LH GABAergic neurons that preferentially encode aspects of either appetitive or consummatory behaviors, but rarely both. These tightly regulated, yet highly intertwined, behavioral processes are thus dissociable at the cellular level.

These tightly regulated, yet highly intertwined, behavioral processes are thus dissociable at the cellular level. Complex, but evolutionary well-conserved, behavioral states, such as those related to feeding, require both precurrent and consummatory responses (Sherrington, 1906Sherrington C.S. The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. CUP Archive, Cambridge1906Google Scholar). These oftentimes sequential reactions, which are historically conceptualized as appetitive and consummatory behaviors (Ball and Balthazart, 2008Ball G.F. Balthazart J.

Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, New York1951Google Scholar), represent highly intertwined processes that are not fully distinguished at the neural level. The lateral hypothalamus (LH), a critical modulator of both appetitive and consummatory processes, is a heterogeneous brain area containing numerous genetically distinct cell populations that utilize various signaling modalities (Berthoud and Münzberg, 2011Berthoud H.-R. Münzberg H. The lateral hypothalamus as integrator of metabolic and environmental needs: from electrical self-stimulation to opto-genetics.Physiol. Behav. 2011; 104: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Gene expression patterns within the LH suggest that individual neurons likely release either inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitters, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate, as well as a host of neuropeptides (Hökfelt et al., 2000Hökfelt T.

Electrical stimulation of the LH, which nonspecifically activates various cell types and processes, evokes voracious consummatory feeding, as well as appetitive reward-related behaviors (Hoebel and Teitelbaum, 1962Hoebel B.G.

Moreover, the activity of LH neurons changes in response to food and associated stimuli (Ono et al., 1981Ono T. Nishino H. Sasaki K. Fukuda M. Muramoto K.

These electrically evoked behaviors and feeding-specific activity patterns were discovered in numerous species of the Kingdom Animalia, from lizards (Molina-Borja and Gómez-Soutullo, 1989Molina-Borja M.

These past findings emphasize the importance and evolutionary conservation of the LH for regulating these survival-oriented behaviors. However, given the heterogeneous cellular composition of the LH (Adamantidis and de Lecea, 2009Adamantidis A. de Lecea L. The hypocretins as sensors for metabolism and arousal.J.

Neurol. 2012; 520: 1831-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), classical electrical stimulation, lesion, or electrophysiological recording studies are unable to determine whether genetically defined cell types, such as LH GABAergic neurons, encode, and regulate precise aspects of appetitive food-seeking and/or consummatory behaviors. Neural circuit tracing and manipulation experiments revealed that optogenetic modulation of LH glutamatergic neurons influences feeding and motivated behavioral responding (Jennings et al., 2013aJennings J.H.

The inhibitory circuit architecture of the lateral hypothalamus orchestrates feeding.Science. 2013; 341: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined if molecularly defined LH neurons that express the gene for the vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat), and thus synthesize and release GABA, selectively promote and encode appetitive and consummatory behaviors. Given that electrical stimulation of the LH produces multiple behavioral responses, including feeding and positive reinforcement (Hoebel and Teitelbaum, 1962Hoebel B.G. Teitelbaum P.

Identical “feeding” and “rewarding” systems in the lateral hypothalamus of rats.Science. 1962; 135: 374-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and that the highest concentration of GABA in the hypothalamus is located within the anterior portions of the LH (Kimura and Kuriyama, 1975Kimura H. Kuriyama K. Distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the rat hypothalamus: functional correlates of GABA wtih activities of appetite controlling mechanisms.J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we first explored the functional role of LH GABAergic neurons in modulating feeding and reward-related behaviors by using optogenetic techniques. Applying established viral procedures (Jennings et al., 2013bJennings J.H. Sparta D.R. Stamatakis A.M. Ung R.L. Pleil K.E. Kash T.L. Stuber G.D. Distinct extended amygdala circuits for divergent motivational states.Nature. 2013; 496: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), we first expressed channelrhodopsin-2 conjugated to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP) selectively in GABAergic neurons located within the anterior and dorsolateral subdivisions of the LH (Figures 1A and 1B ) in Vgat-IRES-Cre mice (Vong et al., 2011Vong L. Ye C. Yang Z. Choi B. Chua Jr., S. Lowell B.B.

Approximately 4 weeks after surgery, we tested whether direct photostimulation of LH GABAergic neurons influenced feeding and reward-related behavioral phenotypes in ad-libitum-fed mice. Photoactivation of these neurons at 20 Hz significantly increased the time spent in a designated food area (Figures 1D and 1E), food consumption (Figure 1F), time spent in a location paired with photostimulation (Figure 1G), and optical self-stimulation behavior (Figure 1H). Next, we tested whether photoinhibition of LH GABAergic neurons disrupted feeding and reward-related behaviors in food-restricted mice. Utilizing similar procedures as described above, we targeted a modified variant (Mattis et al., 2012Mattis J. Tye K.M. Ferenczi E.A. Ramakrishnan C. O’Shea D.J. Prakash R. Gunaydin L.A. Hyun M. Fenno L.E. Gradinaru V. et al.Principles for applying optogenetic tools derived from direct comparative analysis of microbial opsins.Nat.

Photoinhibition of LH GABAergic neurons led to significant reductions in time spent in a designated food area (Figures 1L and 1M), food consumption (Figure 1N), and time spent in a location paired with photoinhibition (Figure 1O). These data indicate that selective optogenetic modulation of neurochemically distinct LH GABAergic neurons (Figures S1C–S1Q) influences both feeding and reward-related phenotypes, supporting the idea that both appetitive and consummatory behavioral processes are represented in the LH by GABAergic neurons.Figure S1Optical Fiber Placements and Discrete Viral Expression for Optogenetic Manipulations, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Fiber placements for LHGABA::ChR2 and corresponding LHGABA::Control mice.(B) Fiber placements for LHGABA::eArch3.0 and corresponding LHGABA::Control mice.(C) A detailed schematic outlining the location of viral (ChR2-eYFP) and optical fiber targeting sites within the dorsolateral subdivisions of the LH.(D) 20x confocal image depicting localized ChR2-eYFP expression in LH GABAergic neurons situated in the dorsolateral and perifornical area (PFA) of the LH.

Scale bars, 20 μm. To expand upon the acute behavioral effects observed from optogenetic manipulations (Figure 1), we investigated if sustained activation of LH GABAergic neurons, over a longer timescale, influenced consumption and work effort to earn a caloric reward. Thus, we virally targeted the Gq-coupled excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD), hM3Dq, to LH GABAergic neurons by injecting the Cre-inducible viral construct, AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), into similar target zones within the LH of Vgat-IRES-Cre mice (LHGABA::hM3Dq; Figures 2A and 2B ; Figures S2A–S2G). The inert molecule, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), selectively binds to hM3Dq and activates neurons through Gq signaling pathways (Alexander et al., 2009Alexander G.M. Rogan S.C. Abbas A.I. Armbruster B.N. Pei Y. Allen J.A. Nonneman R.J. Hartmann J. Moy S.S. Nicolelis M.A. et al.Remote control of neuronal activity in transgenic mice expressing evolved G protein-coupled receptors.Neuron. 2009; 63: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Therefore, to verify CNO-mediated activation in LHGABA::hM3Dq neurons, we performed whole-cell recordings in brain slices and found that the spontaneous firing rate of a subset of LHGABA::hM3Dq neurons significantly increased upon CNO (5 μM) bath application (Figures 2C and 2D). Additionally, we examined whether in vivo stimulation of LH GABAergic neurons, via systemic CNO administration, enhanced the expression of Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, within the LH. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of CNO (1 mg/kg) in LHGABA::hM3Dq mice significantly increased Fos expression in the LH compared to LHGABA::Control mice injected with CNO (Figures 2E–2I). To determine whether DREADD-mediated activation of LH GABAergic neurons affected consummatory behavior, mice were trained in a free-access caloric consumption task (1-hr duration) that permitted the quantification of lick responses at the delivery spout for a palatable caloric liquid reward. Chemogenetic activation of LH GABAergic neurons in LHGABA::hM3Dq mice via CNO (1 mg/kg, i.p.) injection led to a significant increase in the number of lick (consummatory) responses when compared to controls (Figures 2J and 2K). In addition, CNO administration 45 min prior to a 1 hr free-access feeding task (Figure 2L) enhanced food intake in ad-libitum-fed LHGABA::hM3Dq mice (Figure 2M; see the Extended Experimental Procedures).Figure S2LHGABA::hM3Dq Neurons Do Not Overlap with MCH and Orx Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) An additional 10x confocal image from another LHGABA::hM3Dq mouse illustrating localized bilateral hM3Dq-mCherry expression within the LH.

To examine whether chemogenetic activation of LH GABAergic neurons alters work effort exerted to earn a caloric reward, we initially trained mice on a fixed ratio of one (FR1) schedule, where each active nose poke resulted in the delivery of a palatable and calorie-dense liquid. Following stable behavioral responding, on subsequent sessions, LHGABA::hM3Dq and LHGABA::Control mice were either administered saline or CNO (counterbalanced) 45 min prior to progressive ratio 3 (PR3) test sessions, which is an established behavioral assay for measuring an animal’s motivation to obtain caloric rewards (Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, activation of these cells significantly increased lick responses (metrics of consumption; Figures 2N and 2O), but did not alter the number of active nose pokes nor the break point (metrics of motivation; Figures 2P and 2Q). Anecdotally, we observed that LHGABA::hM3Dq mice treated with CNO spent majority of the time licking at the reward receptacle (despite reward delivery being contingent upon nose poke responding), suggesting that bulk chemogenetic activation of these neurons may override optimal behavioral performance by biasing behavior toward aspects of consumption. Taken together, these data indicate that chemogenetic activation of LH GABAergic neurons enhances consummatory behaviors. The LH exclusively houses two separate molecularly defined cell types, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin (Orx) neurons (Elias et al., 1998Elias C.F. Saper C.B. Maratos-Flier E.

Because MCH and Orx are thought to promote aspects of feeding and reward-related behaviors, we next assessed whether Vgat-targeted neurons within the LH coexpress either of these orexigenic neuropeptides. To achieve this, we immunolabeled both peptide-producing neuronal populations in Vgat-IRES-Cre mice that endogenously express eYFP in Vgat+ cells (Vgat-eYFP) and determined whether Orx and/or MCH neurons colocalize with Vgat + cells in the LH. Strikingly, immunostaining for MCH and Orx in Vgat-eYFP (Vgat-IRES-Cre mice crossed to a Ai3 reporter line; Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H.

Although these neuropeptide-producing neurons have been implicated as crucial modulators of feeding, selective activation of Vgat-targeted neurons within the LH does not directly stimulate MCH and Orx cells to produce feeding and reward-related behaviors (Figures S1F–S1Q and S2B–S2G).Figure S3Vgat-Targeted LH Neurons Do Not Colocalize with Either MCH or Orx Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–E) 20x confocal tile images from Vgat::Ai3 mice expressing eYFP in Vgat + neurons with MCH immunolabeled in red display minimal overlap between Vgat-eYFP and MCH within the rostro-caudal (−1.2 to −2.4 mm posterior from bregma) range of the MCH neuronal population.

To characterize these latently infected cells, we studied the integration profile of HIV-1 in viremic progressors, individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, and viremic controllers. Clonally expanded T cells represented the majority of all integrations and increased during therapy. However, none of the 75 expanded T cell clones assayed contained intact virus. In contrast, the cells bearing single integration events decreased in frequency over time on therapy, and the surviving cells were enriched for HIV-1 integration in silent regions of the genome. Finally, there was a strong preference for integration into, or in close proximity to, Alu repeats, which were also enriched in local hotspots for integration. The data indicate that dividing clonally expanded T cells contain defective proviruses and that the replication-competent reservoir is primarily found in CD4+ T cells that remain relatively quiescent."

We show that LH-VTA neurons encode the learned action of seeking a reward, independent of reward availability. In contrast, LH neurons downstream of VTA encode reward-predictive cues and unexpected reward omission. We show that inhibiting the LH-VTA pathway reduces “compulsive” sucrose seeking but not food consumption in hungry mice. We reveal that the LH sends excitatory and inhibitory input onto VTA dopamine (DA) and GABA neurons, and that the GABAergic projection drives feeding-related behavior. Our study overlays information about the type, function, and connectivity of LH neurons and identifies a neural circuit that selectively controls compulsive sugar consumption, without preventing feeding necessary for survival, providing a potential target for therapeutic interventions for compulsive-overeating disorder.

Our study overlays information about the type, function, and connectivity of LH neurons and identifies a neural circuit that selectively controls compulsive sugar consumption, without preventing feeding necessary for survival, providing a potential target for therapeutic interventions for compulsive-overeating disorder. Tremendous heterogeneity exists across lateral hypothalamic (LH) neurons in terms of function and connectivity, and this can be observed by the variety of behaviors related to reward, motivation, and feeding linked with this region. However, little is known about how the LH computes specific aspects of reward processing and how this information is relayed to downstream targets. Electrical stimulation of the LH produces intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (Olds and Milner, 1954Olds J. Milner P.

Psychol. 1954; 47: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), as well as grooming, sexual, and gnawing behaviors (Singh et al., 1996Singh J. Desiraju T. Raju T.R.

LH neurons also fire during both feeding (Burton et al., 1976Burton M.J. Rolls E.T. Mora F.

However, making sense of the remarkable functional heterogeneity observed in the LH has been a major challenge in the field. Although the LH is interconnected with many subcortical regions, we have a poor understanding of how the functional and cellular heterogeneity of the LH is transposed upon these anatomical connections. One LH projection target of interest is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a critical component in reward processing (Wise, 2004Wise R.A. Dopamine, learning and motivation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). The LH-VTA projection was explored in early studies that used electrophysiological recordings combined with antidromic stimulation (Bielajew and Shizgal, 1986Bielajew C. Shizgal P.

It has since been confirmed, using a rabies-virus-mediated tracing approach, that there is monosynaptic input from LH neurons onto dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012Watabe-Uchida M.

The VTA also sends reciprocal projections back to the LH, both directly and indirectly via other regions such as the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and ventral pallidum (Barone et al., 1981Barone F.C. Wayner M.J. Scharoun S.L. Guevara-Aguilar R. Aguilar-Baturoni H.U. Afferent connections to the lateral hypothalamus: a horseradish peroxidase study in the rat.Brain Res.

Although both electrical (Bielajew and Shizgal, 1986Bielajew C. Shizgal P. Evidence implicating descending fibers in self-stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle.J.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 7618-7626Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) stimulation have established a causal role for the LH projection to the VTA in ICSS, several questions remain to be answered. First, what is the neural response of LH-VTA neurons to different aspects of reward-related behaviors? Second, what is the role of the LH-VTA projection in reward seeking under different reinforcement contingencies? Third, what is the overall composition of fast transmission mediated by LH inputs to the VTA, and which VTA cells receive excitatory/inhibitory input? Finally, what do the excitatory and inhibitory components of the LH-VTA pathway each contribute toward orchestrating the pursuit of appetitive reward? To address these questions, we recorded from LH neurons in freely moving mice and used optogenetic-mediated photoidentification to overlay information about the naturally occurring neural computations during reward processing upon information about the connectivity of LH neurons. In addition, we used ex vivo patch-clamp experiments to explore the composition of GABAergic and glutamatergic LH inputs onto both DA and GABA neurons within the VTA. Building on our results from the recordings experiments, we utilized behavioral tasks to establish causal relationships between aspects of both reward seeking and feeding and the activation of distinct subsets of LH-VTA projections. Together, these data help us establish a model for how the components within the LH-VTA loop work together to process reward and how manipulating individual components can have profound effects on behavior. In order to identify LH neurons that provide monosynaptic input to the VTA in vivo and observe their activity during freely moving behaviors, we used a dual-virus strategy to selectively express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in LH neurons providing monosynaptic input to the VTA (Figures 1A and S1). We injected an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV5) carrying ChR2-eYFP in a Cre-recombinase-dependent double-inverted open reading frame (DIO) construct into the LH to infect local somata and injected a retrogradely traveling herpes simplex virus (HSV) carrying Cre-recombinase into the VTA. Subsequent recombination permitted opsin and fluorophore expression selectively in LH neurons providing monosynaptic input to the VTA. To confirm our approach, we performed ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in horizontal brain slices containing the LH and recorded from neurons expressing ChR2-eYFP, as well as neighboring LH neurons that were ChR2-eYFP negative (Figure 1B). Light-evoked spike latencies, measured from light-pulse onset to the peak of the action potential, ranged from 3–8 ms (Figure 1C). We also found that none of the non-expressing (ChR2-negative) cells recorded showed excitatory responses to photostimulation (n = 14; Figure 1C), despite their proximity to ChR2-expressing cells.Figure S1Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full captionChannelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression in VTA-projecting LH neurons was achieved by injection of AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the LH and HSV-EF1α-IRES-Cre-mCherry into the VTA.(A) High-magnification image of ChR2-expressing cell bodies in the LH.(B) Horizontal brain slices were prepared and recordings were made from ChR2-expressing and non-expressing LH neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology.

In order to perform optogenetically mediated photoidentification in vivo, an optrode was implanted into the LH to record neuronal activity during a sucrose-seeking task. In the same recording session, we provided several patterns of photostimulation to identify ChR2-expressing LH-VTA neurons (Figures 1D and S1). We examined the distribution of excitatory photoresponse latencies across all LH neurons displaying a time-locked change in firing rate in response to illumination and observed a bimodal distribution (Figure 1E). We observed a population of neurons during in vivo recordings with latencies in a range of 3–8 ms. This was identical to the latency range found in ChR2-expressing LH-VTA neurons when we recorded ex vivo. We termed these units “Type 1” units (Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F). In addition, there was a distinct population of cells with ∼100 ms photoresponse latencies (Figures 1E and 1G), and we termed these “Type 2” units. We also observed neurons that were inhibited in response to photostimulation of LH-VTA neurons (Figure S2), and we termed these “Type 3” units. We compared the action potential duration (as measured from peak to trough) and mean firing rates of Type 1 and Type 2 units as well as those that did not show a photoresponse (Figure 1H). The distribution of action potential durations of Type 1 (Figure 1I) and Type 2 (Figure 1J) units shows that the majority of Type 1 units have an action potential duration less than 500 μs (84%; n = 16/19, binomial distribution, p = 0.002).Figure S3Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) As a complementary approach to expressing halorhodopsin in the VTA to mediate inhibition, a cannula was implanted above the VTA, and tetrodotoxin (TTX) was infused to inhibit the VTA.(B and C) Type 1 (n = 2/40 units, n = 4 animals) photoresponse properties were unaffected (100%) by the inhibition of the VTA (B), whereas Type 2 (n = 4/40 units, n = 4 animals) photoresponse properties were abolished (100%) by TTX inhibition of the VTA (C).

Inset circles represent the number of units that were photoresponsive during each epoch. Although Type 1 units fit standard criteria to be classified as ChR2 expressing (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y. Haesler S. Vong L. Lowell B.B. Uchida N. Neuron-type-specific signals for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 482: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2013Zhang S.-J. Ye J. Miao C.

Optogenetic dissection of entorhinal-hippocampal functional connectivity.Science. 2013; 340: 1232627Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), it was unclear whether the longer latency photoresponse of Type 2 units was indicative of ChR2-expressing neurons that responded more slowly to photostimulation, or whether this effect was due to network activity. Given that the ChR2-expressing (Type 1) LH neurons project directly to the VTA, one possibility was that Type 2 neurons were receiving feedback from the VTA (Figure 1K). Another possibility was that Type 2 neurons were activated by axon collaterals from Type 1 neurons (Figure 1L). To differentiate between these two possible circuit models, we inhibited the VTA in conjunction with photoidentification in the LH. Based on our circuit models, we would expect distal inhibition to have no effect on the photoresponses of ChR2-expressing LH neurons. However, if photoresponsive, but non-expressing, LH neurons relied on feedback from the VTA to elicit a time-locked response to illumination (Figure 1K), we would expect an attenuation of photoresponses in these neurons upon VTA inhibition. We expressed ChR2 in LH-VTA cells as above, but this time also expressed enhanced halorhodopsin 3.0 (NpHR) in the VTA and implanted an optic fiber in the VTA in addition to the optrode in LH (Figure 2A). We delivered the same blue-light illumination patterns in the LH for all three epochs but also photoinhibited the VTA with yellow light in the second epoch (Figure 2A). The photoresponses of Type 1 units to blue-light illumination in the LH were unaffected by photoinhibition of the VTA, which is consistent with ChR2 expression in Type 1 LH-VTA neurons (Figure 2B). In contrast, the majority of Type 2 units (87%; n = 13/15, binomial distribution, p = 0.004) showed a significant attenuation of photoresponses to blue-light pulses delivered in the LH upon photoinhibition of VTA neurons. The responses of Type 1 and Type 2 units during VTA photoinhibition were significantly different (chi-square = 7.64, p = 0.0057; Figures 2B and 2C). These differences can also be seen in the max Z scores during individual epochs (Figure 2D) and with the yellow-ON epoch normalized to the yellow-OFF epoch (Figure 2E). These data suggest that Type 2 LH neurons receive input (either directly or indirectly) from the VTA (Figure 1K) rather than via local axon collaterals (Figure 1L). Having identified these two distinct types of LH neurons in the LH-VTA loop, we wanted to examine naturally occurring neural activity during a sucrose self-administration task (Figure 3A). Mice were trained to perform nosepoke responses for a cue predicting sucrose delivery at an adjacent port (as in Tye et al., 2008Tye K.M. Stuber G.D. de Ridder B. Bonci A. Janak P.H. Rapid strengthening of thalamo-amygdala synapses mediates cue-reward learning.Nature. 2008; 453: 1253-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To allow us to differentiate neural responses to the nosepoke and the cue, the cue and sucrose were delivered on a partial reinforcement schedule, wherein 50% of nosepokes were paired with a cue and sucrose delivery. Type 1 units showed phasic responses to sucrose port entry, as seen in a representative Type 1 unit (Figure 3B), as well as the population data for all Type 1 units (Figure 3C). The phasic responses of Type 2 units, however, mainly reflected responses to the reward-predictive cue (Figures 3D and 3E). The normalized firing patterns of all recorded neurons (n = 198, divided into Type 1, 2, 3, and non-responsive units) are displayed for each task component: nosepokes paired with the cue, nosepokes in the absence of the cue, and sucrose port entry (Figure 3F). All Type 1 units that showed task-relevant phasic changes in activity (74%; n = 14/19) were either phasically excited or inhibited by sucrose port entry, with a small number also showing phasic inhibition to the reward-predictive cue (Figures 3B, 3C, and 3G). In contrast, Type 2 units were more heterogeneous, with task-responsive neurons encoding the cue selectively (35%), the sucrose port-entry selectively (26%), or both the cue and port entry (12%; Figures 3D, 3E, and 3H). To illustrate the strength of responses of Type 1 and Type 2 units to task-related events, we plotted each cell on a three-dimensional plot according to Z score (Figure 3I). To show the distribution of phasic changes in firing to multiple task-related events on a qualitative level, we plotted the number of cells of each photoresponse type that fell into a given category (Figure 3J). Given the well-defined role of the VTA in reward-prediction error (e.g., the phasic reduction of DA neuron firing in response to the unexpected omission of a reward and the phasic excitation in response to unexpected reward delivery) (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5914) Google Scholar), we investigated whether LH neurons would encode the unexpected omission of a sucrose reward. To do this, we recorded the neural activity of photoresponsive neurons during the same cue-reward task in well-trained animals but randomly omitted 30% of sucrose deliveries following the cue (Figure 4A). The majority of Type 1 units (88%; n = 15/17, binomial distribution, p = 0.001) were insensitive to reward omission (Figures 4B and 4D), whereas a large subset of Type 2 units (67%; n = 12/18) showed a significantly different response to reward-presented and reward-omitted trials (Figures 4C and 4D). We concluded that LH-VTA (Type 1) neurons encoded the action of entering the port, as these port-entry responses were persistent even upon reward omission (Figure 4D), in contrast to Type 2 units (chi-square = 10.9804, p = 0.0009). To determine whether Type 1 responses to port entry were truly encoding the conditioned response (CR), as opposed to general reward-seeking or exploratory behavior, we recorded in untrained mice that had not yet acquired the task. In task-naive mice, we delivered sucrose to the port in the absence of a predictive cue (unpredicted reward delivery) and found that Type 1 units did not show phasic responses to port entry (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4I), consistent with the model that Type 1 neurons encode the CR (Figure 4J). Next, to determine whether Type 2 unit activity is consistent with a reward-prediction error-like response profile, we also recorded these neurons in well-trained animals during unpredicted reward delivery (Figure 4G). We found that a subset of Type 2 units responded to unpredicted sucrose deliveries (50%; Figures 4G–4I). Taken together, subsets of Type 2 units are sensitive to unexpected reward omission (Figures 4C and 4D) and unpredicted reward delivery (Figures 4G–4I), consistent with a reward-prediction error-like response profile. As we have shown above, Type 1 units represent a neural correlate of CR. Importantly, the increase in firing rate begins prior to CR, ramping up until the CR has been completed (Figures 3B, 3C, and 4B). To determine whether activation of the LH-VTA pathway could promote CR, we wanted to test the ability of LH-VTA activation in driving CR in the face of a negative consequence. In wild-type mice, we expressed ChR2-eYFP or eYFP alone in LH cell bodies and implanted an optic fiber over the VTA (Figures 5A and S4). Conversely, to test the role of the LH-VTA pathway in mediating CR or feeding-related behaviors, we bilaterally expressed NpHR-eYFP or eYFP alone in LH cells and implanted an optic fiber above the VTA (Figures 5A and S4).Figure S4Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Injection sites in the LH for AAV5-CaMKIIα-ChR2-eYFP (green), AAV5-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-eYFP (orange), and AAV5-CaMKIIα-eYFP control (gray) in mice used for behavioral tasks in Figure 5.(B and C) High-magnification confocal image showing NpHR-expressing neurons (B) and ChR2-expressing neurons (C) in the LH.(D) Confocal image showing the placement of an optic fiber located above ChR2-expressing terminals within the VTA.(E) High-magnification image of ChR2-expressing fibers in the VTA surrounding TH+ cells.(F) Location of optic fiber tips implanted above the VTA used to illuminate LH terminals.(G) Following completion of the sucrose-seeking task, mice were tested for extinction resistance.

(H) Optical activation of LH terminals in the VTA during extinction showed a trend toward increasing extinction resistance in ChR2-expressing mice (n = 7) compared with eYFP controls (n = 7). (I) Optical inhibition during extinction showed a trend toward decreasing extinction resistance in NpHR-expressing mice (n = 10) compared with eYFP controls (n = 8). (J and K) ChR2-mediated excitation of LH terminals in the VTA had no effect on locomotion (J) or anxiety (K) compared with eYFP controls. (L and M) Similarly, NpHR-mediated inhibition had no effect on locomotion (L) or anxiety (M) compared with eYFP controls. Error bars indicate ± SEM. We designed a Pavlovian conditioning task in which food-deprived mice had to cross a shock grid to retrieve a sucrose reward (Figure 5B). In the first “baseline” epoch (with the shock grid off), we verified that each mouse had acquired the Pavlovian conditioned approach task. In the second (“Shock”) epoch, the shock grid delivered mild foot shocks every second. Finally, in the third epoch (“Shock+Light”), we continued to deliver foot shocks but also illuminated LH terminals in the VTA with blue light (10 Hz) in mice expressing ChR2 and matched eYFP controls and yellow light (constant) for mice expressing NpHR and their eYFP controls (Figure 5B). We observed a significantly higher number of port entries per cue during the Shock+Light epoch and a significantly higher difference score (Shock+Light epoch − Shock-only epoch) in ChR2 mice relative to eYFP mice (Figure 5C and Movie S1). In contrast, photoinhibition of the LH-VTA pathway resulted in a significant reduction in port entries per cue and difference scores in the NpHR mice relative to eYFP mice (Figure 5D and Movie S2)."
https://openalex.org/W1968916032,"Cells must respond sensitively to time-varying inputs in complex signaling environments. To understand how signaling networks process dynamic inputs into gene expression outputs and the role of noise in cellular information processing, we studied the immune pathway NF-κB under periodic cytokine inputs using microfluidic single-cell measurements and stochastic modeling. We find that NF-κB dynamics in fibroblasts synchronize with oscillating TNF signal and become entrained, leading to significantly increased NF-κB oscillation amplitude and mRNA output compared to non-entrained response. Simulations show that intrinsic biochemical noise in individual cells improves NF-κB oscillation and entrainment, whereas cell-to-cell variability in NF-κB natural frequency creates population robustness, together enabling entrainment over a wider range of dynamic inputs. This wide range is confirmed by experiments where entrained cells were measured under all input periods. These results indicate that synergy between oscillation and noise allows cells to achieve efficient gene expression in dynamically changing signaling environments."
https://openalex.org/W2026910668,"Sensory circuits in the dorsal spinal cord integrate and transmit multiple cutaneous sensory modalities including the sense of light touch. Here, we identify a population of excitatory interneurons (INs) in the dorsal horn that are important for transmitting innocuous light touch sensation. These neurons express the ROR alpha (RORα) nuclear orphan receptor and are selectively innervated by cutaneous low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMs). Targeted removal of RORα INs in the dorsal spinal cord leads to a marked reduction in behavioral responsiveness to light touch without affecting responses to noxious and itch stimuli. RORα IN-deficient mice also display a selective deficit in corrective foot movements. This phenotype, together with our demonstration that the RORα INs are innervated by corticospinal and vestibulospinal projection neurons, argues that the RORα INs direct corrective reflex movements by integrating touch information with descending motor commands from the cortex and cerebellum."

https://openalex.org/W2044402968,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are essential for terminating glutamatergic synaptic transmission. They are not only coupled glutamate/Na+/H+/K+ transporters but also function as anion-selective channels. EAAT anion channels regulate neuronal excitability, and gain-of-function mutations in these proteins result in ataxia and epilepsy. We have combined molecular dynamics simulations with fluorescence spectroscopy of the prokaryotic homolog GltPh and patch-clamp recordings of mammalian EAATs to determine how these transporters conduct anions. Whereas outward- and inward-facing GltPh conformations are nonconductive, lateral movement of the glutamate transport domain from intermediate transporter conformations results in formation of an anion-selective conduction pathway. Fluorescence quenching of inserted tryptophan residues indicated the entry of anions into this pathway, and mutations of homologous pore-forming residues had analogous effects on GltPh simulations and EAAT2/EAAT4 measurements of single-channel currents and anion/cation selectivities. These findings provide a mechanistic framework of how neurotransmitter transporters can operate as anion-selective and ligand-gated ion channels."

The HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike trimer, a trimer of gp120 and gp41 subunits, is the only target of neutralizing antibodies. The spike utilizes antibody-evasion strategies, including mutation, glycan shielding, and conformational masking (West et al., 2014West Jr., A.P. Scharf L. Scheid J.F. Klein F. Bjorkman P.J.

Although important, these features are not unique to HIV-1; other viruses employing these strategies elicit IgG antibody responses that provide sterilizing immunity or viral clearance. A potentially unique antibody-evasion strategy for HIV-1 involves hindering IgGs from using both antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) to bind bivalently to spikes (Klein and Bjorkman, 2010Klein J.S.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that a virion’s spike distribution is likely to be relatively static over timescales relevant to neutralization. Taken together, the mechanisms to hinder inter- and intra-spike crosslinking imply that most anti-HIV-1 IgGs bind monovalently to virions. It seems an unlikely coincidence that HIV-1, among the most adept of viruses at evading antibody-mediated neutralization, has an unusually low density of surface envelope spikes with restricted mobility, as well as an unusually high mutation rate. We speculated that HIV-1 evolved a low spike density to hinder bivalent binding by antibodies (Klein and Bjorkman, 2010Klein J.S. Bjorkman P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000908Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and postulated that the combination of predominantly monovalent IgG binding and HIV-1’s rapid mutation rate creates an additional effective antibody evasion strategy (Klein and Bjorkman, 2010Klein J.S. Bjorkman P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000908Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). If the affinity between an IgG Fab and a viral spike is high enough, monovalent IgG binding to a virion should not, in and of itself, hinder or prevent viral neutralization. Thus, affinity-matured anti-Env IgGs raised against a particular strain of virus can effectively neutralize autologous virus (Klein et al., 2013Klein F. Mouquet H. Dosenovic P. Scheid J.F. Scharf L. Nussenzweig M.C. Antibodies in HIV-1 vaccine development and therapy.Science. 2013; 341: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, West et al., 2014West Jr., A.P. Scharf L. Scheid J.F.

Structural insights on the role of antibodies in HIV-1 vaccine and therapy.Cell. 2014; 156: 633-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, upon mutation of an antibody epitope on Env, the low affinity of the monovalent Fab-antigen interaction would result in either complete loss of neutralization or neutralization only at very high concentrations. These concepts are illustrated by comparisons of binding and neutralization for variants of IgG and Fab forms of palivizumab, a neutralizing IgG against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Wu et al., 2005Wu H. Pfarr D.S. Tang Y. An L.L. Patel N.K. Watkins J.D. Huse W.D. Kiener P.A. Young J.F. Ultra-potent antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus: effects of binding kinetics and binding valence on viral neutralization.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 126-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a virus with a high density of Env spikes (Liljeroos et al., 2013Liljeroos L. Krzyzaniak M.A. Helenius A. Butcher S.J. Architecture of respiratory syncytial virus revealed by electron cryotomography.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 11133-11138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Palivizumab Fabs with fast off-rates/low affinities exhibited 2–3 log improvements in neutralization potencies when converted to bivalent IgGs, and the potencies of the IgGs were not affected by mutations that increased the off-rates of their corresponding monovalent Fabs by >100-fold (Wu et al., 2005Wu H. Pfarr D.S. Tang Y. An L.L. Patel N.K. Watkins J.D. Huse W.D. Kiener P.A. Young J.F. Ultra-potent antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus: effects of binding kinetics and binding valence on viral neutralization.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 126-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), illustrating the importance of avidity for IgGs with weak or moderate affinity Fabs. However, high affinity/slow off-rate palivizumab Fabs were equally as potent as their IgG counterparts, which could bind bivalently to RSV through inter-spike crosslinking. In the palivizumab example, binding and neutralization potencies were evaluated for a single strain of virus and antibodies. In the case of HIV-1, we are interested in the effects of mutations in the virus on binding of the same antibody, but the effects of mutation are expected to be similar. Thus, we postulate that avidity effects through bivalent binding can serve as a buffer to dampen the effects of viral mutations on neutralization potencies of IgGs. This line of reasoning suggests that bivalent HIV-1 binders would be optimal for passive prevention or immunotherapy, but because inter-spike distances are not constant, even on a single virion, it is not possible to engineer reagents that could consistently accomplish inter-spike crosslinking. In contrast, reagents that can bind bivalently to a single trimeric spike would function independently of both spike density and distribution (Pace et al., 2013Pace C.S. Song R. Ochsenbauer C. Andrews C.D. Franco D. Yu J. Oren D.A. Seaman M.S. Ho D.D. Bispecific antibodies directed to CD4 domain 2 and HIV envelope exhibit exceptional breadth and picomolar potency against HIV-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13540-13545Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test the idea that intra-spike crosslinking results in increased neutralization potency, we used molecular rulers to map epitopes on virion-bound HIV-1 spikes and created molecules designed to synergize through bivalent interactions within single Env trimers (Figure 1A). We developed methods to produce multiple combinations of Env binders separated by different distances by attaching broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) Fabs to variable-length double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Figures 1B and S1). We chose dsDNA as a linker because its long persistence length (460–500 Å [Bednar et al., 1995Bednar J. Furrer P. Katritch V. Stasiak A.Z. Dubochet J. Stasiak A. Determination of DNA persistence length by cryo-electron microscopy. Separation of the static and dynamic contributions to the apparent persistence length of DNA.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar] compared with ∼30 Å for peptides [Zhou, 2004Zhou H.X. Polymer models of protein stability, folding, and interactions.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2141-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar]) permits its use as a molecular ruler with 3.4 Å/base pair (bp) increments. Here, we show that homo- and hetero-diFabs joined by optimal-length dsDNA bridges can achieve neutralization potency increases of two to three orders of magnitude and provide evidence that the synergy results from intra-spike crosslinking. Upon determining the optimal distances between Env trimer-bound Fabs, we show that it is possible to convert the dsDNA bridge to a protein linker to create a protein-based reagent with similar synergistic properties. These results illustrate the importance of avidity in antibody-pathogen interactions, elucidate mechanisms by which HIV-1 evades the host immune system, and are relevant to the choice of potential protein therapeutics to be delivered to prevent or treat HIV-1 infections. Fabs were modified to contain a free thiol and then conjugated to maleimide-activated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Figure 1B). Different lengths of dsDNA (designed to lack secondary structures [Zadeh et al., 2011Zadeh J.N. Steenberg C.D. Bois J.S. Wolfe B.R. Pierce M.B. Khan A.R. Dirks R.M. Pierce N.A.

Chem. 2011; 32: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar]) (Extended Experimental Procedures and Table S6) were annealed with and ligated to the ssDNA-Fab conjugates to create homo- or hetero-diFabs, in which the two Fabs were the same or different, respectively. Dynamic light scattering confirmed that conjugates with longer DNA bridges were more extended (Figure 2A), supporting the use of dsDNA as a ruler. Inter-Fab distances calculated from dsDNA lengths were regarded as approximate because the DNA linkers included short regions of ssDNA (persistence length 22 Å) (Chi et al., 2013Chi Q. Wang G. Jiang J. The persistence length and length per base of single-stranded DNA obtained from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements using mean field theory.Physica A: Stat. Mech. Appl. 2013; 392: 1072-1079Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to permit orientational flexibility. We first determined the optimal dsDNA linker for a homo-diFab constructed from 3BNC60, a bNAb against the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the gp120 subunit of Env (Scheid et al., 2011Scheid J.F. Mouquet H. Ueberheide B. Diskin R. Klein F. Oliveira T.Y. Pietzsch J. Fenyo D. Abadir A. Velinzon K. et al.Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding.Science. 2011; 333: 1633-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), by evaluating homo-diFabs with different dsDNA lengths using in vitro neutralization assays. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) against HIV-1 strain 6535.3 depended on the dsDNA length, with the most potent homo-diFab containing a bridge of 62 bp (211 Å) (Figures 2B and S2). This length is close to the predicted distance (∼198 Å) between the C termini of adjacent 3BNC60 Fabs bound to the open structure of an HIV-1 trimer (Merk and Subramaniam, 2013Merk A. Subramaniam S. HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein structure.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Figures 3 and S3). Bridge lengths of ∼60 bp also exhibited the best potencies for 3BNC60 homo-diFabs against DU172.17 HIV-1 and for homo-diFabs constructed from VRC01 (Wu et al., 2010Wu X. Yang Z.Y. Li Y. Hogerkorp C.M. Schief W.R. Seaman M.S. Zhou T. Schmidt S.D. Wu L.

The ∼100-fold increased potency of 3BNC60-62bp-3BNC60 compared with 3BNC60 IgG against HIV-1 6535.3 (Figure 2B) suggested synergy resulting from avidity effects due to bivalent binding. The bivalent interaction likely resulted from intra-spike crosslinking rather than inter-spike crosslinking because the latter should not manifest with a sharp length dependence because inter-spike distances are variable within and between virions (Liu et al., 2008Liu J.

https://openalex.org/W2109109653,"Good house construction may reduce the risk of malaria by limiting the entry of mosquito vectors. We assessed how house design may affect mosquito house entry and malaria risk in Uganda.100 households were enrolled in each of three sub-counties: Walukuba, Jinja district; Kihihi, Kanungu district; and Nagongera, Tororo district. CDC light trap collections of mosquitoes were done monthly in all homes. All children aged six months to ten years (n = 878) were followed prospectively for a total of 24 months to measure parasite prevalence every three months and malaria incidence. Homes were classified as modern (cement, wood or metal walls; and tiled or metal roof; and closed eaves) or traditional (all other homes).A total of 113,618 female Anopheles were collected over 6,765 nights. 6,816 routine blood smears were taken of which 1,061 (15.6%) were malaria parasite positive. 2,582 episodes of uncomplicated malaria were diagnosed after 1,569 person years of follow-up, giving an overall incidence of 1.6 episodes per person year at risk. The human biting rate was lower in modern homes than in traditional homes (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.64, p<0.001). The odds of malaria infection were lower in modern homes across all the sub-counties (adjusted odds ratio 0.44, 95%CI 0.30-0.65, p<0.001), while malaria incidence was lower in modern homes in Kihihi (adjusted IRR 0.61, 95%CI 0.40-0.91, p = 0.02) but not in Walukuba or Nagongera.House design is likely to explain some of the heterogeneity of malaria transmission in Uganda and represents a promising target for future interventions, even in highly endemic areas."

https://openalex.org/W2021160410,"Effective silencing by RNA-interference (RNAi) depends on mechanisms that amplify and propagate the silencing signal. In some organisms, small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are amplified from target mRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Both RdRP recruitment and mRNA silencing require Argonaute proteins, which are generally thought to degrade RNAi targets by directly cleaving them. However, in C. elegans, the enzymatic activity of the primary Argonaute, RDE-1, is not required for silencing activity. We show that RDE-1 can instead recruit an endoribonuclease, RDE-8, to target RNA. RDE-8 can cleave RNA in vitro and is needed for the production of 3′ uridylated fragments of target mRNA in vivo. We also find that RDE-8 promotes RdRP activity, thereby ensuring amplification of siRNAs. Together, our findings suggest a model in which RDE-8 cleaves target mRNAs to mediate silencing, while generating 3′ uridylated mRNA fragments to serve as templates for the RdRP-directed amplification of the silencing signal."
https://openalex.org/W1989250499,"Objective To determine factors associated with future falls and/or near falls in people with mild PD. Methods The study included 141 participants with PD. Mean (SD) age and PD-duration were 68 (9.7) and 4 years (3.9), respectively. Their median (q1–q3) UPDRS III score was 13 (8-18). Those >80 years of age, requiring support in standing or unable to understand instructions were excluded. Self-administered questionnaires targeted freezing of gait, turning hesitations, walking difficulties in daily life, fatigue, fear of falling, independence in activities of daily living, dyskinesia, demographics, falls/near falls history, balance problems while dual tasking and pain. Clinical assessments addressed functional balance performance, retropulsion, comfortable gait speed, motor symptoms and cognition. All falls and near falls were subsequently registered in a diary during a six-month period. Risk factors for prospective falls and/or near falls were determined using logistic regression. Results Sixty-three participants (45%) experienced ≥1 fall and/or near fall. Three factors were independent predictors of falls and/or near falls: fear of falling (OR = 1.032, p<0.001) history of near falls (OR = 3.475, p = 0.009) and retropulsion (OR = 2.813, p = 0.035). The strongest contributing factor was fear of falling, followed by a history of near falls and retropulsion. Conclusions Fear of falling seems to be an important issue to address already in mild PD as well as asking about prior near falls."

In the present study, 359 SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers were used for the association mapping of 241 Upland cotton collections. A total of 333 markers, representing 733 polymorphic loci, were detected. The average linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay distances were 8.58 cM (r2 > 0.1) and 5.76 cM (r2 > 0.2). 241 collections were arranged into two subgroups using STRUCTURE software. Mixed linear modeling (MLM) methods (with population structure (Q) and relative kinship matrix (K)) were applied to analyze four phenotypic datasets obtained from four environments (two different locations and two years). Forty-six markers associated with the number of bolls per plant (NB), boll weight (BW), lint percentage (LP), fiber length (FL), fiber strength (FS) and fiber micornaire value (FM) were repeatedly detected in at least two environments. Of 46 associated markers, 32 were identified as new association markers, and 14 had been previously reported in the literature. Nine association markers were near QTLs (at a distance of less than 1-2 LD decay on the reference map) that had been previously described. These results provide new useful markers for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs and new insights for understanding the genetic basis of Upland cotton yields and fiber quality traits at the whole-genome level."

Thus, this study aimed to quantify women's participation in editorial and advisory boards of major dental journals. Gender data on editorial and advisory boards were extracted from major dental journals, which were then categorized by journal specialty focus. The gender of the editor-in-chief and associate editor-in-chief was noted to assess the effect of journal leadership on women's participation in journal boards. For comparison purposes, data were also obtained regarding the percentage of women faculty for each dental specialty.Overall, in the major 69 dental journals, 14.8% of editorial board members were women. An one-way ANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant gender differences between journal specialty categories (p = 0.003) with some dental specialties' journals demonstrating a relatively high participation of women as editorial board members. There was a significant positive correlation for various dental specialties between women's representation in editorial and advisory boards and women in similar dental academic specialties (p = 0.02, r2 = 0.55). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the presence of women in journal editorial leadership and the percentage of women serving as advisory board members (p = 0.03). Our results confirmed that the under-representation of women on dental journal editorial boards was significantly different between dental science specialties. When there were more women in journal editorial leadership positions, there was a higher participation of women as editorial and advisory board members. Journals should increase the numbers of women on editorial boards in order to secure diversity, improve publication quality and recognize women's contribution to dental science."
https://openalex.org/W2026491893,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins are versatile regulators involved in diverse cellular processes in eukaryotes. In plants, the function of G-proteins is primarily associated with ABA signaling. However, the downstream effectors and the molecular mechanisms in the ABA pathway remain largely unknown. In this study, an AGB1 mutant (agb1-2) was found to show enhanced drought tolerance, indicating that AGB1 might negatively regulate drought tolerance in Arabidopsis. Data showed that AGB1 interacted with protein kinase AtMPK6 that was previously shown to phosphorylate AtVIP1, a transcription factor responding to ABA signaling. Our study found that transcript levels of three ABA responsive genes, AtMPK6, AtVIP1 and AtMYB44 (downstream gene of AtVIP1), were significantly up-regulated in agb1-2 lines after ABA or drought treatments. Other ABA-responsive and drought-inducible genes, such as RD29A (downstream gene of AtMYB44), were also up-regulated in agb1-2 lines. Furthermore, overexpression of AtVIP1 resulted in hypersensitivity to ABA at seed germination and seedling stages, and significantly enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic plants. These results suggest that AGB1 was involved in the ABA signaling pathway and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis through down-regulating the AtMPK6, AtVIP1 and AtMYB44 cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2052667409,"Introduction Accessing family planning can reduce a significant proportion of maternal, infant, and childhood deaths. In Ethiopia, use of modern contraceptive methods is low but it is increasing. This study aimed to analyze the trends and determinants of changes in modern contraceptive use over time among young married women in Ethiopia. Methods The study used data from the three Demographic Health Surveys conducted in Ethiopia, in 2000, 2005, and 2011. Young married women age 15–24 years with sample sizes of 2,157 in 2000, 1,904 in 2005, and 2,146 in 2011 were included. Logit-based decomposition analysis technique was used for analysis of factors contributing to the recent changes. STATA 12 was employed for data management and analyses. All calculations presented in this paper were weighted for the sampling probabilities and non-response. Complex sampling procedures were also considered during testing of statistical significance. Results Among young married women, modern contraceptive prevalence increased from 6% in 2000 to 16% in 2005 and to 36% in 2011. The decomposition analysis indicated that 34% of the overall change in modern contraceptive use was due to difference in women’s characteristics. Changes in the composition of young women’s characteristics according to age, educational status, religion, couple concordance on family size, and fertility preference were the major sources of this increase. Two-thirds of the increase in modern contraceptive use was due to difference in coefficients. Most importantly, the increase was due to change in contraceptive use behavior among the rural population (33%) and among Orthodox Christians (16%) and Protestants (4%). Conclusions Modern contraceptive use among young married women has showed a remarkable increase over the last decade in Ethiopia. Programmatic interventions targeting poor, younger (adolescent), illiterate, and Muslim women would help to maintain the increasing trend in modern contraceptive use."
https://openalex.org/W2031242168,"Disuse induces a rapid bone loss in adults; sedentarity is now recognized as a risk factor for osteoporosis. Hypoactivity or confinement also decrease bone mass in adults but their effects are largely unknown and only few animal models have been described. We have used 10 chickens of the rapidly growing strain 857K bred in a large enclosure (FREE group); 10 others were confined in small cages with little space to move around (HYPO group). They were sacrificed at 53 days and femurs and tibias were evaluated by texture analysis, dual energy X-ray densitometry, microcomputed tomography (microCT) and histomorphometry. Hypoactivity had no effect on the length and diameter of the bones. Bone mineral density (BMD), microCT (trabecular bone volume and trabecular microarchitecture) and texture analysis were always found significantly reduced in the animals of the HYPO group. BMD was reduced at both femur and tibia diaphysises; BMD of the metaphysis was significantly reduced in the femur but not in the tibia. An increase in osteoid volume and surfaces was noted in the HYPO group. However, there was no alteration of the mineral phase as the osteoid thickness did not differ from control animals. Bone loss was much more pronounced at the lower femur metaphysis than at the upper metaphysis of the tibia. At the tibia, only microarchitectural changes of trabecular bone could be evidenced. The confined chicken represents a new method for the study of hypodynamia since these animals do not have surgical lesions."

This study aimed to examine whether the residual structure promotes secondary bacterial adhesion. Streptococcus mutans biofilms generated on resin-composite disks in a rotating disc reactor were disinfected completely with 70% isopropyl alcohol, and were again cultured in the same reactor after resupplying with the same bacterial solution. Specimens were subjected to fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy, viable cell counts and PCR-Invader assay in order to observe and quantify secondarily adhered cells. Fluorescence microscopic analysis, particularly after longitudinal cryosectioning, demonstrated stratified patterns of viable cells on the disinfected biofilm structure. Viable cell counts of test specimens were significantly higher than those of controls, and increased according to the amount of residual structure and culture period. Linear regression analysis exhibited a high correlation between viable and total cell counts. It was concluded that disinfected biofilm structures favored secondary bacterial adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1994725874,"In the last decade, the aquatic eddy correlation (EC) technique has proven to be a powerful approach for non-invasive measurements of oxygen fluxes across the sediment water interface. Fundamental to the EC approach is the correlation of turbulent velocity and oxygen concentration fluctuations measured with high frequencies in the same sampling volume. Oxygen concentrations are commonly measured with fast responding electrochemical microsensors. However, due to their own oxygen consumption, electrochemical microsensors are sensitive to changes of the diffusive boundary layer surrounding the probe and thus to changes in the ambient flow velocity. The so-called stirring sensitivity of microsensors constitutes an inherent correlation of flow velocity and oxygen sensing and thus an artificial flux which can confound the benthic flux determination. To assess the artificial flux we measured the correlation between the turbulent flow velocity and the signal of oxygen microsensors in a sealed annular flume without any oxygen sinks and sources. Experiments revealed significant correlations, even for sensors designed to have low stirring sensitivities of ~0.7%. The artificial fluxes depended on ambient flow conditions and, counter intuitively, increased at higher velocities because of the nonlinear contribution of turbulent velocity fluctuations. The measured artificial fluxes ranged from 2 - 70 mmol m-2 d-1 for weak and very strong turbulent flow, respectively. Further, the stirring sensitivity depended on the sensor orientation towards the flow. For a sensor orientation typically used in field studies, the artificial flux could be predicted using a simplified mathematical model. Optical microsensors (optodes) that should not exhibit a stirring sensitivity were tested in parallel and did not show any significant correlation between O2 signals and turbulent flow. In conclusion, EC data obtained with electrochemical sensors can be affected by artificial flux and we recommend using optical microsensors in future EC-studies."
https://openalex.org/W2095121605,"Diaphyseal morphology of long bones, in part, reflects in vivo loads experienced during the lifetime of an individual. The first metatarsal, as a cornerstone structure of the foot, presumably expresses diaphyseal morphology that reflects loading history of the foot during stance phase of gait. Human feet differ substantially from those of other apes in terms of loading histories when comparing the path of the center of pressure during stance phase, which reflects different weight transfer mechanisms. Here we use a novel approach for quantifying continuous thickness and cross-sectional geometric properties of long bones in order to test explicit hypotheses about loading histories and diaphyseal structure of adult chimpanzee, gorilla, and human first metatarsals. For each hallucal metatarsal, 17 cross sections were extracted at regularly-spaced intervals (2.5% length) between 25% and 65% length. Cortical thickness in cross sections was measured in one degree radially-arranged increments, while second moments of area were measured about neutral axes also in one degree radially-arranged increments. Standardized thicknesses and second moments of area were visualized using false color maps, while penalized discriminant analyses were used to evaluate quantitative species differences. Humans systematically exhibit the thinnest diaphyseal cortices, yet the greatest diaphyseal rigidities, particularly in dorsoplantar regions. Shifts in orientation of maximum second moments of area along the diaphysis also distinguish human hallucal metatarsals from those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Diaphyseal structure reflects different loading regimes, often in predictable ways, with human versus non-human differences probably resulting both from the use of arboreal substrates by non-human apes and by differing spatial relationships between hallux position and orientation of the substrate reaction resultant during stance. The novel morphological approach employed in this study offers the potential for transformative insights into form-function relationships in additional long bones, including those of extinct organisms (e.g., fossils)."
https://openalex.org/W2045448209,"Predators have documented post-encounter (density-mediated) effects on prey but their pre-encounter impacts, including behavioural alterations, can be substantial as well. While it is increasingly evident that this “ecology of fear” is important to understand for natural enemy-victim relationships, fear responses of hosts to the threat of infection by a parasite are relatively unknown. We examined larval amphibian (Lithobates pipiens) foraging choices by experimentally manipulating the presence of cues relating to predator (larval odonate) or parasite (the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae) threats. Tadpoles avoided foraging where predator or parasite cues were present; however, they did not treat these as equal hazards. When both threats were simultaneously present, tadpoles strongly preferred to forage under the threat of parasitism compared to predation, likely driven by their relative lethality in our study. Our results indicate that altered spatial use is an important anti-parasite behaviour, and demonstrate that parasite avoidance can affect foraging in a manner similar to predators, warranting greater study of the pre-encounter effects of this enemy type."
https://openalex.org/W2029102330,The relationship between low endothelial shear stress (ESS) and coronary atherosclerosis is well established. ESS assessment so far depended on invasive procedures. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the relationship between ESS and coronary atherosclerosis by using non-invasive coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.A total number of 7 consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease who received CTA and invasive angiography with IVUS analysis were included in this study. CTA examinations were performed using a dual-source scanner. These datasets were used to build a 3D mesh model. CFD calculations were performed using a validated CFD solver. The presence of plaque was assumed if the thickness of the intima-media complex exceeded 0.3 mm in IVUS. Plaque composition was derived by IVUS radiofrequency data analysis.Plaque was present in 32.1% of all analyzed cross-sections. Plaque prevalence was highest in areas of low ESS (49.6%) and high ESS (34.8%). In parts exposed to intermediate-low and intermediate-high ESS few plaques were found (20.0% and 24.0%) (p<0.001). Wall thickness was closely associated with local ESS. Intima-media thickness was 0.43±0.34 mm in low and 0.38±0.32 mm in high ESS segments. It was significantly lower when the arterial wall was exposed to intermediate ESS (0.25±0.18 mm and 0.28 ± 0.20 mm) (p<0.001). Fibrofatty tissue was predominately found in areas exposed to low ESS (p≤0.023).In this study a close association of atherosclerotic plaque distribution and ESS pattern could be demonstrated in-vivo. Adding CFD analysis to coronary CTA offers the possibility to gather morphologic and physiologic data within one non-invasive examination.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are emerging as key effectors of tissue destruction in TB but have not been comprehensively studied in plasma, nor have gender differences been investigated. We measured the plasma concentrations of MMPs in a carefully characterised, prospectively recruited clinical cohort of 380 individuals. The collagenases, MMP-1 and MMP-8, were elevated in plasma of patients with pulmonary TB relative to healthy controls, and MMP-7 (matrilysin) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) were also increased. MMP-8 was TB-specific (p<0.001), not being elevated in symptomatic controls (symptoms suspicious of TB but active disease excluded). Plasma MMP-8 concentrations inversely correlated with body mass index. Plasma MMP-8 concentration was 1.51-fold higher in males than females with TB (p<0.05) and this difference was not due to greater disease severity in men. Gender-specific analysis of MMPs demonstrated consistent increase in MMP-1 and -8 in TB, but MMP-8 was a better discriminator for TB in men. Plasma collagenases are elevated in pulmonary TB and differ between men and women. Gender must be considered in investigation of TB immunopathology and development of novel diagnostic markers."

Alternatively, we connected the femoral artery and vein using the vein graft, whereby we created an AV-loop (n = 27). Vessel loops were embedded in a fibrin filled chamber and blood flow was measured by means of flow probes immediately after surgery (day 0) and 15 days after loop creation. On day 15, animals were sacrificed and angiogenesis was evaluated using μCT and histological analysis. Mean flow increased from 0.5 to 2.4 mL/min and was elevated throughout the cardiac cycle at day 0 in AV-loops whereas, as expected, it remained unchanged in AA-loops. Flow in AV-loops decreased with time, and was at day 15 not different from untreated femoral vessels or AA-loop grafts. Pulsatile flow oscillations were similar in AV-and AA-loops at day 0. The flow amplitude amounted to ~1.3 mL/min which was comparable to values in untreated arteries. Flow amplitude remained constant in AA-loops, whereas it decreased in AV-loops (day 15: 0.4 mL/min). A large number of newly formed vessels were present in AV-loops at day 15 arising from the grafted vein. In marked contrast, angiogenesis originating from the grafted vein was absent in AA-loops. We conclude that exposure to substantially increased flow is required to initiate angiogenesis in grafted veins, whereas selective enhancement of pulsatile flow is unable to do so. This suggests that indeed flow and most likely wall shear stress is decisive to initiate formation of vessels in this hemodynamically driven angiogenesis model."
https://openalex.org/W2118571713,"A fundamental assumption in neuroscience is that brain function is constrained by its structural properties. This motivates the idea that the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the connection profiles of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar connection profiles together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar connection profiles consist of regions that have previously been identified as the ‘rich club’; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments. We show that, while most clusters are clearly delineated, some regions are more difficult to assign. These results indicate that care should be taken when interpreting connectivity-based parcellations obtained using alternative deterministic procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1970990171,"Hip arthroscopy has continued to expand its horizons in treating many conditions other than femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). However, the results of hip arthroscopy are known to be poor if the degree of articular cartilage damage is significant. We wanted to assess, whether the procedure might have a role in the management of young and active patients with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) and whether it should be offered as a treatment modality. 77 consecutive patients with Tönnis grade 2 and 3 osteoarthritis of the hip who had undergone hip arthroscopy were included in the study. Patients' medical notes, plain radiographs and outcome scores (modified Harris hip score (mHHS), non-arthritic hip score (NAHS)) preoperatively and postoperatively at six weeks, six months, one year and annually thereafter, were analysed. 77 patients consisted of 63 men and 14 women with mean follow-up of 2.8 years (2.2 to 4.2) and mean age at surgery of 43 years (19 to 64). The mean preoperative mHHS and NAHS scores were 58 (28 to 87) and 64 (27 to 93) respectively. The mean improvements in both the mHHS and NAHS scores were significant (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001 for mHHS at one and two years, p = 0.002 and p = 0.0003 for NAHS at one and two years, respectively). There were 34 patients (44%) who required a total hip replacement at mean of 18 months (6 to 48) after hip arthroscopy. We conclude that hip arthroscopy improves outcome scores in 56% of patients with severe OA of the hip (Tönnis grade 2 and 3) for at least two years after surgery. We thus consider the procedure to be a reasonable option for patients with hip OA, although success of the procedure will be less than if undertaken for certain other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2037203070,"Dendritic cells play a fundamental role in shaping the immune response to allergens. The events that lead to allergic sensitization or tolerance induction during the interaction of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and dendritic cells are not very well studied. Here, we analyzed the uptake of Bet v 1 and the cross-reactive celery allergen Api g 1 by immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (iMoDCs) of allergic and normal donors. In addition, we characterized the allergen-triggered intracellular signaling and transcriptional events. Uptake kinetics, competitive binding, and internalization pathways of labeled allergens by iMoDCs were visualized by live-cell imaging. Surface-bound IgE was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Allergen- and IgE-induced gene expression of early growth response genes and Th1 and Th2 related cytokines and chemokines were analyzed by real-time PCR. Phosporylation of signaling kinases was analyzed by Western blot. Internalization of Bet v 1 by iMoDCs of both donor groups, likely by receptor-mediated caveolar endocytosis, followed similar kinetics. Bet v 1 outcompeted Api g 1 in cell surface binding and uptake. MoDCs of allergic and healthy donors displayed surface-bound IgE and showed a pronounced upregulation of Th2 cytokine- and NFκB-dependent genes upon non-specific Fcε receptor cross-linking. In contrast to these IgE-mediated responses, Bet v 1-stimulation increased transcript levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 but not of NFκB-related genes in MoDCs of BP allergic donors. Cells of healthy donors were either unresponsive or showed elevated mRNA levels of Th1-promoting chemokines. Moreover, Bet v 1 was able to induce Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK activation in BP allergics but only a slight p38 activation in normal donors. In conclusion, our data indicate that Bet v 1 favors the activation of a Th2 program only in DCs of BP allergic individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2073137467,"Post influenza pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, with mortality rates approaching 60% when bacterial infections are secondary to multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus, in particular community acquired MRSA (cMRSA), has emerged as a leading cause of post influenza pneumonia.Linezolid (LZD) prevents acute lung injury in murine model of post influenza bacterial pneumonia.Mice were infected with HINI strain of influenza and then challenged with cMRSA at day 7, treated with antibiotics (LZD or Vanco) or vehicle 6 hours post bacterial challenge and lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) harvested at 24 hours for bacterial clearance, inflammatory cell influx, cytokine/chemokine analysis and assessment of lung injury.Mice treated with LZD or Vanco had lower bacterial burden in the lung and no systemic dissemination, as compared to the control (no antibiotic) group at 24 hours post bacterial challenge. As compared to animals receiving Vanco, LZD group had significantly lower numbers of neutrophils in the BAL (9×10(3) vs. 2.3×10(4), p < 0.01), which was associated with reduced levels of chemotactic chemokines and inflammatory cytokines KC, MIP-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β in the BAL. Interestingly, LZD treatment also protected mice from lung injury, as assessed by albumin concentration in the BAL post treatment with H1N1 and cMRSA when compared to vanco treatment. Moreover, treatment with LZD was associated with significantly lower levels of PVL toxin in lungs.Linezolid has unique immunomodulatory effects on host inflammatory response and lung injury in a murine model of post-viral cMRSA pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2075063580,"Purpose The lung is one of the most common sites of breast cancer metastasis. While metastatic seeding is often accompanied by a dormancy-promoting mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transitions (MErT), we aimed to determine whether lung epithelial cells can impart this phenotype on aggressive breast cancer cells. Methods Co-culture experiments of normal lung epithelial cell lines (SAEC, NHBE or BEAS-2B) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231) were conducted. Flow cytometry analysis, immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin or Ki-67 and senescence associated beta-galactosidase assays assessed breast cancer cell outgrowth and phenotype. Results Co-culture of the breast cancer cells with the normal lung cells had different effects on the epithelial and mesenchymal carcinoma cells. The epithelial MCF-7 cells were increased in number but still clustered even if in a slightly more mesenchymal-spindle morphology. On the other hand, the mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells survived but did not progressively grow out in co-culture. These aggressive carcinoma cells underwent an epithelial shift as indicated by cuboidal morphology and increased E-cadherin. Disruption of E-cadherin expressed in MDA-MB-231 using shRNA prevented this phenotypic reversion in co-culture. Lung cells limited cancer cell growth kinetics as noted by both (1) some of the cells becoming larger and positive for senescence markers/negative for proliferation marker Ki-67, and (2) Ki-67 positive cells significantly decreasing in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after co-culture. Conclusions Our data indicate that normal lung epithelial cells can drive an epithelial phenotype and suppress the growth kinetics of breast cancer cells coincident with changing their phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2121009567,"In addition to efforts aimed at reducing anthropogenic production of greenhouse gases, geological storage of CO2 is being explored as a strategy to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emission and mitigate climate change. Previous studies of the deep subsurface in North America have not fully considered the potential negative effects of CO2 leakage into shallow drinking water aquifers, especially from a microbiological perspective. A test well in the Newark Rift Basin was utilized in two field experiments to investigate patterns of microbial succession following injection of CO2-saturated water into an isolated aquifer interval, simulating a CO2 leakage scenario. A decrease in pH following injection of CO2 saturated aquifer water was accompanied by mobilization of trace elements (e.g. Fe and Mn), and increased bacterial cell concentrations in the recovered water. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence libraries from samples collected before and after the test well injection were compared to link variability in geochemistry to changes in aquifer microbiology. Significant changes in microbial composition, compared to background conditions, were found following the test well injections, including a decrease in Proteobacteria, and an increased presence of Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and microbial taxa often noted to be associated with iron and sulfate reduction. The concurrence of increased microbial cell concentrations and rapid microbial community succession indicate significant changes in aquifer microbial communities immediately following the experimental CO2 leakage event. Samples collected one year post-injection were similar in cell number to the original background condition and community composition, although not identical, began to revert toward the pre-injection condition, indicating microbial resilience following a leakage disturbance. This study provides a first glimpse into the in situ successional response of microbial communities to CO2 leakage after subsurface injection in the Newark Basin and the potential microbiological impact of CO2 leakage on drinking water resources."
https://openalex.org/W2040842830,"Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) induced in F344 rats by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) demonstrate considerable phenotypic similarity to human oral cancers. Gene expression studies (microarray and PCR) were coupled with methylation analysis of selected genes to identify molecular markers of carcinogenesis in this model and potential biochemical and molecular targets for oral cancer chemoprevention. Microarray analysis of 11 pairs of OSCC and site-matched phenotypically normal oral tissues from 4-NQO-treated rats identified more than 3500 differentially expressed genes; 1735 genes were up-regulated in rat OSCC versus non-malignant tissues, while 1803 genes were down-regulated. In addition to several genes involved in normal digestion, genes demonstrating the largest fold increases in expression in 4-NQO-induced OSCC include three lipocalins (VEGP1, VEGP2, LCN2) and three chemokines (CCL, CXCL2, CXCL3); both classes are potentially druggable targets for oral cancer chemoprevention and/or therapy. Down-regulated genes in 4-NQO-induced OSCC include numerous keratins and keratin-associated proteins, suggesting that alterations in keratin expression profiles may provide a useful biomarker of oral cancer in F344 rats treated with 4-NQO. Confirming and extending our previous results, PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2) and several cyclooxygenase-related genes were significantly up-regulated in 4-NQO-induced oral cancers; up-regulation of PTGS2 was associated with promoter hypomethylation. Rat OSCC also demonstrated increased methylation of the first exon of APC2; the increased methylation was correlated with down-regulation of this tumor suppressor gene. Overexpression of pro-inflammatory chemokines, hypomethylation of PTGS2, and hypermethylation of APC2 may be causally linked to the etiology of oral cancer in this model."
https://openalex.org/W1983441116,"Stroma mediated wound healing signals may share similarities with the ones produced by tumor’s microenvironment and their modulation may impact tumor response to the various anti-cancer treatments including radiation therapy. Therefore we conducted this study, to assess the crosstalk between stromal and carcinoma cells in response to radiotherapy by genetic modulation of the stroma and irradiation. We found that fibroblasts irrespective of their RhoB status do not modulate intrinsic radiosensitivity of TC-1 but produce diffusible factors able to modify tumor cell fate. Then we found that Wt and RhoB deficient fibroblasts stimulated TC-1 migration through distinct mechanisms which are TGF-β1 and MMP-mediated respectively. Lastly, we found that simultaneous irradiation of fibroblasts and TC-1 abrogated the pro-migratory phenotype by repression of TGF-β and MMP secretion. This last result is highly relevant to the clinical situation and suggests that conversely to, the current view; irradiated stroma would not enhance carcinoma migration and could be manipulated to promote anti-tumor immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1974362100,"Using RT-PCR and RACE-PCR strategies, we cloned and identified a new chemosensory protein (FoccCSP) from the Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, a species for which no chemosensory protein (CSP) has yet been identified. The FoccCSP gene contains a 387 bp open-reading frame encoding a putative protein of 128 amino acids with a molecular weight of 14.51 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.41. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal peptide of 19 amino acid residues at the N-terminus, as well as the typical four-cysteine signature found in other insect CSPs. As FoccCSP is from a different order of insect than other known CSPs, the GenBank FoccCSP homolog showed only 31-50% sequence identity with them. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed and revealed that FoccCSP is in a group with CSPs from Homopteran insects (e.g., AgosCSP4, AgosCSP10, ApisCSP, and NlugCSP9), suggesting that these genes likely developed from a common ancestral gene. The FoccCSP gene expression profile of different tissues and development stages was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The results of this analysis revealed this gene is predominantly expressed in the antennae and also highly expressed in the first instar nymph, suggesting a function for FoccCSP in olfactory reception and in particular life activities during the first instar nymph stage. We expressed recombinant FoccCSP protein in a prokaryotic expression system and purified FoccCSP protein by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA-Sepharose column. Using N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (1-NPN) as a fluorescent probe in fluorescence-based competitive binding assay, we determined the binding affinities of 19 volatile substances for FoccCSP protein. This analysis revealed that anisic aldehyde, geraniol and methyl salicylate have high binding affinities for FoccCSP, with KD values of 10.50, 15.35 and 35.24 μM, respectively. Thus, our study indicates that FoccCSP may play an important role in regulating the development of the first instar nymph and mediate F. occidentalis host recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1978776078,"The present study sought to evaluate the functional role of osteocyte-derived IGF-I in the bone repletion process by determining whether deficient expression of Igf1 in osteocytes would impair the bone repletion response to one week of dietary calcium repletion after two weeks of dietary calcium deprivation. As expected, the two-week dietary calcium depletion led to hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increases in bone resorption and bone loss in both Igf1 osteocyte conditional knockout (cKO) mutants and WT control mice. Thus, conditional disruption of Igf1 in osteocytes did not impair the calcium depletion-induced bone resorption. After one week of calcium repletion, both cKO mutants and WT littermates showed an increase in endosteal bone formation attended by the reduction in osteoclast number, indicating that deficient Igf1 expression in osteocytes also did not have deleterious effects on the bone repletion response. The lack of an effect of deficient osteocyte-derived IGF-I expression on bone repletion is unexpected since previous studies show that these Igf1 osteocyte cKO mice exhibited impaired developmental growth and displayed complete resistance to bone anabolic effects of loading. These studies suggest that there is a dichotomy between the mechanisms necessary for anabolic responses to mechanical loading and the regulatory hormonal and anabolic skeletal repletion following low dietary calcium challenge. In conclusion, to our knowledge this study has demonstrated for the first time that osteocyte-derived IGF-I, which is essential for anabolic bone response to mechanical loading, is not a key regulatory factor for bone repletion after a low calcium challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2045116490,"Background Patients with celiac disease (CD), characterized histologically by villous atrophy (VA) of the small intestine, have an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF), risks that persist for years after commencing the gluten-free diet. It is unknown whether persistent VA on follow-up biopsy, rather than mucosal healing, affects the risk of IHD or AF. Methods We identified patients with histologic evidence of CD diagnosed at all 28 pathology departments in Sweden. Among patients who underwent a follow-up small intestinal biopsy, we compared patients with persistent VA to those who showed histologic improvement, with regard to the development of IHD (angina pectoris or myocardial infarction) or AF. Results Among patients with CD and a follow-up biopsy (n = 7,440), the median age at follow-up biopsy was 25 years, with 1,063 (14%) patients who were ≥60 years at the time of follow-up biopsy. Some 196 patients developed IHD and 205 patients developed AF. After adjusting for age, gender, duration of CD, calendar period, and educational attainment, there was no significant effect of persistent VA on IHD (adjusted HR 0.97; 95%CI 0.73–1.30). Adjusting for diabetes had a negligible effect (adjusted HR 0.98; 95%CI 0.73–1.31). There was no significant association between persistent VA and the risk of AF (adjusted HR 0.98; 95%CI 0.74–1.30). Conclusions In this population-based study of patients with CD, persistent VA on follow-up biopsy was not associated with an increased risk of IHD or AF. Failed mucosal healing does not influence the risk of these cardiac events."
https://openalex.org/W2012103564,"Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are small worms whose ecological behaviour consists to invade, kill insects and feed on their cadavers thanks to a species-specific symbiotic bacterium belonging to any of the genera Xenorhabdus or Photorhabdus hosted in the gastro-intestinal tract of EPNs. The symbiont provides a number of biological functions that are essential for its EPN host including the production of entomotoxins, of enzymes able to degrade the insect constitutive macromolecules and of antimicrobial compounds able to prevent the growth of competitors in the insect cadaver. The question addressed in this study was to investigate whether a mammalian pathogen taxonomically related to Xenorhabdus was able to substitute for or “hijack” the symbiotic relationship associating Xenorhabdus and Steinernema EPNs. To deal with this question, a laboratory experimental model was developed consisting in Galleria mellonella insect larvae, Steinernema EPNs with or without their natural Xenorhabdus symbiont and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis brought artificially either in the gut of EPNs or in the haemocoel of the insect larva prior to infection. The developed model demonstrated the capacity of EPNs to act as an efficient reservoir ensuring exponential multiplication, maintenance and dissemination of Y. pseudotuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2040126795,"The observation could be used to reduce the model uncertainties with data assimilation. If the observation cannot cover the whole model area due to spatial availability or instrument ability, how to do data assimilation at locations not covered by observation? Two commonly used strategies were firstly described: One is covariance localization (CL); the other is observation localization (OL). Compared with CL, OL is easy to parallelize and more efficient for large-scale analysis. This paper evaluated OL in soil moisture profile characterizations, in which the geostatistical semivariogram was used to fit the spatial correlated characteristics of synthetic L-Band microwave brightness temperature measurement. The fitted semivariogram model and the local ensemble transform Kalman filter algorithm are combined together to weight and assimilate the observations within a local region surrounding the grid cell of land surface model to be analyzed. Six scenarios were compared: 1_Obs with one nearest observation assimilated, 5_Obs with no more than five nearest local observations assimilated, and 9_Obs with no more than nine nearest local observations assimilated. The scenarios with no more than 16, 25, and 36 local observations were also compared. From the results we can conclude that more local observations involved in assimilation will improve estimations with an upper bound of 9 observations in this case. This study demonstrates the potentials of geostatistical correlation representation in OL to improve data assimilation of catchment scale soil moisture using synthetic L-band microwave brightness temperature, which cannot cover the study area fully in space due to vegetation effects."
https://openalex.org/W2108789507,"Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) is a lens-specific water channel that also forms membrane junctions. Reconstitution of AQP0 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and E. coli polar lipids (EPL) yielded well-ordered, double-layered two-dimensional (2D) crystals that allowed electron crystallographic structure determination of the AQP0-mediated membrane junction. The interacting tetramers in the two crystalline layers are exactly in register, resulting in crystals with p422 symmetry. The high-resolution density maps also allowed modeling of the annular lipids surrounding the tetramers. Comparison of the DMPC and EPL bilayers suggested that the lipid head groups do not play an important role in the interaction of annular lipids with AQP0. We now reconstituted AQP0 with the anionic lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), which yielded a mixture of 2D crystals with different symmetries. The different crystal symmetries result from shifts between the two crystalline layers, suggesting that the negatively charged PG head group destabilizes the interaction between the extracellular AQP0 surfaces. Reconstitution of AQP0 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS), another anionic lipid, yielded crystals that had the usual p422 symmetry, but the crystals showed a pH-dependent tendency to stack through their cytoplasmic surfaces. Finally, AQP0 failed to reconstitute into membranes that were composed of more than 40% dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid (DMPA). Hence, although DMPG, DMPS, and DMPA are all negatively charged lipids, they have very different effects on AQP0 2D crystals, illustrating the importance of the specific lipid head group chemistry beyond its mere charge."
https://openalex.org/W1977281689,"Degeneration of retinal neurons is an underlying cause of several major types of blinding diseases, and effective therapies remain to be developed. The suppositive strategy of repopulating a degenerative retina with new cells generated onsite faces serious challenges, because the mammalian retina seems to lack the ability to regenerate itself or replace its lost neurons. We investigated the possibility of using a transcriptional factor with proneural activities to reprogram ocular tissue with regenerative capability to give rise to retinal cells. Transgenic mice were generated with DNA constructs that targeted the expression in the retinal pigment epithelium of proneural gene neurogenin1 from the promoter of Bestrophin1, or neurogenin3 from RPE65 promoter. Here we report the presence of ectopic retina-like tissue in some of the transgenic mice, young and aged. The ectopic retina-like tissue contained cells positive for photoreceptor proteins Crx, recoverin, red opsin, and rhodopsin, and cells positive for proteins that label other types of retinal neurons, including AP2α and Pax6 for amacrine cells, Otx2 for bipolar cells, and Brn3A for ganglion cells. The retina-like tissue often co-existed with darkly pigmented tissue positive for RPE proteins: cytokeratin 18, Otx2, and RPE65. The ectopic retina-like tissue was detected in the subretinal space, including two retinae co-existing in the same eye, and/or in the optic nerve or in the vicinity of the optic nerve head. On rare occasions, it was detected in the choroid and in the vicinity of the ciliary body. The presence of ectopic retina-like tissue in the transgenic mouse supports the possibility of inducing retinal regeneration in the mammalian eyes through gene-directed reprograming."
https://openalex.org/W2134029939,"Through a series of common garden experiments, it has been shown that heritable phenotypic differences between individual trees can affect arthropod communities. However, field studies under heterogeneous environmental conditions remain rare. In the present study, we investigated the genetic constitution of 121 mature oak host trees at different trophic levels from 10 sites across Bavaria, southern Germany and their associated insect communities. A total of 23,576 individuals representing 395 species of beetles and true bugs were evaluated. In particular, we determined whether the composition of arthropod communities is related to the oak genotype and whether the strength of the relationships decreases from lower to higher trophic levels, such as for phytophagous, xylophagous, zoophagous, and mycetophagous species. The genetic differentiation of oaks was assessed using eight microsatellite markers. We found no significant influence of the oak genotype on neither the full beetle and true bug community nor on any of the analyzed trophic guilds. In contrast, the community composition of the insects was highly related to the space and climate, such that the community similarity decreased with increases in spatial distance and climatic differences. The relationship with space and climate was much stronger in beetles than in true bugs, particularly in mycetophagous species. Our results suggest that spatial processes override the genetic effects of the host plant in structuring arthropod communities on oak trees. Because we used neutral markers, we cannot exclude the possibility that trait-specific markers may reveal a genetic imprint of the foundation tree species on the composition of the arthropod community. However, based on the strength of the spatial patterns in our data set, we assume that genetic differences among oaks are less important in the structuring of arthropod communities. Future whole-genome studies are required to draw a final conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2067614220,"Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are two classes of antiviral drugs available for the chemoprophylaxis and treatment of influenza infections. To determine the frequency of drug resistance in influenza A/H3N2 viruses in Singapore, large-scale sequencing of neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein (MP) genes was performed directly without initial culture amplification. 241 laboratory-confirmed influenza A/H3N2 clinical samples, collected between May 2009 and November 2013 were included. In total, 229 NA (95%) and 241 MP (100%) complete sequences were obtained. Drug resistance mutations in the NA and MP genes were interpreted according to published studies. For the NAIs, a visual inspection of the aligned NA sequences revealed no known drug resistant genotypes (DRGs). For the adamantanes, the well-recognised S31N DRG was identified in all 241 MP genes. In addition, there was an increasing number of viruses carrying the combination of D93G+Y155F+D251V (since May 2013) or D93G (since March 2011) mutations in the NA gene. However, in-vitro NAI testing indicated that neither D93G+Y155F+D251V nor D93G alone conferred any changes in NAI susceptibility. Lastly, an I222T mutation in the NA gene that has previously been reported to cause oseltamivir-resistance in influenza A/H1N1/2009, B, and A/H5N1, was detected from a treatment-naïve patient.

https://openalex.org/W2054864916,"While most breast cancers are thought to arise from the luminal layer of the breast tissue, it remains unclear which specific cells in the luminal layer are the cells of origin of breast cancer. We have previously reported that WAP-positive luminal epithelial cells are at increased susceptibility to tumor initiation by ErbB2 compared to the bulk population, while the mammary cells with canonical Wnt signaling activity fail to evolve into tumors upon ErbB2 activation. Here, we used retrovirus to introduce ErbB2 into the Krt6a-positive mammary progenitor subset of the luminal epithelium and, for comparison, into the mammary luminal epithelium indiscriminately. Tumors developed from both groups of cells with a similar latency. These data indicate that the Krt6a-positive subset of mammary epithelial cells can be induced to form cancer by ErbB2 but it is not more susceptible to tumorigenesis initiated by ErbB2 than the bulk population of the luminal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1971791059,"Background and Objectives The emerging science demonstrates various health benefits associated with infant male circumcision and adult male circumcision; yet rates are declining in the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that healthcare providers present evidence-based risk and benefit information for infant male circumcision to parent(s) and guardian(s). The purpose of this study was to assess providers’ level of infant male circumcision knowledge and to identify the associated characteristics. Methods An online survey was administered to healthcare providers in the family medicine, obstetrics, and pediatrics medical specialties at an urban academic health center. To assess infant male circumcision knowledge, a 17 point summary score was constructed to identify level of provider knowledge within the survey. Results Ninety-two providers completed the survey. Providers scored high for the following knowledge items: adverse event rates, protects against phimosis and urinary tract infections, and does not prevent hypospadias. Providers scored lower for items related to more recent research: protection against cervical cancer, genital ulcer disease, bacterial vaginosis, and reduction in HIV acquisition. Two models were constructed looking at (1) overall knowledge about male circumcision, and (2) knowledge about male circumcision reduction in HIV acquisition. Pediatricians demonstrated greater overall infant male circumcision knowledge, while obstetricians exhibited significantly greater knowledge for the HIV acquisition item. Conclusion Providers’ knowledge levels regarding the risks and benefits of infant male circumcision are highly variable, indicating the need for system-based educational interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2004817903,"Various gaps in the surface of the supersonic aircraft have a significant effect on airflows. In order to predict the effects of attack angle, Mach number and width-to-depth ratio of gap on the local aerodynamic heating environment of supersonic flow, two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the finite volume method, where convective flux of space term adopts the Roe format, and discretization of time term is achieved by 5-step Runge-Kutta algorithm. The numerical results reveal that the heat flux ratio is U-shaped distribution on the gap wall and maximum at the windward corner of the gap. The heat flux ratio decreases as the gap depth and Mach number increase, however, it increases as the attack angle increases. In addition, it is important to find that chamfer in the windward corner can effectively reduce gap effect coefficient. The study will be helpful for the design of the thermal protection system in reentry vehicles."
