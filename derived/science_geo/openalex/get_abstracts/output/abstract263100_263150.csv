This presents an interesting challenge for the biosynthesis of backbone cyclized (circular) proteins, which are encoded as part of precursor proteins and require post-translational peptide bond formation to reach their mature form. The largest family of circular proteins are the plant-produced cyclotides; extremely stable proteins with applications as bioengineering scaffolds. Little is known about the mechanism by which they are cyclized in vivo but a highly conserved Asn (occasionally Asp) residue at the C terminus of the cyclotide domain suggests that an enzyme with specificity for Asn (asparaginyl endopeptidase; AEP) is involved in the process. Nicotiana benthamiana does not endogenously produce circular proteins but when cDNA encoding the precursor of the cyclotide kalata B1 was transiently expressed in the plants they produced the cyclotide, together with linear forms not commonly observed in cyclotide-containing plants. Observation of these species over time showed that in vivo asparaginyl bond hydrolysis is necessary for cyclization. When AEP activity was suppressed, either by decreasing AEP gene expression or using a specific inhibitor, the amount of cyclic cyclotide in the plants was reduced compared with controls and was accompanied by the accumulation of extended linear species. These results suggest that an AEP is responsible for catalyzing both peptide bond cleavage and ligation of cyclotides in a single processing event.

The largest family of circular proteins are the cyclotides, which combine a cyclic backbone with a cystine knot arrangement of three disulfide bonds.

Cyclotides are resistant to thermal and biochemical extremes, treatment with endoproteases and, because of the absence of termini, exoproteases (3Colgrave M.L. Craik D.J.

In precursors that contain multiple cyclotide domains each one is preceded by a repeated portion of the proregion (∼20 residues) that has been designated the N-terminal repeat (NTR) (13Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The sequence identity of the NTR between species is low but the motif appears to be a structurally conserved helix (15Dutton J.L. Renda R.F. Waine C. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Jennings C.V.

Fig. 1 shows the general organization of cyclotide precursor proteins and an expanded portion of the specific precursor that encodes kalata B1, designated Oak1 (for O. affinis kalata B1). Although the residues preceding the cyclotide domain are not highly conserved, an Asn (occasionally Asp) residue is located at the C terminus of the cyclotide domain across all precursor clones. The position of the Asn residue suggests that it is critical for processing, and possibly cyclization, of the cyclotide domain. Intein-based mechanisms have been used to cyclize cyclotides (16Kimura R.H. Tran A.-T. Camarero J.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but the residues at the termini of the cyclotide domain are not reminiscent of those required for in vivo intein splicing, suggesting that an enzymatic mechanism is probably involved. Asparaginyl endopeptidases specifically cleave peptide bonds C-terminal to Asn and, less efficiently, after Asp and are widespread in plants where they are commonly called vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) and are involved in the activation and degradation of storage proteins (17Muntz K. Blattner F.R. Shutov A.D. J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 159: 1281-1293Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the current study we present evidence for the role of a plant AEP in the backbone cyclization of cyclotides. We demonstrate that AEP activity is responsible for asparaginyl bond hydrolysis in cyclotide-containing plants and that this activity is linked to the cyclization of cyclotides in N. benthamiana. Although N. benthamiana does not endogenously produce circular proteins, it is capable of producing correctly folded and backbone-cyclized kalata B1 when transiently expressing the Oak1 precursor, in addition to C-terminally extended linear forms of the cyclotide. Analysis of the different cyclotide forms over time showed that linear kalata B1 was not cyclized in vivo despite the presence of a C-terminal Asn, suggesting that hydrolysis of the asparaginyl bond is necessary for cyclization. Knocking down or inhibiting AEP activity significantly reduced the amount of the cyclic protein produced and led to an accumulation of the longer linear cyclotide species. Overall the results appear to implicate an AEP in catalyzing both protein backbone hydrolysis and cyclization. Assay for Asparaginyl Bond Hydrolysis—O. affinis and V. tricolour leaf extracts in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA were preincubated with protease inhibitors (0.2-5 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1 m dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 1 h. Activity was measured against 200 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-Asn-methylcoumaryl amide (Z-AAN-mca) at 465 nm for 1 h at 30 °C using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5000, Shimadzu). Protease inhibitors (Peptide Institute) were phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO), acetyl-Glu-Ser-Glu-Asn-aldehyde (Ac-ESEN-CHO) and l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucyl amido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64). Construction of the Oak1 Expression Plasmid for Transient Expression Assays—Oak1 cDNA, including the ER signal sequence (13Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR using primers EcoRI-MAKF (5′-GGAATTCATGGCTAAGTT-3′) and SLAA*BamHI (5′-GGATCCTTATGCGGCCAAACT-3′) and subcloned into the pART7 vector (18Gleave A.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) between the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S constitutive promoter and the 3′ octopine synthase transcriptional termination (ocs) region. To generate pART27-Oak1, the Oak1 expression cassette incorporating the Oak1 coding sequence and the flanking promoter and termination regions was removed from pART7 as a single NotI fragment and ligated directly into the T-DNA region of the binary vector pART27 (18Gleave A.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Transient Expression of Oak1 in N. benthamiana—Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 cells transformed with the pART27-Oak1 plasmid were grown in Luria Broth (LB) media containing 10 mm MES, 20 mm acetosyringone, 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 20 μg/ml kanamycin at 28 °C. When the A600 reached ∼0.6 the cells were pelleted (2000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in an equal volume of MES buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.6) supplemented with 200 μm acetosyringone. The suspension was maintained at room temperature for 2-3 h before use. N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with the agrobacterium suspensions (agroinfiltration) as described (19Goodin M.M. Dietzgen R.G. Schichnes D. Ruzin S. Jackson A.O. Plant J. 2002; 31: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Detection and Quantification of Cyclotide Proteins using Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)—Leaf extracts (1 mg/ml or 0.1 mg/ml as indicated) were prepared in 50% CH3CN (acetonitrile), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and combined 1:1 (v/v) with the 4700 Proteomics Analyzer Calibration mixture (1/400 dilution in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; Applied Biosystems) containing a selection of proteins of known mass and concentration. This solution was combined 1:1 (v/v) with CHCA (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) matrix (5 mg/ml in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with 5mm ammonium phosphate) and spotted (0.6 μl) onto a 192-well sample plate (Applied Biosystems). Mass analysis was carried out on the 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) operated in positive ion reflector mode. Accelerating voltage was set at 20,000 V, the grid voltage was set at 68% of the accelerating voltage, and a 200-ns delay time was used. The low mass gate was set at 500 Da, and data were acquired between 1000 and 5000 Da. 50 spectra at 20 positions were accumulated per spot. Data were analyzed on the accompanying 4000 series Explorer Software. For relative quantification, the ACTH (18-39 clip) protein from the calibration mixture (average M+H+ of 2,466.72) was used as an internal standard relative to which the amount of cyclotide proteins was measured. The relative quantity of the cyclotide proteins was expressed as the ratio of the summed areas of the first three isotopic peaks of the analytes (cyclotide proteins) to the internal standard. To account for variations in protein expression between plants the ratios were expressed as a percentage of the total relative area of all the cyclotide proteins detected. Characterization of Cyclotide Proteins Expressed in N. benthamiana—Soluble extracts from N. benthamiana leaves 3 days postinfiltration (dpi) with pART27-Oak1 in agrobacterium were prepared in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, and reduced in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, with 10 mm TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) at 55 °C under nitrogen for 30 min. Reactions were quenched with formic acid and desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) for analysis by MALDI-TOF MS. Proteins extracted from N. benthamiana leaves 6 dpi in MeOH were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Co-elution studies of kalata B1 isolated from O. affinis and the 2892 Da protein from N. benthamiana were performed on C18 at 33% buffer B (90% CH3CN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteins were reduced in 100 mm TCEP for 10 min at 65 °C and 1 h at 37 °C and incubated with trypsin (40 μg/ml in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.5) for 2 h. The solutions were desalted using ZipTips and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. MS/MS fragmentation of the 2914.9 Da precursor ion was performed on the MALDI-TOF 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) operated in positive ion reflector mode. The masses of the y-series (C-terminal) fragment ions were used to determine the partial sequence of the 2892 Da protein. In planta Inhibitor Assay—Ac-YVAD-CHO (1 mm) or a water (mock) control was infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves 1 h prior to infiltration of the same leaf area with agrobacterium solutions harboring the Oak1 expression construct, as described above. Eighteen hours after agroinfiltration the same leaves were again infiltrated with the protease inhibitor, and then repeatedly at 24-h intervals for the next 2 days. Infiltrated leaf tissue was collected 3 days after agroinfiltration. Infiltration of Ac-YVAD-CHO and water was conducted on individual leaves of the same plants (n = 3). For each treatment the leaf samples from the three different plants were pooled for analysis. Oak1 Expression in VPE-silenced Plants—Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of VPE genes in N. benthamiana was carried out with the potato virus X vector construct pPVX: VPE1a-2 described in Ref. 20Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar and the empty pPVX vector (21Chapman S. Kavanagh T. Baulcombe D. Plant J. 1992; 2: 549-557PubMed Google Scholar) as a control. The viral vectors were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 and grown on LB-agar supplemented with tetracyclin (20 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 28 °C for 2 days. Inoculation of 2-week-old N. benthamiana plants was conducted by piercing the growing leaves with a toothpick covered in the agrobacterium cells. The plants were kept under short day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) at 22 °C for 3 days and then transferred to long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at 26 °C. Six plants were inoculated with each viral vector. Four weeks after inoculation two upper leaves on each plant were agroinfiltrated with the Oak1 expression construct as described above and maintained in long day conditions. RT-PCR for Detection of VPE Expression—Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy plant RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was carried out using 1 μg of RNA and Ready-to-go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) with an oligo-dT primer for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). Gene expression was compared using 1 μl of cDNA as a template for PCR with VPE, Oak1, and actin (control) specific primer sets. The VPE (NbVPE common) and actins primer sets have been described previously (20Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The EcoRI-MAKF and SLAA*BamHI primers described above were used to amplify Oak1. Immunoblot Analysis of Oak1 Protein Expression—Immunoblot analysis was carried out essentially as described (22Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1999: 267-309Google Scholar). Soluble leaf extracts were prepared in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the total protein concentration was standardized using the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay (Pierce). Aliquots of the samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blotted membrane was incubated with polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant Oak1 (1 mg/ml diluted 5000-fold). A 1/10,000-fold dilution of the Oak1 antibody was used in the immunoblot of VIGS plant extracts. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG (diluted 20,000-fold; Sigma Aldrich) were used as secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro AEP Activity—Protease activity capable of hydrolyzing asparaginyl bonds was assessed in representative cyclotide-containing Rubiaceae and Violaceae plants using the short peptide substrate Z-AAN-mca. Hydrolysis of the asparaginyl bond was detected in both O. affinis (Rubiaceae) and V. tricolour (Violaceae) leaf extracts as an increase in fluorescence at 465 nm over time, following addition of the substrate. To determine which class of protease(s) was responsible for this activity the cleavage assay was conducted after the plant extracts had been preincubated with a variety of inhibitors, each targeting a different subset of protease activities. As shown in Fig. 2 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and E-64 had no effect on the ability of either the O. affinis or V. tricolour leaf extracts to cleave the Asn-containing substrate, but the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO and the specific AEP inhibitor Ac-ESEN-CHO inhibited hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition profile observed is characteristic of AEPs, which belong to the CD clan of cysteine proteases (23Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 24Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and indicated that AEP activity was responsible for Asn-bond hydrolysis in cyclotide-containing plants. AEP activity was also tested against cyclotide substrates. Cyclic kalata B1 (KB1-c), linear kalata B1 (KB1-l) and a synthetic protein corresponding to linear kalata B1 plus the C-terminal tail region (KB1-tail) were incubated with a commercial preparation of AEP from Jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis) seeds (JB AEP) in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol. JB AEP was used because it has been shown to catalyze peptide ligation during the processing of the concanavalin A precursor (25Bowles D.J. Marcus S.E. Pappin D.J. Findlay J.B. Eliopoulos E. Maycox P.R. Burgess J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1284-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Carrington D.M. Auffret A. Hanke D.E. Nature. 1985; 313: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Min W. Jones D.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 1994; 1: 502-504Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although JB AEP was active in vitro it only cleaved asparaginyl bonds after reduction (and unfolding) of the substrates (see supplemental data Fig. S1 and methods). Circular Kalata B1 Is Produced by N. benthamiana—Cyclotide-containing plants are not ideal systems for the study of cyclization. The plants are not amenable to genetic manipulation, they endogenously accumulate very high levels of cyclotides (up to 2 mg/g wet plant weight; (28Gran L. Lloydia. 1973; 36: 174-178PubMed Google Scholar)) that mask small changes in expression, and the processing events appear to occur too rapidly to allow detection of the precursor protein and protein intermediates. Alternatively we expressed Oak1 in N. benthamiana, a plant that does not endogenously produce cyclotides and is not known to produce circular proteins, but which contains two characterized AEPs (20Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We infiltrated A. tumefaciens harboring the pART27 binary vector encoding Oak1 (pART27-Oak1) under the control of a 35S CaMV constitutive promoter and ocs terminator into N. benthamiana leaves. Mature cyclotide production was detected at 24-h intervals using MALDI-TOF MS. Expression of Oak1 in N. benthamiana produced a suite of proteins with masses corresponding to cyclic oxidized kalata B1 and what appeared to be linear forms of the cyclotide not commonly observed in O. affinis. None of these masses were observed in uninfiltrated controls. As outlined in Fig. 3A, the masses detected correspond to linear kalata B1, linear kalata B1 minus the N-terminal Gly (-G) and linear kalata B1 plus the successive addition of the Gly, Leu, Pro, and Ser residues that constitute the C-terminal tail of Oak1 (+G, +GL, +GLP etc.). A MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of N. benthamiana leaves 3 dpi is shown before and after treatment with the reducing agent TCEP in Fig. 3B. Reduction caused the mass of each species to increase by 6 Da, indicating that each contained 6 Cys residues and was most likely an oxidized protein variant of kalata B1. RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry were used to establish that the 2892 Da mass species identified in N. benthamiana corresponds to backbone-cyclized kalata B1. As shown in Fig. 4 the 2892 Da protein from N. benthamiana co-eluted with kalata B1 extracted from O. affinis on RP-HPLC (Fig. 4A), yielded the same linear product after digestion with trypsin (Fig. 4B) and had the same MS/MS fragmentation pattern as the control protein (Fig. 4C). RP-HPLC was also used to characterize the 2910 Da species, which corresponds in mass to both linear oxidized kalata B1 and an N-terminally truncated -G/+G protein. Two peaks of approximately equal area containing the 2910 Da mass were isolated from an N. benthamiana (6 dpi) extract by RP-HPLC. One of these co-eluted with synthetic oxidized linear kalata B1 while the other contained both -G (2853 Da) and 2910 Da mass species in approximately equal proportions. Consequently we estimated that, at most, the ratio of the linear to -G/+G species in N. benthamiana is 2:1. The 2910 Da mass is hereinafter referred to as linear (-G/+G). A Time Course Analysis of Cyclization—We monitored the progress of cyclotide production in N. benthamiana from 1-7 dpi. Fig. 5 shows the relative abundance of the cyclotide protein species at 24-h intervals. At 2 dpi the most abundant species present is +GLP. The linear (-G/+G), +G and +GL species are also in high abundance but cyclic kalata B1 and the N-terminal -G species are only present in low amounts. Over the next several days the sequential tail species disappear as the amount of -G and linear (-G/+G) increases. Although the amount of kalata B1 increases slightly during this period it does not increase in proportion to the decrease observed in the linear form. This suggests that in vivo linear kalata B1 (which makes up a majority of the 2910 Da mass peak) is being converted into the -G form rather than cyclic kalata B1 and thus that the Asn residue is not itself sufficient for cyclization. VPE Inhibition Abolishes Circular Kalata B1 Production—The effect of AEP activity on Oak1 processing in vivo was tested using the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO. Leaves of N. benthamiana were infiltrated with Ac-YVAD-CHO or a mock water control 1 h prior to agroinfiltration of the same leaves with the pART27-Oak1 construct. After 18 h the protease inhibitor was re-applied to the leaves and again at 24-h intervals for the next 2 days before the leaf samples were collected. For each treatment infiltrated leaf material from three plants was pooled for analysis. Protein extracts of the treated leaves were prepared in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to immunoblotting with Oak1 antibodies to examine Oak1 processing and MALDI-TOF MS to assess cyclotide production. Similar levels of the Oak1 precursor and two lower mass intermediates were detected in the Ac-YVAD-CHO treated and control leaves, as shown in Fig. 6A, suggesting that initial processing events were not perturbed by the inhibitor. By contrast, the production of cyclotide proteins differed substantially between the samples (Fig. 6B and expanded in 6C). Cyclic kalata B1 was not detected in leaves infiltrated with Ac-YVAD-CHO and the distribution of the linear cyclotide proteins was changed relative to the control, causing a shift away from the short linear and +G proteins toward accumulation of the longer +GLP species. Silencing of VPE in N. benthamiana Decreases Production of Circular Kalata B1—Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was used to generate N. benthamiana plants in which expression of the major forms of AEPs, termed VPEs in N. benthamiana, was suppressed. Silencing was targeted toward a region of cDNA from N. benthamiana VPE-1a, which is conserved in the other N. benthamiana AEP, VPE-1b (20Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Plants were inoculated with agrobacterium carrying the region of VPE cDNA encoded in an antisense orientation in the potato virus X vector (pPVX: VPE1a-2). Control plants were inoculated with the empty viral vector pPVX and appeared phenotypically identical to the silenced plants (Fig. 7A). Four weeks after inoculation, leaves of both the silenced and control plants were agroinfiltrated with the Oak1 expression vector. Total RNA was extracted from infiltrated leaves and subject to RT-PCR using a primer set targeting a region common to both N. benthamiana AEPs. Weak VPE gene expression was detected in the silenced plants but at lower levels than the expression detected in the control plants (Fig. 7B). To determine whether the decrease in VPE expression was affecting precursor production, Oak1 infiltrated leaf samples 3 dpi were subject to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against Oak1. Fig. 7C shows Oak1 protein production in the six control plants compared with the six silenced plants. A stark increase or decrease in the amount of precursor was not characteristic of either category. To determine whether decreased VPE expression affects cyclotide production we compared the amount of kalata B1 in leaf extracts from VIGS plants 3 days after agroinfiltration of Oak1, using MALDI-TOF MS. For each plant the area of the cyclic kalata B1 mass peaks was calculated relative to an internal standard protein (relative area), the ionization of which we have found to be directly proportional to kalata B1 (data not shown). Total cyclotide protein expression levels (total relative area) did not vary significantly between the silenced and control plants but a significant (p = ≤0.0001) decrease in cyclic kalata B1 production (>40%) was observed in the silenced plants compared with the controls (Fig. 7D). As in the inhibitor studies, a decrease in cyclic kalata B1 was accompanied by a relative incre"

Studied predominantly on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) during development of the vertebrate nervous system, PSA modulates cell interactions mediated by NCAM and other adhesion molecules. An isoform of NCAM (CD56) on natural killer (NK) cells is the only protein known to be polysialylated in cells of the immune system, yet the function of PSA in NK cells remains unclear. We show here that neuropilin-2 (NRP-2), a receptor for the semaphorin and vascular endothelial growth factor families in neurons and endothelial cells, respectively, is expressed on the surface of human dendritic cells and is polysialylated. Expression of NRP-2 is up-regulated during dendritic cell maturation, coincident with increased expression of ST8Sia IV, one of the key enzymes of PSA biosynthesis, and with the appearance of PSA on the cell surface. PSA on NRP-2 is resistant to digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F but is sensitive to release under alkaline conditions, suggesting that PSA chains are added to O-linked glycans of NRP-2. Removal of polysialic acid from the surface of dendritic cells or binding of NRP-2 with specific IgG promoted dendritic cell-induced activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes. Thus, this newly recognized polysialylated protein on the surface of dendritic cells influences dendritic cell-T lymphocyte interactions through one or more of its distinct extracellular domains.

Thus, this newly recognized polysialylated protein on the surface of dendritic cells influences dendritic cell-T lymphocyte interactions through one or more of its distinct extracellular domains. Sialyltransferases comprise a large family of enzymes that add sialic acid by several different glycosidic linkages to cell surface glycoconjugates (1Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V.

In vertebrates, single molecules of sialic acid can be added by α2-3 or α2-6 linkages to the penultimate sugar (usually galactose) of glycomoieties. Glycoproteins can also be modified by linear homopolymers of α2-8-linked sialic acid with a degree of polymerization greater than seven that are referred to as polysialic acid (PSA) 3The abbreviations used are: PSA, polysialic acid; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; IL, interleukin; endoNF, endosialidaseNF; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; NK, natural killer; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription; nt, nucleotides; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NRP-2, neuropilin-2; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; IFN, interferon; DC, dendritic cells; ImDC, immature DC; mDC, mature DC.3The abbreviations used are: PSA, polysialic acid; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; IL, interleukin; endoNF, endosialidaseNF; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; NK, natural killer; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription; nt, nucleotides; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NRP-2, neuropilin-2; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; IFN, interferon; DC, dendritic cells; ImDC, immature DC; mDC, mature DC.

Polysialic acid modification of NCAM during neuronal development has been studied extensively and has been shown to play a significant role in cell migration, axonal guidance, synapse formation, and functional plasticity by preventing the formation of stable cell contacts mediated by NCAM and other cell surface molecules (10Bonfanti L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 80: 129-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 11Bruses J.L. Rutishauser U. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Neural cell adhesion molecule is heavily polysialylated in undifferentiated neurons but loses its PSA content in mature neurons that have formed permanent intercellular synapses (10Bonfanti L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 80: 129-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 11Bruses J.L. Rutishauser U. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The function of PSA modification on the other four proteins remains to be determined. An isoform of NCAM, namely CD56, that is present in natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system is known to be polysialylated, yet the role of polysialylated CD56 in NK cell function remains unknown.Circulating peripheral blood monocytes can differentiate into either macrophages or dendritic cells after exposure to specific stimuli. Dendritic cells present antigen to naïve T lymphocytes at specific intercellular junctions called the immunological synapse (12Friedl P. den Boer A.T. Gunzer M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 532-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Dendritic cell-T lymphocyte contact at these sites is mediated by numerous proteins that include among others major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules, T cell receptor, adhesion molecules such as LFA1, LFA3, ICAM1, ICAM3, the B7 family members (CD80 and CD86), CD28, and DC-SIGN. Immunological and neuronal synapses are similar in the capacity to establish cell-cell adhesion, to activate signaling pathways, and to secrete and respond to extracellular soluble mediators. Dendritic cells and neurons share an additional feature of expressing members of the neuropilin transmembrane receptor family (13He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

The neuropilins share 45% homology and have overall similar structure with five main extracellular domains; two complement binding domains, two coagulation factor V/VIII homology domains, and a MAM (meprin, tyrosine phosphatase domain) region (13He Z.

In contrast, NRP-2 has not yet been identified in cells of the immune system.In this report, we identify NRP-2 as a polysialylated cell surface protein expressed in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. We show that NRP-2 expression is up-regulated during dendritic cell maturation, coincident with a marked increase in expression of ST8Sia IV, one of the key enzymes of PSA biosynthesis, and with the appearance of PSA on the cell surface. We also show that either binding NRP-2 with specific IgG or removing PSA from the cell surface enhances the ability of dendritic cells to activate T lymphocytes in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, suggesting that polysialylated NRP-2 is a multifunctional protein that helps regulate dendritic cell activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDifferentiation of Purified Monocytes into Dendritic Cells—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by leuko-phoresis of blood from human immunodeficiency virus-1 and hepatitis B and C seronegative human donors followed by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) gradients using standard procedures. Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by negative selection using StemSep separation columns (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Alternatively, monocytes were purified by counter-flow centrifugation/elutriation using an Elutra Cell Separation System (Gambro Healthcare, Lund, Sweden). The purity of monocytes exceeded 95% as determined by flow cytometry after staining cells with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies to CD3, CD14, and CD19 and relevant isotype controls (all from BD Pharmingen), and viability was greater than 97% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.To obtain monocyte-derived immature and mature dendritic cells, purified monocytes were suspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) without serum and seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% humidified, CO2 incubator, nonadherent cells were removed, and the adherent cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm pyruvate (both from Invitrogen), 1% minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (both from Sigma-Aldrich), and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at 50 ng/ml and recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4) at 50 ng/ml (both from R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Immature dendritic cells were harvested after 6 days in culture by gentle scraping with a polyethylene cell scraper (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). To differentiate immature dendritic cells further into mature dendritic cells, lipopolysaccharide at 100 ng/ml (LPS from Escherichia coli, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium after 4 days in culture. Mature dendritic cells were harvested 48 h later for a total of 6 days in culture, the same time in culture as immature cells.The NK-92 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS, 10% horse serum, and recombinant human IL-2 at 100 units/ml (Roche Applied Science). Lymphocytes that were used in the mixed lymphocyte reaction were purified by elutriation using the Elutra Cell Separation System and were stored frozen in liquid N2 until use.Isolation of RNA and Real Time RT-PCR—Monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells were harvested at the indicated times, and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The RNA preparation was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove contaminating DNA. DNase was then removed by binding to DNase inactivation reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). Semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with an ABI sequence detection system (ABI PRISM 5700) as described previously (35Stamatos N.M. Liang F. Nan X. Landry K. Cross A.S. Wang L.X. Pshezhetsky A.V. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2545-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ten nanograms (10 ng) of total RNA was used to detect gene expression of ST8Sia II (GenBank™ accession number U33551), ST8Sia IV (GenBank™ accession number L41680), NRP-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF016050), NRP-2 (GenBank™ accession number AF016098), and NCAM (GenBank™ accession number NM_000615). Gene expression of 18S rRNA (GenBank™ accession number X03205) was also measured as an internal control. The following primers were selected using DNAsis Max software (Hitachi, Japan) and were synthesized by Qiagen (Germantown, MD): ST8Sia II (forward, nt 402–421, 5′-TGTGTCCCAGAACCTCTACG-3′, and reverse, nt 551–532, 5′-CACCTGATGACGAAGCTGTG-3′) yielding a 149-bp product; ST8Sia IV (forward, nt 608–625, 5′-ACCAATGAAGAATCGCAGTG-3′, and reverse, nt 746–727, 5′-AGCAAACTCCACCACAGGAG-3′) yielding a 138-bp product; NRP1 (forward, nt 143–164, 5′-ATCACCCAAGTGAAAAATGCGA-3′, and reverse, nt 236–216, 5′-TCCTCCAAATCGAAGTGAGGG-3′) yielding a 93-bp product; NRP2 (forward, nt 648–667, 5′-GGATGGCATTCCACATGTTG-3′, and reverse, nt 800–780, 5′-ACCAGGTAGTAACGCGCAGAG-3′) yielding a 152-bp product; NCAM (forward, nt 1313–1333, 5′-GTCACTCTTACCTGTGAAGCC-3′, and reverse, nt 1483–1464, 5′-TCCGGCATCAGTGTACTGGA-3′, yielding a 170-bp product; 18 S rRNA (forward, nt 1279–1298, 5′-CGGACAGGATTGACAGATTG-3′, and reverse, nt 1397–1378, 5′-ATGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCGTT-3′), yielding a 119-bp product. To synthesize cDNA, reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 30 min. After a 15-min hot start at 95 °C, DNA amplification was allowed to proceed for 35 cycles (15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). All reactions were run in triplicate. Semiquantitative analysis was based on the cycle number (CT) at which the SYBR Green fluorescent signal crossed a threshold in the log-linear range of RT-PCR. The accuracy of each reaction was confirmed by analysis of melting curves and product size on gel electrophoresis.Analysis of Cellular Proteins by SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot—Monocytes and monocyte-derived immature and mature dendritic cells were collected, and proteins from 2 × 106 cells were solubilized in 0.1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, a protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The amount of protein in the supernatant was measured by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Proteins (1–10 μg) from each cell lysate were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer (gel and running buffer were from Invitrogen), electrotransferred by a semi-wet method to a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with 0.5 μg/ml mouse mAb 735 (36Frosch M.

The respective blots were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse and donkey HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), developed using an ECL chemiluminescence substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to Kodak x-ray film.To immunoprecipitate specific proteins for analysis by SDS-PAGE, a lysate from 1 × 107 mature dendritic cells prepared in 0.40 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay solution as described above was first mixed with 2 μg of preimmune mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30 μl of protein G plus/protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Agarose beads and nonspecifically bound protein were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then mixed with protein G plus/protein A-agarose (30 μl) that had been preincubated with 2 μg of mouse anti-PSA mAb 735 or mouse mAb against NRP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads and bound protein were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, washed 3 times with radioimmune precipitation assay solution, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 1/20 of the total immunoprecipitated product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot as described above, whereas 1/2 of the total immunoprecipitated product was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Simply Blue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen) for subsequent protein identification.Immunofluorescent Staining of Cell Surface Proteins and Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Purified monocytes and immature/mature dendritic cells were collected as described above, and 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2% human serum AB (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA). Cells were then stained at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-PSA mAb 735, mouse mAb against NRP-1 (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), or mouse anti-NRP-2 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by incubation with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and then phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (both from Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Cells were also stained with phycoerythrin-, allophycocyanin-, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to CD1a, CD3, CD14, CD19, CD40, CD83, CD86 CD206, HLA-DR, and isotypic control IgG (all mAbs from BD Pharmingen) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. After incubation with antibodies, the cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 1.0% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur, and data were analyzed using FlowJo data analysis software.Digestion with EndosialidaseNF and Peptide N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F)—Monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells were treated with endosialidaseNF (endoNF) (37Finne J.

Monocytes were treated with endoNF after being resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. Mature dendritic cells were exposed to endoNF after 5 days in culture by the addition of the enzyme directly to the medium of wells in the tissue culture plates. Cells were collected after the treatment and were washed 2 times in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and were either directly analyzed or placed back in culture in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. NK cells were similarly treated with endoNF after cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. To heat-inactivate endoNF, a solution of enzyme was placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min.To release N-linked glycans from NRP-2 and CD56, both proteins were immunopurified with the respective Abs indicated above, and an equal amount of each in 0.01 ml was denatured in a solution containing 0.5% SDS and 0.04 m dithiothreitol at 100 °C for 10 min and either mock-treated or incubated with 1000 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 1 h at 37°C. Mock- and PNGase F-treated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using anti-PSA mAb 735 and anti-CD56 IgG. The relative intensity of bands on exposed films was quantitated using a PharosFX™ Plus Molecular Imager and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad).β-Elimination of O-Linked Glycans—To release O-linked glycans from NRP-2 and CD56, both proteins were immunopurified, and an equal amount of each was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. Duplicate lanes were placed in either HOH or a solution of 0.1 n NaOH at 37 °C for 1 h as described previously (39Martersteck C.M. Kedersha N.L. Drapp D.A. Tsui T.G. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The membranes were then probed on immunoblot with anti-PSA mAb 735, and the relative intensity of bands on the exposed films was determined by densitometry as noted above.Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction—Monocytes were differentiated into mature dendritic cells in vitro and were treated with endoNF or heat-inactivated endoNF or were mock-treated for 2 h as indicated above after 5 days in culture. After the 2-h treatment, cells were harvested from the wells by gentle pipetting and washed twice with RPMI medium 1640 and 10% FCS, and 2 × 104 mature dendritic cells were mixed with 1 × 105 allogeneic resting T lymphocytes in 0.20 ml of RPMI 1640, 10% FCS without IL-4 and GM-CSF in 96-well U-bottom plates (Nunc, Denmark). Alternatively, dendritic cells were preincubated with preimmune goat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) or goat polyclonal anti-NRP-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 40 μg/ml for 1 h at 37°C before mixing with resting lymphocytes. The final concentration of each antibody in the mixed lymphocyte reaction was 20 μg/ml. Where indicated, cells were first treated with endoNF and then incubated with anti-NRP-2 IgG. After 48 h in culture, an aliquot of the medium was sampled to determine the amount of IFN-γ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems), and 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (5.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well. Cells were maintained in culture for an additional 18 h and harvested onto glass fiber filters (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) with a filtermate 196 harvester (Wallac Oy), and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using a Top-Count microplate liquid scintillation counter (1450 Microbeta Trilux Wallac Oy).Mass Spectrometry—Proteins from specific regions of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were analyzed by mass spectrometry at the W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville, VA as previously described (40Hanna S.L. Sherman N.E. Kinter M.T. Goldberg J.B. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2495-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein from gel slices was reduced, alkylated, and trypsinized and analyzed on a Finnigan LTQ-FT mass spectrometer system with a Protana nanospray ion source interfaced to a self-packed 8-cm × 75-mm inner diameter Phenomenex Jupiter 10-mm C18 reversed-phase capillary column. The nanospray ion source was operated at 2.8 kV. The resulting mass spectroscopy data were analyzed by data base searching using the Sequest search algorithm against human International Protein Index. The probability of a protein being present based on the mass spectrometry was determined by the PeptideProphet™ algorithm (41Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2050174110,"Tissue barrier function is directly mediated by tight junction transmembrane proteins known as claudins. Cells that form tight junctions typically express multiple claudin isoforms which suggests that heterotypic (head-to-head) binding between different claudin isoforms may play a role in regulating paracellular permeability. However, little is known about motifs that control heterotypic claudin compatibility. We found that although claudin-3 and claudin-4 were heteromerically compatible when expressed in the same cell, they did not heterotypically interact despite having extracellular loop (EL) domains that are highly conserved at the amino acid level. Claudin-1 and -5, which were heterotypically compatible with claudin-3, did not heterotypically bind to claudin-4. In contrast, claudin-4 chimeras containing either the first EL domain or the second EL domain of claudin-3 were able to heterotypically bind to claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-5. Moreover, a single point mutation in the first extracellular loop domain of claudin-3 to convert Asn44 to the corresponding amino acid in claudin-4 (Thr) produced a claudin capable of heterotypic binding to claudin-4 while still retaining the ability to bind to claudin-1 and -5. Thus, control of heterotypic claudin-claudin interactions is sensitive to small changes in the EL domains.

Thus, control of heterotypic claudin-claudin interactions is sensitive to small changes in the EL domains. Tight junctions regulate the flow of aqueous molecules, ions, and water between cells. Tight junction permeability is directly controlled by transmembrane proteins in the claudin family (1Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev.

To date more than 20 claudin family members have been described, each demonstrating a distinct pattern of tissue expression (5Heiskala M. Peterson P.A. Yang Y.

Claudins not only form a barrier to macromolecule diffusion but also form specific paracellular ion channels (7Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells that form tight junctions, such as epithelial cells, typically express multiple claudin isoforms that interact to produce the unique paracellular ion permeability characteristics of the monolayer (11Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R1078-R1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that interactions between claudins are specific (13Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the rules that determine whether different claudins interact have not been completely elucidated. The presence of multiple claudins in a single cell can confound the analysis of head-to-head (heterotypic) interactions between claudins on adjacent cells. Given this, initial studies of claudin-claudin associations were performed using fibroblasts that do not express endogenous claudins. Claudins expressed by transfected fibroblasts assemble into structures reminiscent of tight junction strands as analyzed by freeze-fracture immunogold electron microscopy (15Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Co-cultures of L-cells or 3T3 fibroblasts transfected to express different claudins have been used to demonstrate that claudin-1 heterotypically binds to claudin-3 but not claudin-2 or claudin-5 (13Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Conversely, claudin-2 and claudin-5 heterotypically bind to claudin-3 but not claudin-1. Thus, the compatibility of claudins for head-to-head binding is not easily predicted. We have found that HeLa cells are claudin-null yet express several other tight junction proteins which modulate tight junction integrity, including occludin, junction adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) 2The abbreviations used are: JAM-A, junction adhesion molecule-A; ZO, Zona Occludens; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EL, extracellular loop. 2The abbreviations used are: JAM-A, junction adhesion molecule-A; ZO, Zona Occludens; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EL, extracellular loop., and scaffold proteins such as Zona Occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3. Although some of these proteins are also expressed by fibroblasts, fibroblasts do not express occludin (15Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Although occludin expression is not required for epithelial barrier function (16Yu A.S. McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A.

Cell Biochem. 2000; 78: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and could potentially alter claudin-claudin interactions. We used HeLa clones stably expressing single or multiple claudins to examine the ability of claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-5 to interact with each other. Although the extracellular loop domains of claudin-3 and claudin-4 are highly conserved, claudins that interact with claudin-3 did not heterotypically bind to claudin-4. Furthermore, we found that although claudin-3 and claudin-4 did not heterotypically bind to each other, they did form heteromeric complexes. Using a series of claudin-3/4 chimeras, we found that the specificity of heterotypic claudin compatibility was sensitive to changes in either extracellular loop domain. Recombinant DNA—Human claudin cDNAs were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The constructs were amplified by PCR using primers containing either EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites or, in the case of claudin-3, HindIII and BamHI sites and then inserted into pcDNA3 and pcDNA3.1/hygro by enzyme digestion and ligation. Claudin-3/-4 chimeras were produced by two-step PCR amplification using established protocols (21Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Chimeras produced were claudin-3e1-4 (claudin-31–29 + claudin-431–81 + claudin-381–222), claudin-3e2-4 (claudin-31–143 + claudin-4145–160 + claudin-3161–222), claudin-3e1,2-4 (claudin-31–29 + claudin-431–81 + claudin-381–143 + claudin-4145–160 + claudin-3160–222), claudin-4e1-3 (claudin-41–30 + claudin-330–80 + claudin-482–209), claudin-4e2-3 (claudin-41–144 + claudin-3144–159 + claudin-4161–209), claudin-4e1,2-3 (claudin-41–30 + claudin-330–80 + claudin-482–144 + claudin-3144–159 + claudin-4161–209). The claudin-3N44T and -3N44R constructs were produced using the Qiagen QuikChange kit, and N-terminal-tagged CFP and YFP-tagged claudin-5 were prepared using standard restriction digestion and ligation reactions to insert the claudin-5 coding sequence into pECFP-C3 or pYFP-C3. All cDNA constructs were sequenced before use. DNA for transfection was purified from bacteria using the Qiagen Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies recognizing claudin-4 and -5 and polyclonal antibodies recognizing claudin-1, -2, -3, -5, -7, -8, and -18 JAM-A, occludin, and ZO-1 were from Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA). Rabbit anti-ZO-2 and ZO-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts, l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1000 mg/liter d-glucose, l-glutamine, pyridoxine hydrochloride, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent from Roche Diagnostics was used to obtain cells stably expressing various claudin constructs. Cells were plated 1 day before transfection in 35-mm culture dishes in media lacking antibiotics to achieve a density of 60% confluence for transfection. Briefly, 6 μl of FuGENE 6 was diluted dropwise to 100 μl of Opti-MEM followed by the addition of 2 μg of plasmid DNA. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow for DNA-FuGENE 6 complex formation, and tube contents were then added to cells. The cells were incubated 48 h with the DNA complexes, the transfection efficiency was examined using immunofluorescence, and stably transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen. Doubly transfected cells were also selected using 2 mg/ml hygromycin. For co-culture studies cells were plated together and then passed three times as a co-culture population before analysis. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated on glass coverslips (Fisher) for immunofluorescence staining. Cells were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and fixed for 2 min at room temperature with equal volumes of methanol and acetone. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS lacking divalent cations (PBS) followed by a 5-min incubation in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBS-Tx) and a subsequent 5-min incubation in PBS-Tx + 2% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 2% goat serum (PBS-GS) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in PBS-GS. Cells were subsequently rinsed once with PBS containing 2% goat serum and 3 times with PBS alone before mounting in Mowiol-488 (Calbiochem). For simultaneous staining of claudin-1 and claudin-3, cells were blocked with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum, incubated with rabbit anti-claudin-1, washed, incubated with excess goat anti-rabbit IgG fab fragment, washed, incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, washed, incubated with rabbit anti-claudin-3, washed, incubated with Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, washed, and mounted. A negative control demonstrating that this approach did not show cross-reactivity is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Immunofluorescence was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus X-70 microscope system and imaged with a Hamamatzu Orca-1 CCD camera and acquired and quantified using Image Pro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Claudin co-localization was scored as the fraction of cell-cell interfaces between cells expressing different claudins that showed regions with a minimum of 100 contiguous pixels with fluorescence intensity values greater than 100 for both channels. Each experiment was quantified from at least five fields from 2 or 3 independently prepared samples and a minimum of 80 heterologous cell-cell interfaces. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and grown to ∼90% confluence for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were rinsed twice with chilled PBS. Cells were subsequently incubated for 5 min on ice with PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Pierce), harvested using a cell scraper, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C through chilled PBS. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% Triton X-100) and lysed for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated on ice to shear the nuclear material and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g. A portion of each post-nuclear lysate was transferred to a tube with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), incubated for 5 min at 70 °C, and stored at -20 °C for later use as an indicator of the amount of claudin protein present in the cell lysate. The remaining post-nuclear lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose (Invitrogen), incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, and subsequently incubated with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) and once with low salt wash buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) before the addition of 2× sample buffer, incubation at 70 °C, and storage at -20 °C. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot—Claudins and junction adhesion molecule were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE, occludin, ZO-2, and ZO-3 were resolved using 8% SDS-PAGE, and ZO-1 was resolved using 6% SDS-PAGE. Positive controls for claudin expression in Fig. 1 included T84 cells (claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, -8, and -18), SKHep-G2 cells (claudin-7) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (claudin-2). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5% nonfat dried milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer containing the appropriate primary antibody, washed 3 times with blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated-secondary antibody diluted into blocking buffer. Membranes were then washed three times with blocking buffer and three times with PBS, and proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Biosciences). Immunoblots were quantified using a Kodak EDAS system. The co-immunoprecipitation index was calculated by first normalizing the amount of immunoprecipitated claudin to the total amount of claudin present in the samples and then calculating the ratio of the amount of co-immunoprecipitated claudin divided by the amount of directly precipitated claudin. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. To analyze paracellular claudin interactions, we sought to identify an epithelial-like cell line expressing most tight junction proteins but lacking claudin protein expression. Affymetrix microarray analysis of HeLa cells from an unrelated study indicated that HeLa cells do not transcribe claudin genes (22Das Sarma J. Das S. Koval M. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2005; 12: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To confirm that HeLa cells lack claudin protein expression, we examined HeLa and cell lysates for the presence of claudins. As seen in Fig. 1, HeLa cells did not express claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, or -18 at the protein level. In contrast, several other tight junction proteins were detected in HeLa cell lysates, including occludin, ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and JAM-A. Thus, we used HeLa cells as a claudin-null background for further studies of claudin-claudin interactions. HeLa cell clones stably expressing human claudins were generated. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected HeLa cells revealed that exogenous claudins expressed by HeLa cells accumulate predominately at cell-cell contact sites with weaker staining at cell surfaces that are not in contact with an adjacent cell (Fig. 2). Based on this observation we concluded that that claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-5 are likely to be stabilized at cell-cell contact sites through homotypic head-to-head binding. Co-cultures of HeLa cells expressing different claudins were then examined using immunofluorescence co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation as assays to determine whether pairs of different claudins were compatible for heterotypic binding. (Figs. 3 and 4). By immunofluorescence, compatible claudins co-localized at the plasma membrane at areas of cell-cell contact. As a positive control, we included co-cultures of cells expressing CFP-claudin-5 and cells expressing YFP-claudin-5, here pseudocolored red and green, respectively. Compatible claudins also showed co-localization in intracellular vesicles, which likely were due to internalization of claudins from the adjacent cell (23Matsuda M. Kubo A. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports using transfected fibroblasts, claudin-1 and claudin-3 were heterotypically compatible, as were claudin-3 and claudin-5 (13Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, claudin-1 and claudin-5 were not compatible, again consistent with a previous report (14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Based on quantification of heterotypic co-localization, we found that the homotypic pair of tagged claudin-5 constructs had the highest level of co-localization, although the other combinations of compatible claudins also showed significantly more co-localization than incompatible controls.FIGURE 4Heterotypic claudin binding specificity. Co-cultures of cells expressing different claudins were solubilized in Triton X-100 and examined for the ability to co-immunoprecipitate (IP) as determined by immunoblot (IB). Shown are representative immunoblots from co-cultures containing HeLa/cldn-1 + HeLa/cldn-5 (a), HeLa/cldn-3 + HeLa/cldn-5 (b), HeLa/cldn-4 + HeLa/cldn-5 (c), HeLa/cldn-1 + HeLa/cldn-3 (d), or HeLa/cldn-1 + HeLa/cldn-4 (e). Arrowheads denote claudin pairs that did not co-immunoprecipitate. f, relative immunoprecipitation was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent the average ± range (n = 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, neither claudin-1 nor claudin-5 was compatible to heterotypically bind to claudin-4. This was unexpected, since the extracellular loop (EL) domains of claudin-3 and claudin-4 are highly conserved at the amino acid level (EL1, 94% identical, 100% identical or conservative; EL2, 71% identical, 94% identical or conservative; Fig. 5i). Given this, we tested whether claudin-3 and claudin-4 could form heterotypic complexes. As shown in Fig. 5, claudin-3 and claudin-4 were not heterotypically compatible. Co-cultured HeLa/cldn-3 and HeLa/cldn-4 cells showed little immunofluorescence co-localization, and claudin-3 did not co-immunoprecipitate with claudin-4. In contrast, when HeLa cells were doubly transfected to express both claudin-3 and claudin-4, these two claudins co-localized and formed a complex isolatable by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5). This is significant since it suggests that claudin-3 and claudin-4 were heteromerically compatible despite their inability to form a heterotypic complex. To further investigate the role of EL domains in regulating heterotypic claudin-claudin binding, we produced a series of claudin chimeras. As shown in Fig. 6, the only pair that was not heterotypically compatible was wild type claudin-3 and wild type claudin-4. Each of the other combinations was able to form a co-immunoprecipitable, heterotypic complex. These results were also confirmed by immunofluorescence co-localization (supplemental Fig. 2). In particular, the “double loop swap” experiment (Fig. 6, c and d) was surprising, since this represents the same combination of EL domains that restrict heterotypic interactions between wild type claudin-3 and -4. This suggests that regulation of heterotypic claudin compatibility requires protein motifs beyond the EL domains. Note that a precedent for this type of regulation was also observed for two gap junction proteins, connexin40 and connexin43, where heterotypic interactions are regulated in part by the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of connexin43 (24Haubrich S. Schwarz H.J. Bukauskas F. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Traub O. Weingart R. Willecke K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We also examined whether an EL domain point mutation could have an effect on heterotypic compatibility. To do this we substituted the asparagine 44 residue with threonine, the corresponding amino acid in claudin-4, to create a claudin-3-N44T mutant. As shown in Fig. 7, claudin-3-N44T was heterotypically compatible with claudin-4 and also retained compatibility with claudin-1, claudin-5, and the claudin-3e1,2-4 loop chimera. Thus, the claudin-3N44T mutant had a compatibility profile distinct from both wild type claudin-3 and claudin-4. Similar results were obtained with claudin-4 chimeras containing entire EL loop swaps tested for heterotypic compatibility with claudin-1 and claudin-5 (supplemental Fig. 3). However, changing asparagine 44 to arginine did not alter heterotypic compatibility, since claudin-3N44R did not bind claudin-4 but still heterotypically interacted with claudin-5. This suggests that amino acid 44 in the EL1 domain has a critical role in regulating heterotypic compatibility between claudin-3 and claudin-4. To further test the effect of altering the EL1 domain on claudin compatibility, we produced two claudin-4 chimeras containing the EL1 domain of either claudin-1 or claudin-5. As shown in Fig. 8, in contrast to wild type claudin-4, both of these chimeras were heterotypically compatible with claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-5. Note in particular that claudin-1 interacts with claudin-4e1-5, and claudin-5 interacts with claudin-4e1-1. Thus, three mutually incompatible claudins could be recombined to produce a chimera and a wild type claudin now able to heterotypically interact. The specificity of claudin heterotypic binding was highly sensitive to EL domain composition. Because most changes to individual EL domains induced heterotypic compatibility as opposed to incompatibility, this suggests that regulating heterotypic claudin-claudin interactions requires the simultaneous recognition of motifs in both pairs of EL domains on the proper protein backbone. Claudins form the physical basis for the tight junction barrier (1Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 403-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 2Furuse M.

For this to occur, the EL domains of claudins on one cell must interact with those on adjacent cells. The nature of this interaction is not well characterized. Because most barrier-forming cells express several claudins, tight junction formation and function is likely regulated at least in part by whether or not individual claudins are compatible for heterotypic binding. We found that claudin-4 did not heterotypically bind to either claudin-1, claudin-3, or claudin-5 (Table 1). To date, all of the known heterotypic claudin-claudin interactions appear to involve claudin-3. However, since only a limited subset of the claudins has been examined, further analysis may reveal other potential heterotypic claudin-claudin interactions. In contrast, homotypic claudin-claudin interactions appear likely to be universal.TABLE 1Heteromeric claudin compatibilityCompatibleReferencesNot compatibleReferencesClaudin-1Claudin-313Furuse M.

We found that a specific single amino acid substitution in the first EL domain of claudin-3 was sufficient to enable a heterotypic interaction with wild type claudin-4. Similarly, the claudin-3e2–4 chimera, containing five amino acid changes, also heterotypically interacted with claudin-4. Using a series of constructs, we found that chimeras containing a mixture of claduin-3 and claudin-4 EL domains could heterotypically bind to both wild type claudin-3 and wild type claudin-4. Furthermore, all of the chimeras could bind to all of the other chimeras containing a mixture of EL domains. In Fig. 6, the only combination that was not heterotypically compatible was wild type claudin-3 and wild type claudin-4. This suggests that the nature of heterotypic binding was not due to a simple binary interaction of EL-1 with EL-1, EL-1 with EL-2, or EL-2 with EL-2. Instead, heterotypic binding appears to be mediated by a simultaneous interaction involving both pairs of EL1 and EL2 domains. Moreover, since the double loop swap claudin-3 and claudin-4 chimeras were heterotypically compatible (Fig. 6, c and d), the context of the EL domains can have an effect on their structure. The notion that motifs beyond the EF domains can also play a role in regulating heterotypic compatibility is consistent with the observation that heterotypic binding between connexin40 and connexin43 could be inhibited by changes restricted to the cytoplasmic C terminus (24Haubrich S. Schwarz H.J. Bukauskas F. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Traub O. Weingart R. Willecke K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The complex nature of claudin heterotypic interactions is underscored by the finding that claudin-1 and claudin-5 are heterotypically compatible with claudin-3 even though they have EL domains that are less homologous to claudin-3 than claudin-4. That claudin-1 and claudin-5 are incompatible yet both bind to claudin-3 further suggests that a complex interaction between both pairs of EL domains dictates the specificity of heterotypic claudin-claudin interactions. This complexity could underlie the observed asymmetry in heterotypic claudin binding. However, a complete understanding of the molecular nature for heterotypic claudin binding will require detailed structural information of claudins which to date has not been determined. Although claudin-3 and claudin-4 were not heterotypically compatible, they did form a heteromeric complex when both claudins were expressed in the same cell. Whether claudins form heteromeric compatibility groups or are universally heteromerically compatible is not known. Although heteromeric binding likely requires lateral interactions in plane of the plasma membrane, it is also possible that heterotypic interactions may contribute to heteromer formation. For instance, EL domains of claudins on adjacent cells may help regulate heteromeric claudin-claudin interactions within tight junction strands. Also, the C-terminal domains may participate in regulating heteromeric interactions through interactions with ZO-1 and/or ZO-2 (25Umeda K. Ikenouchi J. Katahira-Tayama S. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Nakayama M. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Furuse M. Cell. 2006; 126: 741-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). HeLa cells provided a claudin-null background to analyze claudin-claudin interactions. These cells offer the advantage that they express several other tight junction proteins, including occludin, JAM-A, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3. In particular, HeLa cells enabled us to confirm that occludin does not alter claudin heterotypic compatibility, since our results were comparable with the heterotypic claudin-claudin compatibility profiles obtained using claudin-transfected fibroblasts (13Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The compatibility profile for claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-5 has also been observed for airway epithelia (14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although occludin-null mice form functional tight junctions (17Saitou M. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 26Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), the ability of occludin EL peptides to disrupt epithelial barrier function suggests a role for occludin in regulating tight junctions (18Everett R.S. Vanhook M.K. Barozzi N. Toth I. Johnson L.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Nusrat A. Brown G.T. Tom J. Drake A. Bui T.T. Quan C. Mrsny R.J. Mol. Biol.

At present it is unclear whether heterotypic occludin-claudin interactions contribute to the ability of occludin to modulate barrier function. However, because claudin heterotypic compatibility is not altered by the presence of occludin and the EL loops of occludin and claudins show significant structural differences, such a scenario seems unlikely. Heterotypic compatibility and/or incompatibility may help determine the characteristics of tight junction permeability. The up-regulation of several claudins, including claudin-2, claudin-5, and claudin-6, are associated with decreases in epithelial barrier function (28Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 29Turksen K. Troy T.C. Development. 2002; 129: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kojima S. Rahner C. Peng S. Rizzolo L.J. J.

Biol. 2003; 29: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, these claudins are not necessarily inherently “leaky.” For instance, claudin-5 enhances barrier function in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and plays a critical role in maintaining blood-brain barrier function (32Morita K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 33Amasheh S. Schmidt T. Mahn M. Florian P. Mankertz J. Tavalali S. Gitter A.H. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These apparently paradoxical results may reflect that function of a given claudin will vary depending upon which other claudins are present. For instance, if heterotypic incompatibility (e.g. between claudin-5 and claudin-4) is a dominant interaction in lung epithelia, then increased claudin-5 expression would be expected to compromise tight junction integrity, as previously observed (31Wang F. Daugherty B. Keise L.L. Wei Z. Foley J.P. Savani R.C. Koval M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the endothelium, claudin-5 may be compatible with the other major endothelial claudin, claudin-12 (34Nitta T. Hata M. Gotoh S. Seo Y. Sasaki H. Hashimoto N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then up-regulation of claudin-5 might be expected to increase blood-brain barrier function. Alternatively, it is also possible that homotypic claudin-5 interactions dominate endothelial tight junctions and the junctions of some transfected cell models, in which case increased claudin-5 expression might also be expected to increase barrier function. Heterotypic interactions may also have more subtle effects on barrier function by regulating claudin paracellular ion channel activity. Although claudin permeability is mainly regulated by the EL1 domain (12Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), it is not known whether multiple EL1 domains contribute to net ion permeability. Also, whether the EL2 domain contributes to ion permeability is not known at present. We were unable to use HeLa cells for barrier function measurements, as these cells do not form a continuous monolayer able to cover a permeable support and instead form discrete colonies. Despite this limitation, transfected HeLa cells offered the ability to biochemically analyze binary claudin-claudin interactions in a claudin-null cell model that expresses other tight junction proteins. Note that claudin-transfected fibroblasts suffer from a similar limitation, since they create barriers that minimally limit macromolecular permeability and form monolayers with much lower resistance than epithelial monolayers (13Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 14Coyne C.B. Gambling T.M. Boucher R.C. Carson J.L. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1166-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A claudin-null cell model that will allow defined combinations of claudins to be functionally examined in high resistance monolayers is needed to better understand how EL1 and EL2 interact and to determine whether multiple claudins act in concert to regulate paracellular ion permeability.

However, inhibition of binding was competitive, increasing the apparent KD without much change in Bmax. Ibogaine increased the reactivity of cysteine residues positioned in the proposed cytoplasmic permeation pathway of SERT but not at nearby positions out of that pathway. In contrast, cysteines placed at positions in the extracellular permeation pathway reacted at slower rates in the presence of ibogaine.

Ibogaine is a hallucinogenic alkaloid found in the roots of the West African shrub Tabernanthe iboga. In Europe and North America, ibogaine has been promoted as a treatment for addiction, although clinical evidence has been difficult to obtain, partly due to its listing as a Schedule I controlled substance (1Popik P. Layer R. Skolnick P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 235-253PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vastag B. Science. 2005; 308: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and partly due to concerns about toxicity (3O'Hearn E. Molliver M.E. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Ibogaine has affinity for σ2 receptors, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, κ-opioid receptors, and serotonin and dopamine transporters (4Popik P. Layer R.T. Skolnick P. Psychopharmacology. 1994; 114: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Mach R.H. Smith C.R. Childers S.R.

Ibogaine is demethylated to 12-hydroxyibogamine (noribogaine), which has been reported to persist in the blood for over 24 h and to have even higher affinity for 5-HT transporters than ibogaine (8Mash D. Staley J. Baumann M. Rothman R. Hearn W. Life Sci. 1995; 57: PL45-PL50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 3The abbreviations used are:5-HT5-hydroxytryptamineSERTserotonin transporterβ-CIT2β-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)tropaneMTSEA2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromideTM5fifth transmembrane domainX5CSERT mutant with reactive cysteines mutated (C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A). transporter (SERT) is responsible for reuptake of 5-HT released from serotonergic neurons (9Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This protein is the target for antidepressant drugs, such as imipramine and fluoxetine, and psychostimulants, such as cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. SERT couples the entry of 5-HT into the cell to the entry of Na+ and Cl- and the exit of K+ (10Rudnick G. Reith M. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). The transport of 5-HT has been envisaged as a two-step process, where 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- are transported in a single step and K+ is transported in a second step (11Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10084-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These transport steps are proposed to interconvert two states of the transporter: an extracellular state that binds extracellular substrates and a cytoplasmic state that releases those substrates to the cytoplasm (9Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 5-hydroxytryptamine serotonin transporter 2β-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)tropane 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide fifth transmembrane domain SERT mutant with reactive cysteines mutated (C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A). SERT belongs to a large family of Na+-dependent transporters in prokaryotes and animals designated the SLC6 or NSS family. The high resolution x-ray structure of the prokaryotic leucine transporter LeuT (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) appears to be a good model for other members of the family, and homology models for SERT and other neurotransmitter transporters have been generated using structure-based alignments (13Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The utility of LeuT as a model for SERT has recently been validated by the identification of the Cl- binding site in SERT through analysis of the LeuT structure (14Forrest L.R. Tavoulari S. Zhang Y.-W. Rudnick G. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12761-12766Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This structure shows an aqueous pathway leading from the extracellular face of the protein almost to the leucine binding site. However, almost 20 Å of ordered protein structure separates that site from the cytoplasm, leaving unanswered the question of how bound substrates pass through to the cell interior. In SERT, the cysteine reagent 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) reacted with cysteine residues placed in the intracellular half of transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) even at positions predicted by the LeuT structure to be inaccessible (15Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The accessibility of these positions, as judged by the rate of the MTSEA reaction, varied in the presence of 5-HT and cocaine in a manner consistent with the proposal that TM5 contributes to the substrate permeation pathway between the cytoplasm and the binding site for 5-HT (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). According to this proposal, SERT undergoes conformational changes between two states. The extracellular state, stabilized by cocaine, is similar to the conformation of LeuT in the crystal structure, in which the TM5 residues would be buried and therefore less reactive with MTSEA. In the cytoplasmic state, favored in the presence of 5-HT, a cytoplasmic permeation pathway, formed partly by one face of TM5, connects the binding site with the cytoplasm, allowing dissociation of bound substrate and modification of cysteines placed in TM5. As a tool for identifying other parts of the cytoplasmic pathway, it would be advantageous to use an inhibitor that stabilized the cytoplasmic state of SERT. Most SERT inhibitors, including cocaine, are competitive inhibitors. This behavior is expected for a compound that binds to the same state of SERT that binds extracellular 5-HT. However, an inhibitor that bound to the cytoplasmic state might not act as a competitive inhibitor, since it would stabilize a conformation of SERT to which extracellular 5-HT could not bind. To our knowledge, there are only two examples of transporters with inhibitors binding specifically to each conformation. These are the adenine nucleotide exchanger of mitochondria, inhibited by atractyloside from the intramembrane space and bongkrekic acid from the matrix (17Buchanan B.B. Eiermann W. Riccio P. Aquila H. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2280-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the red cell glucose transporter, inhibited by cytochalasin B from the cytoplasm and ethylidineglucose from the cell surface (18Gorga F.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Neither of these transporters is in the NSS family, and in both cases, evidence for the sidedness of inhibitor binding was based primarily on kinetic measurements. In the present work, we used structural inferences from the LeuT structure and site-directed chemical modification to understand the mechanism by which ibogaine inhibits transport and binding by SERT. Expression of Rat SERTs—Rat SERT cysteine mutants used here were described previously (15Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, each mutant was subcloned into the X5C background construct, which is lacking all endogenous cysteine residues known to react with MTS reagents (19Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression system used has been described in detail elsewhere (20Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured in 96-well culture plates and allowed to grow overnight. The confluent cells were infected with recombinant VTF7–3 virus and transfected with a plasmid containing rat SERT cDNA under control of the T7 promoter. Transfected cells were incubated for 20–22 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then assayed for transport. Alternatively, LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing rat SERT were grown and assayed in 24-well plates as described (22Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Transport Assay—[3H]5-HT influx was assayed in monolayer cultures at room temperature. Transfected HeLa cells in 96-well plates were washed once with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM). Transport of 5-HT was measured by adding 100 μl of PBS/CM containing 20 nm [3H]5-HT (PerkinElmer) to each well and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. The assays were terminated by three rapid washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then solubilized in 30 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min. The extent of [3H]5-HT accumulated was determined by a Wallac Microbeta plate counter. To measure the effect of ibogaine, cocaine, or 5-HT on inactivation by MTSEA, HeLa cells expressing the appropriate rat SERT mutant were incubated with 10 μm ibogaine, cocaine, or 5-HT for 10 min in 50 μl of PBS/CM. This incubation was followed by the addition of MTSEA at the indicated concentrations in 50 μl of PBS/CM. After 10 min, the cells were washed five times with 100 μl of PBS/CM (Cells were incubated with PBS/CM between washes and gently rocked to ensure that all residual MTSEA, ibogaine, cocaine, or 5-HT was removed). Control wells that did not receive ibogaine, cocaine, or 5-HT were subjected to the same washes. Transport activity was then measured by the addition of 20 nm [3H]5-HT in 100 μl of PBS/CM. Membrane Preparation and Binding Assay—Binding assays with membranes from transfected HeLa cells and platelets were performed as described (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Rudnick G. Nelson P.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4739-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Binding of the 125I-labeled high affinity cocaine analogue, 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane (β-CIT), was measured in crude membrane preparations. HeLa cells grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks were transfected with rat SERT cDNA as described above. After overnight transfection, the cells were rinsed once with room temperature 10 mm lithium-HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES free acid brought to pH 8.0 with LiOH) and scraped into 10 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed by two cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication, and the resulting crude membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and stored at -80 °C in 0.1-ml aliquots until used. For membrane binding assays, aliquots of membranes from cells expressing rat SERT mutants were thawed on ice and diluted with 1 ml of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). Binding was measured in Multiscreen-FB 96-well filtration plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were pretreated by the addition of 200 μl of 0.1% polyethyleneimine to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The polyethyleneimine was rinsed away with 3 × 100 μl of room temperature binding buffer, and then 100 μl of the diluted membrane solution was added per well. The membranes were washed twice by filtration with 200 μl of binding buffer, and then binding was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.1 nm [125I]β-CIT (RTI-55; PerkinElmer). Binding was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The reaction was stopped by washing all wells three times with 100 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. The filters were removed from the plate and counted after soaking in 150 μl of Optifluor. For determination of MTSEA sensitivity, membranes in Multiscreen-FB wells preincubated with 5-HT, cocaine, or ibogaine, as indicated, were treated by the addition of MTSEA at varying concentrations for 15 min at room temperature, and then the reagent was removed by washing the membranes three times with binding buffer. The effect of MTSEA treatment was subsequently determined using [125I]β-CIT as described above. Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve-fitting algorithm. The statistical analysis given was from multiple experiments. Data with error bars in the figures represent the mean ± S.D. for triplicate measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t tests. Materials—Ibogaine was purchased from Sigma. [3H]5-HT and [125I]RTI-55 were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled RTI-55 was from RBI (Natick, MA). MTSEA was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Ibogaine Inhibits Transport and Binding by SERT—Ibogaine inhibits 5-HT accumulation by HeLa cells expressing SERT and also inhibits binding of the cocaine analog β-CIT to membranes prepared from those cells. The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that transport was inhibited by ibogaine with an IC50 of 6.3 ± 1.3 μm. Binding of the high affinity cocaine analog [125I]β-CIT also was inhibited by ibogaine with an IC50 value of 2.5 ± 0.2 μm. Ibogaine behaved as a noncompetitive inhibitor of 5-HT transport. The data in Fig. 2A demonstrate that inhibition of 5-HT transport into LLC-SERT cells was not reversed at higher concentrations of 5-HT. As shown in the Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 2B), inhibition of 5-HT transport was predominantly an effect on the Vmax (ordinate intercept), and there was little change in the Km for 5-HT (-slope). To ensure that [3H]5-HT and ibogaine had equal access to their respective binding sites on SERT, they were added simultaneously in this experiment. In separate experiments, ibogaine preincubation with the cells for 15 min had no effect on the extent of inhibition (data not shown). In contrast to the noncompetitive inhibition of transport, ibogaine was a competitive inhibitor of [125I]β-CIT binding to human platelet plasma membranes. Fig. 3 is a Scatchard plot showing that the maximum amount of β-CIT binding in the presence of 5 μm ibogaine (abscissa intercept) is similar to the control. Ibogaine decreased the slope of the Scatchard plot, which is equivalent to -1/KD (app). From the increase in the apparent KD for β-CIT, we calculated a KI of 2.26 ± 0.57 μm for ibogaine. Ibogaine Influences the Reactivity of SERT S277C—To determine whether ibogaine had an influence on the equilibrium of SERT between cytoplasmic and extracellular states, we determined its ability to influence the reactivity of cysteine residues positioned in the cytoplasmic and extracellular permeation pathways. We previously demonstrated that in TM5 of SERT, cysteine residues placed on one face of the cytoplasmic half of that helix reacted faster in the presence of 5-HT and slower in the presence of cocaine, consistent with the ability of cocaine to favor the extracellular state of SERT and 5-HT to trigger the conversion to the cytoplasmic state (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These measurements of reactivity depend on the ability of reagents such as MTSEA to inactivate binding of the cocaine analog β-CIT. The SERT mutants studied contained cysteine residues accessible only from the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. In intact cells expressing these mutants, β-CIT binding was not sensitive to extracellular MTSEA, but binding to membranes prepared from these cells was sensitive (15Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because β-CIT, like cocaine, is thought to bind to an extracellular site, it is unlikely that MTSEA inactivated binding by directly modifying the binding site, but rather by an allosteric mechanism. We proposed that by modifying cysteines in or near the cytoplasmic permeation pathway, MTSEA prevented the conformational change required to close that pathway and open the extracellular cocaine binding site (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows the effect of ibogaine on inactivation of three SERT mutants. X5C is the background construct in which the five reactive endogenous cysteine residues have been mutated (19Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); S277C and K279C (in the X5C background) have cysteine residues positioned on the accessible face of TM5 and on the opposite face, respectively. As previously shown, [125I]β-CIT binding to X5C was insensitive to MTSEA concentrations up to 2 mm. K279C and S277C were both sensitive, and in this experiment 30% inactivation of binding activity required MTSEA concentrations of 0.05 and 2 mm in S277C and K279C, respectively, due to their different reactivities. When the inactivation was carried out in the presence of ibogaine, the reactivity of S277C increased, leading to more inactivation, but ibogaine did not increase inactivation of X5C or K279C. Fig. 4B shows that the effect of ibogaine on S277C was similar to that of 5-HT but opposite the effect of cocaine, indicating that ibogaine and 5-HT both increase the reactivity of Cys-277. By measuring the amount of inactivation as a function of MTSEA, we can estimate the rate constant for inactivation. Fig. 5 shows that the concentration of half-maximal inactivation varied over 14-fold when the reaction was performed in the presence of 10 μm ibogaine, 5-HT, or cocaine. However, the extent of inactivation was relatively constant at 70–80% of the untreated activity. This result supports the proposal that 5-HT, cocaine, and ibogaine affect the rate of inactivation and do not alter the consequences of modification by MTSEA (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). If cocaine, 5-HT, or ibogaine had altered the consequence of MTSEA reaction with S277C, we might expect to observe different levels of inactivation at saturating MTSEA concentrations. Because this was not observed, and only the rate was affected, we interpret the results to indicate that cocaine, 5-HT, and ibogaine altered reactivity of Cys-277 by altering the accessibility of MTSEA to the cytoplasmic permeation pathway. For each of the other cysteine mutants tested, we used the same approach, and in each case, the rate of inactivation and not the extent was altered by inhibitor or substrate addition. As with S277C, we interpreted changes in inactivation rate to indicate changes in accessibility of each reactive cysteine residue. Previous studies suggested that the opposing influences of 5-HT and cocaine on accessibility were due to the stabilization of cytoplasmic and extracellular states of SERT (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The observation that ibogaine, like 5-HT, increased the accessibility of Cys-277 suggests that they both favor the cytoplasmic state of SERT. Ibogaine Increases Accessibility in Other TM5 Cysteine Mutants—Using data similar to the data shown in Fig. 5, we tested the effect of ibogaine on eight additional cysteine mutants. In three, like S277C, cysteine replaced residues on the face of TM5 in contact with the cytoplasmic permeation pathway (G273C, V281C, and T284C) (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Three other cysteine replacements were made on the opposite face of TM5 (K272C, T276C, and W282C). Finally, two positions likely to lie in the extracellular pathway (Y107C and S404C), where cysteine was shown previously to be protected by 5-HT (24Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Mitchell S.M. Lee E. Garcia M.L. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), were also tested. Fig. 6A shows that for all of the cysteine replacements on the reactive face of TM5, the rate constant for inactivation was increased by ibogaine. As shown previously, cocaine decreased the rate constant for all of these mutants, whereas 5-HT increased the rate for all except for T284C (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cysteine replacement mutants at TM5 positions not in contact with the permeation pathway did not react faster in the presence of ibogaine. We found a moderate decrease in reactivity for 5-HT, cocaine, and ibogaine with each of those mutants (Fig. 6B). Decreased Accessibility of Extracellular Positions—In contrast to the increased reactivity of positions in the cytoplasmic pathway, cysteine replacement mutants at positions extracellular to the substrate binding site reacted much more slowly with MTSEA in the presence of ibogaine (Fig. 6C). As described previously, 5-HT also decreased the reactivity of both of these mutants, and cocaine slightly increased the reactivity of Y107C (24Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Mitchell S.M. Lee E. Garcia M.L. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows, in the context of a SERT homology model based on the LeuT structure, the TM5 residues exposed by ibogaine (red), those TM5 residues not exposed (blue), and extracellular residues protected by ibogaine (green). A leucine molecule marks the substrate binding site in the center of the protein. The evidence presented here supports the proposal that ibogaine binds to and stabilizes the cytoplasmic conformation of SERT, in which the substrate binding site is accessible from the cytoplasm. We previously identified positions on one face of TM5 that became more reactive in the presence of 5-HT and less reactive in the presence of cocaine (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We interpret these reactivity changes as resulting from changes in accessibility. Because the corresponding positions are inaccessible in the crystal structure of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of SERT (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), we proposed that the increase in accessibility with 5-HT represented a conformational change required for bound 5-HT to dissociate to the cytoplasm. Consistent with this proposal, the 5-HT-induced accessibility increase required the presence of Na+ and Cl-, which are co-transported with 5-HT and are predicted by the alternating access model of transport to be essential for translocation (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this experimental approach, we used inactivation of β-CIT binding as a measure of cysteine reactivity. We proposed that after MTSEA reacts with TM5 cysteines in the cytoplasmic permeation pathway, the modified transporter cannot exist in the extracellular state and thus cannot bind cocaine or β-CIT (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Results from our previous studies are most consistent with the proposal that the reactive TM5 residues are accessible in the cytoplasmic state of SERT but not in the extracellular state. Therefore, it follows that insertion of a 2-thioethylamine group within this pathway by MTSEA might prevent the pathway from closing and therefore prevent conversion of SERT to the extracellular state that binds β-CIT (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the alternating access model, transport proteins are proposed to switch between at least two conformational states, which bind substrate from opposite sides of the membrane. As a tool for studying substrate permeation pathways, conformational states, and the structural mechanism of transporters, it is extremely useful to have ligands that stabilize transporters in each of these two conformations. To date, we are aware of only two other transporters, the adenine nucleotide exchanger of mitochondria and the red cell glucose transporter, where separate inhibitors are known to bind to the two states (17Buchanan B.B. Eiermann W. Riccio P. Aquila H. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2280-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Gorga F.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SERT now becomes only the third transporter and the first co-transporter in this category. The efficacy of ibogaine to stabilize the cytoplasmic state of SERT was demonstrated not only by its ability to increase accessibility of positions in the cytoplasmic pathway but also by its ability to decrease the accessibility of positions 107 and 404 in the extracellular pathway, as predicted if the extracellular pathway closed when the cytoplasmic pathway opened. The evidence that ibogaine stabilizes the cytoplasmic state of SERT comes from both kinetic and structural approaches. Ibogaine is unique in its noncompetitive inhibition of SERT (Fig. 2). Inhibition by other known inhibitors was overcome by increased 5-HT concentrations. Although there are other mechanisms that lead to noncompetitive inhibition, we can understand the mechanism of ibogaine inhibition in the context of its ability to stabilize the cytoplasmic conformation of SERT. In this interpretation, ibogaine inhibition of transport is due to biasing the equilibrium between extracellular and cytoplasmic states of SERT toward the cytoplasmic state. In the transport studies shown in Figs. 1 and 2, 5-HT was added to the cell exterior, depleted of SERT binding sites by ibogaine. Because the ibogaine-inhibited state of SERT had no ability to bind extracellular 5-HT, adding more 5-HT could not reverse the conformational bias induced by ibogaine. In contrast, equilibrium binding studies with β-CIT showed ibogaine to be a competitive inhibitor, as expected if binding of ibogaine and β-CIT, a cocaine analog, were mutually exclusive and SERT could not bind both compounds simultaneously. Competitive binding inhibition would most directly be explained by competition for the same binding site. However, noncompetitive inhibition of transport suggested that ibogaine and 5-HT did not bind to the same site, and competition between 5-HT and cocaine analogues suggested that those two did bind at the same or overlapping site(s) (26Wall S.C. Innis R.B. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 264-270PubMed Google Scholar, 27Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To resolve this apparent contradiction, we speculate that ibogaine and cocaine bound to sites that are mutually exclusive, because they exist on different conformational states of SERT. This interpretation is supported by the finding that ibogaine and cocaine induce or stabilize different SERT conformations, as measured by their opposing effects on the reactivity of cysteine residues in the extracellular and cytoplasmic permeation pathways (Fig. 6). An alternative explanation, that ibogaine caused internalization of SERT, is unlikely, because ibogaine inhibition was maximal immediately after addition and did not increase with a 15-min preincubation. In other experiments (not shown), ibogaine failed to alter surface expression of SERT as measured by biotinylation. The behavior of T284C provides an important insight into the difference between the effects of 5-HT and ibogaine. This mutant was, in contrast to all of the other mutants containing a cysteine on the reactive face of TM5, less reactive toward MTSEA in the presence of 5-HT. Because 5-HT must bind to both extracellular and cytoplasmic states of SERT as it is transported across the membrane, it is not a priori more likely to bind to one state or the other. Moreover, it is not unexpected that SERT mutants, particularly mutations close to the substrate binding site, might differ in their affinity for 5-HT in the two states. A likely explanation for the difference between the effect of 5-HT on T284C and its effect on the other reactive TM5 cysteine mutants is that the other mutants (G273C, S277C, and V281C in this study) bound 5-HT more avidly to the cytoplasmic state of SERT, but T284C bound 5-HT more avidly to the extracellular state. If ibogaine bound to SERT only in the cytoplasmic state, we would expect it to stabilize that state, in which the entire reactive region of TM5, including positions 273, 277, 281, and 284, were more accessible to MTSEA. Thus, the ability of ibogaine, but not 5-HT, to increase T284C reactivity (Fig. 6) is an expected consequence of 5-HT binding to both states and ibogaine binding to just the cytoplasmic state. Like 5-HT, ibogaine contains an indole nucleus, with an amino group separated by two carbons from the 3-position of the indole ring and a substituted 5-position (Fig. 8). In 5-HT, the 5-substituent is a hydroxyl group, and the amino group is unsubstituted, but in ibogaine, a methoxy group replaces the hydroxyl, and the amino group is at the bridgehead of a constrained tricyclic system (Fig. 8). It may not be coincidental that the structure of 5-HT is essentially contained within the ibogaine structure. The constrained orientation of the aminoethyl side chain of 5-HT may allow ibogaine to occupy the 5-HT binding site of SERT only in the cytoplasmic conformation. We plan further studies to determine if ibogaine indeed binds to the 5-HT site and from which side of the plasma membrane it binds. Ibogaine is unique in its ability to stabilize the cytoplasmic conformation of SERT. Because it is also a hallucinogen with putative anti-addiction properties, it is pertinent to consider the possibility that these effects are due, in some part, to the interaction of ibogaine with SERT. Selective SERT inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, have none of the dramatic behavioral consequences of ibogaine, and ibogaine is known to have moderate affinity for other targets, such as σ2 receptors (28Bowen W.D. Vilner B.J. Williams W. Bertha C.M. Kuehne M.E. Jacobson A.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 279: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although it has negligible affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, or dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (29Toll L. Berzetei-Gurske I. Polgar W. Brandt S. Adapa I. Rodriguez L. Schwartz R. Haggart D. O'Brien A. White A. Kennedy J. Craymer K. Farrington L. Auh J. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1998; 178: 440-466PubMed Google Scholar). Given the present state of uncertainty with respect to ibogaine action, it may be that some consequence of its interaction with SERT, such as the possibility that it activates one of the many ionic currents that SERT conducts (30Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), could play a role in its pharmacologic actions.

https://openalex.org/W1968793799,"GPR40 was formerly an orphan G protein-coupled receptor whose endogenous ligands have recently been identified as free fatty acids (FFAs). The receptor, now named FFA receptor 1, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and is a drug target because of its role in FFA-mediated enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin release. Guided by molecular modeling, we investigated the molecular determinants contributing to binding of linoleic acid, a C18 polyunsaturated FFA, and GW9508, a synthetic small molecule agonist. Twelve residues within the putative GPR40-binding pocket including hydrophilic/positively charged, aromatic, and hydrophobic residues were identified and were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Our results suggest that linoleic acid and GW9508 are anchored on their carboxylate groups by Arg183, Asn244, and Arg258. Moreover, His86, Tyr91, and His137 may contribute to aromatic and/or hydrophobic interactions with GW9508 that are not present, or relatively weak, with linoleic acid. The anchor residues, as well as the residues Tyr12, Tyr91, His137, and Leu186, appear to be important for receptor activation also. Interestingly, His137 and particularly His86 may interact with GW9508 in a manner dependent on its protonation status. The greater number of putative interactions between GPR40 and GW9508 compared with linoleic acid may explain the higher potency of GW9508."
https://openalex.org/W1964619821,"Previous studies have suggested that Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog that does not exhibit appreciable affinity for the caspase 8-generated C-terminal Bid fragment (tBid), diminishes sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). This study was performed to determine the mechanism by which Mcl-1 confers TRAIL resistance and to evaluate methods for overcoming this resistance. Affinity purification/immunoblotting assays using K562 human leukemia cells, which contain Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL as the predominant antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologs, demonstrated that TRAIL treatment resulted in binding of tBid to Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1. In contrast, TRAIL caused increased binding between Mcl-1 and Bak that was diminished by treatment with the caspase 8 inhibitor N-(Nα-acetylisoleucylglutamylthreonyl) aspartic acid (O-methyl ester)-fluoromethyl ketone (IETD(OMe)-fmk) or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125. In addition, TRAIL caused increased binding of Bim and Puma to Mcl-1 that was inhibited by IETD(OMe)-fmk but not SP600125. Further experiments demonstrated that down-regulation of Mcl-1 by short hairpin RNA or the kinase inhibitor sorafenib increased TRAIL-induced Bak activation and death ligand-induced apoptosis in a wide variety of neoplastic cell lines as well as clinical acute myelogenous leukemia specimens. Collectively, these observations not only suggest a model in which Mcl-1 confers TRAIL resistance by serving as a buffer for Bak, Bim, and Puma, but also identify sorafenib as a potential modulator of TRAIL sensitivity.

Med. 2001; 193: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Consistent with this postulated function, TRAIL is expressed on interferon-activated natural killer cells as well as monocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells (1Smyth M.J. Takeda K. Hayakawa Y.

TRAIL and agonistic anti-TRAIL receptor antibodies kill target cells by triggering the extrinsic caspase activation pathway. According to current understanding, the binding of TRAIL or agonistic antibodies to the extracellular domains of DR4 and/or DR5 leads to recruitment and oligomerization of the adaptor molecule FADD at the receptor cytoplasmic domains (11Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 12Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 13Wang S. El-Deiry W.S.

Oligomerized FADD in turn binds and activates procaspases 8 and 10. Once activated, these initiator caspases cleave a small number of substrates, including the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid and the zymogen form of the major effector caspase, caspase 3 (15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). In so-called type I cells, the amounts of caspase 8 and caspase 3 that are activated downstream of FADD are sufficient to trigger the entire apoptotic process (16Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In type II cells, on the other hand, the amount of caspase 8 that is initially activated is insufficient to trigger full-blown apoptosis (16Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Instead, caspase 8-mediated cleavage of Bid ostensibly leads to mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which participates in amplification of the death signal through caspase 9 activation (11Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 12Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 13Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Concomitant release of mitochondrial XIAP antagonists in type II cells is thought to facilitate apoptosis by relieving XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition (17Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M.

Conversely, overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, which bind tBid and inhibit mitochondrial permeabilization, has been observed to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis in type II cells (20Ruiz de Almodovar C.

In particular, siRNA- or shRNA-mediated Mcl-1 down-regulation enhances TRAIL cytotoxicity in cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma cells (27Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 28Wirth T. Kuhnel F. Fleischmann-Mundt B. Woller N. Djojosubroto M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 10153-10163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Several explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. On the one hand, it has been suggested that Mcl-1 down-regulation frees the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim, which then binds to Bax to induce apoptosis (29Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10153-10163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This explanation, however, is difficult to reconcile with earlier studies that failed to implicate Bim as a prominent factor involved in death ligand-induced mitochondrial permeabilization (30Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 31Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has also been reported that Mcl-1 binds directly to tBid, inhibiting its ability to facilitate mitochondrial permeabilization (32Clohessy J.G. Zhuang J. de Boer J. Gil-Gomez G. Brady H.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5750-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This model, however, conflicts with affinity measurements that demonstrate a >10 μm Kd value for the interaction between Mcl-1 and the Bid BH3 domain (33Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J.

Accordingly, the mechanistic basis for the ability of Mcl-1 to modulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis requires further investigation. Additional studies have demonstrated that JNK, a kinase that modulates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in other contexts (35Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D.

In several model systems this TRAIL-induced JNK activation contributes to TRAIL cytotoxicity (40Herr I. Wilhelm D. Meyer E. Jeremias I. Angel P. Debatin K.M.

A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim (46Corazza N. Jakob S. Schaer C. Frese S. Keogh A. Stroka D. Kassahn D. Torgler R. Mueller C. Schneider P. Brunner T. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2493-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In other model systems, on the other hand, a contribution of JNK activation to the cytotoxicity of TRAIL has been difficult to demonstrate (42Puduvalli V.K. Sampath D. Bruner J.M. Nangia J. Xu R. Kyritsis A.P. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 43Varfolomeev E. Maecker H. Sharp D. Lawrence D. Renz M. Vucic D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

To gain further insight into the ability of Mcl-1 to modulate death receptor-induced apoptosis, we have examined changes in the binding of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to Mcl-1 during the course of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Results of this analysis demonstrated increased binding of Bak, Bim, and Puma but not tBid to Mcl-1 during TRAIL treatment. Based on the concept that Mcl-1 serves as a buffer for Bak, Bim, and Puma after TRAIL treatment, we further examined the effect of shRNA-mediated or pharmacological Mcl-1 down-regulation on TRAIL sensitivity. Results of the latter experiments demonstrate that sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor (48Strumberg D. Drugs Today. 2005; 41: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) that induces rapid Mcl-1 down-regulation (49Yu C. Bruzek L.M. Meng X.W. Gores G.J. Carter C.A. Kaufmann S.H. Adjei A.A.

Materials—Sorafenib was a kind gift from Chris Carter, Bayer Corp. (West Haven, CT). Additional reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: recombinant human TRAIL and agonistic anti-DR5 antibody 71903 (MAB631) from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); CH-11 agonistic anti-Fas antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (51Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol.

Antibodies for immunoblotting or flow cytometry were obtained from the following suppliers: murine monoclonal antibodies that recognize XIAP, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, caspase 3, and caspase 8 from BD Biosciences; monoclonal anti-Fas (Apo-1-1), anti-DR4 (HS101), and anti-DR5 (HS201) from Alexis (San Diego, CA); murine Ab-1 monoclonal antibody to active Bak from Calbiochem; murine monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 and rabbit polyclonal anti-Mcl-1 from Dako (Carpinteria, CA); rabbit anti-Bax and goat anti-actin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-Puma from Axxora (San Diego, CA); rabbit anti-Bak from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize Akt, Bid, Bim, Bcl-xL, JNK, and phospho-Thr183Tyr185 JNK from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and murine anti-FLAG epitope antibody from Sigma. Murine monoclonal antibodies that recognize PARP, heat shock protein 90, and histone H1 were gifts from Dr. G. Poirier (Laval University, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada), David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), and James Sorace (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore), respectively. Cell Culture—All cell lines were maintained in medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. K562 cells were maintained in medium A, which consisted of RPMI 1640 medium with 5% (v/v) FBS. Jurkat cells (from Paul Leibson, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), HL-60 cells, and T98G cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS (medium B). KBM5 cells (from Joya Chandra, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS (medium C). Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—pcDNA3.1 containing the full-length Mcl-1 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Ruth Craig (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). To generate plasmid encoding tagged Mcl-1 for S proteinagarose pulldowns, a 15-amino acid S peptide tag (KETAAAKFERQHMDS) with GA linker (total 28 amino acids) was inserted at the N terminus of wild-type Mcl-1 essentially as described (52Hackbarth J.S. Lee S.-H. Meng X.W. Vroman B.T. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 835-839PubMed Google Scholar). To allow re-expression of untagged Mcl-1 in cells expressing Mcl-1 shRNA, the wild-type Mcl-1 cDNA was rendered shRNA-resistant by mutating the cDNA to CGCGATTGGCTGGTAAAGC to induce silent mutations (indicated by underlines) of the third nucleotides in five of the targeted codons using a QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the supplier's instructions. A plasmid encoding S peptide-tagged Bcl-xL was constructed by isolating cDNA encoding codons 2–234 of the Bcl-xL open reading frame and inserting the cDNA into the AscI and EcoRI sites of pSPN (52Hackbarth J.S. Lee S.-H. Meng X.W. Vroman B.T. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 835-839PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length Bid cDNA, amplified by reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA extracted from K562 cells, was cloned in-frame with FLAG into the pCI2 vector using EcoRI and NotI sites. Bak shRNA targeted the sequence 5′-GTACGAAGATTCTTCAAAT-3′ using the vector pCMS4A-EGFP. All plasmids were subjected to automated sequencing to verify the described alteration and confirm that no additional mutations were present. These plasmids were prepared for transfection using a plasmid maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfections—For transient transfections with shRNA, 1 × 107 K562 cells were transfected with 40 μg of empty pSSH1P vector or vector encoding a previously described Mcl-1 shRNA (27Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Greg Gores) and 5 μg of plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused to histone H2B (a kind gift from Jan van Deursen, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) using a BTX 820 square wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA) programmed to deliver a 10-ms pulse at 320 V. Under these conditions K562 cells have a 60–80% transfection efficiency when monitored by flow cytometry for EGFP fluorescence. In some experiments, 20 μg of pcDNA3.1 without an insert or with cDNA encoding siRNA-resistant Mcl-1 was included as indicated. 24 h after transfection, cells were sorted based on EGFP expression and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described previously (53Kaufmann S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of TRAIL. At the completion of the incubation, cell death was assessed using APC-coupled annexin V as described below. Data were analyzed by gating on cells that were EGFP-positive. Transient transfections with plasmid encoding FLAG epitope-tagged Bid were performed in a similar manner using 40 μg of plasmid DNA. 24 h after transfection, cells were utilized for pulldown assays as described below. To generate stable cell lines, aliquots containing 1 × 107 K562 cells were transfected with 40 μg of plasmid encoding S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells were transferred to medium A containing 800 μg/ml G418. After the G418-resistant cells grew to ∼5 × 105/ml, clones were isolated by limiting dilution and assayed for transgene expression by blotting with anti-S peptide monoclonal antibody (52Hackbarth J.S. Lee S.-H. Meng X.W. Vroman B.T. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 835-839PubMed Google Scholar). Pulldown Assays—To assess changes in binding of partners to Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, K562 cells expressing S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL were treated with 25 ng/ml TRAIL for 0–5 h. At the completion of the incubation, cells were solubilized at 4 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer consisting of 1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 nm microcystin. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min to sediment insoluble material, aliquots of supernatant containing 1000 μg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 40 μl of S protein-agarose (EMD Biosciences, San Diego) and washed five times in lysis buffer. Polypeptides bound to the beads were released by heating for 20 min at 65 °C in SDS sample buffer consisting of 4 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. After blots were probed with antibodies (53Kaufmann S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), films from at least three independent experiments were scanned on a Hewlett Packard Scanjet 4C scanner and quantified using ImageJ software. After normalization for Mcl-1 content, results were analyzed using paired t tests and presented as the mean ± S.D. of the indicated number of experiments. Assays of Apoptosis—After treatment with the indicated concentrations of JNK inhibitors, sorafenib and/or TRAIL, cells were washed, lysed at 4 °C in buffer consisting of 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, and subjected to flow cytometry as described previously to assess DNA fragmentation (54Nicoletti I.

In parallel experiments, cells were fixed in 3:1 (v/v) methanol/acetic acid, stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, and examined by fluorescence microscopy for apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology (56Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In further experiments, cells were stained with APC-conjugated annexin V and 0.1 μg/ml propidium iodide in 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) as instructed by the supplier. For this assay, 30,000 events were collected from the FL2 (excitation 488 nm, emission 585 ± 21 nm) and FL4 (excitation 635 nm, emission 661 ± 8 nm) channels of a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Clonogenic Assays—Aliquots containing 0.25 × 106 K562 cells in 1 ml of medium A were incubated with the indicated concentrations of sorafenib and TRAIL for 24 h. Cells were then sedimented at 80 × g for 5 min, resuspended in fresh medium A, diluted, and plated in 35-mm gridded plates in the medium of Pike and Robinson (57Pike B.L. Robinson W.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1970; 76: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) containing 0.3% (w/v) Bacto agar (BD Biosciences). After incubation for 10–14 days at 37 °C, colonies containing ≥50 cells were counted on an inverted microscope. Alternatively, aliquots containing 250 T98G cells were plated in replicate 35-mm tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for 14 h. After treatment with the indicated concentration of sorafenib and agonistic anti-DR5 antibody for 24 h, cells were washed, incubated for 7–8 days, stained with Coomassie Blue, and manually examined for colony formation. Diluent-treated plates typically contained 150 colonies. Analysis of Cell Surface Death Receptor Expression—1 × 106 cells were stained with mouse apo-1-1 anti-Fas, HS101 anti-DR4, or HS201 anti-DR5 on ice for 45 min. After two washes in PBS containing 2% (v/v) FBS, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for an additional 30 min on ice.

https://openalex.org/W2050772120,"There is an emerging body of evidence implicating iron in carcinogenesis and in particular colorectal cancer, but whether this involves Wnt signalling, a major oncogenic signalling pathway has not been studied. We aimed to determine the effect of iron loading on Wnt signalling using mutant APC (Caco-2 and SW480) and wild-type APC (HEK-293 and human primary fibroblasts) containing cell lines. Elevating cellular iron levels in Caco-2 and SW480 cells caused increased Wnt signalling as indicated by increased TOPFLASH reporter activity, increased mRNA expression of two known targets, c-myc and Nkd1, and increased cellular proliferation. In contrast wild-type APC and β-catenin-containing lines, HEK 293 and human primary fibroblasts were not responsive to iron loading. This was verified in SW480 cells that no longer induced iron-mediated Wnt signalling when transfected with wild-type APC. The cell line LS174T, wild type for APC but mutant for β-catenin, was also responsive suggesting that the role of iron is to regulate β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that E-cadherin status has no influence on iron-mediated Wnt signalling. We thus speculate that excess iron could exacerbate tumorigenesis in the background of APC loss, a common finding in cancers."

In this study the formation of PSI-6130-triphosphate was characterized in primary human hepatocytes. PSI-6130 and its 5′-phosphorylated derivatives were identified, and the intracellular concentrations were determined. In addition, the deaminated derivative of PSI-6130, β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methyluridine (RO2433, PSI-6026) and its corresponding phosphorylated metabolites were identified in human hepatocytes after incubation with PSI-6130. The formation of the 5′-triphosphate (TP) of PSI-6130 (PSI-6130-TP) and RO2433 (RO2433-TP) increased with time and reached steady state levels at 48 h. The formation of both PSI-6130-TP and RO2433-TP demonstrated a linear relationship with the extracellular concentrations of PSI-6130 up to 100 μm, suggesting a high capacity of human hepatocytes to generate the two triphosphates. The mean half-lives of PSI-6130-TP and RO2433-TP were 4.7 and 38 h, respectively. RO2433-TP also inhibited RNA synthesis by the native HCV replicase isolated from HCV replicon cells and the recombinant HCV polymerase NS5B with potencies comparable with those of PSI-6130-TP. Incorporation of RO2433-5′-monophosphate (MP) into nascent RNA by NS5B led to chain termination similar to that of PSI-6130-MP.

New treatment options with improved clinical efficacy and greater tolerability are urgently needed. Novel antiviral agents targeting essential processes of HCV replication as part of optimized combination regimens could achieve increased clinical efficacy and potentially improved adverse event profiles as well as shortened treatment duration as compared with the current standard of care. HCV RNA replication is mediated by a membrane-associated multiprotein replication complex (5Hardy R.W. Marcotrigiano J. Blight K.J. Majors J.E. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Ma H. Leveque V. De Witte A. Li W. Hendricks T. Clausen S.M. Cammack N. Klumpp K. Virology. 2005; 332: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The HCV NS5B protein, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is the catalytic subunit of the HCV replication complex and is responsible for the synthesis of the RNA progeny and, hence, is a prime target of anti-viral inhibition. Nucleoside analogs have been established as successful antiviral agents targeting the active site of DNA polymerases for the treatment of other viral diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and herpes simplex virus (7Vivet-Boudou V. Didierjean J. Isel C. Marquet R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The majority of marketed antiviral nucleoside analogs need to be converted to the active 5′-triphosphate forms in the target cells. These nucleotide triphosphate analogs then serve as alternative substrates for the viral DNA polymerases and compete with the incorporation of the corresponding natural nucleotide triphosphates. Upon incorporation by the viral DNA polymerases, the lack of the 3′-hydroxyl group in the deoxyribose moiety leads to the termination of the nascent viral DNA (chain termination). In the past few years a number of ribonucleoside analogs with 2′-C-methyl, 2′-O-methyl, or 4′-azido substituents on the ribose moiety have been reported to be inhibitors of HCV replication in the subgenomic replicon system (8Carroll S.S.

Prodrugs of two nucleoside analogs, 2′-C-methylcytidine (NM107) and 4′-azidocytidine (R1479), have successfully progressed into clinical development and shown efficacy in HCV-infected patients (14Afdhal, N., Rodriguez-Torres, M., Lawitz, E., Godofsky, E., Chao, G., Fielman, B., Knox, S., and N., B.

The corresponding nucleotide triphosphate analogs are substrates for HCV polymerase NS5B and inhibit RNA synthesis activity of HCV NS5B in vitro. The incorporation of the nucleotide analogs into nascent HCV RNA strongly reduces the efficiency of further RNA elongation by NS5B, resulting in termination of the nascent RNA product. Therefore, these nucleoside analogs are non-obligatory chain terminators despite the presence of a 3′-hydroxyl group. Recently, β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methylcytidine (PSI-6130) has been identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of HCV replication in the subgenomic replicon system with little or no cytotoxicity in various human cell lines or bone marrow precursor cells (16Stuyver L.J. McBrayer T.R. Tharnish P.M. Clark J. Hollecker L. Lostia S. Nachman T. Grier J. Bennett M.A. Xie M.Y. Schinazi R.F. Morrey J.D. Julander J.L. Furman P.A. Otto M.J. Antiviral Chem.

Conversion to the active 5′-triphosphate form by cellular kinases is an important part of the mechanism of action for nucleoside analogs. In this study we determined the metabolism of β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methylcytidine in primary human hepatocytes isolated from several donors. We show that β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methylcytidine was converted to β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methylcytidine 5′-triphosphate and β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methyluridine 5′-triphosphate via deamination of the phosphorylated cytidylates. Furthermore, we determined the kinetics of the formation of the two active triphosphates and the potency of the two triphosphates against the native HCV replicase and NS5B as well as the molecular mechanism of action of the two triphosphates. Compounds—β-d-2′-Deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methylcytidine (PSI-6130) was provided by Pharmasset, Inc. (18Clark J.L. Hollecker L. Mason J.C. Stuyver L.J. Tharnish P.M. Lostia S. McBrayer T.R. Schinazi R.F.

A stock solution of 10 mm PSI-6130 was prepared in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and stored at –20 °C. Tritium-labeled PSI-6130 was synthesized at Roche Palo Alto LLC. The tritiated compound was dissolved in 50% (v/v) ethanol at the concentration of 0.97 mCi/ml with a specific activity of 25.78 Ci/mmol. The stock solution was stored at –20 °C. The phosphorylated derivatives of PSI-6130, namely PSI-6130-MP, -DP, and -TP, were provided by Pharmasset, Inc. β-d-2′-Deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methyluridine (RO2433) was synthesized at Roche Palo Alto LLC. RO2433-MP, -DP, and -TP were synthesized by TriLink BioTechnologies (San Diego, CA). Compound stock solutions were prepared in nuclease-free H2O and stored at –20 °C. 3′-dCTP was purchased from TriLink BioTechnologies. Cell Culture of Primary Human Hepatocytes—Plated fresh human hepatocytes or hepatocyte suspensions were obtained either from CellzDirect, Inc. or from In Vitro Technologies, Inc. Fresh human hepatocytes obtained from each company were plated or cultured on 6-well collagen coated plates (BD Biosciences #356400) at 1.5 million cells per well using complete serum containing medium obtained from the respective companies. Cells were allowed to recover for at least 18 h before the addition of the compound. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To determine the time course of uptake and phosphorylation of PSI-6130, human primary hepatocytes were incubated with 3H-labeled PSI-6130 at a final concentration of 2 μm and 10 μCi/ml. The compound was added 72, 48, 24, 16, 6 and 1 h before cell harvesting. All time points and untreated cell controls were set up in duplicates. To determine the dose response of the phosphorylation of PSI-6130, human primary hepatocytes were incubated with 3H-labeled PSI-6130 at 0, 2, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 250 μm for 24 h. Final concentrations of PSI-6130 were achieved by supplementing 3H-labeled PSI-6130 with non-radiolabeled PSI-6130. Duplicate cell samples were harvested after 24 h of incubation. To determine the half-life of the triphosphates of PSI-6130 and RO2433, human primary hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h with 3H-labeled PSI-6130 at 2 μm and 10 μCi/ml. The cell monolayer was washed once with the cell culture medium without PSI-6130 and then incubated with fresh medium without PSI-6130 at 0-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h time points after the removal of PSI-6130. Duplicate cell samples were set up for each time point. The viable cell numbers of the untreated cell controls for each experiment were determined at the end of the experiment using the trypan blue exclusion method. Preparation of Cell Extract for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis—At the time of cell harvest the cell culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into 1 ml of pre-chilled 60% (v/v) methanol and extracted in methanol for 24 h at –20 °C. The extracted samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and evaporated in a speed vacuum at room temperature. The pellets were stored at –80 °C until analysis. The dried pellets of cell extracts were dissolved in H2O and filtered though a nanosep MF centrifugal device (Pall Life Sciences #ODM02C34). Before HPLC analysis, cell extract samples were spiked with unlabeled reference standards PSI-6130, RO2433, and their phosphorylated derivatives. HPLC—The phosphorylated derivatives of PSI-6130 were separated by ion exchange HPLC with a Whatman Partisil 10 SAX (4.6 × 250 mm) column coupled to a radiometric detector (β-RAM, IN/US Systems, Inc.). The mobile phase gradient changed linearly from 0% buffer A (H2O) to 100% buffer B (0.5 m KH2PO4 + 0.8 m KCl) between 4 and 8 min. 100% buffer B ran from 8 to 18 min and changed back to 100% A in 1 min. Buffer A ran until 25 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. A ratio of 5:1 Flo Scint IV or Ultima-Flo™ AP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to column eluent was used for the detection of radiolabeled species in the β-RAM detector (IN/US Systems, Inc.). The separation of PSI-6130 and RO2433 was performed by reverse phase chromatography with a Zorbax SB-C8 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) coupled to a radiometric detector (β-RAM). The gradient changed linearly from 100% buffer A (0.01 m heptane sulfonic acid, sodium salt, 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid in water) to 10% buffer B (0.01 m heptane sulfonic acid sodium salt, 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid in 1:1 methanol water) between 0 and 3 min and then changed linearly from 10% buffer B to 95% buffer B between 3 and 18 min. 95% buffer B ran from 18 to 22 min and changed back to 100% A in 0.1 min. Buffer A ran until 25 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. PSI-6130 and its intercellular metabolites were identified by comparison of the retention times of the intracellular species in the radiochromatogram with the retention times of nonradioactive reference standards spiked in the cell extract samples and detected by UV absorption at 270 nm. Acid Phosphatase Treatment of Cell Extracts—Hepatocyte cell extracts were incubated with acid phosphatase (Sigma #P-0157) at a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml (23.9 units/ml) at 37 °C for 2.5 h to dephosphorylate any phosphorylated metabolites of PSI-6130. After digestion the samples were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC.

Virology. 2005; 332: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that 5 μl of cytoplasmic replicase complex (2.5 × 106 replicon cell equivalent) was added to a 20-μl reaction for 60 min. The inhibition of the RNA synthesis activity of the HCV replicases by RO2433-TP was determined in reactions containing 6.25 μl of cytoplasmic replicase complex (3.1 × 106 replicon cell equivalent), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml actinomycin D, 1 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP, 24 μCi of (0.4 μm) [α-33P]UTP (PerkinElmer #NEG607H), 1 units/μl SUPERase.

Virology. 2005; 332: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; IC50 determinations were carried out using 200 nmin vitro transcribed complementary internal ribosome entry site RNA template, 1 μCi of tritiated UTP (42 Ci/mmol), 500 μm ATP, 500 μm GTP, 1 μm CTP, 1× TMDN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm NaCl) and 200 nm NS5B570-Con1. The inhibition potency of RO2433-TP was determined as described above with the following modification of NTP concentrations: 1 μCi of tritiated CTP (39 Ci/mmol), 500 μm ATP, 500 μm GTP, 1 μm UTP. The compound concentration at which the enzyme-catalyzed rate is reduced by 50% (IC50) was calculated using equation, Y=%Min+(%Max-%Min)1+XIC50(Eq. 1) where Y corresponds to the relative enzyme activity, % Min is the residual relative activity at saturating compound concentration, % Max is the relative maximum enzymatic activity, and X corresponds to the compound concentration. The apparent Michaelis constants (Km(app)) for UTP or CTP were measured using assay conditions above with the following modifications; Km(app) for CTP was measured using 2 μCi of tritiated UTP (0.93 μm), 4.07 μm unlabeled UTP, 50 μm ATP, 50 μm GTP, and 5 nm to 50 μm CTP; Km(app) for UTP was measured using 2 μCi of tritiated CTP (1.67 μm), 3.33 μm unlabeled CTP, 50 μm ATP, 50 μm GTP, and 5 nm to 50 μm UTP. Apparent Km(app) values were calculated by nonlinear fitting using Equation 2, Y=(Vmax(app))XKm(app)+X(Eq. 2) where Y corresponds to the rate of RNA synthesis by NS5B, Vmax(app) is the maximum rate or RNA synthesis at saturating substrate concentration, and X corresponds to CTP or UTP concentration. Ki values were derived from the Cheng-Prusoff Equation (Equation 3) for competitive inhibition, Ki=IC501+[NTP]Km(app)(Eq. 3) where [NTP] is the concentration of CTP or UTP, and Km(app) is the apparent Michaelis constant for CTP or UTP. Mean Ki values were averaged from independent measurements at 0.2, 1, 5, and 25 μm CTP or UTP concentrations in triplicate experiments. Gel-based Nucleotide Incorporation Assay—The RNA template-directed nucleotide incorporation and extension of nucleotide triphosphates and nucleotide triphosphate analogs by HCV polymerase was performed with a 19-nucleotide RNA oligo (5′-AUGUAUAAUUAUUGUAGCC-3′) under assay conditions as described (9Klumpp K.

The incorporation and extension of CTP and CTP analogs were determined with 5′-end-radiolabeled GG primer and nucleotide triphosphates at the indicated concentrations. The incorporation and extension of UTP and UTP analogs were performed similarly with the same RNA oligo template, 5′-end-radiolabeled GGC primer and nucleotide triphosphates at the indicated concentrations. The radio-labeled RNA products were separated on a TBE-urea acrylamide gel and analyzed using phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). Metabolic Profile of PSI-6130—Cellular extracts from primary human hepatocytes incubated with tritium-labeled β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methylcytidine (PSI-6130) were resolved by ion exchange HPLC. PSI-6130 and metabolites derived from PSI-6130 were identified by comparing the retention times of radiolabeled species with the retention times of unlabeled reference compounds (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, PSI-6130 (3.0 min) and the 5′-phosphorylated derivatives PSI-6130-DP (13.2 min) and PSI-6130-TP (16.8 min) were identified in human hepatocytes incubated with PSI-6130. In addition, metabolites with retention times corresponding to those of the deaminated product of PSI-6130, β-d-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-2′-C-methyluridine (RO2433, 3.8 min) and its corresponding 5′-phosphates RO2433-DP (12.5 min) and RO2433-TP (14.8 min), were detected (Fig. 1B). The monophosphates of the cytidine and uridine analogs PSI-6130-MP and RO2433-MP were not separated sufficiently under the chromatography conditions and, therefore, co-eluted as a single radioactive peak at 10.6 min. It has been reported that 2′-O-methylcytidine was extensively metabolized to CTP and UTP due to deamination coupled with demethylation of the 2′-substituent or base swapping after glycosidic bond cleavage (19Tomassini J.E. Getty K. Stahlhut M.W. Shim S. Bhat B. Eldrup A.B. Prakash T.P. Carroll S.S. Flores O. MacCoss M. McMasters D.R. Migliaccio G. Olsen D.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2050-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). None of the intracellular metabolites of PSI-6130 was eluted with retention time corresponding to those of 2′-C-methyl-CTP, CTP, and UTP (data not shown). Therefore, there was no evidence for metabolism of PSI-6130 at the 2′-position or evidence for hydrolysis at the glycosidic bond. These data suggest that the primary routes of PSI-6130 metabolism in human hepatocytes were phosphorylation at the 5′-position and deamination at the base. The hepatocyte extracts were also analyzed by reversed phase HPLC to identify unphosphorylated metabolites of PSI-6130. Two unphosphorylated species with retention times corresponding to PSI-6130 (20.3 min) and its uridine metabolite RO2433 (11.9 min) were observed, with PSI-6130 being the predominant intracellular species (Fig. 2B). There was no evidence of formation of uracil, uridine, cytosine, cytidine, or 2′-deoxycytidine (data not shown). These data agree well with the ion exchange HPLC analysis result and suggest the absence of metabolism at the 2′ position and at the glycosidic bond. The phosphorylated metabolites, with the exception of PSI-6130-MP, were not resolved by reversed phase HPLC and co-eluted early as a single broad peak (Fig. 2, A, and B). Acid phosphatase treatment completely converted all the intracellular metabolites to PSI-6130 and RO2433. Therefore, all detected intracellular metabolites represent phosphorylated derivatives of PSI-6130 and RO2433. These results established that PSI-6130 could be phosphorylated to its pharmacologically active 5′-triphosphate analog and that PSI-6130 and/or its phosphates could be deaminated to the corresponding uridine analogs in primary human hepatocytes. In Vitro Potency of RO2433 and RO2433-TP—As described above, incubation of human hepatocytes with PSI-6130 resulted in the formation of substantial concentrations of the triphosphate of its uridine analog, RO2433-TP. Next we determined whether the PSI-6130-derived uridine analog RO2433 could inhibit HCV replication targeting NS5B polymerase. Huh7 cells containing a subgenomic genotype 1b Con1 strain HCV replicon were incubated with RO2433 or PSI-6130 for 72 h, and dose-dependent inhibition of luciferase reporter activity was determined. RO2433 did not inhibit the HCV replication in the HCV subgenomic replicon system at concentrations up to 100 μm, whereas PSI-6130 inhibited HCV replication with a mean IC50 of 0.6 μm under the same assay conditions (Table 1). The lack of potency in the replicon could be related to inefficient compound phosphorylation. To address whether the triphosphate of RO2433 directly inhibits the HCV RNA polymerase, the RNA synthesis activity of the native membrane-associated HCV replication complexes isolated from the same replicon cells was tested in the presence of RO2433-TP. RO2433-TP inhibited the RNA synthesis activity of HCV replicase with a mean IC50 of 1.19 μm, whereas PSI-6130-TP inhibited HCV replicase with a mean IC50 of 0.34 μm (Table 1). RO2433-TP also inhibited the RNA synthesis activity of the recombinant HCV Con1 NS5B on a heteropolymeric RNA template derived from the 3′-end of the negative strand of the HCV genome with an IC50 of 0.52 μm and Ki of 0.141 μm, as compared with an IC50 of 0.13 μm and Ki of 0.023 μm for PSI-6130-TP under the same assay conditions (Table 1). These results established that both RO2433-TP and PSI-6130-TP are intrinsically potent inhibitors of RNA synthesis by HCV polymerase.TABLE 1Potency of PSI-6130 and RO2433 and their 5′-triphosphatesCompoundIC50Ki NS5B GT1bKm NS5B GT1bReplicon GT1bNS5B GT1bReplicase GT1bμmμmμmPSI-61300.6 ± 0.04NDNDNDNDRO2433>100NDNDNDNDPSI-6130-TPND0.13 ± 0.010.34 ± 0.10.023 ± 0.0020.22 (CTP)RO2433-TPND0.52 ± 0.111.19 ± 0.090.141 ± 0.030.37 (UTP) Open table in a new tab To investigate the molecular mechanism of HCV polymerase inhibition by PSI-6130-TP and RO2433-TP, we measured their incorporation and chain -termination properties. The incorporation of nucleotide and nucleotide analogs by HCV polymerase NS5B was determined in a gel-based assay using a short RNA template (Fig. 3A). Incorporation of CMP, PSI-6130-MP, and 3′-dCMP was initiated from a 33P-labeled GG primer (Fig. 3A). Incorporated CMP (Fig. 3B, lane 6) could be further extended in the presence of the next nucleotide UTP (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–10). PSI-6130-TP and 3′-dCTP could also serve as substrates for HCV NS5B and were incorporated into the nascent RNA product (Fig. 3B, lane 11 and 16). After incorporation of PSI-6130-MP or 3′-dCMP, further extension in the presence of the next nucleotide UTP was completed blocked even when UTP was present at concentrations up to 1 mm (Fig. 3B, lane 12–15 and lanes 16–20, respectively). Incorporation of UMP, RO2433-MP, and 3′-dUMP was initiated from a 33P-labeled GGC primer using the same RNA template (Fig. 3A). Incorporated UMP (Fig. 3C, lane 6) could be further extended in the presence of the next nucleotide ATP (Fig. 3C, lanes 7–10). Full-length RNA product was observed in the presence of UTP and ATP but absence of CTP (Fig. 3C, lanes 7–10), possibly due to misincorporation by NS5B through G-U wobble base-pairing. HCV NS5B was also able to incorporate RO2433-MP (Fig. 3C, lane 11) and 3′-dUMP (Fig. 3C"
https://openalex.org/W2051381056,"Mutant Abl kinases (such as BCR-Abl) drive the development of leukemia; however little is known regarding whether Abl kinases contribute to the development or progression of solid tumors. We recently demonstrated that endogenous Abl kinases (c-Abl, Arg) are activated by deregulated ErbB receptors and Src kinases, and drive invasion of aggressive breast cancer cells. In this study, we examined whether activation of endogenous Abl kinases affects transformation, proliferation and survival, which are major contributors to breast cancer development and metastatic progression. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and RNAi, we demonstrate that activation of endogenous Abl kinases dramatically promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in serum, as well as survival following nutrient deprivation. Activation of Abl kinases mediates phosphorylation of STAT3, and promotes proliferation by accelerating G1 → S progression. Moreover, we identify IGF-1R as a novel upstream activator of endogenous Abl kinases, and demonstrate that Abl kinase activation is required for IGF-1-stimulated cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells. Since activation of Abl kinases affects multiple steps of breast cancer development and progression, Abl kinase inhibitors are likely to be effective agents for the treatment of breast cancers containing highly active Abl kinases."

Tick salivary secretion has been shown as important for both blood-meal completion and pathogen transmission. Here we report a duplication event of cystatin genes in its genome that results in a transcription-regulated boost of saliva inhibitory activity against a conserved and relatively limited number of vertebrate papain-like cysteine proteases during blood feeding. We further show that the polypeptide products of the two genes differ in their binding affinity for some enzyme targets, and they display different antigenicity. Moreover, our reverse genetic approach employing RNA interference uncovered a crucial mediation in tick-feeding success.

Among the differences that make a relationship between two organisms parasitic rather than symbiotic is the lack of mutual benefit; the parasite manages to continuously receive valuable resources from the host without returning this favor; in addition, sometimes it triggers catastrophic conditions to the host such as disease transmission. Hard ticks can be considered another case of efficient ectoparasites that are able to suck blood, a rich source of nutrients, from their vertebrate host(s) for several days (1Sauer J.R. McSwain J.L. Bowman A.S. Essenberg R.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). If the “blood donor” is aware of the tick attack to the skin/blood circulation, given that a tick cannot fly, rejection could be the best scenario and death the worst for the arthropod. Consequently, ticks have developed a series of mechanisms to gain undisturbed access to their nutritious meal, including saliva injection in biting sites (2Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Tick salivary glands regulate water and ion excretion by saliva secretion that in addition reduces the volume of the blood bolus in the tick digestive tract as feeding progresses. Furthermore, they deliver a repertoire of pharmacologic compounds in the site of infestation that affects among other things, hemostasis and host immunity, thus facilitating the completion of a good quality meal for the tick (3Wikel S.K. Bergman D. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 383-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unluckily for the host, saliva has also been shown to enhance tick vector competence, e.g. its capability to transmit pathogens (4Wikel S.K. Int. J. Parasitol. 1999; 29: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis is among the most successful arthropod blood feeders; after hatching from the egg, larvae and nymphs feed normally on small rodents, whereas adults feed on larger animals (5Anderson J.F. Med. Clin. N. Am. 2002; 86: 205-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This species transmits the Lyme disease etiologic agent Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti (causing the diseases anaplasmosis and babesiosis respectively), and viruses within the tick-borne encephalitis complex (6Estrada-Pena A. Jongejan F. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 1999; 32: 685-715Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To enhance our knowledge about saliva constituents that account for its unpleasant (for the host) biologic properties, two massive sequencing projects of salivary expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 2The abbreviations used are:ESTexpressed sequence tag(s)aaamino acid(s)dsRNAdouble-stranded RNAIC50concentration of inhibitor at which 50% enzyme inhibition is achievedKiinhibition constant(s)Ki*apparent dissociation constant(s)RNAiRNA interferenceRTreverse transcriptionMOPS3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acidPIPESpiperazine-N,N-bis-2-ethane sulfonic acidcontiggroup of overlapping clones.2The abbreviations used are:ESTexpressed sequence tag(s)aaamino acid(s)dsRNAdouble-stranded RNAIC50concentration of inhibitor at which 50% enzyme inhibition is achievedKiinhibition constant(s)Ki*apparent dissociation constant(s)RNAiRNA interferenceRTreverse transcriptionMOPS3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acidPIPESpiperazine-N,N-bis-2-ethane sulfonic acidcontiggroup of overlapping clones. were completed in our laboratory (7Valenzuela J.G.

Analysis using bioinformatic tools revealed gene family expansions in salivary gland secretome. This finding created, as is almost always the case, more questions than answers. Is the expansion due to polymorphisms or gene duplications, and if the last is the case, are they maintained stable in the genome to achieve antigenic variation, redundancy in biochemical pathways, or a combination of these? expressed sequence tag(s) amino acid(s) double-stranded RNA concentration of inhibitor at which 50% enzyme inhibition is achieved inhibition constant(s) apparent dissociation constant(s) RNA interference reverse transcription 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid piperazine-N,N-bis-2-ethane sulfonic acid group of overlapping clones. expressed sequence tag(s) amino acid(s) double-stranded RNA concentration of inhibitor at which 50% enzyme inhibition is achieved inhibition constant(s) apparent dissociation constant(s) RNA interference reverse transcription 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid piperazine-N,N-bis-2-ethane sulfonic acid group of overlapping clones. In an attempt to bridge this gap between genomics and the function of the secretome, we focused on characterizing two cystatins with high amino acid (aa) identity to each other that are secreted from salivary glands of I. scapularis. Cystatins are present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and protozoa, and all of them form tight, equimolar, and reversible inhibitory complexes with papain-like cysteine proteases. This holds true for the first cystatin we expressed, which we named sialostatin L because of its affinity for cathepsin L (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We further showed that saliva indeed displays inhibitory activity against cathepsin L in vitro that could be partially attributed to the presence of sialostatin L. Consistent with the role of its target enzymes in immunity, we finally discovered an antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive action of the protein to the vertebrate host (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of the second cystatin, which we named sialostatin L2 to emphasize its redundant inhibitory activity against cathepsin L. Other than their high aa identity and similar affinity for cathepsin L, we show that the two cystatins are not equally potent in inhibition of other target enzymes and that they also differ in antigenicity. Furthermore, we report major differences in their transcript abundance during tick infestation; sialostatin L2 transcripts greatly accumulate in the salivary glands as feeding to the host progresses, whereas sialostatin L transcripts slightly decrease at the same time. Given this transcriptional induction of sialostatin L2 and the absence of classical genetic approaches to this non-model arthropod vector, we undertook a reverse genetic approach to silence sialostatin L2 by RNA interference (RNAi). This well established technique (10Karim S. Miller N.J. Valenzuela J. Sauer J.R. Mather T.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1336-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) led to reduction of cystatin transcripts in the salivary glands followed by feeding inhibition, reduced tick size, and number of eggs laid. Moreover, normal ticks when exposed to a rabbit previously infested with silenced ticks exhibited significant feeding impairment due to an enhanced host immune response. Because of its stringent and unique specificity, sialostatin L2 can be useful for studying the role of certain papain-like proteases in various biologic phenomena. In addition it can provide a starting point for potent pharmaceutical interventions that target the key role of those enzymes in human diseases. Besides their limited number of targets, we reveal the crucial mediation of I. scapularis cystatin salivary constituents in blood-meal uptake through control of their targets' proteolytic activity. Taking into account their role in the success of parasitism, they should be considered in the development of antiparasitic vaccines; they may be additional candidate ingredients in the mixture of antigens that will potentially lead to achievement of this difficult goal. Unless otherwise indicated, protocols followed standard procedures (11Sambrook J. Fritish E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and all experiments were performed at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). All materials were obtained from Sigma, and the water used was of 18-megaohm quality, produced by a MilliQ apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Bioinformatic Tools—To obtain genomic information relative to the cystatin transcripts, raw trace FASTA files from shotgun genomic sequences of I. scapularis (found in ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB/ixodes_scapularis) representing nearly 24 million sequences were downloaded and removed of vector and primer sequences using a homemade tool written in Visual Basic. Sequences with average quality values below 20 were excluded. Sialostatins L and L2 coding sequences (NCBI accession gi:22164282 and gi:67083499, respectively) were blasted against these genomic sequences using blastn with a word size of 80 (–W 80 switch). The resulting matches were assembled using the cap3 assembler (12Huang X. Madan A. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar), and the produced consensus sequences were in turn blasted against the two cystatin transcripts. All other sequence comparisons reported here were done using the BLAST server at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) and the ClustalW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute, whereas protein secretion signals were revealed in the SignalP 3.0 server of the Technical University of Denmark. Expression, Purification, and Sequence Verification of Sialostatin L2—We followed the same procedure as described before for sialostatin L (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) except that sialostatin L2 cDNA was PCR-amplified using high fidelity Taq polymerase from a λTriplEx2 cDNA clone, described in our previous work (8Ribeiro J.M. Alarcon-Chaidez F. Francischetti I.M. Mans B.J. Mather T.N. Valenzuela J.G. Wikel S.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 36: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), with gene-specific primers (forward, 5′-GCC CAT ATG GAA CTG GCA CTG CGT GGC GGT TAC CGC GAG CG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCC CTC GAG TTA TGC GGC CGC ACA CTC AAA GGA GCT-3′) designed for subcloning into the pET17b bacterial expression vector. Enzymatic Assays—Apparent inhibition constants of sialostatin L2 or L for various proteases were obtained as described earlier (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) by measuring loss of enzymatic activity at increasing concentrations of inhibitor in the presence of a fluorogenic enzyme substrate in large excess. Production of Polyclonal Sera—Female Swiss Webster mice, 6–8 weeks old, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in the NIAID Animal Care Facility (Twinbrook 3 Bldg., NIH) under pathogen-free conditions in temperature-controlled rooms and received water and food ad libitum. Groups of six mice each received intradermal injections of 10 μg of pure recombinant protein in each ear and four boosts followed at 2-week intervals. Preimmune sera were taken from each mouse before vaccination, whereas control groups received buffer (vehicle) vaccination in parallel. All treatments were performed in accordance with The Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH). Tick Rearing—For most experiments ticks were harvested after detaching from mice (nymphs) or rabbits (adults). Engorged nymphs were maintained at 23 °C and >90% relative humidity under a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod until enough time elapsed for them to molt into the adult stage. In all feeding experiments involving adult ticks, we placed an equal number of female and male ticks on the ears of New Zealand White rabbits. Ears were covered with cotton ear bags, and an Elizabethan collar was placed around the neck of each rabbit to prevent grooming. Engorged adult ticks were held under similar conditions as nymphs until enough time elapsed for them to lay eggs. For harvesting tick tissues, partially fed females were dissected within 4 h of being removed from hosts. Harvesting Tick Tissues—Tick tissues (salivary glands and midguts) were dissected in ice-cold 100 mm MOPS buffer containing 20 mm ethylene glycol/EGTA, pH 6.8. After removal, glands were washed gently in the same ice-cold buffer. Dissected tissues were stored immediately after dissection in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) before isolating total RNA. Tissues were used immediately after dissection or stored at –70 °C in 0.5 m PIPES, pH 6.8, containing 20 mm EGTA, 1× Complete™ Mini Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). All other manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Synthesis of Tick Salivary Gland cDNA and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using an RNAqueous™ total RNA isolation kit (Ambion) from dissected partially fed female salivary glands/midguts and unfed female adult salivary glands/midguts. Concentration of total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically, separated into aliquots, and stored at –70 °C before use. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to manufacturer's protocol. For each gene, cDNA was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers; sialostatin L2, forward 5′-CTA TGC GGC TTC CTC GAA GGG GCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGC TAC AGC GAG AGG GCG AAC CAC CAA-3′; tick salivary gland Isac, forward, 5′-AGC GAA GAC GGT CTC GAG CAA GAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCG GCA CAC GAT GCC TCA GGG AAT-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-GAA GAT CTT GAG AAG ATG GCC CAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGG TAC CGT CGA TGG TCA CC-3′, as the control. The PCR program we used included the following cycles: 75 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 2 min, and 22 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 49 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.20 min followed with 10 min at 72 °C. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the Mx4000 or Mx3005P Multiplex Quantitative PCR system and the Brilliant SYBR Green Single-Step QRT-PCR Master Mix kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve (100–107 copies per reaction) was generated using purified sialostatin L and L2 PCR products as the template. The following primers were used for all reactions; sialostatin L, forward 5′-TCG CGA TCG CTA GCA TCA CAC TT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGC AGA AGG ACC AAA GCG AAG GTA-3′; sialostatin L2, forward 5′-AAG TCC ATT AGC TCC TTC GAG TGT G-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATC ATT CCG CGA CGT ACA GTG AGA-3′. Reactions (25-μl final volume) contained 10 ng of total RNA and were run under the following conditions; 1 cycle of 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 55 °C for 30 s. Fluorescence was measured every cycle at the end of the 55 °C step. Samples were run in triplicate as well as in the absence of reverse transcriptase or template as negative controls. The copy number of sialostatin L and L2 mRNA in each sample was determined using the Mx4000 or Mx3005P data analysis software based on the standard curve. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Synthesis, Tick Injections, and Feeding—Sialostatin L2 RT-PCR product was joined to the Block-iT T7 TOPO linker. This TOPO linking reaction was used in two PCR reactions with gene-specific and T7 PCR primers to produce sense and antisense linear DNA templates. These sense and antisense DNA templates were used to generate sense and antisense transcripts using the BLOCK-iT RNA TOPO transcription kit. The resulting dsRNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify its size. Subsequently, unfed female ticks were injected with 0.5 μg of cystatin dsRNA or with 1 μl of TS.MOPS (vehicle) using a 35-gauge needle. After injection of dsRNA or buffer alone, ticks were kept at 37 °C overnight under high humidity to observe tick survival. Surviving ticks were exposed to a naïve (never tick-bitten) rabbit and allowed to blood-feed to repletion. Their feeding success was determined by total engorged weight, survival, and egg lying. The ears of the rabbits exposed to dsRNA sialostatin L2 or water-injected ticks were cleaned by the end of the experiment; the animals were kept for 14 days and then re-exposed to normal unfed ticks, and feeding success evaluation was performed as described above. Statistics—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test; differences in multiple comparisons among different experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance using the Tukey test. The Two Cystatin Transcripts Are Encoded by Two Different Genes—Several I. scapularis transcripts were revealed to be of salivary origin during our most recent massive EST sequencing project (8Ribeiro J.M. Alarcon-Chaidez F. Francischetti I.M. Mans B.J. Mather T.N. Valenzuela J.G. Wikel S.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 36: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) including a novel cystatin that shows 75% identity at the protein level to sialostatin L, a secreted cystatin previously characterized in our laboratory (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When the secretion signal was removed from this polypeptide, multiple alignment with sialostatin L showed a clustering of aa substitutions in two regions of the protein; of a total of 27 aa substitutions throughout the 115-residue polypeptide, 12 were located in the first 22 amino-terminal residues, whereas another 12 substitutions gathered in the last 33 carboxyl-terminal aa of the protein (Fig. 1A). This raised the possibility that the two proteins could be allelic products of the same gene. To test this hypothesis, a bioinformatic approach was undertaken. cDNA sequences of both transcripts were compared by BLAST analysis to the publicly available shotgun genomic sequences from the I. scapularis genome project. The resulting matches were assembled into contigs that were in turn compared by BLAST to both cystatin transcripts. The result showed clearly that the two cystatins are encoded by two different genes (data not shown). The sialostatin L locus consists of three exons, whereas only two exons coding for parts of the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus of the second cystatin could be revealed (data not shown). Possibly the third exon was not detected due to the limited DNA sequence available. In both genes, intronic sequences were partial but unique; their high numbers of repeating sequences made impossible their successful extension due to the very large number of matches with repetitive sequences from intronic regions found in the shotgun genomic sequences. The Polypeptide Products of the Two Genes Differ in Their Target Specificity and Display Different Antigenicity—We next proceeded to the expression and purification of the protein encoded by the novel transcript, which was subsequently used in inhibition assays of various commercially available purified proteases. Only four cysteine proteases of seven tested were affected by the presence of the protein in the assay, namely cathepsins L, V, S, and C (Fig. 1B). No inhibition was observed for cysteine proteases cathepsin X/Z/P, B, or H (Table 1), aspartic proteases cathepsin D and legumain, or serine proteases cathepsin G and elastase (data not shown). We next compared this novel cystatin with sialostatin L for efficiency in inhibiting their overlapping target enzymes. The results are shown in Fig. 1C and are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, the two inhibitors are equally potent for inhibition of cathepsins L and V (Fig. 1C, upper panel) but displayed major differences in inhibition of cathepsins S and C (Fig. 1C, lower panel). To further evaluate those findings, we tested whether this novel cystatin is a tight inhibitor for cathepsin L, as is the case for sialostatin L (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we used decreasing amounts of cathepsin L in our assays, less cystatin was necessary to achieve the same percentage of enzymatic inhibition (Fig. 2A), which is a typical characteristic of tight inhibition. The decrease in the concentration of the inhibitor at which 50% enzymatic inhibition (IC50) is achieved was actually analogous to the reduction of the amount of enzyme used in the assay (Fig. 2B). Because conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics do not hold true for tight binding inhibition, we applied Morrison's equation (13Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) to obtain apparent dissociation constants (Ki*) in the presence of varying substrate concentrations. Fig. 2C shows the linear regression line (r2 = 0.9918) when Ki* for several substrate concentrations was plotted against the substrate concentration, indicating a y intercept of 65.5 ± 23.1 pm that is the inhibition constant (Ki) of this novel cystatin for cathepsin L. The sialostatin L Ki for the same enzyme is 95.3 ± 7.3 pm (9Kotsyfakis M. Sa-Nunes A. Francischetti I.M. Mather T.N. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), demonstrating a similar affinity of the two inhibitors for cathepsin L. To emphasize this similarity, we assigned the name sialostatin L2 to this second salivary cystatin.TABLE 1Sialostatin L2 affinity changes for proteolytic enzymes when compared with sialostatin LEnzymeEnzyme concentrationSialostatin L2 IC50Sialostatin L IC50Cathepsin L20 pm70.9 ± 3.4 pm125.8 ± 3.7 pmCathepsin V1 nm28.8 ± 2.8 nm24.1 ± 2.7 nmCathepsin S60 pm378.1 ± 23 nm0.7 ± 0.01 nmCathepsin C10 nm740.4 ± 22.3 nm52.2 ± 2.3 nmCathepsin X/Z/P16 nmNI937 ± 14 nmCathepsin BNINICathepsin HNINI Open table in a new tab Having in hand both pure and active cystatins, we then examined their antigenicity, i.e. their capability to induce production of specific polyclonal sera in a vertebrate host, in this case female Swiss Webster mice. Sialostatin L or L2 was administered (20 μg) in each mouse five times at 2-week intervals; 2 weeks post the last vaccination, their sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for recognition of vaccination antigen (sialostatin L or L2) and potential for cross-reaction with the second cystatin (sialostatin L2 or L, respectively). The results are shown in Fig. 3. Although both proteins were immunogenic, only sera from mice vaccinated with sialostatin L2 cross-reacted with sialostatin L. In a step further we estimated the mean antibody titer in the sera of the mice in both experimental groups using standard methods (11Sambrook J. Fritish E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); for the sialostatin L-vaccinated mice the mean antibody titer was 4100 ± 400 for sialostatin L and 200 ± 35 for sialostatin L2, whereas the mean antibody titer in the sera of the sialostatin L2 vaccinated mice was 4000 ± 450 for sialostatin L2 and 1070 ± 136 for sialostatin L. To sum up, the 27 different amino acids between the two cystatin molecules apparently results in changes in their interaction interface with some of the targeted enzymes (and, therefore, their binding affinity). These primary structure changes and, more interestingly, the observed different affinity of the two inhibitors for cathepsin S, a critical enzyme for antigen processing and presentation, can account for the observed differences in their recognition from the vertebrate immune system as well. Sialostatin L2 Transcription Increases as Feeding to the Host Progresses—To shed light on the transcriptional control of the two genes during I. scapularis feeding on the vertebrate host, we employed real-time quantitative RT-PCR using RNA isolated from unfed or partially fed adult female tick salivary glands or midguts. Expression levels were first normalized using the constitutively expressed actin transcript as a standard (14Pedra J.H. Narasimhan S. Deponte K. Marcantonio N. Kantor F.S. Fikrig E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2006; 75: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similar accumulation of sialostatin L transcripts was revealed in unfed salivary glands and midguts, which were 80 and 20 times higher when compared with sialostatin L2 expression levels in the corresponding tissues. Furthermore, the difference in transcript abundance for the two tick cystatins, both in the midgut and in the salivary glands, as feeding continues and when compared with the corresponding transcript abundance in tissues from unfed ticks was estimated, and it is presented in Table 2. Briefly, as feeding starts, sialostatin L transcript levels decrease in both the midgut and salivary glands. On the other hand, sialostatin L2 transcripts slightly fluctuate in the midgut but drastically accumulate in salivary glands. Our bioinformatic approach uncovered that the 600-bp of the 5′-untranslated region of the two genes do not show any similarity when compared with BLASTN (data not shown), indicating that the differences in the transcription regulation of the two genes can be partially or fully attributed to their different 5′-untranslated region nucleotide sequences.TABLE 2Transcriptional regulation of sialostatins L and L2 in the midgut and salivary glands during the onset of tick blood feedingFeeding periodSialostatin L2)Sialostatin LMidgutsSalivary glandsMidgutsSalivary glands-fold difference-fold differenceUnfed111124 h1.3290.30.348 h1.22730.10.172 h0.32320.10.296 h1.39400.030.1 Open table in a new tab Sialostatin L2 Is Essential for Tick Blood Feeding Success—Given this transcriptional induction of sialostatin L2 in tick salivary glands as feeding progresses, we decided to silence the gene using the RNAi technique. Adult unfed female ticks were injected with sialostatin L2 dsRNA and subsequently allowed to recover from the injections and feed on rabbits as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Groups of 12 ticks each were pulled from the rabbit after 4 days of feeding, and their salivary glands were dissected and subsequently checked for gene silencing efficiency by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, ticks injected with sialostatin L2 dsRNA showed an ∼80% decrease in sialostatin L2 transcript levels when compared with water-injected controls. Moreover, sialostatin L was completely silenced (data not shown), whereas levels of β-actin and Isac (negative controls) remained unchanged in both experimental and control groups. When attached to a rabbit in vivo, ∼40% of the silenced ticks were unable to feed and subsequently died (Fig. 4B), whereas in most cases apparent inflammatory and swollen skin was revealed in the feeding sites of dead ticks (Fig. 4C). For the remaining ∼60% of RNAi ticks that fed on the host to repletion, their average weight approximated 60 mg, much lower than the control average weight of 170 mg (Fig. 4, D and"

Murthy H.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11681-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ApoD was also isolated as a progesterone-binding protein abundant in mammary gross cystic disease fluid (6Pearlman W.H. Gueriguian J.L. Sawyer M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5736-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was found as a monomeric protein in apocrine secretion, where it seems to bind odorants (7Zeng C. Spielman A.I. Vowels B.R. Leyden J.J. Biemann K. Preti G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6626-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ApoD mRNA is expressed in a variety of organs (8Drayna D. Fielding C. McLean J. Baer B. Castro G. Chen E. Comstock L. Henzel W. Kohr W. Rhee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16535-16539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in certain human cancers. Indeed, ApoD has received attention as prognostic marker for various, often steroid-responsive tumors, including prostate cancer (9Hall R.E. Horsfall D.J. Stahl J. Vivekanandan S. Ricciardelli C. Stapleton A.M. Scardino P.T. Neufing P. Tilley W.D. Prostate. 2004; 58: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), breast carcinoma, and cutaneous malignant melanoma (10Miranda E. Vizoso F. Martin A. Quintela I. Corte M.D. Segui M.E. Ordiz I. Merino A.M. J. Surg. Oncol. 2003; 83: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, ApoD is synthesized by astrocytes in the central nervous system (11Patel S.C. Asotra K. Patel Y.C. McConathy W.J. Patel R.C. Suresh S. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and there, it seems to be involved in arachidonic acid transport, metabolism, and signaling (12Thomas E.A. Copolov D.L. Sutcliffe J.G. Curr. Mol. Med. (Hilversum). 2003; 3: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Notably, ApoD plays a well documented pathophysiological role in several psychiatric disorders (12Thomas E.A. Copolov D.L. Sutcliffe J.G. Curr. Mol. Med. (Hilversum). 2003; 3: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), especially in schizophrenia (13Mahadik S.P. Khan M.M. Evans D.R. Parikh V.V. Schizophr. Res. 2002; 58: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ApoD has been prepared as a soluble recombinant protein via secretion into the periplasm of Escherichia coli, and its binding activity for progesterone and arachidonic acid, both with KD values around 1 μm, was demonstrated (14Vogt M. Skerra A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, recombinant ApoD reveals a pronounced tendency to adsorb to surfaces and to form aggregates upon storage, which may be explained by hydrophobic surface properties that enable ApoD to interact with HDL and/or with lipid membranes in its physiological environment. Using systematic substitution of presumably exposed hydrophobic residues, we were able to construct a “solubilized” mutant of ApoD that retained native ligand binding function and appeared to be suitable for structural analysis (15Nasreen A. Vogt M. Kim H.J. Eichinger A. Skerra A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein Production and Crystallization—An engineered version of ApoD was produced in E. coli via periplasmic secretion essentially as described (15Nasreen A. Vogt M. Kim H.J. Eichinger A. Skerra A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As mass spectrometric analysis revealed some inhomogeneity with respect to the processing of the N-terminal OmpA signal peptide, the first 2 residues of the mature protein sequence, Gln-Ala, were deleted from the expression plasmid via site-directed mutagenesis, yielding pApoD27ΔQA. Seleno-l-methionine-labeled protein was subsequently prepared according to a published protocol (16Breustedt D.A. Korndörfer I.P. Redl B. Skerra A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 484-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration on an analytical Superdex 75 column in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. For crystallization, the protein was dialyzed against the same buffer without EDTA and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using 10-kDa cut-off Vivaspin tubes (Sartorius AG, Hannover, Germany) followed by sterile filtration with 0.45-μm Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Crystals were grown at 20 °C as described (15Nasreen A. Vogt M. Kim H.J. Eichinger A. Skerra A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using micro-seeding and refined conditions of 1.1 m Li2SO4, 100 mm NH4HCO2, 75 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, soaked in the precipitant solution supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The ApoD-progesterone complex was prepared by soaking crystals of the seleno-l-methionine-labeled protein for 48 h in the precipitant solution containing ∼4mm progesterone (minimum 99%, Sigma-Aldrich). Data Collection and Processing—For structure solution of the uncomplexed ApoD by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD), three data sets were collected from a single crystal of space group P43212 at beam line ID14-4 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France). Diffraction data up to a resolution of 1.80 Å were measured at 100 K (Table 1), processed with MOSFLM, scaled with SCALA, and reduced with TRUNCATE (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Three selenium atom sites were identified with SHELX (18Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Refinement of the selenium sites, MAD phasing, solvent flattening, and calculation of a native electron density map were carried out with SHARP (19Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). For the ApoD-progesterone complex, a single wavelength data set was collected at beam line ID23-1 of the ESRF and processed as described above (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallographic statistics for data collection and refinementData setPeakInflection pointRemoteLigand complexSpace groupP43212Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c [Å], α = β = γ = 90°49.25, 49.25, 143.4949.37, 49.37, 144.0549.41, 49.41, 144.1249.21, 49.21, 144.13Wavelength [Å]0.979400.979690.968631.00890Resolution range [Å]aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.30.00-1.80 (1.90-1.80)30.00-2.00 (2.11-2.00)30.00-2.30 (2.42-2.30)30.00-1.80 (1.90-1.80)I/∑(I)6.4 (2.2)8.1 (2.2)7.9 (2.1)6.6 (2.3)Rmerge [%]aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.6.7 (28.5)6.0 (22.8)7.3 (36.0)7.0 (30.8)Unique reflections1700212649848617084Multiplicity15.013.413.211.3CompletenessaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.99.1 (98.7)99.4 (99.2)99.6 (99.5)98.7 (95.3)Anomalous completenessaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.99.5 (98.7)99.8 (99.5)99.9 (99.7)Phasing and refinementFigure of merit0.410Rcryst/Rfree20.24/24.9818.68/22.58Protein atoms12841318Ligand atoms23Solvent atoms152235Average B-factor [Å2]22.8222.55Geometryr.m.s.d. bond lengths/angles [Å/deg]0.014/1.430.014/1.69Ramachandran analysisCore, allowed, generously allowed [%]91.4, 6.5, 2.290.2, 8.4, 1.4a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Model Building and Refinement—First, the initial atomic model of the uncomplexed ApoD was built using the MAD electron density map and the program O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Then, the structure of the ApoD-progesterone complex was obtained by difference electron density calculation from the refined structure of the uncomplexed ApoD using REFMAC (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The electron density map of the uncomplexed ApoD allowed model building for 161 of the 174 residues (Phe-3-Thr-34, Gly-39 -Glu-50, Gly-52-Leu-168) present in the recombinant protein. In the complex with progesterone, even some more residues (Phe-3-Met-49, Asn-51-Leu-168) appeared to be ordered. The C-terminal residues Ser-169 and Ala-170 as well as the His6 tag (171-176) were not defined in either structure. Both protein models were refined with REFMAC, whereby water molecules were added using CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

The refined models (for details cf. Table 1) were validated with PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Mos D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHAT_CHECK (23Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Secondary structure assignment and calculation of solvent-accessible surface areas were performed using DSSP (24Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). Protein-ligand interactions were analyzed with LIGPLOT (25Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar). Graphics were prepared with PyMOL 3W. L. DeLano, PyMOL. and GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). To visualize the surface properties of the native protein instead of the recombinant version, original side chains were introduced with the program O by using rotamers with the highest possible propensity without leading to sterical clashes. Structural alignments were carried out with SuperPose (28Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), sequence alignments were prepared with Clustal-W (29Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar), and pairwise Cα atom distances were calculated with RMSPDB (30Kleywegt, G. J., Zou, J. Y., Kjeldgaard, M., and Jones, T. A. (2001) in International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. F, Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules (Rossmann, M. G., and Arnold, E., eds), pp. 353-356 and 366-367, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). The structure of the ApoD-arachidonate complex was modeled with the program O and idealized with REFMAC. The coordinates for the free ApoD and its complex with progesterone have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 2HZR and 2HZQ). Tertiary Structure of ApoD—The crystal structure of human ApoD reveals an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel flanked by an α-helix (Fig. 1), as it is typical for the lipocalin protein family (31Skerra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The calyx has an outer diameter of around 45 Å at its broadest site and a length of around 40 Å. Four loops connect the β-strands A/B, C/D, E/F, and G/H (Fig. 1A) in a pairwise fashion and thus form the entrance to the characteristic ligand-binding site of the lipocalins. In the case of ApoD, the narrow, conically shaped, and mainly hydrophobic cavity is ∼15 Å deep and about 10 by 15 Å wide at its entry (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal peptide segment runs across the bottom of the β-barrel between the two short loops that connect strands B/C and F/G, respectively, before it enters into β-strand A. A short 310-helix (Val-19 -Lys-21) forms a cap that closes the β-barrel at the bottom (Fig. 1A). The Cys residues 8 and 114 as well as 41 and 165 form two disulfide bridges (4Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Blanco-Vaca F. Gaskell S.J. Yang M. Massey J.B. Gotto Jr., A.M. Pownall H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The first disulfide bond connects the N-terminal segment to strand G of the β-barrel, whereas the second one fixes the C terminus to strand B. Thus, the connectivity is similar to the bilin-binding protein (BBP; Fig. 2), a structurally well characterized lipocalin from the butterfly Pieris brassicae (32Huber R. Schneider M. Mayr I. Müller R. Deutzmann R. Suter F. Zuber H. Falk H. Kayser H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), but it differs from the retinol-binding protein (RBP), another abundant human plasma lipocalin (31Skerra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In fact, a weak sequence homology between ApoD and BBP was noted before (33Peitsch M.C. Boguski M.S. New Biol. 1990; 2: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar). The four largely exposed loops at the open top of the β-barrel shape the ligand cavity of ApoD. There, two opposite pairs of β-strands, which support the loops C/D and G/H, are bent widely open, thus granting access to the binding site. Both loops form hairpin turns (residues Arg-62-Thr-66 and Ile-117-Ser-120, respectively). The two other loops, which connect β-strands A/B and E/F (Ile-32-Gly-39 and Phe-89 -Ser-95, respectively), are substantially longer, with an Ω-type appearance for loop A/B. Three of these loops form protrusions and expose bulky hydrophobic side chains (see below), e.g. loop A/B with Phe-36, loop E/F with Trp-91 and Phe-92, and loop G/H with Phe-121, which is also in vicinity of the hydrophobic N-terminal residue Phe-3. The two tight loops C/D and G/H are involved in altogether eight hydrogen bonds with four symmetry-related molecules. Arg-62 NH2 in loop C/D forms a hydrogen bond to Glu-138 OE1 in the first turn of the α-helix, close to the bottom of the β-barrel, of the first neighboring molecule. The adjacent residue Ala-63 forms with its carbonyl oxygen two hydrogen bonds via water molecules to the second symmetry-related molecule, one to Ser-116 O in strand G and the second one to Ser-118 N in the loop G/H. Residue Gly-65 forms with its carbonyl oxygen a hydrogen bond to Ser-120 OG in loop G/H of the third neighboring molecule. The corresponding donor/acceptor groups of the residues Ser-116, Ser-118, and Glu-138 in the original molecule form symmetrical hydrogen bonds to the crystallographic neighbors numbers one and two, whereas Ser-120 OG forms a hydrogen bond to Gly-65 O in loop C/D of the fourth neighboring molecule. As the residues that are involved in these interactions lie at the tip of the two loops, except for Glu-138 in the α-helix, and are thus all remote from the central cavity, it seems unlikely that ligand binding is influenced by crystal-packing contacts. The ligand pocket of ApoD is lined by mainly hydrophobic side chains (in particular, Tyr-22, Trp-26, Tyr-46, Ile-54, Tyr-98, Val-111, Trp-127, and Leu-129; Fig. 1D), which explains its binding activity for the non-polar ligand progesterone (see below) and also for arachidonic acid (14Vogt M. Skerra A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Residues Tyr-46 and Tyr-98 form the bottom of the ligand pocket. Together with Tyr-22, they are arranged like a trigonal pyramid, whereby their side chain hydroxyl groups form a hydrogen bond network (Fig. 1C). The ligand pocket is slightly negatively charged due to residue Glu-60 close to its entrance. Residues Glu-28 and Lys-31 in β-strand A form a salt bridge (length: 2.6 Å). In the apo-form of the protein, the side chain oxygen atom of Asn-58 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-46, which is mediated by a water molecule. This water molecule is absent in the complex structure due to a conformational change of the Asn-58 side chain. In the apo-structure, there are altogether 13 ordered water molecules in the upper part of the cavity, which are arranged in typical hydrogen-bonding distances. The Complex with Progesterone—The crystal structures of free ApoD and its complex with progesterone are almost identical, with an r.m.s.d. of just 0.38 Å upon superposition of the Cα positions 3-34, 39-50, and 52-168 (Fig. 1D). The only differences are some conformational changes of the side chains of Asn-45, Asn-58, and Tyr-46. Progesterone is deeply buried in the cleft, with the A-ring of the steroid system oriented toward the entrance. The steroid molecule is sandwiched between the aromatic side chains of Phe-89 and Trp-127 such that the two methyl groups (C18 and C19) point toward residue Phe-89 (Fig. 1C). A hydrogen bond is formed between the keto oxygen of the acetyl substituent at C17 and the hydroxyl group of the Tyr-46 side chain at the bottom of the cavity. One fixed water molecule is visible in the cleft, but it does not form a hydrogen bond with progesterone. Nine more ordered water molecules are located at the entrance of the ligand pocket. In previous experiments with the bacterially produced ApoD, there was no detectable binding activity for the related steroids testosterone and pregnenolone (14Vogt M. Skerra A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of testosterone, the acetyl side chain at C17 of progesterone is replaced by a much smaller and more polar hydroxyl group, which should lead to a loss of contacts at the bottom of the cavity. For pregnenolone, however, the reason for the diminished affinity is less clear because the molecular differences to progesterone are limited to the reduction of the keto group at C3 to an alcohol and a shift of the C=C double bond from steroid ring A to B. These structural changes occur in a region that is close to the entrance of the ligand pocket of ApoD where the packing with protein side chains is less tight. Pairwise superposition of all 21 carbon atoms of progesterone in the ApoD structure with the crystal structure of progesterone alone (CCDC accession number KEFBEC) (34Allen F.H. Bellard S. Brice M.D. Cartwright B.A. Doubleday A. Higgs H. Hummelink T. Hummelink-Peters B.G. Kennard O. Motherwell W.D.S. Rodgers J.R. Watson D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. 1979; 35: 2331-2339Crossref Google Scholar) led to an r.m.s.d. of 0.16 Å. In contrast, the same pairwise superposition of pregnenolone (CCDC:PREGOL) with progesterone in the ApoD structure led to a significantly larger r.m.s.d. of 0.33 Å, whereby major deviations occurred around C4, C6, and for the substituent at C3. According to this superposition, the carbon atoms C6 and C7 of pregnenolone would make significantly closer contacts (by ∼0.6 Å) to Trp-127 of ApoD (cf. Fig. 1C). Structural Comparison with Other Lipocalins—A search for homologous protein structures in the Protein Data Bank using DALI (35Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) revealed that ApoD is most closely related to insect BBP (PDB accession number 1BBP; Z-score = 20.4) (32Huber R. Schneider M. Mayr I. Müller R. Deutzmann R. Suter F. Zuber H. Falk H. Kayser H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) followed by the crustacyanin subunit A1 (PDB: 1H91; Z-score = 19.1) (36Cianci M. Rizkallah P.J. Olczak A. Raftery J. Chayen N.E. Zagalsky P.F. Helliwell J.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The bacterial lipocalin of E. coli (PDB: 1QWD; Z-score = 17.5) (37Campanacci V. Nurizzo D. Spinelli S. Valencia C. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as porcine RBP (PDB: 1AQB; Z-score = 16.2) (38Zanotti G. Panzalorto M. Marcato A. Malpeli G. Folli C. Berni R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1049-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed less similarity. Interestingly, insecticyanin (39Holden H.M. Rypniewski W.R. Law J.H. Rayment I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), another insect lipocalin with similar ligand binding function as the BBP and detectable sequence similarity with ApoD (33Peitsch M.C. Boguski M.S. New Biol. 1990; 2: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar), did not show up in this DALI search. Superposition of the ApoD and BBP crystal structures, as complexes with their cognate ligands progesterone and biliverdin IXγ, respectively, using the structurally conserved set of 58 Cα atoms of the β-barrel (31Skerra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), led to an r.m.s.d. of 0.96 Å (Fig. 3). Despite the remarkable similarity of the tertiary structures of these two phylogenetically distant lipocalins, there are significant differences in the loop region, especially at the entrance to the ligand pocket. The loops E/F (Phe-89 -Ser-95) and G/H (Ile-117-Ser-120) of ApoD are directed outward from the β-barrel axis, thus leading to the more open, funnel-like appearance of the cavity in ApoD when compared with BBP. Loop D/E (Val-77-Ala-83) at the closed end of the β-barrel is also oriented more outwardly than the corresponding loop of BBP. Another notable difference between the two protein structures is the preponderance of exposed bulky hydrophobic side chains at the entrance to the cavity of ApoD, which is not evident for BBP and might be explained by the differing physiological environment of the two lipocalins and the specific association of ApoD with HDL. A structure-based amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 2) revealed a mutual sequence identity of 28%. When conservative side chain replacements are taken into account, the similarity rises to 46.3%. This number is much higher than the <20% sequence similarity that is found on average among different members, within or across species, of the lipocalin protein family (40Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the sequence alignment reveals several gaps, which account for the different lengths of the loops that connect the neighboring antiparallel strands at both ends of the β-barrel (cf. Figs. 2 and 3). At the bottom, two of the three loops have identical lengths, whereas loop B/C is longer by one residue in ApoD. Notably, at the open end of the β-barrel, where the ligand-binding site is situated, all four loops have a different length in ApoD when compared with BBP (A/B, -1; C/D, +1; E/F, -2; G/H, -1). Furthermore, there are significant conformational differences in the loop region at the entrance to the ligand pocket as mentioned above. Despite these mutual deviations in the variable loop region, which are typical for the lipocalin family (31Skerra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the β-barrel is extremely well conserved between ApoD and BBP (Fig. 3A). This varying similarity in main chain conformation also becomes apparent from an r.m.s.d. plot (Fig. 3B). In particular, the conserved lipocalin sequence motif GXWX, which occurs within the N-terminal loop that runs across the bottom of the β-barrel before it enters into strand A (residues 24-27), is conformationally almost identical between the two crystal structures, except that the solvent-exposed side chain at position 27 corresponds to a Tyr in ApoD and to a Trp in BBP. The pronounced similarity between the β-barrel structures of ApoD and BBP becomes furthermore evident from an analysis of the interior residue packing within its lower part. There, 26 amino acids whose side chains protrude from the strands and the bottom loops into the β-barrel form the hydrophobic core of ApoD: Phe-17, Val-19, Tyr-22, Gly-24, Trp-26, Glu-28, Lys-31, Ala-44, Tyr-46, Ile-54, Val-56, Asn-58, Ile-70, Gly-72, Ala-74, Pro-76, Leu-85, Val-87, Tyr-98, Ile-100, Thr-103, Ala-109, Val-111, Phe-125, Trp-127, Leu-129. Among these, 18 amino acids are identical with BBP, whereas another 4 residues correspond to conservative substitutions (cf. Fig. 2). The resulting sequence similarity of 85% in this region is much higher than with other lipocalins. For example, there are just 9 amino acid identities between ApoD and human plasma RBP (PDB: 1RBP) (41Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) within this set, together with ∼10 conservative substitutions. This finding illustrates the unusual structural relationship between human ApoD and the insect BBP despite their large evolutionary distance. Role of “Solubilizing” Amino Acid Substitutions—In a preceding protein engineering study (15Nasreen A. Vogt M. Kim H.J. Eichinger A. Skerra A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), 4 amino acid exchanges were introduced at the surface of ApoD (W99H, C116S, I118S, L120S) to enhance the solubility of the recombinant protein and another three (L23P, P133V, N134A) were introduced to facilitate its genetic manipulation (42Vogt M. Skerra A. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). At all of these sites, the polypeptide backbone conformation seems not to be influenced by the side chain substitutions also because residues in equivalent positions of the BBP are located very close to those of ApoD in the superimposed structures (Fig. 3A). In fact, the mutations introduced into human ApoD were all correctly predicted as pointing with their side chains into the solvent. Since there is no mutation inside the cavity, the binding activity for small molecules should not be affected, which is in agreement with biochemical data for the engineered protein (15Nasreen A. Vogt M. Kim H.J. Eichinger A. Skerra A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, only one of the replaced side chains, Ser-120, is directly involved in crystal-packing contacts. It forms a hydrogen bond between its OG atom and the backbone oxygen of Gly-65 of a neighboring molecule. Another 2 substituted residues, Ser-116, and Ser-118, form intermolecular hydrogen bonds via their main chain atoms, as explained above. Together with the generally enhanced solubi"
https://openalex.org/W2049862220,"We identified a new extracellular protein, TM14, by differential hybridization using mouse tooth germ cDNA microarrays. TM14 cDNA encodes 440 amino acids containing a signal peptide. The protein contains 3 EGF modules at the center, a C-terminal domain homologous to the fibulin module, and a unique Sushi domain at the N terminus. In situ hybridization revealed that TM14 mRNA was expressed by preodontoblasts and odontoblasts in developing teeth. TM14 mRNA was also expressed in cartilage, hair follicles, and extraembryonic tissues of the placenta. Immunostaining revealed that TM14 was localized at the apical pericellular regions of preodontoblasts. When the dentin matrix was fully formed and dentin mineralization occurred, TM14 was present in the predentin matrix and along the dentinal tubules. We found that the recombinant TM14 protein was glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides and interacted with heparin, fibronectin, fibulin-1, and dentin sialophosphoprotein. We also found that TM14 preferentially bound dental mesenchyme cells and odontoblasts but not dental epithelial cells or nondental cells such as HeLa, COS7, or NIH3T3 cells. Heparin, EDTA, and anti-integrin β1 antibody inhibited TM14 binding to dental mesenchyme cells, suggesting that both a heparan sulfate-containing cell surface receptor and an integrin are involved in TM14 cell binding. Our findings indicate that TM14 is a cell adhesion molecule that interacts with extracellular matrix molecules in teeth and suggest that TM14 plays important roles in both the differentiation and maintenance of odontoblasts as well as in dentin formation. Because of its protein characteristics, TM14 can be classified as a new member of the fibulin family: fibulin-7.

Effects on cell behavior and gene expression are often mediated through interactions between ECM molecules and cell surface receptors, leading to signal transduction across the plasma membrane. It is well known that many ECM proteins, including collagens, elastin, as well as other glycoproteins and proteoglycans are crucial for morphogenesis during embryonic development, and dysfunctions of these molecules cause congenital defects in humans. We have been interested in ECM molecules important in both tooth development and diseases. Previously, we identified the enamel matrix-specific protein ameloblastin that is essential for maintaining differentiated dental epithelial cells (ameloblasts) and for enamel formation (1Krebsbach P.H.

Cells Tissues Organs. 2005; 181: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this report, we characterized a new dentin matrix protein that we named TM14, which we identified in mouse tooth germ cDNA microarrays by differential hybridization (4Nakamura T. Unda F. de-Vega S. Vilaxa A. Fukumoto S. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 626-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mature teeth consist of two major mineralized tissues, dentin and enamel, the hardest tissue in the body. The development of these tissues is initiated by reciprocal interactions between the dental epithelium and mesenchyme, leading to the terminal differentiation of matrix-producing ameloblasts and odontoblasts, respectively (5Thesleff I. Hurmerinta K. Differentiation. 1981; 18: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Dental epithelial cells differentiate into enamel matrix-secreting ameloblasts, while the underlying neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells give rise to odontoblasts and its associated dentin matrix. Odontoblasts synthesize and secrete several collagenous and noncollagenous proteins to form the unique extracellular matrix of dentin. The differentiation of odontoblasts is characterized by a sequence of cytological and functional changes that occurs according to a specific spatiotemporal pattern. The cells in contact with the basement membrane elongate, polarize, and start to synthesize predentin and then dentin components such as type I, type V, and type VI collagens. Collagens constitute almost 90% of the organic matrix of dentin (6Ruch J. Revis. Biol. Cellular. 1987; 14: 1-99Google Scholar). During odontoblast differentiation, the basement membrane is degraded and replaced with predentin. The noncollagenous matrix proteins are minor constituents in calcified tissues, but they play very important roles in regulating both cell activities and extracellular matrix events. Odontoblasts also secrete proteoglycans such as decorin and biglycan (7Matsuura T. Duarte W.R. Cheng H. Uzawa K. Yamauchi M.

Fibronectin stabilizes the attachment of ECM to cells by acting as binding sites for cell surface receptors and plays a role in odontoblast polarization (15Lesot H. Osman M. Ruch J.V. Dev.

Fibronectin transitorily accumulates at the apical surface of dental mesenchyme cells and polarizing preodontoblasts and at later stages, surrounds the odontoblast cell surface (18Lesot H.

Fibulins are a family of secreted glycoproteins defined by the presence of two structural modules: tandem repeats of an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module and a unique C-terminal fibulin-type module. Argraves et al. (20Argraves W.S. Dickerson K. Burgess W.H. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1989; 58: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) described the first member of this family, fibulin-1, as a binding partner for the fibronectin receptor integrin and an important regulator of cell adhesion. So far, 5 other members (fibulins 2-6) have been identified and they modulate cell morphology, growth, adhesion, and motility (21Gallagher W.M. Currid C.A. Whelan L.C. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 336-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All of the fibulins are glycoproteins that have several N-linked acceptor sites (22Timpl R. Sasaki T. Kostka G. Chu M.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The members of the family have been classified into 2 subgroups. In the first subgroup, fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 are larger than the other members because they have an extra domain with 3 anaphylatoxin modules and more of the EGF modules (23Kobayashi N. Kostka G. Garbe J.H. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. Hanisch F.G. Markova D. Tsuda T. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11805-11816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The remaining fibulin members form the second subgroup. Fibulins are implicated in many protein-protein interactions, particularly with other extracellular matrix proteins. For example, fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 both bind fibronectin, but other fibulins do not (23Kobayashi N. Kostka G. Garbe J.H. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. Hanisch F.G. Markova D. Tsuda T. Timpl R. Chu M.L.

It is thought that fibulins act as intramolecular bridges within the ECM to form supramolecular structures. Fibulin proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner during embryo development, but to date only fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 are found at the interaction site between the epithelium and mesenchyme in certain ectodermal tissues (24Zhang H.Y.

C Embryo Today. 2004; 72: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the dysregulation of some fibulins is linked to cancer, and both tumor suppressive and oncogenic roles have been proposed for members of the fibulin family (for review, see Ref. 21Gallagher W.M. Currid C.A. Whelan L.C. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 336-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, we show that TM14 is a 440-amino acid protein that has a signal peptide and a calculated molecular weight of ∼48 kDa. The protein contains 3 EGF modules at the center and a C terminus that is homologous to the classical fibulin C-terminal module. TM14 contains a unique Sushi domain at the N terminus. TM14 mRNA was expressed not only in developing teeth but also in extraembryonic tissues of the placenta, hair follicles, and cartilage. Immunostaining revealed that TM14 appeared first in the apical surface of preodontoblasts. At the later differentiation stage, TM14 was localized in the predentin matrix and the dentinal tubules. We also found that TM14 was a cell adhesion molecule for dental mesenchyme cells and odontoblasts and that it bound to heparin, fibulin-1, DSPP, and fibronectin, suggesting interesting roles of TM14 in odontogenesis. Because of some motif homologies and protein interaction activities similar to fibulins, TM14 may be classified as a new member of the fibulin family, fibulin-7. Cloning of TM14 cDNA—A mouse E19.5 molar tooth cDNA library was constructed and screened by differential hybridization using DNA microarrays as described previously (4Nakamura T. Unda F. de-Vega S. Vilaxa A. Fukumoto S. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 626-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Eleven clones for potential new genes were preferentially identified in molar mRNA, and one of these clones, which we named TM14, was further characterized in this study. By RT-PCR (primers TM14-F0 and TM14-R0, supplemental Table S1) using RNA from newborn mouse molars, we obtained the full-length cDNA for TM14. RT-PCR and Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from newborn mouse tissues using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen). 2 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription to generate cDNA, which was used as a template for PCR with gene-specific primers, TM14F and TM14R (supplemental Table S1). Each cDNA was amplified using ExTaq polymerase (Takara) with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1.2 min, then 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 32 cycles, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min and then separated on agarose gels. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Extraction, Purification and Analysis of Messenger RNA from Eukaryotic Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeling of cDNA was performed with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with labeled probes at 68 °C in QuikHyb (Stratagene), washed first at 65 °C in 1× SSC with 0.1% SDS and then at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS, and exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak). In Situ Hybridization of Tissue Sections—Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled, single-stranded RNA probes for TM14 were prepared using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid p301, containing a 1.2-kb cDNA insert for TM14, was used to prepare antisense and sense probes using EcoRI/T7 polymerase and XhoI/T3 polymerase, respectively. In situ hybridization of the tissue sections was performed as follows. Frozen tissue sections of newborn mouse embryo heads, E19.5 limbs, and E16 placenta were cut and placed on RNase-free glass slides. After drying the frozen sections for 30 min at room temperature, the sections were treated with 20 μg/ml of proteinase K for 20 min at RT. Hybridization was performed in Hybrisol I solution (Serologicals Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD) at 50 °C overnight, and washes were carried out with 2× SSC and 2× SSC containing 50% formamide at 53 °C. The slides were then subjected to digestion with 0.1 μg/ml RNase A in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 15 min to remove nonhybridized DIG-labeled RNA and washed again. The DIG Nucleic Acid Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to detect signals according to the manufacturer's instructions. For paraffin sections, the slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series in RNase-free water. Then, they were treated as previously described for frozen sections. Plasmid Construction and Recombinant Proteins—Mouse IMAGE clone 4167912 was used as a template to produce TM14f (amino acid residues 23-440), TM14d1 (amino acid residues 41-440), and the N-terminal short deletion TM14d2 (amino acid residues 75-440), and the mouse IMAGE clone BC007140 was used as a template to prepare fibulin-1 (Fbln1, amino acid residues 30-705) construct by PCR using pfu Turbo Hot Start DNA polymerase (Stratagene) (primer sequences in supplemental Table S1). TM14d1 and TM14d2 cDNA were cloned into the pCEP4-Mul-PURD, which contains a BM-40 signal peptide, a His tag, and a multicloning site under the control of the CMV promoter and enhancer as described (34Hozumi K. Suzuki N. Nielsen P.K. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32929-32940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TM14f and Fbln1 cDNA were cloned into a modified pBFX vector (35Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28057-28065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which contains a IL2R signal peptide and a FLAG tag under the control of the CMV promoter. These cDNA clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant expression vectors were transfected into Freestyle 293F cells (Invitrogen) by using 293Fectin reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Because TM14f accumulated in the cytoplasm and was not secreted into the media, it was not purified for functional analysis. After incubating the transfectants in suspension culture for 3 days, the conditioned medium was recovered by centrifugation, and TM14d1 and TM14d2 proteins were purified with the Probond Purification System (Invitrogen). The medium was cleared of debris by centrifugation, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) was added to decrease proteolysis. For TM14d1 and TM14d2 recombinant proteins, Nickel-charged agarose resins (Probond, Invitrogen) were equilibrated with PBS and added to the conditioned medium. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resins were transferred to a column and washed with a solution containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0), and 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged TM14 recombinant proteins were eluted with a solution containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0), and 250 mm imidazole. For Fbln1 recombinant protein, an Anti-FLAG M2 affinity Gel (Sigma) was equilibrated with TBS and added to the conditioned medium. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h to capture the Fbln1 FLAG fusion protein, the resin was collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min) and washed with TBS to remove all of the nonspecific proteins. The FLAG protein was eluted by competition with FLAG peptide (Sigma). Purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS and quantified using the BCA protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Pierce). Full-length human DSPP cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from human kidney poly(A)+ RNA (BD BioSciences) using SuperScript III One-Step with Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). The ∼3.9 kbp product was subcloned into pVQAd5CMV K-Npa plasmid (ViraQuest Inc.) and grown in STBL-2 Escherichia coli cells. Bacterial recombination events resulted in one clone (hDSPPxRep) that upon sequencing was found to be identical to the published reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NP_055023) except the in-frame removal of amino acid residues 576-1295, most of the “SSD” repeats. The adenovirus construct therefore encoded all of DSP and all of DSPP except for the majority of the SSD repeats. Human marrow stromal cells (a gift of Dr. Pamela G. Robey, NIDCR, NIH) were infected with this virus for 24 h and then grown in serum-free, α-MEM for 20 days. Conditioned media (about 50% of the total protein was recombinant hDSPPxRep protein) was collected every 72 h. Protein purification was completed using a Sartobind® Q15X strong anion-exchange preparative membrane system (Sartorius). The membrane was prewashed with 6 m urea, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the conditioned media was then loaded. The membrane was washed with 25 ml of 6 m urea in 0.5× TBS and then 100 ml of 6 m urea in PBS. Protein was eluted in step gradient fashion of increasing amounts of NaCl in 6 m urea in PBS, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The 0.55 m NaCl elution fraction used in this study showed no observable proteins in the preparation other than the hDSPPxRep protein by Coomassie Blue staining. Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-human DSPP (LF-151) (36Gronthos S. Brahim J. Li W. Fisher L.W. Cherman N. Boyde A. DenBesten P. Robey P.G. Shi S. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) showed the recombinant protein to be a ∼200 kDa protein with good post-translational modifications (significantly higher Mr than the lower salt step gradient fractions). Antibodies—To produce polyclonal antibody against TM14, rabbits were immunized with the synthetic peptide CPALEAPPDGKKFGSKYLVDHE (amino acid residues 81-102) conjugated to KLH through the Cys via maleimide. The antibody was affinity-purified by using the antigenic peptide conjugated to Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce). Mouse monoclonal antibody against fibronectin was purchased from Chemicon. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to fibronectin was purchased from Abcam. Rabbit polyclonal antibody (LF-151) for DSPP was described previously (36Gronthos S. Brahim J. Li W. Fisher L.W. Cherman N. Boyde A. DenBesten P. Robey P.G. Shi S. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase (HRP) antibody was purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Tissue Sections and Immunohistochemistry—Newborn, postnatal day 2 (P2), and P21 mouse heads were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, into xylene, and then embedded in Paraplast paraffin. Sections were cut at 10 μm on a microtome (RM2155, Leica). For immunohistochemistry, the sections were dewaxed and treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. Then, sections were treated with proteinase K at 1 μg/ml (Roche Applied Sciences) at 37 °C for 30 min, blocked with Rodent Block M (Biocare Medical) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against TM14 (1:50) and rabbit polyclonal fibronectin (Abcam, 1:250) for 3 h or 1 h, respectively, at room temperature. The specimens were treated with secondary rabbit antibody in Rodent HRP-Polymer (Biocare Medical) for 30 min and were detected by DAB chromogen (Vector). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Immunoreactivity was observed under a light microscope (Axiovert, Zeiss). Deglycosylation of TM14 Recombinant Proteins—The purified TM14 proteins were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation by N-Glycanase, PNGaseF, sialidase A, or O-glycanase with the Enzymatic Deglycosylation kit (Glyco) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, incubation buffer and denaturation solution were added to the protein and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. After cooling to room temperature, detergent solution and 1 μl of each enzyme were added and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the protein was analyzed by Western blot. Solid-phase Binding Assay—96-well, flat bottom microtiter plates (Immunolon 2HB, Thermo) were coated with 0.1 μg/well of recombinant histidine-tagged TM14d2 in bicarbonate buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, and 3 mm NaN3 at pH 9.2) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed five times with 0.1% Tween-DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, containing calcium and magnesium) and then blocked with 2% BSA in DPBS for 5 h at room temperature. hDSPPxRep, fibulin-1 (recombinant FLAG-tagged), or fibronectin (Sigma) proteins were added in triplicate in a serial dilution in DPBS and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed 5 times with 0.1% Tween-DPBS and incubated with DSPP, FLAG-HRP, or fibronectin antibodies (1:500) for 90 min at room temperature. Goat anti-rabbit (for hDSPPxRep) and goat anti-mouse (for fibronectin) antibodies conjugated with HRP (Pierce 1:1000) in DPBS were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl Benzidine substrate solution (TMB, Pierce) was added to the wells for 30 min at room temperature. After addition of 2 n H2SO4 to stop the colorimetric reaction, optical density was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Control plates were prepared by coating them with 0.1 μg/well of BSA instead of TM14d2 and used for protein binding assays, similar to TM14d2-coated wells. There was little protein binding to the control plates. Heparin Acrylic Beads Binding Assay—A 50-μl aliquot of heparin acrylic beads (Sigma) was washed twice with DPBS to remove unbound heparin molecules. For blocking, BSA was added and incubated 2 h at 4 °C under rotation. After washing several times with DPBS, increasing amounts of TM14d2 protein were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under rotation. The beads were then separated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice with 100 μl of DPBS. The beads were boiled in a sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, electrophoresed on SDS/PAGE, and the TM14d2 protein detected using a TM14 antibody (1:500) after transfer. Cell Culture—For dental mesenchyme and epithelial cell cultures, molars from P1 mice were dissected. Molars were treated with 0.1% collagenase/0.05% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min, and the dental mesenchyme was separated from the dental epithelium. The tissues were further treated with 0.1% collagenase/0.05% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA for 15 min. Epithelial cells were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM medium supplemented with EGF, bovine pituitary extract (BPE), and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Dental mesenchyme cells, HeLa, COS7, and NIH3T3 cells (from ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Dental mesenchyme cells were induced to differentiate by the treatment with hr BMP2 (200 ng/ml) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) for 48 h. Cell Binding Assay—Cells were detached with 0.05% EDTA, washed with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, and resuspended to a concentration of 3.5 × 105 cells/ml. Assays were performed in 96-well, round-bottom microtiter plates (Immulon-2H, Dynex Technologies, Inc.). Wells were coated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of various amounts of TM14d2, fibronectin (Sigma), laminin-2 (human laminin, Invitrogen), or laminin-1 (mouse EHS laminin, Invitrogen) which were diluted with PBS and then blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 2 × 103 cells in 100 μl of DMEM were plated and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Attached cells were stained for 10 min with 0.2% crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% methanol. After washing with H2O, cells were dissolved in 10% SDS, and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. For the cell binding inhibition experiments using heparin (Sigma) or antibodies against integrin β1 (HMβ1-1, BD PharMingen), cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml each of these inhibitors at room temperature for 30 min before plating. cDNA Sequence, Gene Structure, and Protein Domains of TM14—We previously constructed a cDNA library from mouse tooth germs and prepared DNA microarrays containing ∼11,000 cDNA clones (4Nakamura T. Unda F. de-Vega S. Vilaxa A. Fukumoto S. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 626-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cDNA microarray was screened by differential hybridization using RNA from newborn teeth and non-tooth tissues to identify novel genes important for tooth and craniofacial development. We have obtained several new or previously uncharacterized genes that are preferentially expressed in teeth. One of the clones"
https://openalex.org/W2119879750,"We report here the discovery and characterization of Ehp, a new secreted Staphylococcus aureus protein that potently inhibits the alternative complement activation pathway. Ehp was identified through a genomic scan as an uncharacterized secreted protein from S. aureus, and immunoblotting of conditioned S. aureus culture medium revealed that the Ehp protein was secreted at the highest levels during log-phase bacterial growth. The mature Ehp polypeptide is composed of 80 residues and is 44% identical to the complement inhibitory domain of S. aureus Efb (extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein). We observed preferential binding by Ehp to native and hydrolyzed C3 relative to fully active C3b and found that Ehp formed a subnanomolar affinity complex with these various forms of C3 by binding to its thioester-containing C3d domain. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Arg75 and Asn82 are important in forming the Ehp·C3d complex, but loss of these side chains did not completely disrupt Ehp/C3d binding. This suggested the presence of a second C3d-binding site in Ehp, which was mapped to the proximity of Ehp Asn63. Further molecular level details of the Ehp/C3d interaction were revealed by solving the 2.7-Å crystal structure of an Ehp·C3d complex in which the low affinity site had been mutationally inactivated. Ehp potently inhibited C3b deposition onto sensitized surfaces by the alternative complement activation pathway. This inhibition was directly related to Ehp/C3d binding and was more potent than that seen for Efb-C. An altered conformation in Ehp-bound C3 was detected by monoclonal antibody C3-9, which is specific for a neoantigen exposed in activated forms of C3. Our results suggest that increased inhibitory potency of Ehp relative to Efb-C is derived from the second C3-binding site in this new protein.

Staphylococcus aureus is a widely disseminated and persistent human pathogen that has a long-standing and increasingly negative impact on human health. It is the primary cause of numerous disorders that range from the seemingly mild (such as skin and soft-tissue infections) to several potentially fatal conditions (such as bacteremia, necrotizing pneumonia, and endocarditis) as well as infections associated with implanted medical devices (such as intravascular catheters, pacemakers, and delivery pumps) (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). One of the most striking features of S. aureus biology is its ability to survive and colonize distinct microenvironments within the host organism, and this propensity clearly contributes to its ability to form long-lasting and repetitive infections (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). To facilitate host colonization, S. aureus expresses a diverse array of virulence-determining factors, including exoenzymes, toxins, and numerous protein adhesins. These adhesins (termed receptins (2Kronvall G. Jonsson K. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) or MSCRAMM® proteins (3Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar)) are believed to contribute to the initiation and propagation of infections by precluding bacterial clearance by physical forces. Over the last several years, it has also become clear that S. aureus produces a series of immunomodulators that promote virulence by affecting both arms of the host immune system (4Lee L.Y.L. Miyamoto Y.J. McIntyre B.W. Höök M. McCrea K.W. McDevitt D. Brown E.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Lee L.Y.L. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Components of the innate immune system represent the first line of defense against infection, and S. aureus has consequently evolved modulators of this system (5Lee L.Y.L. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In regard to cell-mediated innate immunity, a secreted chemotaxis inhibitory protein from S. aureus (CHIPS) that blocks function of the C5a and formylated peptide receptors required for chemotaxis or neutrophils was recently described (6de Haas C.J.C. Veldkamp K.E. Peschel A. Weerkamp F. van Wamel W.J.B. Heezius E.C.J.M. Poppelier M.J.J.G. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In terms of humoral innate immunity, the circulating complement system is a primary target of virulence factors produced by many pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi (7Wurzner R. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Lachmann P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8461-8462Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Hornef M.W. Wick M.J. Rhen M. Normark S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and because the complement component C3 serves a central role in the amplification of all three complement pathways, it is an attractive target for inhibition or modulation of this essential immune response (5Lee L.Y.L. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Indeed, SCIN, a secreted complement inhibitory protein from S. aureus that effects the function of C3 convertases, was identified late in 2005 (11Rooijakkers S.H.M. Ruyken M. Roos A. Daha M.R. Presanis J.S. Sim R.B. van Wamel W.J.B. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and a C3-binding and complement inhibitory activity was recently described for the secreted S. aureusextracellular fibrinogen-binding protein Efb (5Lee L.Y.L. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Lee L.Y.L. Liang X. Höök M.

Together, these examples illustrate that inhibiting the normal function of the innate immune system is fundamentally important to the success of S. aureus as a human pathogen. Three lines of current evidence suggest that S. aureus may express additional complement inhibitory proteins, the functions of which are not yet appreciated. First, S. aureus has been shown to activate all three complement pathways (13Neth O. Jack D.L. Johnson M. Klein N.J. Turner M.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4430-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Kawasaki A. Takada H. Kotani S. Inai S. Nagaki K. Matsumoto M. Yokogawa K. Kawata S. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Microbiol.

Kim Y. Peterson P.K. Quie P.G. Michael A.F. Infect. Immun. 1978; 20: 388-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mice that have been complement-depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor succumb quickly to staphylococcal bacteremia (18Sakiniene E. Bremell T. Tarkowski A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This underscores the importance of complement inhibition in S. aureus virulence. Second, complement proteins are among the most abundant components in human plasma (19Schuhard M. Melm C. Crawford A. Chapman H. Cockrill S. Ray K. Mehigh R. Chen D. Scott G. Proteomic Technologies Reagents Resource Workshop, Specific Depletion of Twenty High Abundance Proteins from Human Plasma.

Proteomics. 2002; 1: 947-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This makes it unlikely that any single complement inhibitory protein could be expressed by the pathogen at levels sufficient to provide a completely effective mode of protection from complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis. Finally, the numerous functions of C3, along with their accompanying regulatory mechanisms, provide many different locations at which inhibitory strategies could be executed (10Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Indeed, although SCIN and Efb both block complement activation, their mechanisms of action appear to be completely distinct (11Rooijakkers S.H.M. Ruyken M. Roos A. Daha M.R. Presanis J.S. Sim R.B. van Wamel W.J.B. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Hammel M. Sfyroera G. Ricklin D. Magotti P. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that S. aureus may express additional proteins that act on the human immune response, we recently conducted an in silico screen to identify uncharacterized secreted proteins of S. aureus. 4B. V. Geisbrecht and M. Pop, unpublished data. Using this approach, we identified the protein SAV1155, the further characterization of which we report here. SAV1155 was expressed at the highest levels during log-phase culture growth, displayed a high level of sequence identity to Efb, and formed a subnanomolar affinity complex with human complement component C3. Functional analysis of SAV1155 demonstrated that it potently inhibited the alternative pathway of complement activation by perturbing the solution conformation of C3. On the basis of these properties, we have tentatively assigned the name Ehp (for Efb homologous protein) to SAV1155. Our results support previous work that identified induced conformational change in C3 as a novel basis for complement inhibition and elaborate upon both the structure and function of a growing family of small secreted complement inhibitory proteins from S. aureus (22Rooijakkers S.H.M. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—A designer gene fragment encoding residues 30–109 of Ehp was amplified from S. aureus genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-aaagtcgacccaaactaaaaacgttgaagctgctaaaaaatatgatcag-3′ and 5′-tttgcggccgcttattttaaagtattatattttaaaactagatcgatttgtct-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. These oligonucleotides appended SalI and NotI restriction endonuclease sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the amplified Ehp-encoding sequence, and the amplified DNA was digested and cloned into the corresponding sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pT7HMT (23Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following verification of the Ehp-encoding region, this expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for recombinant protein expression. Expression, refolding, and purification of Ehp were carried out according to the general protocol reported previously (23Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ehp purified in this fashion was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, migrated as a monomeric 11,000-Da species as judged by analytical gel filtration chromatography, and had an experimental molecular mass of 9809.09 Da (predicted molecular mass of 9803.37 Da) according to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The increased molecular mass of recombinant Ehp over that of the predicted mature form of the protein was due to the presence of three additional residues (-GST-) at its N terminus that resulted from the subcloning procedure. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ehp was carried out according to the two-step megaprimer PCR method (24Sakar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Following expression and purification, the structural integrity of all mutants was confirmed by analytical gel filtration chromatography and comparative circular dichroism spectropolarimetry with wild-type Ehp as described previously (23Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding residues 996–1287 of human C3 was amplified via PCR to encode the C1010A mutation and subcloned into a modified form of pET28a lacking all tags. This vector encodes the additional residues MGSRST- at its N terminus, and the C1010A mutation is necessary to avoid the formation of the reactive thioester bond found in native C3 (10Sahu A.

Bacterial Culture and Analysis of Conditioned Medium—S. aureus strain Mu50 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in LB broth in a 37 °C shaking incubator. To analyze the proteins present in the conditioned culture medium at various time points, a 5-ml preculture was diluted into 50 ml of sterile LB broth to achieve an initial A600 nm of 0.1. Samples equivalent to 1.0 A600 nm unit were withdrawn and sterile-filtered at 2, 4, 6, 10, 18, 24, and 48 h post-dilution. Following normalization of the volume for the density of the culture, each sample was concentrated to 0.2 ml in an Amicon centrifugal concentrator (5000 nominal Mr cutoff). 20 μl of each sample was separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting as described (21Hammel M.

Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Purified recombinant Ehp was used to elicit the production of anti-Ehp polyclonal antibodies in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were purchased from and maintained and immunized according to the standard protocols of Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc. (Woodbine, MD). For affinity purification, 100 μl of post-immune serum was diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 5The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) and applied by gravity flow to a 1-ml column containing 1 mg of Ehp immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. After washing with 10 ml of PBST, bound antibodies were eluted by applying 2 ml of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.0), followed by immediate neutralization with 0.2 ml of 1 m Tris base. The affinity-purified antibodies were dialyzed into PBS and used at a final concentration of 1:100 as the primary probe for immunoblotting according to a previously published procedure (28Geisbrecht B.V.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig secondary antibody was purchased from Sigma. Pulldown Assays and Proteomics—Ehp, Efb, Efb-C, and Efb-C(R131E/N138E) were immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose fast flow according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The coupling density was 2 mg/ml of resin for all proteins except Efb, which was coupled at 3 mg/ml to account for its larger molecular mass relative to the others. Following quenching of excess reactive groups with 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 h at 25 °C, the affinity resins were washed and stored as 50% slurries in PBST. To test for binding to plasma proteins, aliquots of EDTA-stabilized human plasma were diluted 1:100 in PBST and mixed individually with 20 μl of each affinity resin in a total volume of 1 ml. Following a 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the resins were isolated by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 2 min, and washed five times with 1 ml of PBST. After the last wash, each resin was resuspended in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, mixed briefly, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Following sample preparation, the proteins contained in each sample were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For protein identification, the bands of interest were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolysis by trypsin as described by Kinter and Sherman (29Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Wiley-Interscience, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting tryptic fragments were extracted, separated by capillary liquid chromatography (LC), and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (29Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Wiley-Interscience, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). Proteins were identified by comparing the observed fragmentation ion patterns against a data base of human proteins using the MASCOT software package (29Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Wiley-Interscience, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—All SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore 2000 biosensor at 25 °C using running buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20) as described previously (21Hammel M. Sfyroera G. Ricklin D. Magotti P. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To examine Ehp binding to C3 and its various fragments, 200–600 response units of Ehp were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min using amine coupling (5-min activation and deactivation). All C3 fragments were screened at a concentration of 200 nm and at a flow rate of 20 μl/min with injection and dissociation phases of 3 min each. The Ehp surface was regenerated with two 30-s injections of 0.1% SDS and reconstituted in running buffer for 10 min. An empty flow cell, which was only activated and deactivated, was used as a reference surface. Three buffer blanks were included in each analysis, and their average signals were subtracted from the processed sample responses (double referencing) (30Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recogit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Data processing and analysis were performed using Scrubber (Version 2.0a, BioLogic Software Pty. Ltd.). The SPR experiments were repeated three times using different immobilization densities and protein batches, essentially leading to the same ranking result. Native C3 was freshly reconstituted from MES-precipitated samples and kept on ice until immediately prior to analysis on the same day. Under these conditions, contamination with C3(H2O) was found to be <2% (21Hammel M. Sfyroera G. Ricklin D. Magotti P. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed at 25 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal) as described previously (21Hammel M. Sfyroera G. Ricklin D. Magotti P. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, all proteins were dissolved in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl to a final concentration of either 150 μm for S. aureus proteins or 12 μm for recombinant C3d or C3dg. A preliminary 1-μl injection of the S. aureus protein into a solution of C3d was followed by multiple injections of 5 μl at 240-s intervals, and the evolved heat was measured. After correcting the observed heat values for the effects of dilution and background buffer titration, all processed data were fit using Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab) to either a single- or two-site binding model to give the final experimental values for enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). Complement Inhibition Assays—The abilities of Ehp and its various mutants to inhibit the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation were evaluated using previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods (31Kraus D. Medof D.E. Mold C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 399-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sfyroera G. Katragadda M. Morikis D. Isaacs S.N. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2143-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For both assays, detection of C3b bound to the wells was achieved using a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human C3 antibody (MP Biomedicals). Following extensive washing with PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20, color was developed by addition of the peroxidase substrate 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Percent inhibition was plotted against the protein concentration, and the resulting data set was fit to a logistic dose-response function using Origin 7.0 software. IC50 values were obtained from the fit parameters that achieved the lowest χ2 value. C3 Capture ELISA—EDTA-stabilized plasma diluted 1:10 in PBS was incubated with or without 25 μm Ehp, the various site-directed mutants of Ehp, or controls at 37 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was added to an ELISA plate coated with monoclonal antibody C3-9 (2 μg/ml), which recognizes a neoantigen that is exposed in C3(H2O), C3b, and C3c, but not in native C3 (33Hack C.E.

The wells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 and incubated with rabbit anti-C3a polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) that had been affinity-purified on a CNBr-Sepharose column derivatized with an N-terminal C3a peptide (H-SVQLTEKRMDKVGKYPKELRK-NH2) (33Hack C.E.

Detection of bound anti-C3a antibody was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000) and the peroxidase substrate 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Values were plotted against the protein concentration, and the resulting data set was fit to a logistic dose-response function using Origin 7.0 software. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, Refinement, and Analysis—The Ehp(N63E)·C3d complex was reconstituted from purified monomers and isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 (26/60) column (GE Healthcare). Following purification, the complex was dialyzed against double-distilled H2O and concentrated to 13 mg/ml complex by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Twinned needle cluster crystals of the complex were obtained by vapor diffusion of hanging drops consisting of equal volumes of 13 mg/ml Ehp(N63E)·C3d and a mother liquid of 0.2 m Li2SO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). Although the original crystals did not diffract x-rays, inclusion of 0.2 m CaCl2 as an additive in the mother liquid occasionally resulted in clusters with blades of sufficient thickness to allow their manipulation and a more thorough diffraction analysis. The Ehp(N63E)·C3d crystals appeared within 7 days and belonged to the space group P21, with cell dimensions of a = 67.89, b = 91.03, and c = 122.60 Å and β = 89.93° and four complete complexes in the asymmetric unit, which corresponded to a solvent content of 44.5%. The structure of Ehp(N63E)·C3d was solved by molecular replacement using x-ray diffraction data to 2.7-Å limiting resolution collected from a single frozen crystal at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team beamline 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory. Following data processing using the HKL2000 software package, molecular replacement was carried out with the refined structure of Efb-C·C3d as a search model (Protein Data Bank Code 2GOX) (21Hammel M.

https://openalex.org/W2068931327,"The activating transcription factor, ATF-2, is a target of p38 and JNK that are involved in stress-induced apoptosis. Heterozygous Atf-2 mutant (Atf-2+/-) mice are highly prone to mammary tumors. The apoptosis-regulated gene GADD45alpha and the breast cancer suppressor gene Maspin, both of which are known to be p53 target genes, are downregulated in the mammary tumors arisen in Atf-2+/- mice. Here, we have analysed how ATF-2 controls the transcription of GADD45alpha and Maspin. ATF-2 and p53 independently activate the GADD45alpha transcription. ATF-2 does not directly bind to the GADD45alpha promoter; instead, it is recruited via Oct-1 and NF-I. ATF-2 simultaneously binds to Oct-1, NF-I and breast cancer suppressor BRCA1 to activate transcription. With regard to Maspin, ATF-2 and p53 directly bind to different sites in the Maspin promoter to independently activate its transcription. Consistent with the observation that ATF-2 and p53 independently activate the transcription of Maspin and GADD45alpha is that the loss of one copy of p53 shortened the period required for mammary tumor development in Atf-2+/- mice. These studies suggest the functional link between the ATF-2 and the two tumor suppressors BRCA1 and p53."
https://openalex.org/W1964029491,"Stromal–epithelial interactions play a central role in development and tumorigenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in the intestine is involved in both of these processes. Inactivation of BMP pathway genes in the epithelium is known to cause intestinal polyposis. However, the role of the intestinal stroma in polyp initiation is incompletely understood. We observed that conditional inactivation of the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) in the stroma leads to epithelial hyperplasia throughout the colon with increased epithelial cell proliferation. Mutant mice developed rectal bleeding and hamartomatous polyps in the colorectum. The polyps demonstrated increased proliferation of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the mucosa with an expansion of the myofibroblast cell population. These results demonstrate that genetic mutations altering the BMP signaling pathway in the stromal microenvironment can lead to epithelial tumors in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W1973470243,"P-Rex1 is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac that is directly activated by the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and by the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is generated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Gβγ subunits and PIP3 are membrane-bound, whereas the intracellular localization of P-Rex1 in basal cells is cytosolic. Activation of PI3K alone is not sufficient to promote significant membrane translocation of P-Rex1. Here we investigated the subcellular localization of P-Rex1 by fractionation of Sf9 cells co-expressing P-Rex1 with Gβγ and/or PI3K. In basal, serum-starved cells, P-Rex1 was mainly cytosolic, but 7% of the total was present in the 117,000 × g membrane fraction. Co-expression of P-Rex1 with either Gβγ or PI3K caused only an insignificant increase in P-Rex1 membrane localization, whereas Gβγ and PI3K together synergistically caused a robust increase in membrane-localized P-Rex1 to 23% of the total. PI3K-driven P-Rex1 membrane recruitment was wortmannin-sensitive. The use of P-Rex1 mutants showed that the isolated Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain tandem of P-Rex1 is sufficient for synergistic Gβγ- and PI3K-driven membrane localization; that the enzymatic GEF activity of P-Rex1 is not required for membrane translocation; and that the other domains of P-Rex1 (DEP, PDZ, and IP4P) contribute to keeping the enzyme localized in the cytosol of basal cells.

Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

P-Rex1 was highly abundant in the neutrophil cytosol, representing around 0.1% of total protein (3Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

When overexpressed in the pig aortic endothelial (PAE) cell line, P-Rex1 was also localized in the cytosol (3Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Stimulation of P-Rex1-transfected PAE cells with PDGF resulted in PI3K-dependent (wortmannin-sensitive) and P-Rex1-dependent activation of Rac, as was clear from the resulting cytoskeletal changes of lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling. However, activation of PI3K did not result in any significant membrane translocation of P-Rex1 (3Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Hence, although the PI3K-dependent activator of P-Rex1, PIP3, is membrane-bound, its formation alone is not sufficient to induce significant P-Rex1 membrane localization.The Bokoch laboratory has recently studied the membrane translocation of endogenous P-Rex1 in neutrophils (13Zhao T. Nalbant P. Hoshino M. Dong X. Wu D. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using a mainly microscopy-based approach, they showed that endogenous neutrophil P-Rex1 translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to stimulation of GPCRs and that translocation can be inhibited by several pharmacological inhibitors, including wortmannin, which inhibits PI3K, M119, which inhibits Gβ-subunit binding to effectors, and several protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as stimulators of PKA (13Zhao T. Nalbant P. Hoshino M. Dong X. Wu D. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Here we investigated whether Gβγ subunits or the concomitant presence of both Gβγ and PIP3 are sufficient signal to mediate P-Rex1 membrane translocation, using fractionation of Sf9 cells expressing P-Rex1 either alone or with Gβγ and/or PI3K. We provide information on the relative contributions of Gβγ subunits and PI3K to P-Rex1 membrane translocation, the roles of the various domains of P-Rex1 in membrane translocation, and the effects of the subcellular localization on the catalytic activity of P-Rex1. Our results reinforce the notion that P-Rex1 acts as a coincidence detector for the concomitant activation of PI3Ks and GPCRs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESP-Rex1, Gβγ Subunit, and PI3K Constructs—The construction of most of the panel of cDNAs, encoding human full-length and mutant N-terminally EE-tagged P-Rex1, in the baculovirus transfer vector pAcoG1 used here was described previously (12Hill K.

The production of high titer baculovirus for each P-Rex1 construct and the basic infection conditions for the Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cell line with high titer virus were as described in Ref. 14Hill K.

The isolated DH (iDH) domain construct, a C-terminal truncation consisting of P-Rex1 residues Met1–Glu245, was generated by standard PCR cloning and subcloning into pAcoG1, which gave it an N-terminal EE epitope tag for use in Sf9 cells. For microscopy experiments, full-length P-Rex1 was constructed with NH2-terminal EGFP and GFP-myc tags. The heterotrimeric G protein subunits EE-Gβ1γ2 and the PI3K catalytic His6-p110γ and regulatory EE-p101 subunits were expressed as described (3Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J.

Baculovirus titers and expression times were optimized for concomitant expression of P-Rex1 with Gβγ subunits and PI3K, as assayed by immunoprecipitation with EE tag antibody and Western blotting. Infected cells were serum-starved in Grace's insect medium (11605-045; Invitrogen) for 6 h at 27 °C prior to cell fractionation. In some experiments, Sf9 cell culture dishes were pretreated with wortmannin at a final concentration of 100 nm for 20 min at room temperature before cell fractionation.Membrane Translocation Assay—Infected serum-starved Sf9 cells were washed in ice-cold lysis buffer (160 mm NaCl, 38 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) before being resuspended in lysis buffer containing anti-proteases (10 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Wortmannin-pretreated cells were washed and collected into buffer containing 100 nm wortmannin. Cells were lysed by probe sonication using the microprobe of a Misonix sonicator on setting 5 (20 watts) by three pulses of 15 s with 15-s pauses on ice. A 10% aliquot of the total lysate was removed for Western blotting control; the rest was submitted to low speed centrifugation at 400 × g, 10 min at 4 °C, to remove unbroken cells, debris, and nuclei. A 10% aliquot of the postnuclear supernatant was removed for Western blotting control, and the remainder was separated by ultracentrifugation at 117,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C into cytosol and membrane fractions. Membrane pellets were resuspended in boiling 1.2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Boiling 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the total lysate, postnuclear supernatant, and cytosol fractions to a final concentration of 1×, and samples were boiled for 5 min as soon as each fraction became available during the course of fractionation. All fractions were snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Samples from all stages of cell fractionation were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with EE tag antibody, followed by densitometric analysis. We chose the Sf9 cell system specifically because it supports concomitant expression of several exogenous proteins. However, expression levels of P-Rex1 did vary considerably between Sf9 cells that expressed P-Rex1 alone, P-Rex1 plus Gβγ or PI3K, or P-Rex1 plus Gβγ and PI3K. To control for variations in expression level, the amount of P-Rex1 in all subcellular fractions was always normalized to the average total lysate control for each fraction.Isolation of Membrane-bound and Cytosolic P-Rex1 for in Vitro GEF Assays—Sf9 cells were infected to express full-length EE-P-Rex1, serum-starved, lysed, and fractionated as described for the membrane translocation assay except that production was scaled up from 6 cm to eight 175-cm2 flasks per condition. Uninfected control cells were mock-treated through all stages. EE-P-Rex1 was extracted from the 150,000 × g membrane fraction by resuspending the membrane pellet in the same lysis buffer used during sonication of the cells except that it additionally contained 1% Triton X-100 and phosphatase inhibitors 20 mm NaF and 17 mm β-glycerophosphate. Concentrated Triton X-100, NaF, and β-glycerophosphate stocks were added to the cytosol fraction (150,000 × g supernatant) to give the same final concentrations. Membrane and cytosol fractions were incubated on ice with periodic mixing and vortexing for 20 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 117,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. EE-P-Rex1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using EE antibody covalently coupled to Sepharose beads. Samples were washed extensively, and purified membrane-derived and cytosol-derived P-Rex1 were eluted from the beads by the addition of excess free antigenic EE peptide. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (A6003; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and ice-cold glycerol was added to 50%, immediately before samples were snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Aliquots of the purified membrane- and cytosol-derived P-Rex1 were subjected to anti-EE Western blot analysis, densitometric scanning, and ImageJ analysis for quantification, using recombinant EE-P-Rex1 as a standard.Production of Recombinant Rac2 for in Vitro GEF Assays—Recombinant GDP-loaded post-translationally modified C-terminally EE epitope-tagged Rac2 for use in GEF activity assays in vitro was produced in Sf9 cells, purified by Triton X-114 phase separation and immunoprecipitation, and stored at -80 °C in 40 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4 (4 °C), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) cholate, 5 μm GDP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, essentially as previously described (14Hill K.

EE-P-Rex1 purified from membrane and cytosol fractions of Sf9 cells as described above was diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (4 °C), 10% ethylene glycol, 1% betaine, 0.01% sodium azide, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 m KCl, prior to the addition to the assay. GDP-loaded purified post-translationally modified recombinant Sf9 cell-derived EE-tagged Rac2 was incubated for 10 min on ice with liposomes made of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol. Membrane-derived P-Rex1, cytosol-derived P-Rex1, or negative controls prepared in parallel from uninfected mock-treated Sf9 cells were added, together with GTPγS (including [35S]GTPγS; NEG 030H; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Final concentrations were 30 nm Rac2, 10 nm membrane- or cytosol-derived P-Rex1, 5 μm GTPγS, and a 200 mm concentration of each lipid. Rac2 was isolated using its EE tag, and its [35S]GTPγS loading was measured by β-counting. EDTA (2 mm) was used to artificially GTPγS-load Rac2 as a positive control. In some assays, synthetic d-stearoyl/arachidonoyl-PIP3 (16Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

In these assays, PIP3 was incorporated into the liposomes to a final concentration of 0.2 μm, and Gβγ was added before the 10-min incubation on ice to a final concentration of 0.3 μm. To control for the presence of cholate in the Gβγ stock, cholate was added to controls to give the same concentration (0.005% final) in all samples.Live Video Microscopy of P-Rex1 in PAE Cells—PAE cells were cultured and transiently transfected with EGFP-DAPP1 or EGFP-P-Rex1 as described (17Anderson K.E.

Transfected cells were grown on glass coverslips for 14 h and then serum-starved for 11 h before being mounted in the 37 °C chamber of an Ultra-View confocal microscope. After 1–2 min, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for at least 10 min. Images were taken every 2–3 s throughout.Immunofluorescence Microscopy of P-Rex1 in THP-1 Cells—Monocytic THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HighClone), Glutamax and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with GFP-myc-P-Rex1 using the Amaxa Nucleofection kit, and positive clones were selected with 0.7 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Stable clones were maintained in the absence of G418. Before stimulation, cells were starved for 4 h in fetal bovine serum-free medium with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resupended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in starvation medium, and then stimulated with or without 100 nm MCP-1 for 90 s. Cells were fixed in an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, sedimented, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, transferred into 96-well plates, and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with Alexa-488 rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) to enhance the GFP signal, with Alexa-594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), washed, and transferred onto glass slides in ProLong Antifade embedding medium (Molecular Probes) under coverslips. Wide field microscopy was performed with a Nikon T-800, and images were deconvoluted with Openlab software (Improvision).Calculations and Statistics—To quantify P-Rex1 membrane translocation, densitometric scanning and ImageJ analysis were performed on triplicate Western blot bands of EE-P-Rex1 from total lysate, postnuclear supernatant, cytosol, and membrane fractions. The different fractions were compared on the same autoradiography film, using unsaturated exposures, and normalized for cell equivalents loaded. Levels of EE-P-Rex1 in the membrane fraction were expressed as a percentage of EE-P-Rex1 in the total lysate. Unless otherwise indicated, data are means ± S.E. of all experiments. Statistics were calculated using Student's t test.RESULTSActivation of PI3K Is Not Sufficient to Induce P-Rex1 Membrane Recruitment—In our earlier work, we found that intracellular localization of P-Rex1 in unstimulated cells was cytosolic, both for endogenous protein from pig neutrophils and for overexpressed P-Rex1 in the endothelial PAE cell line (3Welch H.C.

In order to investigate whether we might have missed a minor or transient translocation of P-Rex1 in PDGF-stimulated PAE cells, we performed here similar experiments using live video microscopy with NH2-terminally EGFP-tagged P-Rex1. We compared the localization of P-Rex1 during PDGF stimulation of PAE cells with that of DAPP1, which is well known to translocate to the plasma membrane (17Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M.

Under conditions where PDGF stimulation led to activation of Rac, as was obvious from cell spreading, lamellipodia formation, and membrane ruffling, and where DAPP1 translocation was very clear, we did not find membrane translocation of EGFP-P-Rex1. Hence, the live video microscopy experiments confirmed our earlier findings in fixed cells that PI3K activation alone is not sufficient to stimulate membrane translocation of P-Rex1.FIGURE 3PI3K activity and Gβγ subunits together synergistically induce P-Rex1 membrane recruitment in Sf9 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2062861782,"Multiple studies have addressed the mechanisms by which ultraviolet (UV) light induces cell death, and a few have focused on stress mediators such as acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) or protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). Based on a recent study that identified a novel mechanism of activation of ASMase through phosphorylation, the current study was undertaken to determine the upstream mechanisms regulating ASMase in response to UV and to investigate the role of ASMase and its phosphorylation at S508 as an integral event during UV light-induced cell death. Exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to UV light type C (UVC) transiently activated ASMase with maximal activity detected at 10 min postirradiation. A significant increase in C16-ceramide was detected concomitant with a decrease in C16-sphingomyelin. In marked contrast, cells overexpressing the ASMase(S508A) mutant, which could not be phosphorylated, had no change in either ASMase activity or ceramide levels post-UV radiation. Loss of PKCdelta by RNA interference or its inhibition by rottlerin blocked ASMase phosphorylation and membrane targeting, thus implicating PKCdelta upstream of ASMase activation by UV light. Further investigations revealed that UV radiation altered mitochondrial morphology from elongated tubules to fragmented perinuclear organelles, consistent with the onset of the apoptotic cascade. Importantly, cells overexpressing ASMase(S508A) were protected (>50%) from UV light-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Mechanistically, the results showed that ASMase(S508A) cells had 50% less active Bax than ASMase(WT) cells. These molecular differences culminated in resistance of ASMase(S508) cells to UVC-induced cell death (25%) as compared to ASMase(WT) cells (46%). Taken together, this study provides key molecular insights into activation of ASMase in response to UV light, the role of PKCdelta in this activation, and the role of ASMase in mediating apoptotic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2073207414,"The human IFI16 gene is an interferon-inducible gene implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and tube morphogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis has demonstrated that this gene is highly expressed in endothelial cells in addition to hematopoietic tissues. In this study, gene array analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells overexpressing IFI16 revealed an increased expression of genes involved in immunomodulation, cell growth, and apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, IFI16 triggered expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and E-selectin or chemokines such as interleukin-8 or MCP-1. Treatment of cells with short hairpin RNA targeting IFI16 significantly inhibited ICAM-1 induction by interferon (IFN)-γ demonstrating that IFI16 is required for proinflammatory gene stimulation. Moreover, functional analysis of the ICAM-1 promoter by deletion- or site-specific mutation demonstrated that NF-κB is the main mediator of IFI16-driven gene induction. NF-κB activation appears to be triggered by IFI16 through a novel mechanism involving suppression of IκBα mRNA and protein expression. Support for this finding comes from the observation that IFI16 targeting with specific short hairpin RNA down-regulates NF-κB binding activity to its cognate DNA and inhibits ICAM-1 expression induced by IFN-γ. Using transient transfection and luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate indeed that activation of the NF-κB response is mediated by IFI16-induced block of Sp1-like factor recruitment to the promoter of the IκBα gene, encoding the main NF-κB inhibitor. Activation of NF-κB accompanied by induction of proinflammatory molecules was also observed when IκBα expression was down-regulated by specific small interfering RNA, resulting in an outcome similar to that observed with IFI16 overexpression.

Recently, the Pyrin domain, commonly found among cell death-associated proteins such as Pyrin, ASC, and zebrafish caspase, and also referred to as the PAAD/DAPIN domain (7Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat.

Cell Res. 2005; 308: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), was originally identified as a target of interferons (IFN-α/β and -γ). Recently, however, it has become clear that oxidative stress, cell density, and various proinflammatory cytokines also trigger IFI16 expression (11Gugliesi F. Mondini M. Ravera R. Robotti A. De Andrea M. Gribaudo G. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Mondini M. Vidali M. Airò P. De Andrea M. Riboldi P.S. Meroni P.L. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1110: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). IFI16 expression is seen in vascular endothelial cells from blood and lymph vessels in addition to hematopoietic cells, suggesting a possible link to angiogenesis and inflammation (13Gariglio M. Azzimonti B. Pagano M. Palestro G. De Andrea M. Valente G. Voglino G. Navino L. Landolfo S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Wei W.

Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of IFI16 in HUVEC efficiently suppressed endothelial migration, invasion, and formation of capillary-like structures in vitro accompanied by inhibition of cycle progression and arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (15Raffaella R. Gioia D. De Andrea M. Cappello P. Giovarelli M. Marconi P. Manservigi R. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, anti-IFI16 autoantibody titers are significantly elevated in patients with autoimmune diseases such as cutaneous systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome, but not in those with other autoimmune diseases when compared with controls (16Mondini M. Vidali M. De Andrea M. Azzimanti B. Airò P. Riboldi P.S. Meroni P.L. Albano E. Shoenfeld Y. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that IFI16 may be involved in the early steps of inflammation by modulating endothelial cell functions. One of the initial key events in the endothelial response to inflammatory stimuli is the expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) and production of chemokines, including IL-8 and MCP-1 (17Cook-Mills J.M. Deem T.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18Millan J. Hewlett L. Glyn M. Toome D. Clark P. Ridley A.J. Nat.

The majority of genes expressed in endothelial cells in response to inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide, IL-1β, or TNF-α contain functionally important NF-κB-binding sites in their promoter regions (20Denk A.

Kestler H. Lasar A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5308-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB activity resulted in efficient inhibition of endothelial cell activation (22Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 23Li X. Stark G.R. Exp.

The five members of the mammalian NF-κB family, p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-κB1), and p52/p100 (NF-κB2), are present in unstimulated cells as homo- or heterodimers bound to IκB family proteins (22Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 23Li X. Stark G.R. Exp.

NF-κB proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved 300-amino acid Rel homology domain that is located toward the N terminus of the protein and is responsible for dimerization, interaction with IκBs, and binding to DNA. Binding to IκB prevents the NF-κB-IκB complex from translocating to the nucleus, thereby maintaining NF-κB in an inactive state. Three distinct NF-κB-activating pathways have emerged, and all of them rely on sequentially activated kinases (25Janssens S. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Kato Jr., T. Delhase M. Hoffman A. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 27Viatour P. Merville M.-P. Bours V. Chariot A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The first pathway, i.e. the classical pathway, is triggered by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and leads to the sequential recruitment of various adaptors, including TNF receptor-associated death domain protein, receptor interacting protein, and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to the cytoplasmic membrane. This is followed by the recruitment and activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which includes the scaffold protein NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO; also named IKKγ), IKKα, and IKKβ kinases. Once activated, the IKK complex phosphorylates on Ser-32 and Ser-36 IκBα, which is subsequently ubiquitinated and then degraded via the proteosome pathway. A second pathway, i.e. the alternative pathway, is NEMO-independent and is triggered by cytokines, including lymphotoxin b, B-cell activating factor or the CD40 ligand, and by viruses (e.g. human T-cell leukemia virus and the Epstein-Barr virus). This pathway relies on the recruitment of TRAF proteins to the membrane and on the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which activates an IKKα homodimer. IKKα phosphorylates the ankyrin-containing and inhibitory molecule p100 on specific serine residues located in both the N- and C-terminal regions. p100 is then ubiquitinated and cleaved to generate the NF-κB protein p52 that moves as a heterodimer with RelB into the nucleus. The third signaling pathway is classified as “atypical” because it is independent of IKK but still requires the proteosome and is triggered by DNA-damaging agents such as UV radiation or doxorubicin. UV radiation induces IκBα degradation via the proteosome, but the targeted serine residues are located within a C-terminal cluster that is recognized by the p38-activated casein kinase 2 (CK2). To add new information to the physiological role of IFI16 in the modulation of the immune response and inflammation, we initiated microarray analysis of IFI16-overexpressing HUVEC. The results obtained indicate that genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis are affected by IFI16 overexpression. In particular we demonstrate that IFI16 stimulates the expression of proinflammatory genes, including ICAM-1, E-selectin, IL-8, and MCP-1. ICAM-1 stimulation by IFNs appears to depend on functional IFI16, because inhibition of its expression by RNA interference blocks the IFN capability to increase ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 induction takes place through activation of the NF-κB complex that appears to be triggered by transcriptional suppression of the IκBα gene expression. Consistent with these observations, reduction in IκBα expression by RNA interference results in the same outcome observed with IFI16 overexpression. Altogether, these results demonstrate that IFI16 modulates the response of proinflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells and may provide a molecular explanation for its role in the initial steps of the autoimmune response. Cells Lines and Reagents—HUVEC obtained by trypsin treatment of umbilical cord veins were cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM-2, Clonetics, San Diego) containing 2% fetal bovine serum, human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, human epidermal growth factor, insulin growth factor (IGF-1), hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, heparin, gentamycin, and amphotericin B (1 μg/ml each) and were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin. Experiments were performed with cells at passage 2–6. Human embryo kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) (Microbix Biosystems Inc.) were cultured in minimum Eagleŉs medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin per ml, and 100 μg per ml of streptomycin sulfate. Cells were kept in logarithmic growth phase by 1× citric saline detachment and reinoculation every 2–4 days. Interferon-γ and TNF-α were the generous gifts of Gianni Garotta, Geneva, Switzerland, and Tiziana Musso, Turin, Italy, respectively. Recombinant Adenovirus Preparations and HUVEC Infection—The pAC-CMV IFI16, containing the human IFI16 cDNA linked to a FLAG tag at the N terminus, was cotransfected together with pJM17 into human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously (11Gugliesi F. Mondini M. Ravera R. Robotti A. De Andrea M. Gribaudo G. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After several rounds of plaque purification, the adenovirus containing the IFI16 gene (AdVIFI16) was amplified on 293 cell monolayers and purified from cell lysates by banding twice on CsCl gradients. Desalting was performed using G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and viruses were frozen in PBS, 10% glycerol at -80 °C. The infectious titers (PFU) were determined by a standard plaque assay on 293 cell monolayers (11Gugliesi F. Mondini M. Ravera R. Robotti A. De Andrea M. Gribaudo G. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The physical particles of the vector preparations were measured by spectrophotometry (28Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our viral preparations showed a 1:10–1:20 ratio between PFU and physical particles. Endotoxin contaminations were excluded by E-Toxate kit (Sigma) (sensitivity > 1.4 pg/ml). Recombinant AdVIFI16 was tested for IFI16 expression by Western blotting, using an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). For cell transduction, pre-confluent HUVEC were washed once with PBS and incubated with AdVIFI16 or AdVLacZ (used as a control) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 300 in EGM. After 60 min at 37 °C, the virus was washed off, and fresh medium was added. Cells were cultured for 36 h before use in the experiments. For IFI16 interference the pAC-CMV shRNA-IFI16, containing the short hairpin RNA sequence targeting the human IFI16 gene mRNA (shRNAIFI16) (5′-CCG TCA GAA GAC CAC AAT CTA CTT CAA GAG AGT AGA TTG TGG TCT TCT GAT TTT TTG GAA A-3′), or the pAC-CMV shRNA-SCRAMBLED (shRNASCR), containing a scrambled human IFI16 gene shRNA sequence (5′-CCG GCA CAG TCA CAA CAA ATC TTT CAA GAG AAG ATT TGT TGT GAC TGT GCT TTT TTG GA AA-3′), were cotransfected with pJM17 into 293 cells. After several rounds of plaque purification, recombinant adenoviruses were amplified on 293 cell monolayers and purified to homogeneity as before. PFU were assessed for virus titers on the 293 complementing cell line with agar overlay. Recombinant AdVshRNAIFI16 was tested for IFI16 knockdown by Western blotting. For cell transduction, HUVEC were washed once with PBS and incubated with AdVshRNAIFI16 or AdVshRNASCR at an m.o.i. of 300 in EGM. After 2 h at 37 °C, the virus was washed off, and cells were treated as indicated. For IκBα interference, the adenoviral human IκBα siRNA recombinant virus (AdVshRNAIκBα) containing the short hairpin RNA sequence targeting the human IκBα gene mRNA was purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA) and used according to the manufacturerŉs instruction at an m.o.i. of 1000. Microarray and Data Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from HUVEC cultured at subconfluence and infected with AdVIFI16 or AdVLacZ for 6 h or 24 h. RNA pooled from different cultures was used as a template for biotinylated probe synthesis. Total RNAs were quality-controlled and quantified on the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). For gene expression profiling on Beadchips from Illumina, reverse transcription, double-stranded cDNA, and biotinylated cRNA synthesis were carried out according to standard Illumina protocols, using the “Illumina RNA amplification kit” (Ambion) and biotin-16 UTP (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA were used for reverse transcription to synthesize double-stranded cDNA. The cDNA was used for in vitro transcription to obtain biotinylated cRNA, followed by a purification step. Subsequently, 550 ng of biotinylated cRNA, resuspended in Hyb E1 buffer, formamide, and RNase-free water, were denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and hybridized for 16 h at 55 °C on Ilumina “Human Sampler” bead arrays, exploring 516 genes. Hybridized bead arrays were then washed three times with E1BC buffer (Illumina), once with 100% EtOH, blocked using blocking E1 buffer (Illumina), and stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (2 μl per chip of 1 mg/ml stock, from Amersham Biosciences). After the final washing and drying, bead arrays were scanned on a GenePix Personal 4100A microarray reader (Axon). Images were processed with the Beadarray Studio software (Illumina) to extract signal intensities for each bead type in each experiment and export them to a tab-delimited text file. Statistical analysis and selection of regulated genes was carried out using Excel (Microsoft). We defined two criteria for selecting regulated genes as follows: (a) genes that were regulated more than 2-fold in both replicates (32 genes); (b) genes that were regulated by average at least 1.4-fold plus 2 standard deviations (45 genes). The first approach allowed capturing genes with greater response, and the second allowed identifying genes with smaller, but consistent, response. In total, we selected 55 genes, of which 22 passed both tests. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR analysis was performed on an Mx 3000 P™ (Stratagene) using the SYBR Green I dye (Invitrogen) as a nonspecific PCR product fluorescence label. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the Eurozol reagent (Euroclone Ltd.). RNA (1 μg) was then retrotranscribed at 42 °C for 60 min in PCR buffer (1.5 mm MgCl2) containing 5 μm random primers, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion) in a final volume of 20 μl. cDNAs (2 μl) or water as control was amplified in duplicate by real time RT-PCR using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene) in a final volume of 25 μl. Primer sequences were as follows: IFI16 (sense, 5′-ACT GAG TAC AAC AAA GCC ATT TGA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTG TGA CAT TGT CCT GTC CCC AC-3′); ICAM-1 (sense, 5′-CAA CCG GAA GGT GTA TGA AC-3′; antisense, 5′-CAG CGT AGG GTA AGG TTC-3′); V-CAM1 (sense, 5′-CAT GGA ATT CGA ACC ACA-3′; antisense, 5′-GAC CAA GAC GGT TGT ATC GG-3′); BAD (sense, 5′-CAT TGA GCC GAG TGA GCA GG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCG TCA CTC ATC CTC CGG AG-3′); UCP3 (sense, 5′-CGT GGT GAT GTT CGT AAC CTA TG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGG TGA TTC CCG TAA CAT CTG-3′); CDC25a (sense, 5′-CTC CTC CGA GTC AAC AGA TT-3′; antisense, 5′-CAG AGT TCT GCC TCT GTG TG-3′); SSTR1 (sense, 5′-GGC GAA ATG CGT CCC AG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGG AGT AGA TGA AAG AGA TCA GGA-3′); CCR4 (sense, 5′-CCT CAG AGC CGC TTT CAG A-3′; antisense, 5′-GCC TTG ATG CCT TCT TTG GT-3′); E-Selectin (sense, 5′-CTC TGA CAG AAG AAG CCA AG-3′; antisense, 5′-ACT TGA GTC CAC TGA AGT CA-3′); MCP-1 (sense, 5′-TCC TGT GCC TGC TGC TGA TAG C-3′; antisense, 5′-TTC TGA ACC CAC TTC TGC TTG G-3′); IL-8 (sense, 5′-ATG ACT TCC AAG CTG GCC GTG GCT-3′; antisense, 5′-TCT CAG CCC TCT TCA AAA ACT TCT C-3′); PAI-1 (sense, 5′-TGC TGG TGA ATG CCC TCT ACT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGG TCA TTC CCA GGT TCT CTA-3′); PTX-3 (sense, 5′-TGG CTG CCG GCA GGT; antisense, 5′-TCC ACC CAC CAC AAA CAC TAT-3′); and β-actin (sense, 5′-GTT GCT ATC CAG GCT GTG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGT CCA CGT CAC ACT TCA-3′). Following an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 2 min to activate 0.75 units of Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), the cDNAs were amplified for 30 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min). For quantitative analysis, semi-logarithmic plots were constructed of Δ fluorescence versus cycle number, and a threshold was set for the changes in fluorescence at a point in the linear PCR amplification phase (Ct). The Ct values for each gene were normalized to the Ct values for β-actin with the ΔCt equation. The level of target RNA, normalized to the endogenous reference and relative to the mock-infected and untreated cells, was calculated by the comparative Ct method with the 2-ΔΔCt equation. Plasmids and Transfection Assays—Reporter luciferase vectors for human full-length ICAM-1 promoter pIC1352 (-1352/+1) and the relevant mutant constructs pIC339 (-339/+1), pIC135 (-135/+1), and pIC135 (ΔAP2) have been described previously (29Van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Stade B.G. Koenderman L. Raaijmakers J.A. Johnson J.P. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6185-6192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To derive ICAM-1 promoter with mutated NF-κB-binding sites, the sequence of these sites was modified by two consecutive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). The two NF-κB recognition sites were abrogated and changed to unique restriction sites (-187 BamHI, and -491 KpnI) in the plasmid pIC1352 (mut2NF-κB). In the plasmid pIC339 (mutNF-κB) the -187 NF-κB-binding site was mutated and changed with BamHI restriction site. The correctness of the introduced mutations was confirmed by sequencing the derived constructs. The pGL2-ICAM-1 construct, spanning 137 nucleotides before the translation start site and carrying two Ets-responsive sites, pGL2-ICAM-1/Mut117, pGL2-ICAM-1/Mut97, and pGL2-ICAM-1/Mut117–97, the specific mutants for one or both Ets sites, respectively, have been described previously (30de Launoit Y. Audette M. Pelczar H. Plaza S. Baert J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 0.4SK-pGL3 Luc, obtained by subcloning the 0.4-kb fragment of the IκBα promoter, and the relevant mutant constructs, mutkB1, mutSp1, and mutkB1/Sp1, have been described previously (31Algarté M. Kwon H. Génin P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6140-6153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, HUVEC cells grown to subconfluence were transfected with 2 μg of the reporter vector of interest that was added to serum-free EGM-2, mixed with 6 μl of Reagent Plus and 3 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with EGM-2 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Twenty four hours later, cells were infected with AdVIFI16 or AdVLacz (at an m.o.i. of 300) or mock-infected. After 24 h of incubation, chemiluminescence was measured using the Lumino luminometer (Stratec Biomedical Systems, Birkenfeld, Germany). Reporter gene activity was normalized to the amount of plasmid DNA introduced into the recipient cells measured by real time PCR with appropriate luciferase-actin primers. Nuclear Extract Isolation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—HUVEC were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/100-mm diameter dish and after 72 h infected with AdVIFI16, AdVLacz, or mock-infected. At the indicated times post-infection (p.i.), cells were washed in cold PBS, harvested, and centrifuged to collect the pellet. The pellets were then incubated for 15 min on ice with a cytoplasmic isolation buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The samples were centrifuged, and the nuclear pellets were then collected by removing the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic extract, washed in cytoplasmic isolation buffer without Non-idet P-40, centrifuged, and incubated for 10 min on ice with a nuclear isolation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After centrifugation, supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were collected and stored at -70 °C. EMSA was performed as described previously (32Caposio P. Dreano M. Garotta G. Gribaudo G. Landolfo S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3190-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (15 μg of proteins) were incubated in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm MgCl2) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare) and the 32P-labeled double-stranded NF-κB, AP-1, and Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides (Promega). The oligonucleotide probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturerŉs protocol, and finally column-purified on G-25 Sephadex (Bio-Rad). Complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% PAGE, dried, and detected by autoradiography. Immunoblotting—Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared by resuspending pelleted cells in lysis buffer containing 125 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin. After a brief sonication, soluble proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were analyzed for protein concentration with a Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and stored at -70 °C in 10% glycerol. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Filters were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and immunostained with the rabbit anti-IFI16 Ab (diluted 1:2000), the rabbit anti-IκBα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (diluted 1:500), the rabbit anti-p50 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (diluted 1:300), the mouse anti-p65 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (diluted 1:500), the mouse anti-IKK2 mAb (Pharmingen) (diluted 1:1000), or the mouse anti-actin mAb (Chemicon) (diluted 1:4000).

https://openalex.org/W2067771360,"There are three major isoforms of BAG-1 in mammalian cells, termed BAG-1L (p50), BAG-1M (p46) and BAG-1S (p36) that function as pro-survival proteins and are associated with tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Initiation of BAG-1 protein synthesis can occur by both cap-dependent and cap-independent mechanisms and it has been shown that synthesis of BAG-1S is dependent upon the presence of an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) in the 5′-UTR of BAG-1 mRNA. We have shown previously that BAG-1 IRES–meditated initiation of translation requires two trans-acting factors poly (rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) for function. The former protein allows BAG-1 IRES RNA to attain a structure that permits binding of the ribosome, while the latter protein appears to be involved in ribosome recruitment. Here, we show that the BAG-1 IRES maintains synthesis of BAG-1 protein following exposure of cells to the chemotoxic drug vincristine but not to cisplatin and that this is brought about, in part, by the relocalization of PTB and PCBP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2074437785,"mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin, is a critical target of survival signals in many human cancers. In the absence of serum, rapamycin induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. However, in the presence of serum, rapamycin induces G(1) cell cycle arrest-indicating that a factor(s) in serum suppresses rapamycin-induced apoptosis. We report here that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) suppresses rapamycin-induced apoptosis in serum-deprived MDA-MB-231 cells in a protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta)-dependent manner. Importantly, if TGF-beta signaling or PKCdelta was suppressed, rapamycin induced apoptosis rather than G(1) arrest in the presence of serum. And, if cells were allowed to progress into S phase, rapamycin induced apoptosis in the presence of serum. BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 breast, and SW-480 colon cancer cells have defects in TGF-beta signaling and rapamycin induced apoptosis in these cells in the presence of either serum or TGF-beta. Thus, in the absence of TGF-beta signaling, rapamycin becomes cytotoxic rather than cytostatic. Importantly, this study provides evidence indicating that tumors with defective TGF-beta signaling--common in colon and pancreatic cancers--will be selectively sensitive to rapamycin or other strategies that target mTOR."
https://openalex.org/W1988350032,"The p53 transcription-independent apoptosis in mitochondria, mediated by its interaction with the pro-apoptotic and the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family of proteins, has been described in vivo, especially in radiosensitive tissues. We have characterized the interaction of p53 with both the pro-apoptotic Bak and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL proteins, comparing their affinity and their interaction surfaces, using biophysical techniques such as fluorescence anisotropy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and NMR. We have shown that both proteins interact with only the p53 core domain and not with its N- and C-terminal regions. Further, p53 has a higher affinity for Bcl-xL than for Bak, which is consistent with the previously described sequential binding of Bcl-xL and Bak by p53. Interestingly, although the interaction with both proteins is electrostatic in character, they have different binding sites. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have determined that Bcl-xL interacts with the DNA binding site of p53, but Bak does not interact with this site. A new potential interaction surface for Bak is proposed.

A new potential interaction surface for Bak is proposed. p53 is a transcription factor that acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing growth arrest or apoptosis in response to a variety of cellular stresses among other activities (1Green D.R.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). These responses protect the cell against uncontrolled proliferation, and more than 50% of human cancers have mutations in the gene coding for p53 (5Hainaut P. Hollstein M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 81-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). p53 is a homotetramer, with each monomer consisting of several independent domains: the N-terminal transactivation domain (residues 1–63); the proline-rich regulatory domain (residues 64–92); the DNA binding core domain (residues 94–312); the tetramerization domain (residues 324–355); and the C-terminal domain (residues 360–393). In response to multiple death stimuli, p53 rapidly translocates to mitochondria, promoting apoptosis via a transcriptionally independent pathway (6Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). This p53 transcription-independent apoptosis precedes p53 target gene activation (7Erster S. Mihara M. Kim R.H. Petrenko O. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6728-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and is mediated by the direct interaction of p53 with at least five of the members of the Bcl2 family, the anti-apoptotic members Bcl2 and Bcl-xL (8Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), and the pro-apoptotic Bax (9Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar), Bak (10Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and Bad (11Jiang P. Du W. Heese K. Wu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9071-9082Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Bcl2 family members regulate the apoptosis mediated by mitochondria. They are defined by the presence of at least one of the four Bcl2 homology domains (BH1, BH2, BH3, or BH4). Despite their similar structures, they are divided into two subfamilies of opposite functions: the anti-apoptotic subfamily (including Bcl2, Bcl-xL, Bclw, and Mcl1) and the pro-apoptotic subfamily (including Bax, Bak, Bok/Mtd, and the BH3-only proteins Bik, Puma, and Nox) (12Chan S.L. Yu V.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2004; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism used by the Bcl2 family to control apoptosis in mitochondria is not completely understood, but it is known that the pro-apoptotic members are active only when they oligomerize. Further, it has been proposed that oligomerization of pro-apoptotic members is inhibited upon the binding of anti-apoptotic members (13Spierings D. McStay G. Saleh M. Bender C. Chipuk J. Maurer U. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 310: 66-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p53 is able to bind both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family. The binding of p53 to Bcl2 and Bcl-xL inhibits their anti-apoptotic function. Although the exact mechanism of this inhibition is not known, it has been proposed that the interaction of p53 could prevent or disrupt the complex between the anti-apoptotic and the pro-apoptotic proteins (10Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 14Perfettini J.L. Kroemer R.T. Kroemer G. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further, the interaction between p53 and the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax or Bak activates them (9Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 10Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), inducing conformational changes that promote the oligomerization that is required to exert their pro-apoptotic function. Several reports support the importance of the p53 transcription-independent apoptosis pathway in vivo. Thus, p53 translocates to mitochondria in radiosensitive tissues of an irradiated mouse (7Erster S. Mihara M. Kim R.H. Petrenko O. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6728-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), targeting of p53 to mitochondria suppresses growth of lymphomas in vivo (16Palacios G. Moll U.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6133-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of the binding of p53 to Bcl-xL protects mice from radiation (17Strom E. Sathe S. Komarov P.G. Chernova O.B. Pavlovska I. Shyshynova I. Bosykh D.A. Burdelya L.G. Macklis R.M. Skaliter R. Komarova E.A. Gudkov A.V. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Detailed knowledge of this pathway, including the characterization of the interaction between p53 and the Bcl2 family proteins is, therefore, very important for future anti-tumor therapies or radioprotection of normal tissues in radiotherapy. Although there are several biochemical studies of these interactions (14Perfettini J.L. Kroemer R.T. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), there are few biophysical characterizations of the binding of the core domain of p53 to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL (15Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Bcl2 (18Tomita Y. Marchenko N. Erster S. Nemajerova A. Dehner A. Klein C. Pan H. Kessler H. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8600-8606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and there are no biophysical data regarding its binding to the pro-apoptotic proteins. In this work, we have biophysically characterized the binding of p53 to Bak and Bcl-xL and compared them. Our results show that Bcl-xL interacts with higher affinity than Bak, but both proteins bind only the core domain and not the C- and N-terminal regions of p53. Further, using competition binding experiments and NMR spectroscopy we have shown that the interaction surface of Bak differs from the site described for Bcl-xL, and a new potential binding site is proposed. The physiological significance of these findings is discussed.

(residues 1–190) and Bcl-xLΔC (residues 1–211) coding sequences, without the C-terminal transmembrane domain, were amplified from a cDNA library (Clontech, multiple tissue cDNA panels) from heart and brain, respectively. Amplified PCR products were cloned into the pGEMT vector system (Promega). The expression vectors for both proteins were made by inserting the coding sequence into the pRSETHisLipoTEV vector (19Weinberg R.L. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) using an overlapping PCR strategy (20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli C41 containing the expression plasmids for Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC were grown at 37 and 25 °C, respectively, to log phase, when 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added. Bcl-xLΔC was expressed for 4 h at 37 °C, and Bak was expressed for 15 h at 20 °C. The proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen). The lysates, resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole), were loaded onto the equilibrated column and eluted with the elution buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm imidazole). The fusion protein was digested with TEV protease and reapplied to the nickel affinity column to remove the His-lipo-TEV tag. The proteins were recovered in the flow through, then diluted 10 times in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, and loaded onto a source 30Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. The proteins were eluted using a NaCl gradient (0.05–1 M). The final step of the purification was gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA. For Bak purification, all the buffers contained 10% glycerol. The p53 core domain (p53C) (residues 94–312), p53 full-length quadruple mutant (p53 flQM), and the N-terminal region of p53 (p53N) (residues 1–93) were purified as described (19Weinberg R.L. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Andreeva A. Rutledge S.E. Tidow H. Canadillas J.M. Blair C.M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2115-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 15N-Labeled p53C was expressed in M9 minimal medium supplemented with vitamin mix and 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl as sole nitrogen source. The C-terminal region of p53 (p53CT) (residues 293–392) was a kind gift from Dr. M. R. Fernandez-Fernandez (Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK). The value of Mr for each protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The proteins were folded and had characteristic thermal transitions during differential scanning calorimetry: Bcl-xL had a Tm of 76.9 °C and ΔH = 57 kcal/mol; Bak 72.7 °C and 21 kcal/mol (data not shown). Both proteins were active in the regulation of cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. 4Dr. Gorka Basañez, personal communication. Fluorescein Labeling of Proteins—Proteins were labeled using 5′ (and 6′) carboxyfluorescein succimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) as described (20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To separate the non-incorporated fluorescein, the mixture was loaded onto an analytical GF column Superdex 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences). This chromatographic step also provided confirmation that the labeling process had not affected the protein conformation. The yield of labeled protein varied between 20 and 40% of the total protein. The final product consisted of a mixture of both labeled and unlabeled species. Fluorescence Anisotropy—The experiments were performed at 10 °C with a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Hamilton Microlab M dispenser, using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. A concentrated solution of protein was titrated into 1 ml-containing fluorescein-labeled proteins. Titrations were carried out at three ionic strengths (50, 100, and 150 mm). The 50 mm ionic strength buffer (I, 50 mm) was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT. For the higher ionic strength buffers (I, 100 and 150 mm), NaCl was added to a final concentration of 48 and 97 mm, respectively. The program Kaleidagraph™ (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used to calculate the dissociation constants by fitting the polarization data to one binding site plus linear drift equation (22Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).r=r0+(ra[Titrant]/(Kd+[Titrant]))+c[Titrant](Eq. 1) where r is the experimentally determined anisotropy at each point of the titration, r0 is the initial anisotropy, ra is the difference in anisotropy between unbound and bound to one titrant molecule, Kd is the dissociation constant, [Titrant] is the molar concentration of titrant (M), and c is the constant of the linear drift. In the competition binding assays, the double-stranded GADD45 response element sequence, assembled from the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides 5′-CAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-CAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGG-3′, was titrated into a mixture of 150 nm fluorescein-labeled protein (FL-Bcl-xLΔC or FL-BakΔC) and 27 μm p53C. For the Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC competition experiments, Bcl-xLΔC was titrated in a mixture of 150 nm FL-BakΔC and 20 μm p53C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out at 10 °C with a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge in a 50 Ti rotor at 18,000 rpm. The total concentration of the fluorescein-labeled proteins FL-Bcl-xL and FL-Bak was 15 μm and of the unlabeled p53C was 100 μm at the three different ionic strengths. Absorbance at 492 nm (fluorescein absorbance maximum) and interference data were measured. The absorbance data were used to calculate the concentrations of free-labeled protein and its complex, by fitting the data to a double-exponential model corresponding to two species in equilibrium. As the concentration of p53C is much higher than the concentration of labeled protein, the contribution of the latter and the complex to the interference data can be discarded. Thus, the interference data were used to calculate the total p53C concentration (approximately equal to free concentration) by fitting the data to a single exponential model corresponding to one species present. Data were processed and analyzed using ULTRASPIN software. The dissociation constants were calculated using a single model binding equation.Kd=([free FL-protein]·[free p53C])/[complex](Eq. 2) Controls of fluorescein protein and p53C were carried out in parallel to check the oligomerization state of the proteins and their integrity at the end of the centrifugation experiment. NMR—1H, 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with CryoProbe™ and single axis gradients, at 298 K (I, 100 MM) in buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 48 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT). The concentrations of the proteins were 100 μm 15N-p53C and 300 μm Bcl-xLΔCorBakΔC. The effects of binding were analyzed using the assignments of p53C (23Canadillas J.M. Tidow H. Freund S.M. Rutherford T.J. Ang H.C. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2109-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The data were processed in Felix98 (MSI Biosystems), and figures were generated using NMRView (24Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Interaction of Bcl-xL and Bak with p53C—The interaction of p53 with Bcl-xLΔC (8Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) and Bcl2ΔC (18Tomita Y. Marchenko N. Erster S. Nemajerova A.

The binding surface for these proteins overlaps with the DNA binding surface of p53; therefore, an electrostatic binding has been suggested (15Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further, biochemical experiments suggest that Bak also binds to this domain (10Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). We analyzed the binding of BakΔC and Bcl-xLΔC to the core domain of p53 (p53C) at different ionic strengths (50, 100, and 150 mm) to compare both interactions and their electrostatic nature (Fig. 1). Two biophysical techniques were used to test the binding using fluorescein-labeled Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC: fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 1A) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (Fig. 1B) (Table 1). The anisotropy measurements revealed an electrostatic interaction between p53C and both BakΔC and Bcl-xLΔC since affinity decreased with increasing ionic strength. Further, the interaction of p53C with BakΔC appeared weaker than that observed for Bcl-xLΔC. The interactions were too weak for measurement Kd, except for Bcl-xLΔC at 50 mm ionic strength (Kd; 16 μm; Table 1), where the binding reached near saturation and could be fitted to a one-binding site model plus linear drift. We also analyzed these interactions by AUC, which was a powerful technique for measuring Kd for weaker binding (Fig. 1B) (Table 1). The sedimentation curves of FL-Bcl-xLΔC and FL-BakΔC without p53C could be fitted to a single model of a monomeric protein of 24 and 20 kDa, respectively, but the protein mixture sedimentation profiles fitted to a bi-exponential model of a mixture of two species of 24 and 49 kDa for mixtures of p53C and FL-Bcl-xLΔC and of 20 and 45 kDa for mixtures of p53C and FL-BakΔC. For Bcl-xLΔC at 50 mm ionic strength, binding was too tight to be measured by AUC; all the Bcl-xLΔC was bound to p53C, and the sedimentation curve could be fitted to only a single species of 49 kDa, consistent with the Kd calculated by anisotropy. These experiments also confirmed weak and electrostatic binding for both proteins as well as the higher affinity for p53C of Bcl-xLΔC than of BakΔC, as can be observed from the calculated Kds summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Dissociation constants of Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC from p53C at different ionic strengths (I)IKdBcl-xLnaNumber of experiments used to calculate the average.Baknmmμm5016 ± 6bCalculated from anisotropy experiments because binding was too tight to be measured by AUC.

Open table in a new tab Binding to the N- and C-terminal Domains of p53—Although it is clear that Bcl-xL and Bak interact with the DNA binding domain of p53 (10Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 15Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and confirmed here, the role of the N-terminal region (residues 1–94) of p53 (Np53) in the interaction with and in induction of p53 transcription-independent apoptosis is controversial. A deletion mutant of p53 without the proline-rich domain (residues 62–91) is unable to activate Bax (9Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar), a pro-apoptotic protein analogue of Bak. Further, NMR binding experiments imply a direct interaction between Bcl-xL and Np53 (25Xu H. Tai J. Ye H. Kang C.B. Yoon H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is claimed that the N-terminal domain of p53 is not able to bind Bcl-xL and Bak (8Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 10Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). To investigate whether either protein can interact with this region of p53, we checked the binding of Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC to fluorescein-labeled Np53 (residues 1–93) by fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 2A). Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC did not bind to Np53 under our conditions, although Np53 interacted with the p53 interaction domain of MDM2 (residues 2–125). This interaction has been already described (26Yu G.W. Rudiger S. Veprintsev D. Freund S. Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and was used as a control. In contrast to the controversy about the role of the N-terminal domain of p53 in transcription-independent apoptosis, it is commonly accepted that the C-terminal domain is not important for the mitochondrial function of p53 (6Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). No biophysical in vitro experiments have been reported to check the interaction of this domain with the Bcl-2 family proteins. Here, the interaction of the fluorescein-labeled C-terminal domain of p53 (p53CT, residues 293–392) with Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC was thus checked by fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 2B). The binding of S100B, a protein that binds p53CT (20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was used as a positive binding control. In this case, as for the N-terminal domain of p53, there was no binding of Bcl-xLΔC and BakΔC to p53CT. The interaction of both the proteins with full-length Tp53, a thermodynamically stable quadrupole mutant of p53 (27Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, the interaction was too weak to be able to calculate the Kd by fluorescence anisotropy, as the concentration of p53 was limited to <30 μm under the experimental conditions at higher ionic strengths, and p53 aggregated at the lower ionic strengths where binding was tighter and more readily measured. Our results show that the interaction was weak, with a Kd higher than 30 μm, which might indicate that there was no cooperative effect between core domains to bind Bak and Bcl-xL. Determination of the Binding Surface of the p53C-BakΔC Complex—NMR data has previously shown (15Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that p53C and Bcl-xLΔC interact via the DNA binding region of p53, suggesting a electrostatic nature of the binding, which is confirmed by our binding experiments at different ionic strength. Because the binding to BakΔC is also ionic strength-dependent and therefore electrostatic, the question arises whether it also binds to the same binding site. To check this possibility, we performed fluorescence anisotropy competition assays for binding of p53C between unlabeled DNA (GADD45 response element sequence) and fluorescein-labeled FL-BakΔC or FL-Bcl-xLΔC (Fig. 3). The Kd for the interaction between p53C and GADD45 is 14 μm at 210 mm ionic strength (28Ang H.C. Joerger A.C. Mayer S. Fersht A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21934-21941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but at lower salt concentration the affinity is higher, with Kd in the nm range (29Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the DNA was able to disrupt completely the pre-formed complex with both proteins at the three ionic strengths, as revealed by the reversal of the increment in anisotropy obtained on addition of 27 μm p53C to both fluorescein-labeled proteins. DNA displacing the proteins at three ionic strengths demonstrated that the binding surface for each was the same at three ionic strengths, i.e. the higher affinity at low salt concentration was not because of nonspecific binding but due to a higher electrostatic potential between the binding surfaces. An important observation made from these experiments was that a higher DNA concentration was needed to disrupt the p53-BakΔC complex than for the p53-Bcl-xLΔC complex, despite the higher affinity of the latter. This suggests that the DNA binding site of p53 and the BakΔC binding surface do not overlap completely as in the case for Bcl-xLΔC. To test this possibility, the 1H, 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra for both complexes were recorded to compare the binding site in p53C for both proteins. The experiments were performed in 100 mm ionic strength buffer at a 1:3 molar ratio, p53C: BakΔC or Bcl-xLΔC, respectively. Our results obtained with Bcl-xLΔC are consistent with the previously published data (15Petros A.M. Gunasekera A. Xu N. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A), confirming that the Bcl-xLΔC binding site overlaps the DNA binding surface of p53 (Fig. 5A). However, the binding of BakΔC did not produce the same signal perturbations in the p53C spectrum (Fig. 4A), confirming the suggestion that BakΔC did not bind to the DNA binding site. The residues of p53C perturbed upon binding of BakΔC were localized between the amino acids 202 and 208, as well as Val-173, which was severely line broadened because of this interaction. This region was not perturbed by the presence of Bcl-xLΔC, as can be seen for Tyr-205 in Fig. 3B. Because of the low affinity of p53C with BakΔC, all the perturbations were small or led only to an exchange broadening of peaks, as would be expected from a low affinity site with an exchange rate of hundreds of μs. However, the fact that all the affected residues were located on the same protein surface (Fig. 5A) supports the idea that this might be a binding site for Bak. These residues are situated on the surface between monomers that is formed when two core domains bind DNA (30Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This fact may explain the competition observed between DNA and Bak for binding p53C because when two p53Cs interact with DNA and form the protein-protein interactions that stabilize the core dimer bound to DNA, this would present steric hindrance for the binding of Bak. Thus, the competition would be indirect, which would"

Nelson M.T. Kidney Blood Press. Res. 2000; 20: 355-371Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry through CaV1.2 channels regulates multiple physiological functions, including cell contractility and gene expression (2Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). In small resistance arteries and arterioles, CaV1.2 channels play a dominant role in myogenic tone development and blood pressure regulation (3Moosmang S. Schulla V. Welling A. Feil R. Feil S.

Smooth muscle-specific inactivation of the CaV1.2 gene (CACNA1C) dramatically reduces mean arterial blood pressure in mice, and arterial myocytes from hypertensive subjects exhibit increased L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit expression (3Moosmang S.

Moreover, a variety of agents that selectively block L-type Ca2+ channels are widely used to treat hypertension because of their ability to reduce arterial myocyte contractility (6Triggle D.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, despite the central role of CaV1.2 channels in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, the molecular identity of these channels in myocytes of small myogenic arteries that regulate blood pressure and flow is unknown. voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ rapid amplification of cDNA ends enhanced green fluorescent protein current-voltage. In most tissues, native voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels consist of a pore-forming α1 (CaV1.2) subunit and auxiliary β and α2δ subunits (7Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). CaV1.2 subunits contain the voltage sensor and several regulatory sites that determine the basic biophysical and pharmacological properties of the Ca2+ channel complex, whereas β and α2δ subunits regulate channel trafficking and gating kinetics (8Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The human CaV1.2 gene can undergo alternative splicing at 19 out of 55 exons, leading to structural and functional CaV1.2 diversity (9Tang Z.Z. Liang M.C. Lu S. Yu D. Yu C.Y. Yue D.T. Soong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44335-44343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Vascular CaV1.2 subunits identified so far were cloned either from a whole organ, the rat aorta, or from a smooth muscle layer isolated by laser-capture microdissection from carotid or femoral arteries (10Koch W.J.

In each of these studies, clones were derived from conduit vessels that do not develop myogenic tone or critically influence systemic or organ blood pressure (GenBank™ accession numbers: M59786, AY830711-AY830713, Z34811, and Z34812; Refs. 10Koch W.J.

To better understand Ca2+-dependent regulation of arterial smooth muscle physiology and to design more effective interventions for vascular pathologies associated with dysfunctional Ca2+ signaling, it is imperative to determine the molecular identity of CaV1.2 subunits expressed in myocytes of resistance size arteries. Conceivably, myocytes of myogenic arteries may express distinct subunit isoforms that confer tissue-specific physiology. Here, we cloned full-length CaV1.2 subunits from small, myogenic cerebral arteries. Through the use of 5′-RACE, we found that CaV1.2 subunits expressed in myocytes of these arteries predominantly contain a novel, cysteine-rich N terminus encoded by alternative splicing of the CaV1.2 gene at exon 1. Electrophysiological studies indicate that the novel exon 1-derived N terminus modifies both CaV1.2 subunit current density and regulation by auxiliary subunits. Our study suggests that CaV1.2 exon 1, through alternative splicing, contributes to auxiliary subunit-mediated regulation of arterial myocyte voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, splicing of the arterial myocyte CaV1.2 N terminus may contribute to tissue-specific Ca2+ entry and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Tissue Preparation—Procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Tennessee. Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) were euthanized by peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital solution (150 mg/kg). For total RNA extraction, small (<200 μm) cerebral arteries, isolated cerebral artery myocytes, cardiac myocytes, aorta, heart, and brain, were prepared and placed immediately in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Myocytes were enzymatically dissociated from rat cerebral arteries (∼150 μm diameter) using a procedure similar to that previously described (12Jaggar J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C439-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were prepared as previously described (13Liu Q. Hofmann P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 285: H97-H103Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. P. A. Hofmann in the Department of Physiology at UTHSC. Reverse Transcription—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from ∼3 μg of total RNA using oligo d(T) and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript™ III, Invitrogen). Rapid Amplification of CaV1.2 5′-End (5′-RACE) and Cloning of Full-length CaV1.2 Subunits—Primer sequences are provided in Table S1 of supplemental information. 5′-Ends of CaV1.2 subunits were generated using the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit using gene-specific primer 1 (GSP1). Nested PCR was performed using GSP2 and UPM primers. Nested PCR products were purified and ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and transformed in JM109 cells. Plasmids containing inserts were sequenced using a T7 promoter primer (Promega), which revealed two different CaV1.2 5′-end sequences. Full-length CaV1.2 subunits were amplified from cerebral artery cDNA with primers designed to recognize the two different 5′-ends (sense 6 and antisense 4 for the exon 1b-containing subunit, termed CaV1.2e1b, and sense 5 and antisense 4 for the exon 1c-containing subunit, termed CaV1.2e1c) using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Antisense 4 was designed according to the highly conserved 3′-untranslated region of known Ca 1.2 sequences (GenBank™V accession number: rat brain, M67515, M67516; rat aorta, M59786). PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for selection. Plasmids containing DNA inserts were sequenced at the University of Tennessee Molecular Resource Center. Polymerase Chain Reaction—To identify the presence of exon 1a, exon 1b, exon 1c, β1b, β2a, and β3, two consecutive rounds of PCR were performed. The first PCR round was 20 cycles, and the second PCR round was 40 cycles. PCR reactions were started with a 2-min initial denaturation at 94 °C, then thermocycled at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s in the first round of PCR, or 60 s in the second round of PCR, followed by 72 °C for 3 or 5 min. PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gels. Primer pairs of the first round PCR were: exon 1c-176S1 and exon2-A1 for CaV1.2e1c; exon 1b-97S1 and exon 2-A1 for CaV1.2e1b; actin-2794S1 and actin-3337A1 for β actin. Primer pairs of the second round PCR were: exon 1c-201S2 and exon 1c-382A2 for CaV1.2e1c; exon 1b-137S2 and exon 1b-287A2 for CaV1.2e1b; actin-2901S2 and actin-3037A2 for β actin. A similar procedure was used to identify CaVβ subunits in arterial myocytes. Primers used for amplification of β1b (X61394, Ref. 14Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P.

Identification of Exons 1a, 1b, 1c, and CaVβ Subunits in Rat Cerebral Artery Myocytes and Cardiac Myocytes—Individual arterial myocytes or cardiac myocytes were visualized using an inverted microscope (Nikon, TS100) and aspirated individually into a small glass pipette, as described previously (17Jaggar J.H. Li A. Parfenova H. Liu J. Umstot E.S. Dopico A.M. Leffler C.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed with 2–10 myocytes using Super-Script III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Two consecutive PCR rounds were performed to identify the presence of exon 1a, 1b, 1c, β1b, β2a, and β3. PCR products were verified by sequencing. Quantitative Real Time PCR—CaV1.2 cDNA was synthesized from 2–10 rat arterial myocytes that were collected as described above. One initial 20-cycle round of PCR was performed, and the PCR products were used as templates for realtime PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The primer pairs used in identification experiments were also used for real time PCR of exon 1b and 1c, except that Exon 1c-201S2 was replaced with Exon 1c-230S2. For exon 1a, Exon 1a-134S1 and Exon 2-A1 were used in initial PCR, and Exon 1a-188S2 and Exon 1a-340A2 were used in real time PCR. Amplification efficiency was evaluated from the slope of the regression curve obtained with several dilutions of cardiac cDNA, and the specificity of primers was tested by melting curve analysis. A mean amplification efficiency of 1.92 was used for calculating the relative percentage of exon 1a, 1b, and 1c mRNA in cerebral artery myocytes and cardiac myocytes. Construction of Expression Vectors for L-type Ca2+ Channel α1 Subunits—For electrophysiological characterization, full length CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c were subcloned from the pGEM-T easy vector into the pIRES-hrGFP II vector (Stratagene) using NotI and T4 ligase for expression. EcoRV was used to examine the ligation direction. Constructs with correct nucleotide sequences were transformed into DH5α cells, purified with the HiSpeed plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen), and stored at –20 °C. For generation of EGFP-tagged CaV1.2, CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c coding sequences were amplified from pIRES-CaV1.2e1b-hrGFP II and pIRES-CaV1.2e1c-hrGFP II, respectively, using PfuUltra II fusion HS DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the following primers: forward, CACCGTCGACCTGCAGATATCCATCACACTGG; reverse, CACCCCGCGGCCAGGTTGCTGACATAGGACC. cDNAs were purified and ligated into pEGFP-N3 vector using SalI and SacII. The reading frames of pEGFP-CaV1.2e1c-N3 and pEGFP-CaV1.2e1b-N3 vectors were confirmed by sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and HEK 293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM-F12 (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS under standard tissue culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). Endogenous CaV1.2 subunits are not present in significant amounts in COS-1 and HEK 293 cells (18Meir A. Bell D.C. Stephens G.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Kobrinsky E. Tiwari S. Maltsev V.A. Harry J.B. Lakatta E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol.

Cells for transfection were grown in 35-mm Petri dishes and transiently transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). COS-1 cells were used for patch clamp electrophysiology experiments following transfection with different combinations of pIRES-CaV1.2e1c-hrGFP II, pIRES-CaV1.2e1b-hrGFP II, pGW-β1b, pcDNA3-β2a, pcDNA3-β3, and pcDNA3-α2δ-1 (1 μg of each). HEK 293 cells were used for channel localization measurements because plasma membrane fluorescence originating from EGFP-tagged CaV1.2 channels could be more effectively differentiated from that in intracellular compartments than with COS-1 cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with different combinations of pEGFP-CaV1.2e1b-N3 or pEGFP-CaV1.2e1c-N3 (0.5 μg) and pcDNA3-α2δ-1 and pGW-β1b (1 μg of each). Cells were maintained in a 95% O2/5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C and used for electrophysiological and fluorescence experiments between 36 and 72 h after transfection. pGW-β1b was kindly provided by Dr. Henry Colecraft (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine), pcDNA3-β2a by Dr. Timothy J. Kamp (University of Wisconsin Medical School), and pcDNA3-β3 and pcDNA3-α2δ-1 by Dr. Diane Lipscombe (Brown University). Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp recordings were acquired at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and pCLAMP 8.2 or 9.2. Borosilicate glass electrodes of resistance 1–3 MΩ were filled with pipette solution containing (in mmol/liter): for COS-1 cells, Cs-MeSO3 135, CsCl 5, EGTA 5, MgATP 4, Na2GTP 0.25, HEPES 10, and glucose 10 (pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH); for arterial myocytes, CsCl 140, EGTA 5, MgATP 4, HEPES 10, and glucose 10 (pH 7.2, with CsOH). The extra-cellular bath solution contained (in mmol/liter): for COS-1 cells, NaCl 80, TEACl 60, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, BaCl2 5, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH), for myocytes, TEACl 140, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, BaCl2 20, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4, adjusted with TEAOH). Myocyte voltage-dependent Ba2+ currents were isolated by subtracting Cd2+ (250 μm)-insensitive currents from whole cell currents. Solutions were ∼300 mOsm, as measured using a Vapor Pressure Osmometer. Isolated cells that were not visibly attached to neighboring cells were used for patch clamp. Cell capacitance was measured by applying a 5-mV test pulse and correcting the capacitance transients with series resistance compensation. For measurement of current-voltage (I-V) relationships, cells were clamped at –80 mV and whole cell currents were evoked every 5 s by 300-ms step depolarizations to between –60 and +60 mV in 10-mV increments. Steady-state inactivation was measured every 15 s by providing 1-s conditioning pulses to between –80 and +60 mV (+30 mV for α1/β3/α2δ) in 10-mV increments before a 200-ms test pulse to 0 mV. A 15-ms return to –80 mV was applied after the conditioning pulse and prior to the test pulse. Tail currents were generated by repolarization to –80 mV after a series of 20-ms test pulses to between –60 mV and +60 mV in 10-mV increments. Whole cell currents were filtered at 1–2 kHz and digitized at 4–10 kHz. P/4 protocols were used to subtract leak and capacitive transients. Steady-state inactivation curves and tail currents were fit with the Boltzmann function in Equation 1,I/Imax=Rin+(Rmax−Rin)/(1+exp((V−V1/2)/k))(Eq. 1) where I/Imax is the normalized peak current, V is the conditioning pre-pulse voltage, V1/2 is the voltage for half-inactivation for steady-state inactivation or half-activation for tail currents, k is the slope factor, Rin is the proportion of non-inactivating current, Rmax is the maximal current. Inactivation time constants (τ) were obtained using Equation 2,It=Ifast·e−t/τfast+Islow×e−t/τfast+Iθ(Eq. 2) where It is the inward current at time t, and Iθ is the residual current. Confocal Microscopy—HEK 293 cells transfected with EGFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1 subunits and either α2δ or α2δ + β1b were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope. EGFP was excited using 488 nm light, and >510 nm light was collected. Analysis methodology similar to that previously described was used to calculate plasma membrane localized fluorescence originating from EGFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1 subunits containing either the exon 1b or exon 1c-derived N terminus (20Pietrzykowski A.Z. Martin G.E. Puig S.I. Knott T.K. Lemos J.R. Treistman S.N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8322-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane boundaries were established by visualizing DIC images using a membrane thickness of 0.55 μm. Using these boundaries, membrane localized fluorescence was calculated from back-ground subtracted fluorescence images. For each cell, total membrane-localized fluorescence was calculated by subtracting cytoplasmic fluorescence from total cellular fluorescence. Total membrane fluorescence was then divided by membrane area (in μm2) to establish average membrane fluorescence. Image analysis was performed using Image J software (NIH). Data Analysis—Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Clampfit 8.2 and 9.2 and Origin 7.5. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t-tests were used for comparing paired or unpaired data, and one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls or Dunn posthoc tests were used for comparing multiple data sets. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To identify voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels present in myocytes of small cerebral arteries, we first measured currents in these cells using patch clamp electrophysiology. Fig. 1A illustrates Cd2+ (250 μm)-sensitive, voltage-dependent Ba2+ currents characteristic of CaV1.2 that were recorded in cerebral artery myocytes (Fig. 1A). To proceed to clone full-length CaV1.2 subunits from small cerebral artery myocytes using PCR, we first sought to identify the CaV1.2 5′-end sequence(s) expressed in these cells. Two different CaV1.2 N termini have previously been described (21Liao P. Yong T.F. Liang M.C. Yue D.T. Soong T.W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Exon 1a encodes the CaV1.2 subunit N terminus found in whole heart (22Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) and whole aorta (10Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17786-17791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and exon 1b (also referred to as exon 1) encodes the N terminus detected in whole brain (23Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), lung (24Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and jejunum CaV1.2 subunits (25Lyford G.L. Strege P.R. Shepard A. Ou Y. Ermilov L. Miller S.M. Gibbons S.J. Rae J.L.

CaV1.2 5′-ends expressed in resistance size (<200 μm diameter) cerebral arteries were amplified using 5′-RACE and ligated into pGEM-T easy vector (Fig. 1B). Sequencing analysis of 11 plasmids revealed two different CaV1.2 subunit 5′-ends (Fig. 1C). One did not match any sequence previously described, but was mapped within CACNA1C of the rat genome. The second sequence was identical to the previously described exon 1b. Exon 1a was not detected by 5′-RACE. According to their relative location within the rat genome, the sequence previously described in brain, lung and jejunum (exon 1) was termed “exon 1b”, and the novel 5′-end was termed “exon 1c” (Fig. 1, C and D). Exon 1c is responsible for encoding a 9 amino acid peptide, and substituting glycine at the exon 1/2 junction for cysteine (Fig. 1E). This substitution generates the cysteine-rich N-terminal sequence: MLCCALDCAC. To examine whether exon 1b and 1c were expressed in arterial myocytes, RT-PCR was performed using small groups (∼10) of manually selected cerebral artery myocytes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Critically, this methodology avoids contamination from other vascular wall cell types, including fibroblasts and perivascular neurons that express voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel subunits, including CaV1.2 (26Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Both exons 1b and 1c were detected in cerebral artery myocytes (Fig. 2A). Next, to examine whether exon 1c exhibits arterial myocyte-specific expression, real-time PCR was performed on dissociated arterial and cardiac myocytes. Data indicated that exon 1c was predominant (∼96%) in cerebral artery myocytes (Fig. 2B) Exons 1a, 1b, and 1c were all detected in cardiac myocytes, with exon 1a prevalent (∼82%) and exons 1b and 1c each less than 15% of total message (Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that in the cardiovascular system, exon 1c message is predominant in arterial myocytes and scarce in cardiac myocytes. Using 5′-end primers specific to either exon 1b or exon 1c, full length CaV1.2 cDNAs were amplified (forward primers: sense6 for exon 1b, sense5 for exon 1c; reverse primer: anti-sense4), and termed “CaV1.2e1b” (GenBank™ accession number: DQ538522) and “CaV1.2e1c” (AY974797), according to their exon 1 sequences (Fig. 3, A and B). The coding region of the CaV1.2e1c subunit contains 6,477 nucleotides (including the stop codon) and encodes a 2,158-amino acid protein, whereas CaV1.2e1b contains 6,498 nucleotides and encodes a 2,165-amino acid protein. CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c are identical except for their exon 1-derived N termini. Each variant contains exon 8, 9 + 9a, 21, and 32 + 33, consistent with CaV1.2 subunits identified in large, conduit arteries (11Tiwari S. Zhang Y. Heller J. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; Google Scholar, 28Tang Z.Z. Hong X. Wang J. Soong T.W. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate whether exon 1 splicing imprints a distinct functionality to the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel in arterial myocytes, CaV1.2e1b or CaV1.2e1c were subcloned into pIRES-hrGFP II vector and transfected in COS-1 cells for electrophysiological characterization. Voltage-dependent Ba2+ currents (IBa) were absent in non-transfected cells (data not shown). When co-expressed with α2δ, maximal IBa for both CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c occurred at +10 mV (Fig. 4, A and B, Table 1). However, the mean peak current density of CaV1.2e1b/α2δ currents was ∼2-fold larger than for CaV1.2e1c/α2δ currents (Fig. 4, B and C, Table 1). Voltages of steady-state half-inactivation (V1/2,inact) and half-activation (V1/2,act) of CaV1.2e1c/α2δ currents were also ∼7 and ∼5 mV more negative than those of CaV1.2e1b/α2δ currents, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C, Table 1). In contrast, inactivation rate constants of CaV1.2e1c/α2δ and CaV1.2e1b/α2δ currents were similar (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that when co-expressed with α2δ, the novel exon 1c-derived CaV1.2 N terminus attenuates membrane current density and induces a negative shift in both V1/2,act and V1/2,inact, when compared with currents mediated by channels containing the CaV1.2 exon 1b-derived N terminus.TABLE 1Electrophysiological properties of Cav1.2 channels containing e1b or e1c when expressed alone or co-expressed with auxiliary subunitsCombinationsI-VSteady-state inactivationActivationIpeak densitynV1/2,inactΔV1/2,inactaΔV1/2,inact, β subunit-induced shift in V1/2,inact of corresponding Cav1.2α1/α2δ channels.nV1/2,actΔV1/2,actbΔV1/2,act: β subunit-induced shift in V1/2,act of corresponding Cav1.2α1/α2δ channels.npA/pFmVmVmVmVCav1.2e1cα1/α2δ-5.1 ± 0.96-9.3 ± 1.85-3.0 ± 0.85Cav1.2e1cα1/β1b/α2δ-18.8 ± 4.2cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.9-14.6 ± 0.9cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.-5.38-7.3 ± 1.6-4.37Cav1.2e1cα1/β2a/α2δ-19.2 ± 3.9cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.8-12.9 ± 1.0-3.67-14.9 ± 0.7cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.-12.06Cav1.2e1cα1/β3/α2δ-28.6 ± 6.8cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.11-19.4 ± 1.3cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.-10.18-11.3 ± 1.0cp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.-8.46Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ-10.1 ± 1.7dp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1b versus corresponding Cav1.2e1c.5-1.9 ± 2.0dp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1b versus corresponding Cav1.2e1c.51.5 ± 1.2dp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1b versus corresponding Cav1.2e1c.5Cav1.2e1bα1/β1b/α2δ-20.9 ± 4.7ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.8-17.7 ± 0.7ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.-15.88-8.1 ± 1.3ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.-9.68Cav1.2e1bα1/β2a/α2δ-17.1 ± 3.6ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.10-14.1 ± 1.4ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.-12.29-15.7 ± 1.2ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.-17.29Cav1.2e1bα1/β3/α2δ-27.1 ± 5.9ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.10-16.2 ± 1.7ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.-14.37-7.5 ± 1.1dp < 0.05 Cav1.2e1b versus corresponding Cav1.2e1c.,ep < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.-9.05a ΔV1/2,inact, β subunit-induced shift in V1/2,inact of corresponding Cav1.2α1/α2δ channels.b ΔV1/2,act: β subunit-induced shift in V1/2,act of corresponding Cav1.2α1/α2δ channels.c p < 0.05 Cav1.2e1cα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1cα1/α2δ.d p < 0.05 Cav1.2e1b versus corresponding Cav1.2e1c.e p < 0.05 Cav1.2e1bα1/β/α2δ versus Cav1.2e1bα1/α2δ.

We previously showed that Src mediates growth factors-induced activation of Dgk-α, whose activity is required for cell motility, proliferation and angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that both hepatocytes growth factor (HGF) stimulation and v-Src transformation induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Dgk-α on Y335, through a mechanism requiring its proline-rich C-terminal sequence. Moreover, we show that both proline-rich sequence and phosphorylation of Y335 of Dgk-α mediate: (i) its enzymatic activation, (ii) its ability to interact respectively with SH3 and SH2 domains of Src, (iii) its recruitment to the membrane. In addition, we show that phosphorylation of Dgk-α on Y335 is required for HGF-induced motility, while its constitutive recruitment at the membrane by myristylation is sufficient to trigger spontaneous motility in absence of HGF. Providing the first evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of Dgk-α is required for growth-factors-induced activation and membrane recruitment, these findings underscore its relevance as a rheostat, whose activation is a threshold to elicit growth factors-induced migratory signaling."

We have investigated the role of hc-Krox transcription factor on type I collagen expression by human dermal fibroblasts. hc-Krox exerted a stimulating effect on type I collagen protein synthesis and enhanced the corresponding mRNA steady-state levels of COL1A1 and COL1A2 in foreskin fibroblasts (FF), adult normal fibroblasts (ANF), and scleroderma fibroblasts (SF). Forced hc-Krox expression was found to up-regulate COL1A1 transcription through a –112/–61-bp sequence in FF, ANF, and SF. Knockdown of hc-Krox by short interfering RNA and decoy strategies confirmed the transactivating effect of hc-Krox and decreased substantially COL1A1 transcription levels in all fibro-blast types. The –112/–61-bp sequence bound specifically hc-Krox but also Sp1 and CBF. Attempts to elucidate the potential interactions between hc-Krox, Sp1, and Sp3 revealed that all of them co-immunoprecipitate from FF cellular extracts when a c-Krox antibody was used and bind to the COL1A1 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Moreover, hc-Krox DNA binding activity to its COL1A1-responsive element is increased in SF, cells producing higher amounts of type I collagen compared with ANF and FF. These data suggest that the regulation of COL1A1 gene transcription in human dermal fibroblasts involves a complex machinery that implicates at least three transcription proteins, hc-Krox, Sp1, and Sp3, which could act in concert to up-regulate COL1A1 transcriptional activity and provide evidence for a pro-fibrotic role of hc-Krox.

A complex network of cytokines/growth factors, acting by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, controls the fibroblast metabolism and ensures the tissue integrity. In a normal situation, there is a balance between synthesis and degradation of the matrix components, including elastic fibers, proteoglycans, and collagens (1Sorrell M.J. Kim A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 2Eckes B. Kim P. Kessler D. Holtkötter O. Shephard P. Mauch C. Krieg T. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This equilibrium is disrupted in pathological processes, such as fibrosis, and characterized by excessive production of matrix proteins, particularly of type I collagen, which is the major structural component of dermal ECM (2Eckes B. Kim P. Kessler D. Holtkötter O. Shephard P. Mauch C. Krieg T. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain, encoded by two distinct genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, respectively (3Lee B. Kim M. Ramirez F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 173-187PubMed Google Scholar). Coordinated transcription of these genes involves similar cis elements interacting with the same transcription factors, such as Sp1, Sp3, CBF (CCAAT-binding factor), and c-Krox (collagen-Krüppel box) (4Karsenty G.

The relative proportions and/or interactions between these and other transcription factors are responsible for the modulation of type I collagen expression under physiopathological conditions. Human c-Krox (hc-Krox) is a zinc finger transcription factor belonging to the Krox family proteins and binds to GC-rich sequences. This protein harbors a BTB-POZ (for “broad complex, tramtrack, and bric à brac/pox virus and zinc finger”) domain in its N-terminal extremity, which is responsible for protein homo- and heterodimerization and for the inhibition of transcriptional activity of ECM-targeted genes (16Widom R.L. Kim I. Lee J.Y. Korn J.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 407-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hc-Krox has already been found to inhibit type I collagen (COL1A1 and COL1A2), fibronectin, and elastin genes in fibroblastic cells and uridine diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) in rabbit articular chondrocytes (17Widom R.L.

On the other hand, the murine homologue of hc-Krox, mouse c-Krox (mc-Krox), was first cloned as a partial cDNA lacking the BTB-POZ domain and was demonstrated to be an activator of transcription of mouse Col1a1 and Col1a2 genes in fibroblastic cells (14Galéra P. Kim M. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9372-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This transcription factor is expressed in a quite specific manner in the dermis, although it is absent in bone (14Galéra P. Kim M. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9372-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Galéra P. Kim R.-W. Ducy P. Mattéi M.-G. Karsenty G. J. Biol.

Its expression can be detected at 9.5 days post-coitum in the myodermatomes and it precedes type I collagen expression. These data, reporting the co-localization of type I collagen and c-Krox expression in skin fibroblasts, suggest the possible involvement of the trans factor in the fibrotic process, particularly in scleroderma. Further support to this hypothesis comes from the fact that the full-length mc-Krox (containing the BTB-POZ domain) was recently found to promote thymocyte differentiation into CD4+ T cells rather than into CD8+ T cells (19Sun G. Kim X. Mercado P. Rhiannon Jenkinson S. Kypriotou M. Feigenbaum L. Galéra P. Bosselut R. Nat. Immun. 2005; 6: 373-381Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20He X. Kim X. Dave V.P. Zhang Y. Hua X. Nicolas E. Xu W. Roe B.A. Kappes D.J. Nature. 2005; 433: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Knowing that during the early stages of scleroderma disease there is an activation of CD4+ T cells, rather than of CD8+ T cells (21Turner J. Kim M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we may suppose that c-Krox plays an important role in the early manifestation of this disease that leads to fibrotic reaction in later stages. Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitous proteins belonging to the family of Sp transcription factors recognizing GC and TC boxes, like c-Krox (22Jimenez S.A. Kim C.T. Ann. Intern. Med. 2004; 140: 37-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 is a well characterized activator of type I collagen genes (6Li L. Kim C.M. Jimenez S.A. Hall D.J. Varga J.

It has been shown to inhibit mouse Col1a1 gene in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (26Nehls M.C. Kim R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to function as a co-inhibitor of human COL1A2 gene transcription when it interacts with the transcription factor Fli-1 in human skin fibroblasts (27Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Kim F. Jackers P. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20839-20848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Additionally, Sp1 may play a role in fibrotic diseases, because it is one of the mediators of transforming growth factor-β1, a profibrogenic factor that activates human COL1A1 gene transcription (10Inagaki Y.

Sp3 shares identical binding sites and affinities with Sp1. Consequently, it often behaves like an Sp1 antagonist in many systems, competing with the latter for the same DNA sites, reducing Sp1 binding activity, and inducing inhibition of gene transcription (30Hagen G.

These effects can be cell- and/or promoter-specific, but it can also depend on the number of binding sites available for Sp3 on a given gene (34Majello B. Kim P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Jimenez S.A. Kim B. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2000; 21: 397-414Google Scholar, 35Yu B. Kim P.K.

Recent findings show that there exist four Sp3 isoforms, resulting from alternative translational start sites. Thus, Sp3 does not appear as a simple Sp1 homologue but is rather controlled by complex mechanisms of expression (36Sapetschnig A. Kim F. Rischitor G. Mennenga T. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42095-42105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the functions of hc-Krox in human dermal fibroblasts. We found that hc-Krox increases type I collagen synthesis in human foreskin fibroblasts (FF) obtained from young children, adult normal fibroblasts (ANF), and scleroderma fibroblasts (SF). Moreover, hc-Krox enhances human COL1A1 transcriptional activity in FF, ANF, and SF through a –112/–61-bp promoter sequence. The factor can bind to this promoter region in vitro and in vivo, as well as Sp1 and CBF. Our results reveal for the first time the transactivating role of hc-Krox on human COL1A1 gene in normal and pathological human dermal fibroblasts and provide evidence for interactions between hc-Krox, Sp1, and Sp3. Moreover, the data suggest that hc-Krox is a pro-fibrogenic factor, because its DNA binding is increased in SF compared with ANF, and this is correlated with enhanced type I collagen expression, and this offers new perspectives for therapeutic strategies that could be applied to fibrotic diseases and aging-related skin disorders. Cell Cultures—Children foreskin samples were provided by Dr. P. Ravasse (Dept. of Children Surgery, Caen Hospital, Caen, France). Human ANF and SF were obtained from forearm biopsies of either healthy donors or patients suffering from localized scleroderma (Prof. F.-X. Maquart, Laboratory of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Reims, France). Fibroblasts were obtained after explant cultures and seeded at 2.5 × 106 cells/cm2 in 175-cm2 flasks, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 environment. They were passaged with a trypsin (0.05%), EDTA (0.25 mm) solution (Invitrogen) after reaching confluency. All the experiments were performed on cells between 5 and 9 passages. Collagen Labeling and Assay—Fibroblasts were seeded at 0.17 × 105 cells/9.6-cm2 wells, in 10% fetal calf serum-containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and transiently transfected, or not, by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with the hc-Krox expression vector and/or the corresponding insertless plasmid (pSG5/hc-Krox). After 15 h, the culture medium was replaced by the same fresh medium supplemented with β-aminopropionitrile (50 μg/ml) and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) for a further 24-h period. The same medium was then renewed, and [3H]proline (2 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. After 24 h, the culture medium was collected, and the labeled collagen was assayed, using the bacterial collagenase method (37Peterkofsky B. Kim R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). The cell layer was scraped, and the extracts were sonicated. They were used to assay cell protein levels, using the Bradford colorimetric assay. Levels of collagen and noncollagenous proteins were corrected for total protein amount. An alternative method of transfection was also used to estimate collagen neosynthesis in the siRNA knockdown experiments. Fibroblasts were trypsinized at confluency and then distributed in Eppendorf tubes (1 × 106 cells per 1.5-ml tube). Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g and transfected using the Nucleofector apparatus (AMAXA, Köln, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After the transfection of hc-Krox siRNA (1 μg), the cells were plated and incubated in the same media, and the bacterial collagenase assay was performed as described above. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant collagen promoters were made using the –804hCOL-LUC as a template for PCR together with mutated oligonucleotides as follows. A 30-mer spanning the collagen promoter sequence from –84 to –55 was synthesized containing either G to T mutations at positions –61 and –62 or C to A mutations at positions –73 and –74. PCR was performed with a single oligonucleotide primer and the –804h COL-LUC template for 18 cycles using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) as directed by the manufacturer. The PCR product was digested with DpnI restriction endonuclease to eliminate the input template, followed by transformation of Escherichia coli. Plasmid DNA extracted from bacterial colonies was sequenced using the pGL2 primer (Promega) to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. This gave rise to the –804mut–73/–74 and –804mut–61/–62 constructs. The –112 mutant constructs were created by using the –804 mutant constructs as PCR templates with an upstream 18-mer beginning at –112, and the pGL2 as downstream primer. All plasmids were sequenced prior to transfection to confirm the presence of the correct mutations and the promoter length. Transient Transfections with COL1A1 Constructs—Fibro-blasts were passaged after reaching confluency and then distributed in Eppendorf tubes (1 × 106 cells per 1.5-ml tube). Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g and transfected using the Nucleofector apparatus and an NHDF kit (AMAXA, Köln, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each sample, 2 μg of pSV40/β-gal expression vector, 2 μgof reporter plasmids, and 1 μg of hc-Krox expression vector were used. After transfection, cells were seeded in 9.6-cm2 wells and incubated 12 h at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced, and cells were harvested 6 h later to determine luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, as well as the protein amount (38Ghayor C. Kim J.-F. Chadjichristos C.

FF, ANF, and SF were transfected as described earlier, with the following modifications. For each sample of 1 × 106 cells, 1 or 1.5 μg of hc-Krox siRNA or control siRNA were added to the transfection mixture. 12 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and 6 h later, cells were harvested to measure the transcriptional activity or to extract total RNAs. RNA Extraction and Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—Fibro-blasts were seeded in 9.6- or 55-cm2 wells and transiently transfected by the AMAXA Nucleofector apparatus or the calcium phosphate precipitation method, respectively, in the presence of the hc-Krox expression vector (pSG5/hc-Krox) and/or the corresponding insertless plasmid (pSG5). 12 h after Nucleofector transfection, and 17 h after transfection by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure, the medium was replaced by fresh medium. 6 h (nucleofection procedure) or 24 h (calcium phosphate precipitation) later, cells were harvested. Total RNA were extracted (40Chomczynski P. Kim N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and 2 μg were reverse-transcribed and analyzed (18Beauchef G. Kim M.

Kim D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and gel retardation assays were performed with the oligonucleotides shown in Table 2 or in Fig. 5A. The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Charbonnières, France). FF, ANF, and SF nuclear extracts (5 or 7.5 μg) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with the probe (5 fmol) in 20 μl of a specific binding buffer (43Cicchillitti L. Kim S.A. Sala A. Saitta B. Biochem.

For antibody interference reactions, nuclear extracts were incubated with specific antibodies directed against c-Krox (antibody developed in collaboration between our laboratory and Novotec (Lyon, France)), Sp1, Sp3, and CBFb (Tebu-Bio SA, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) for 10 min at room temperature and then 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, the probe was added, and a 10-min incubation at room temperature was performed. Samples were then fractionated by electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 150 V on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide at 30:1) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm Na2EDTA) and visualized by autoradiography.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used in this study (Eurogentec)Oligonucleotide nameSequence (potential binding sites for CBF, Sp1/Sp3, and c-Krox transcription factors are in boldface)SOX9 (“decoy” control)5′-AGCCCCATTCATGAGAGACGAGGT-3′-112/-61 wild type5′-AGGCAGCTCTGATTGGCTGGGGCACGGGCGG CCGGCTCCCCCTCTCCGAGGG-3′Aα1(I) wild type5′-CTTGCGGGAGGGGGGGCGCTGGGTGGACA-3′ Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Fibroblasts were seeded in 55-cm2 wells and at 90% confluency, transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method in the presence of an expression vector containing or not the hc-Krox cDNA. 17 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by fresh medium and 24 h later, cells were harvested, and cellular extracts were prepared as described previously (18Beauchef G.

The cellular proteins were fractionated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide at 30:1) and electrotransferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After blocking with TBST (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat dry milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-human type I collagen, dilution 1:1500 (Novotec, Lyon, France), or mouse anti-human β-actin, dilution 1:500 (Tebu-Bio)) in TBST, 2% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were then rinsed with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies (horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody) (Tebu-Bio). Type I collagen and β-actin protein bands were revealed using a Western blot detection kit (WestPico kit, Pierce) and quantified with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Immunoprecipitation Assays—10 μl of antibody raised against c-Krox were incubated with 40 μl of anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) in cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged for 15 s at 1200 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were rinsed twice with RIPA buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate monohydrate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 40 μg/ml aprotinin). Cellular extracts (corresponding to 2–3 × 106 FF) were added to the substrates, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 15 s at 1200 rpm. Supernatants were removed, and pellets were rinsed four times with an IP buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl) and once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Then 20 μlof2× sample buffer were added to each immunoprecipitation reaction, and samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and submitted to Western blot assays as described above. Primary antibodies against Sp1 (rabbit anti-human Sp1, 1:300 dilution in TBST, 2% nonfat milk) and Sp3 (rabbit anti-human Sp3, 1:300 dilution in TBST, 2% nonfat milk) were purchased from Tebu-Bio. c-Krox antibody (rabbit anti-mouse c-Krox) was used at a dilution of 1:250 in TBST, 5% nonfat milk. Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking Experiments—10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence of 2 μl of 0.1% glutaraldehyde or not, in a protein binding buffer (43Cicchillitti L. Kim S.A. Sala A. Saitta B. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 609-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min at room temperature. Then 5 μlof5× sample buffer were added, samples were denaturated for 5 min at 95 °C and subjected to Western blot assays as described previously. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed by using a commercially available chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif). Briefly, fibroblasts (10 150-cm2 flasks) were cross-linked, scraped, and lysed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was then sheared using enzymatic digestion, and specific protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using either anti-hc-Krox, anti-Sp1, or anti-Sp3 antibodies. Following overnight immunoprecipitation, cross-linking was reversed, and the proteins were removed after treatment with proteinase K, and the DNA was purified and used as a template in PCR assay. The primers used for the amplification of the COL1A1 promoter were as follows: forward, 5′-CAGAGCTGCGAAGAGGGGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGACTCTTTGTGGCTGGGGAG-3′. The amplicon corresponds to a 300-bp fragment that covers the core COL1A1 gene promoter (–200/+100 bp). hc-Krox Increases Type I Collagen Expression in FF, ANF, and SF—We first studied the effect of hc-Krox on total collagen synthesis in FF. Cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of an expression vector containing the hc-Krox cDNA, and the collagen neosynthesis was determined after tritiated proline labeling. We found that hc-Krox increased the amount of newly synthesized collagen, which includes type I isotype as the major form in the dermis (∼80% of the total collagen) (Fig. 1A). Western blotting confirmed that this stimulating effect did affect type I collagen synthesis, indicating that hc-Krox was acting as an activator on this protein production (Fig. 1B). We the"

Heparin, a highly sulfated polymer of uronic acids and glucosamine, binds strongly to the integrin receptor αXβ2 (p150,95, CD11c/CD18). Here, we analyze the structural motifs within heparin that constitute high affinity binding sites for the I domain of integrin αXβ2. Heparin oligomers with chain lengths of 10 saccharide residues or higher provide strong inhibition of the binding by the αX I domain to the complement fragment iC3b. By contrast, smaller oligomers or the synthetic heparinoid fondaparinux were not able to block the binding. Semipurified heparin oligomers with 12 saccharide residues identified the fully sulfated species as the most potent antagonist of iC3b, with a 1.3 μm affinity for the αX I domain. In studies of direct binding by the αX I domain to immobilized heparin, we found that the interaction is conformationally regulated and requires Mg2+. Furthermore, the fully sulfated heparin fragment induced conformational change in the ectodomain of the αXβ2 receptor, also demonstrating allosteric linkage between heparin binding and integrin conformation.

Increasing evidence points to an important function of heparin in the immune system. Heparin is exclusively synthesized by connective tissue mast cells and released from storage granula in the inflammatory responses mediated by these leukocytes. Furthermore, several receptors on leukocytes are able to bind with high affinity to heparin. These include the β2 integrins αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18) and αXβ2 (p150,95, CD11c/CD18) (1Coombe D.R. Watt S.M. Parish C.R. Blood. 1994; 84: 739-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which play key roles in the adhesion, migration, and binding of complement fragments by myeloid leukocytes. αMβ2 and αXβ2 integrins, also referred to as complement receptors 3 and 4, respectively, bind strongly to a protelytic fragment of complement factor 3 designated iC3b, as shown by both cellular and biochemical assays. iC3b plays an important role in phagocytic uptake of microbes by leukocytes of the myeloid lineages. Diamond et al. (2Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported the adhesion of neutrophil granulocytes to heparin-coated surfaces through the αMβ2 integrin, which is abundantly expressed on these leukocytes. The αXβ2 integrin, primarily expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, was also demonstrated to support adhesion to heparin by use of cell line transfectants (2Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Integrin receptors contain multiple domains in their ectodomain. β2 integrins, which in addition to αMβ2 and αXβ2 include the αLβ2 integrin (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18), bind ligands through an inserted (I) domain in the α subunit. Previous studies have indicated a central role for the αM and αX I domains in binding to heparin (2Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and shown that the affinity of the αXI domain for heparin is significantly higher than the affinity of the αM I domain (3Vorup-Jensen T.

However, the requirement for Mg2+ in the binding between integrin I domains and heparin is unclear. For many protein ligands the binding to integrin I domains is regulated through conformational changes, where the open conformation of the I domain binds these ligands with several magnitudes stronger affinity than the closed conformation (4Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). By contrast, conformational regulation of the binding by I domains to heparin or other nonproteinous ligands has not been studied. The structure of heparin has been subject to considerable investigation. Heparin is a sulfated, linear polysaccharide with a repeating disaccharide residue of d-glucosamine and uronic acids. Each repeating residue of glucosamine and uronic acid may hold a maximum of three sulfo groups, but other, less sulfated disaccharides can also be isolated from enzymatically degraded heparin. This microheterogeneity and the polydisperse length with the average Mr of natural heparin chains distributed between 10,000 and 12,000 constitute together a highly complex structure (5Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 6Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

No studies on integrins have addressed the character of the binding sites in heparin for I domains. These properties are important in understanding the ability to bind pharmacologically important glucosamineglycans such as fondaparinux sodium, a synthetic heparinoid recently marketed for antithrombotic treatment (8de Kort M. Buijsman R.C. van Boeckel C.A. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we analyze the binding between heparin and the αXI domain and identify oligomers with 10 saccharide residues or more as potent ligands for the αX I domain. The binding to heparin was dependent on Mg2+ and conformationally regulated similar to what has been reported for protein ligands. Fully sulfated oligomers bound the αX I domain with the highest affinity and with sufficient potency to induce conformational change in the ectodomain of αXβ2 integrin. Preparation and Characterization of Bovine Lung Heparin Oligosaccharides—The heparin oligosaccharide mixture, prepared from bovine lung heparin (Sigma) by controlled enzymatic depolymerization with heparin lyase I (EC 4.2.2.7; IBEX, Montreal, Canada), was fractionated by gel permeation chromatography on a P-10 column (Bio-Rad) to obtain oligosaccharides uniform in size. The fraction consisting of dodecasaccharides was further separated using semi-preparative strong anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography on a 5-μm Spherisorb™ column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.9 m NaCl, pH 3.5, over 180 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (9Pervin A.

Six peaks, labeled dp12(A), dp12(C), dp12(D), dp12(E), dp12(F), and dp12(G), were collected, desalted, and freeze-dried. The size and sulfatation of the oligosaccharide samples were determined by analysis on gels with a linear polyacrylamide gradient from 12 to 22% (w/v), visualized by Alcian Blue staining, and compared with a banding ladder of heparin oligosaccharide standards (10Edens R.E. al-Hakim A.

In brief, the wild-type αX I domain and open conformation αM and αXI domains carrying the mutations Ile-316 → Gly and Ile-314 → Gly, respectively, were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the soluble fraction. The affinity of the open conformation αM and αX I domains for heparin and heparin fragments was measured by inhibition of I domain binding to ligand. The experiments were carried out by SPR with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) in CM-4™ chip flow cells coupled with 4,700-5,300 arbitrary response units (RU; 1,000 RU =∼1 ng of protein/mm2 of flow cell surface) of iC3b (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and with a reference cell coupled with ethanolamine in parallel as described (12Vorup-Jensen T.

For inhibition experiments with the I314G αX I domain, unfractionated bovine heparin (H-0777l Sigma), fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra™; GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA), sizesorted heparins, and purified dp12 heparin oligosaccaharides were mixed at concentrations from 0.2 to 100 μg/ml with a fixed concentration of 0.63 or 1.4 μm of the αX I domain in running buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 6.0. Similarly, the I316G αM I domain at a concentration of 1.4 μm was mixed with the heparins in running buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The samples of I domain and heparin were injected over the reference and iC3b-coupled surfaces with a contact time of 240 s followed by a dissociation phase of 120 s and regeneration in 1.5 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0. The strength of the interaction between I domain and heparin in solution was approximated as the concentration inhibiting binding (measured in RU at injection stop) to iC3b by 50%. As an alternative way of determining the affinity of the interaction between heparin oligomers and the αX I314G I domain, we analyzed the influence of the heparin oligomers on the initial on-rate (Vi) of binding between the I domain and immobilized iC3b. The rate constants for the association (kon) and dissociation processes (koff) of the I domain binding to iC3b are related to the response level (R) during the injection phase through Equation 1. dR/dt=kon·Cfree·(Rmax−R)−koff·R(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, t is the time point following injection start. Early during the injection phase where Rmax ≫ R, the contribution to the response level from release of material from chip surface can be neglected, and Equation 2 with α as the product of the constants kon and Rmax can thus be simplified to the following. dR/dt=α·Cfree=Vi(Eq. 3) The slope of the tangent at a time point shortly following injection start (here chosen as t = 4 s) approximates dR/dt, which equals the initial on rate Vi. Because of the linear relationship between Vi and Cfree, the concentration of competitor required to reduce the concentration of free I domain with 50% was determined by plotting Vi as a function of concentration of competitor, i.e. heparin oligomers. The direct binding of I domains to heparin was analyzed by immobilizing heparin to CM-4 chip with a chip surface coated with carboxymethylated dextran. The surface was activated with a mixture 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide with Biacore's kit (catalog number BR-1006-33; Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) and injection of 35 μl of 5 mm hydrazine over 7 min followed by blocking of unreacted sites by injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.0. Nitrous acid-depolymerized heparin with an average atomic mass of 5,314 Da ∼ dp20 and a reducing terminal 2,5-anhydromannose (DH-03253; Celsus Laboratories Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was dissolved at 5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and injected over the hydrazine-coupled surface to allow for aldehyde coupling through the reducing end of the heparin. The resulting hydrazone bond formed from the reaction between hydrazine and the aldehyde group is not stable in aqueous medium, and the bond was consequently reduced to a stable hydrazide bond by injection of 40 μl of cyanoborohydride coupling buffer (C4187; Sigma) over 7 min, followed by regeneration of the surface with injection of 5 μl of 10 mm HCl. This procedure immobilized heparin at a level corresponding to 250 RU. The binding to the heparin-coupled surfaces was tested for the αM and αX I domains with the running buffers described above except that the MgCl2 concentration was 1 mm. Exposure of Activation-dependent Epitopes in the β2 Subunit of Recombinant αXβ2—The ability of heparin and fragments of heparin to induce conformational change in the αXβ2 integrin was tested by use of the monoclonal antibody KIM127 (13Andrew D.

Soluble, heterodimeric αLβ2 and αXβ2 integrins with a C-terminal, α-helical coiled-coil clasp were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines and purified as described (15Nishida N. Xie C.

The purified proteins were stored in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Plastic microtiter wells were treated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the ACID/BASE coiled-coil clasp as described by Takagi et al. (16Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of 5 μg/ml antibodies in 30 mm NaN3, 0.15 m Na2CO3, 0.35 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6, followed by washing in TBS with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (TBS-T) and blocking with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TBS. After washing in TBS-T, 50 μl of recombinant αXβ2or αLβ2, diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in TBS with 5 mm CaCl2, were added to antibody-coated wells and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h, followed by three washes in TBS-T. The wells with immobilized integrins were incubated with heparin, bovine heparan sulfate (H-7640, Sigma), porcine chondroitin sulfate type A (C-0914, Sigma), purified dp12(E) heparin, or fondaparinux sodium in concentrations between 5 and 500 μg/ml in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. For comparison immobilized αXβ2 and αLβ2 integrins were also incubated with 100 μg/ml dp12(E) heparin in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, or in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, without glucosaminoglycans, or in TBS with 2 mm MnCl2, or in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm XVA143 (17Welzenbach K. Hommel U. Weitz-Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10590-10598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The wells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Biotinylated monoclonal antibody KIM127 diluted to 1 μg/ml or biotinylated monoclonal antibody IB4 diluted to 5 μg/ml in TBS with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin were incubated in the wells at room temperature for 15 min. The signals were read following incubation with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase and the addition of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The Affinity of the αX I Domain Correlates with Heparin Oligosaccharide Length—By controlling enzymatic depolymerization with heparin lyase I, it is possible to derive from unfractionated heparin a set of oligomers with defined lengths. We employed oligomers ranging in lengths from a degree-of-polymerization (dp) of two saccharide residues (dp2) to 14 saccharide residues (dp14) with a Mr approximately between 500 and 3,500, respectively, as inhibitors of the open conformation αXI domain binding to iC3b. The αX I314G I domain binds the iC3b fragment of complement factor 3 with a KD of 1.5 μm (Fig. 1A). When mixed with the αX I domain prior to application to SPR, heparin oligosaccharides dp8, dp10, dp12, and dp14 inhibited binding to iC3b, whereas the dp2, dp4, and dp6 oligomers had only a marginal influence on the response level (Fig. 1C). A range of oligomer concentrations was used to inhibit binding to two different iC3b sensor chip preparations, which in the absence of inhibition bound 1,610 and 1,760 RU of αX I domain when 1.4 μm was applied (Fig. 2). The concentration required to obtain a 50% reduction in the SPR response level was 45, 5.3, and 4.5 μm for the dp10, dp12, and dp14 oligomers, respectively (Figs. 2B and 3D). Unfractionated heparin is a potent inhibitor of binding by the open conformation αX I domain to immobilized iC3b (Fig. 2A). With an average Mr of 11,000 and dp of 42, the concentration of heparin required to obtain 50% inhibition was 0.30 μm.FIGURE 2Competitive inhibition of the binding by I domains to immobilized iC3b with heparin and heparin fragments. In the calculation of oligomer concentrations, the average Mr of heparin was taken as 11,000, whereas the Mr of smaller fragments was estimated from a Mr of 500/disaccharide. A, inhibition of the binding by the open conformation αX I314G I domain to immobilized iC3b as a function of the concentration of native heparin oligomers. Samples with a fixed concentration of I domain at 1.4 μm were mixed with heparin, and the SPR response level was recorded at the end of the injection phase. The percentage of inhibition was calculated relative to the response level in the absence of heparin. B, The binding by the αX I314G to iC3b in the presence of size-sorted heparins in oligomer concentrations from 0.13 to 66 μm. C, inhibition of the binding by the αX I314G I domain to immobilized iC3b with the fractions from ion exchange chromatography of the dp12 heparin oligomers. Fractions A, C, D, E, F, and G were applied at oligomer concentrations from 0.07 to 33 μm. For comparison, the influence of fondaparinux on the binding to iC3b is indicated. The inhibition, calculated as in A, is expressed as a mean value of two independent experiments ± difference from the mean. D, similar to the experiments in B, inhibition of the binding by the αM I316G to iC3b in the presence of size-sorted heparins is shown for oligomer concentrations from 0.13 to 66 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Influence on the initial on-rate of the binding by αX I314G I domain to iC3b by heparin and heparin oligomers. A, the initial on-rate (Vi), measured 4 s after injection start as the slope of the tangent to the sensorgram, for the binding of the αM I316G and αX I314G I domains to iC3b (as shown in Fig. 1, A and B) plotted as function of the applied I domain concentration (conc.). Linearity was confirmed from fitting a straight line (indicated with dotted lines) to the data. B, the decrease in initial on-rate plotted as function of the heparin oligomer concentration for dp2, dp4, dp6, dp8, dp10, dp12, dp14, and unfractionated bovine heparin applied in a concentration range. C, the decrease in initial on-rate plotted as a function of the concentration of dp12 oligomers applied in a concentration range from 0.07 to 33 μm. D, the IC50 values obtained for the inhibition of I domain binding to iC3b with heparin in solution. The IC50 values were estimated either from the concentration of oligosaccharides decreasing the response level at the end of the injection phase by 50% or by a 50% decrease in initial on-rate. The IC50 values included for the open conformation αM and αX I domain for low molecular weight heparin (Mr =∼6,000 =∼dp21) were determined in an earlier report (3Vorup-Jensen T. Carman C.V.

No significant inhibition was observed from application of the sizesorted heparin oligomers to the binding by the open conformation αM I domain to immobilized iC3b (Figs. 1D and 2D). The interaction between heparin oligomers and the αX and αM I domains was further analyzed by considering the influence of the oligomers on the initial on-rate as has been described for other inhibition assays with use of SPR (18Hymowitz S.G. Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J. Runyon S. Yan M. Yin J. Shriver S.K. Gordon N.C. Pan B. Skelton N.J. Kelley R.F. Starovasnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7218-7227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To check the validity of Equation 3 (see “Materials and Methods”), we titrated the I domain concentration for either construct from 0.28 to 3.14 μm and measured the initial on-rate Vi at t = 4 s. As shown by the plot in Fig. 3A, there was a linear relationship between the applied I domain concentration and Vi with correlation coefficients close to 1, suggesting that the binding reaction was not limited by mass transport. Furthermore, from the slope of the line (α) of 33 × 106 RU m-1 s-1 and Rmax of 3,160 RU as estimated from Equation 1, kon was calculated to be 10,400 m-1 s-1, which is within 20% of our earlier published value of 8,400 m-1 s-1 (12Vorup-Jensen T. Ostermeier C. Shimaoka M. Hommel U. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because mass transport effects are only pronounced when kon significantly exceeds 10,000 m-1 s-1 (19Karlsson R. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and because our analysis confirmed the linear relationship between Vi and the I domain concentration, we concluded that the kinetics of our binding assay are not limited by mass transport. We therefore analyzed the influence of the size-sorted heparin oligomers and native heparin on the initial on-rate. The heparin oligomer concentrations required to reduce the initial on-rate 50% for dp8, dp10, dp12, and dp14 were 56, 22, 1.8, and 1.1 μm, respectively (Fig. 3D). The Affinity of the αX I Domain for Anion Exchange-Purified Heparin Oligomers—To further characterize the interaction between heparin and the αX I domain, we semi-purified the dodecasaccharide oligomers by strong anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. The oligomers were separated in seven fractions (Fig. 4A), and six fractions contained semipurified species when analyzed by PAGE (Fig. 4B). Fractions D and E correspond to dodecasaccharides based on comparison with oligosaccharide standards (10Edens R.E. al-Hakim A. Weiler J.M. Rethwisch D.G. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). According to earlier analysis by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy (9Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), fraction E, of higher than 90% purity (Fig. 4B), corresponds to a fully sulfated, i.e. with a maximum of 18 sulfo groups, dodecasaccharide. Fraction D contained undersulfated dodecasaccharides, i.e. with less than 18 sulfo groups. The fractions F and G contained oligomers with 10-14 saccharides, whereas fraction A, in addition to dp12 oligomers, contained highly sulfated decasaccharides (Fig. 4B). Inhibition assays were carried out as for the size-sorted material (Figs. 1E and 2C), and the data were analyzed by determining the concentration required to lower the response level at the end of the injection phase by 50%. The dp12(E) oligomers bound the αX I domain with the highest affinity with an IC50 of 1.3 μm (Fig. 1F). The less sulfated dp12(D) oligomers bound with an IC50 of 3.3 μm. Both the dp12(A) and dp12(C) fractions showed a 5-fold lower affinity than the dp12(E) oligomers, consistent with the presence in this fraction of decasaccharides. The fraction dp12(F) had the lowest potency in inhibiting the binding between the αX I domain and iC3b, whereas the dp12(G) showed an affinity close to the affinity of dp14 oligomers (Figs. 2C and 3D). These findings were further supported by the reduction by purified dp12 oligomers of the initial on-rate in binding by the αX I domain (Fig. 3, C and D). The rank among the six dp12 fractions of the IC50 values was identical to that determined for the inhibition of the final response level, with dp12(E) the most potent ligand for the αX I domain. For comparison with the naturally derived heparin oligomers, we included fondaparinux sodium, which is a synthetic pentasaccharide (dp5) with a Mr of 1,728 and a total of 7 sulfo groups (8de Kort M. Buijsman R.C. van Boeckel C.A. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), i.e. 2 less than the maximum number of possible sulfo groups. At similar concentrations compared with those used for size-sorted heparin fragments or the chemically purified dp12 oligomers, fondaparinux was not able to affect the binding of the αX I domain to iC3b (Fig. 2C). Direct Binding of the αX and αM I Domain to Surface-immobilized Heparin—The direct binding of open and closed αX and αM I domains to surface-immobilized heparin was monitored by SPR. Nitrous acid depolymerization of native heparin generates oligomers containing terminal anhydromannose with a reducing end that allows for covalent coupling to hydrazine-coupled surfaces (20Hoffman J. Larm O. Scholander E. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 117: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Compared with native heparin the average Mr was reduced ∼2-fold from 10,000 (dp40) to 5,000 (dp20) with a ratio (mol/mol) of 0.8 aldehyde group/heparin oligomer (information provided by Celsus Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The open conformation αX I314G I domain at a concentration of 4.7 μm bound robustly to surface-immobilized heparin in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5A). EDTA abolished binding by the open conformation αX I domain. The conformational regulation of the binding was studied by comparing the binding of the wild-type αX I domain injected at a concentration of 10.6 μm. In this case only a minor response was observed, suggesting a weak affinity for heparin (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the observations that heparin in s"

Combinations of the strong ligands, His, Lys, Met, and Cys, usually result in the low spin ferrous and ferric states with an intense Soret absorption peak and two Qov or αβ bands in the visible wavelength region (14Moore G.R.

However, it is unclear whether these axial ligands contribute to just binding affinity or have additional catalytic roles in heme and hemin transfer. Thus, detailed examination of the roles of the axial ligands in hemin binding and transfer should provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of these processes. We have recently determined the crystal structure of the heme-binding domain of Shp (Protein Data Bank code 2Q7A), 3Aranda, R., IV, Worley, C. E., Liu, M., Bitto, E., Cates, M. S., Olson, J. S., Lei, B., and Phillips, G. N., Jr. J. Mol. Biol., in press.3Aranda, R., IV, Worley, C. E., Liu, M., Bitto, E., Cates, M. S., Olson, J. S., Lei, B., and Phillips, G. N., Jr. J. Mol. Biol., in press. which reveals two methionine thiol ether sulfur atoms (Met66 and Met153) as the axial ligands of the iron atom. In order to gain insight into the structural mechanism of rapid hemin transfer from Shp to HtsA, we examined these processes for Shp mutants containing only the NH2-terminal heme-binding domain or full-length Shp in which the Met axial ligands were replaced with alanine (Ala) or histidine (His). Both the heme-binding domain and COOH-terminal region contribute to rapid heme transfer. Met153, but not Met66, appears to be critical for the high affinity of Shp for hemin, whereas both Met66 and Met153 are critical for rapid hemin transfer. The replacements of either Met66 or Met153 with Ala result in detection of an intermediate in hemin transfer to hemin-free HtsA (apoHtsA), indicating multiple first order reaction steps. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism in which the two axial Met ligands in wild-type Shp are simultaneously displaced by groups from apoHtsA after the two proteins have formed a transient binary complex. Protein Preparation—The preparation of the heme-binding domain of Shp containing amino acids 30–180 (designated Shp180) has been described elsewhere.3 Ala and His replacement mutants of Met66 and Met153 of Shp (designated ShpM66A, ShpM153A, ShpM66H, and ShpM153H) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (DE3) containing the appropriate plasmid. The majority of the mutant proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies. Except for ShpM153H, the hemin-binding forms (holo-forms) of these mutant proteins were purified from inclusion precipitates. All solutions were buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (Tris-HCl), unless otherwise specified. The cell pellet from a 6-liter culture was resuspended in 50 ml of Tris-HCl, sonicated for 15 min, and centrifuged to obtain the pellet. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 50 ml of 8 m urea. Each denatured protein was refolded by diluting with 40-fold Tris-HCl in the presence of excess hemin. The sample was loaded onto a DEAE column (2.5 × 10 cm), and the column was washed with 100 ml of Tris-HCl and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl. Each protein was dialyzed against 3 liters of 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (1.5 × 6 cm). The column was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl in the acetate buffer. The fractions containing >95% mutant protein were pooled, dialyzed against 3 liters Tris-HCl, and concentrated using Centricon Plus 20 filtration devices. HoloShpM153H was prepared by incubating purified apoShpM153H with excess hemin, loading the mixture onto a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 20 cm), and eluting with Tris-HCl. ApoShp and mutant proteins were prepared from inclusion bodies as described above except that hemin was absent in the refolding step. ApoHtsA was prepared, as described previously (13Nygaard T.K.

EPR Measurement—EPR spectra of wild-type and mutant Shp were measured with a Bruker EMX spectrometer using the following conditions: frequency, 9.6 GHz; power, 3 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 10 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; and temperature, 10 K. The high spin signal at g = 6 was quantified by double integration between 800 and 1700 G and comparison with the signal of a high spin sperm whale metmyoglobin at pH 7. Quantification of the low spin signals was based on comparison of the area of the g = 3 absorption-like signal with the analogous low spin signal of metmyoglobin at pH 9.5. Rates of Hemin Dissociation from Shp Mutants—The rates of hemin dissociation from ShpM66A, ShpM153A, and ShpM153H were measured using H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin as a hemin scavenger as described previously (19Hargrove M.S. Kim E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips G.N. Jr. Olson J. S. Mathews A. J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each Shp mutant protein (3 μm) was incubated with 58 μm apomyoglobin in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, and the changes in absorbance at 410 nm for ShpM153A and at both 405 and 410 nm for ShpM66A were monitored. The ΔA410 and Δ(A410 - A405) time courses were fit to a single exponential equation to obtain the rate constants for hemin dissociation from ShpM153A and ShpM66A, respectively. Kinetic Analyses—A stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a photodiode array detector (SX20; Applied Photophysics) was used to measure the rates of hemin transfer from Shp mutants to apoHtsA and the binding of hemin to apoShp mutants. In these measurements, 2.4 μm holoShp or 2 μm hemin in one syringe was mixed with apoprotein at ≥5× [apoHtsA] or [apoShp], respectively, in another syringe. Spectra were recorded with time in each reaction. Changes in absorbance at appropriate wavelengths were fitted to a single or double exponential expression, yielding pseudo-first-order rate constants for each reaction step for further analysis as described under “Results.” The Heme-binding Domain of Shp—Shp and its homologue in S. equi share 75 and 25% identify in amino acid sequence in the regions over amino acids 28–173 and 174–291, respectively (12Nygaard T.K. Kim M. McClure M.J. Lei B. BMC Microbiol. 2006; 6 (article 82)Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that the heme-binding domain of Shp is located in the amino-terminal region. To test this idea, Shp180, consisting of amino acids 30–180, was prepared. The spectra of oxidized and reduced Shp180 are almost identical to those reported for full-length Shp (13Nygaard T.K. Kim G.C. Liu M. Fukumura M. Olson J.S. Fabian M. Dooley D.M. Lei B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20761-20771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Like Shp, reduced Shp180 is stable in air. These data indicate that the heme-binding domain of Shp is located in the region of amino acids 30–180. This result led us to try Shp180 in successful crystallization and structure determination studies (Protein Data Bank code 2Q7A).3 Hemin and Heme Transfer from Shp180 to ApoHtsA—When reduced Shp180 reacts with excess apoHtsA, the absorbance at 424 nm (A424) rapidly increases on millisecond time scales due to heme transfer from Shp to apoHtsA and slowly decreases on second time scales due to autoxidation of the heme bound to HtsA, as is also seen for heme transfer from full-length Shp to apoHtsA (13Nygaard T.K.

The time course for hemin transfer from oxidized Shp180 to apoHtsA measured at 414 nm also resembles that for transfer from full-length Shp. The basis for these optical changes is the difference in the maximum wavelengths of the Soret band of reduced and oxidized Shp180 and HtsA, which are 428, 419, 424, and 412 nm, respectively. Both heme and hemin transfers are pseudo-first-order processes at excess [apoHtsA], and the observed rate constants depend hyperbolically on [apoHtsA] as in the full-length Shp-apoHtsA reactions (13Nygaard T.K.

Thus, the mechanism established for the full-length Shp-apoHtsA reactions (13Nygaard T.K. Kim G.C. Liu M. Fukumura M. Olson J.S. Fabian M. Dooley D.M. Lei B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20761-20771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) applies to the reactions of apoHtsA with Shp180. In both cases, the observed time courses can be analyzed by Scheme I, which proposes rapid formation of a Shp180-apoHtsA complex (Kd = 90 and 107 μm for the oxidized and reduced Shp180-apoHtsA complexes, respectively) (Table 1) and a first order decay involving intracomplex heme or hemin transfer.

Thus, although the heme-binding domain retains the ability to directly and efficiently transfer heme and hemin to apoHtsA, the COOH-terminal domain does play a significant role by enhancing 6–15-fold the intracomplex transfer rate. Ala and His Replacement Mutants of Shp Met66 and Met153—To assess the contributions of the Shp axial ligands to hemin binding and transfer, Met66 and Met153 were replaced by either a noncoordinating Ala or the strong ligand His. The Soret absorption peak shifts from 420 nm in wild-type oxidized Shp to 406 and 402 nm, respectively, in ShpM66A and ShpM153A (Fig. 1). In addition, there was a marked alternation in the visible absorbance spectrum (470–700 nm) with a new peak at around 600 nm indicative of a high spin Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX complex. The UV-visible spectra of ShpM66A and ShpM153A are similar to those of H64V and H64L human metmyoglobin mutants (20Ikeda-Saito M. Kim H. Andersson L.A. Prince R.C. Pickering I.J. George G.N. Sanders C.R. II Lutz McKelvey R.S. E. J. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22843-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the analogous sperm whale metmyoglobin show pentacoordinate hemin complexes with no coordinated water (21Quillin M.L. Kim R.M. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Thus, the spectral features of the Shp mutants suggest that loss of one of the Met axial ligands leads to formation of a pentacoordinate hemin-Met complex. This interpretation is supported by the spectra of the reduced Shp Ala mutants. The well resolved and intense α and β bands of reduced wild-type Shp, which are typical of hexacoordinate heme complexes with two strong axial ligands, are replaced with a single broad band for the Ala mutants (Fig. 1), which is similar to that of pentacoordinate deoxyhemoglobin. This result indicates strongly that the reduced Shp mutants also form pentacoordinate heme complexes. Our interpretation of the coordinate state of ShpM66A and ShpM153A is further supported by the EPR spectra shown in Fig. 2A. The mutants both show EPR spectra with 100% high spin signals in the g = 6 region. In both cases multiple derivative signals occur, which are similar to those reported by Ikeda-Saito et al. (20Ikeda-Saito M. Kim H. Andersson L.A. Prince R.C. Pickering I.J. George G.N. Sanders C.R. II Lutz McKelvey R.S. E. J. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22843-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for pentacoordinate H64V and H64L metmyoglobin. The latter authors suggested an increase in rhombic symmetry in the apolar metmyoglobin mutants due to increased anionic character of the proximal imidazole and/or mixing of S = 3/2 and 5/2 spin states due to the pentacoordinate character of the hemin iron atom. The latter explanation probably applies to the spectra of the Shp mutants, and in addition, some partial coordination with solvent water could occur and account for the very sharp feature at g = 5.81 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, wild-type Shp exhibits an EPR spectrum with dominant low spin signals (>86%) due to strong coordination by the sulfur atoms of Met66 and Met153. ShpM153H appears to exhibit normal wild type-like hemichrome and hemochrome spectra (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating axial His and Met coordination in both oxidation states. This conclusion is supported by the EPR spectrum of oxidized ShpM153H, which shows ∼60% low spin character (Fig. 2B). Although reduced ShpM66H displays a wild type-like spectrum indicative of His and Met coordination (Fig. 3B), oxidized ShpM66H shows an optical spectrum (Fig. 3A) similar to that of high spin aquometmyoglobin (19Hargrove M.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22843-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting hexacoordinate Met-Fe-OH2 coordination. This coordination is supported by the EPR spectrum of oxidized ShpM66H, which shows a single g = 5.66 signal indicative of a purely high spin aquohemin form (Fig. 2B). Thus, replacement of Met66 by His results in a coordination of the hemin iron to a solvent water molecule, instead His66, in the oxidized mutant, further supporting the idea that Met66 is only weakly coordinated to the heme iron atom. Hemin Binding to and Dissociation from the Met66 and Met153 Mutants—To examine the individual contributions of the Met ligands to the overall affinity of Shp for hemin, association and dissociation rate constants for hemin binding to ShpM66A, ShpM153A, ShpM66H, and ShpM153H were measured and compared with the corresponding parameters for wild-type Shp (Table 2). Association equilibrium constants for hemin binding to all five proteins were calculated from these parameters as described previously (13Nygaard T.K. Kim G.C. Liu M. Fukumura M. Olson J.S. Fabian M.

NOS is said to be “coupled” when all the electrons from NADPH are utilized in the formation of monooxygenated products and H2O (Reactions 1, 2, 3) and “uncoupled” when electrons leak to molecular oxygen to form ROS (Reactions 4 and 5). Spontaneous dismutation (Reaction 6) of O2·¯ to H2O2 (k = ∼2 × 105 m-1 s-1 at pH 7.4) produces H2O2 at a detectable level whether or not the NOS-catalyzed two-electron reduction of oxygen to form H2O2 as a direct product occurs. 2O2-+2H+→H2O2+O2REACTION 6 Diacetyldeuteroheme-substituted horseradish peroxidase (dHRP) is an artificial trapping agent first used by Ishimura and co-workers (7Makino R. Tanaka T. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11444-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakamura Y. Ohtaki S. Makino R. Tanaka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4759-4761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to distinguish superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation. dHRP rapidly (k > 106 m-1 s-1) reacts with O2·¯ and H2O2 to form compound III and compound II, respectively, according the equations below, dHRP(FeIII)+O2-→dHRP(FeIIO2)REACTION 7 dHRP(FeIII)+H2O2→dHRP(FeIVO)+H2O)REACTION 8 thereby effectively competing with Reaction 6 for the spontaneous mutation of O2·¯ to H2O2. Compounds II and III are chemically stable and spectrally distinguishable from each other; thus, both O2·¯ and H2O2 can be trapped, and the initial product(s) of the uncoupled reaction(s) can be determined. We have modified the original dHRP trapping protocol for NADPH-consuming enzymes such as NOS and reported the successful combination of the dHRP trapping system with an NADPH regeneration system (9Gao Y.T. Panda S.P. Roman L.J. Martásek P. Ishimura Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7921-7929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Maintaining a constant low concentration of NADPH not only keeps NADPH from being oxidized by dHRP compound I but also keeps NADP+ “feedback inhibition” negligible. In this paper, we applied this modified dHRP trapping protocol to study the products of the eNOS reactions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Even though Reactions 4 and 5 appear to be simple chemical reactions, quantitative analysis has always been a challenge given the spontaneous/catalyzed dismutation of O2·¯. EPR is the logical analytical tool for studying the formation of small radicals such as O2·¯; however, quantification of O2·¯ to determine stoichiometry and determination of rates is difficult or impossible using EPR (5Rosen G.M. Tsai P. Pou S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Stuehr D. Pou S. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14533-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Our modified dHRP trapping protocol has been shown to be compatible with simultaneous measurement of oxygen concentration (9Gao Y.T. Panda S.P. Roman L.J. Martásek P. Ishimura Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7921-7929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); in this paper we report the simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and dHRP compound III formation, revealing the uncoupled stoichiometry of eNOS. Both NO and ROS are highly reactive chemical entities in aqueous solution; the complexity of their coexistence in a reaction mixture makes it difficult to determine stoichiometry (11Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 125-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 12Beckman J.S. Crow J.P. Biochem. Soc.

To simplify the system, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase can be added to suppress accumulation of ROS and recycle partially reduced oxygen to either H2O or O2. The presence of SOD accelerates Reaction 6 to a rate that is diffusion-limited (14Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar), and catalase catalyzes the breakdown of H2O2 to H2O and O2 (15Deisseroth A. Dounce A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1970; 50: 319-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). 2H2O2→2H2O+O2REACTION 9 In a system that contains sufficient amounts of both SOD and catalase, oxygen in the uncoupled reaction is fully reduced to water. Regardless of whether O2·¯ and/or H2O2 is the initial product, the overall uncoupled reaction will be as follows. O2+2NADPH+2H+→2H2O+2NADP+REACTION 10 Considering all of the reactions listed above, it is apparent that molecular oxygen is the ultimate oxidizing reagent in both the coupled and uncoupled reactions by NOS; NADPH, on the other hand, is the ultimate electron donor that initiates all subsequent redox processes. The ratio of [O2]/[NADPH] varies in accordance with substrate/cofactor binding and serves as an important parameter to study coupling/uncoupling of NOS. The fully coupled NOS reaction with l-arginine as substrate produces the theoretical value of [O2]/[NADPH] = 2/1.5 = 1.33 (Reaction 3). When NOHA is added as the substrate, the theoretical value becomes [O2]/[NADPH] = 2.0 (Reaction 2). In the absence of l-arginine and NOHA, NOS is totally uncoupled, and the theoretical value becomes [O2]/[NADPH] = 1/2 = 0.5 (Reaction 10). In the absence of SOD and catalase, we calculate the theoretical value of [O2]/[O2·¯] to be 1/1, when O2·¯ is the initial product of the uncoupled reaction (Reaction 4). Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor in the oxygenase domain and is proposed to have multiple roles in all three mammalian NOS isoforms (16Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol.

One of the presently accepted functions of BH4 is to act as a one-electron donor during reductive activation of the oxyferrous complex of the heme (18Mayer B. John M. Schultz G. Bohme E.

Although there are many publications about the roles of BH4 in eNOS and how the absence of BH4 promotes eNOS uncoupling (22Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Meade A.L. McDonald J.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Inorg.

Andersson K.K. Marchal S. Lange R. Mayer B. Nitric Oxide. 2005; 396: 456-466Google Scholar), there is little quantitative evidence regarding its effect on oxygen metabolism. In this study, we report a decreased oxygen consumption rate, as well as a lower [O2]/[NADPH] ratio when BH4 is absent from the fully coupled eNOS reaction. Chemicals—NADPH was purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA). 5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrobiopterin and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Fe(III) 2,4-diacetyl deuteroporphyrin IX chloride was purchased from Porphyrin (now Frontier Scientific, Inc. Logan, UT). Trizma base, l-arginine, cytochrome c (horse heart), K3Fe(CN)6, dl-isocitric acid trisodium salt, l-arginine, and other commercial chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Enzymes—eNOS was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Martásek et al. (25Martásek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparation was concentrated to 50 μm after being purified by a 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, with 100 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol) to remove 2′-AMP, arginine and BH4. NO Formation rate (hemoglobin capture assay) of the purified eNOS was determined to be 120 ± 10 nmol/min/mg, using the extinction coefficient of 60 mm-1 cm-1 at 401 nm. Cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP-2) was prepared as described by Cunningham and Bash (26Cunningham M.A. Bash P.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A133-a133Google Scholar), and Ding and co-workers (27Xu X. Zhao J.Y. Xu Z. Peng B.Z. Huang Q.H. Arnold E. Ding J.P. J. Biol.

The His-tagged protein was purified from a nickel column and concentrated to 8 mg/ml. Activity was tested by monitoring NADPH formation at 340 nm. Purified IDP-2 has stoichiometrically bound NADP+. The activity of the IDP-2, measured by monitoring the formation of NADPH at 340 nm with an extinction coefficient of 6220 m-1 cm-1, was calculated to be 40 μmol/min/mg. dHRP was prepared using the method described by Makino et al. (7Makino R. Tanaka T. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11444-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Makino R. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 72: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Native horseradish peroxidase was bought from Toyobo Inc. (Japan). Calmodulin was prepared by the method of Zhang and Vogel (29Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 981-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); SOD and catalase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. dHRP Experiments—dHRP trapping of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide was monitored by an Agilent 8453 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. The standard reaction buffer consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm CaCl2, and 50 μm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid. The reaction was carried out in a glass cuvette, and measurements were taken every 10 s. A typical reaction mixture contained the standard reaction buffer and 100 μm dHRP, 200 μm MgCl2, 0.65 μm eNOS (BH4- and arginine-free), 2 μm IDP-2, and 10 mm dl-isocitric acid (trisodium salt) was added to start the reaction immediately prior to the first optical measurement. Where needed, calmodulin (7 μm) and SOD (23 μg/ml) were added as described in the figure legends. Control experiments were performed in the absence of eNOS. Quantitative analysis of the uncoupled [O2]/[O2·¯] ratio was performed using simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and the abovementioned dHRP trapping of superoxide anion. The reaction was carried out in an air-tight cuvette (2.22 ml), and the oxygenated standard reaction buffer was premixed with 160 or 100 μm dHRP, 200 μm MgCl2, 2.3 μm eNOS (BH4- and arginine-free), and 2 μm IDP-2; 10 mm dl-isocitric acid was added to start the reaction. The rate of compound III accumulation was calculated using the 583-nm delta extinction coefficient of 3.8 mm-1 reported by Makino and Yamazaki (28Makino R. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 72: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the corresponding oxygen consumption was recorded by the oxygen sensing system described below. Oxygen Consumption—The uptake of molecular oxygen was measured at 24 °C using a fluorescence-based oxygen sensing system consisting of an SD2000 dual channel spectrophotometer combined with an LS-450 Blue LED light source and a Foxy-18G probe, all from Ocean Optics (Dunedin, FL). The reaction was carried out in an air-tight cuvette (1.80 ml), designed and fabricated in the laboratory. The standard reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm CaCl2, and 50 μm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) was stirred gently overnight to ensure full oxygenation. A typical reaction mixture contained 7 μm calmodulin, 23 μg/ml SOD, 1.7 μm catalase, 5.5 μm BH4, and 0.3 ∼ 2 μm eNOS. To study the coupled reaction, either 500 μm l-arginine or NOHA may be added. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 440 μm. Determination of the [O2]/[NADPH] ratio was performed by injecting a small volume of NADPH quantitatively and monitoring the oxygen concentration trace. The reaction was carried out in the abovementioned oxygen apparatus. Standard reaction buffer containing 7 μm calmodulin, 23 μg/ml SOD, 1.7 μm catalase, 5.5 μm BH4, and 0.3-0.5 μm eNOS was mixed before multiple stepwise injections of NADPH, which started the reaction. Each injection contained a precisely determined amount of NADPH and could only reduce a certain amount of oxygen. The [O2]/[NADPH] ratio was determined under three conditions: 1) in the totally uncoupled reaction in the absence of l-arginine or NOHA, 2) in the presence of 500 μm l-arginine as substrate, and 3) in the presence of 500 μm NOHA as substrate. It is noteworthy that excessive amounts of SOD and catalase were present in the oxygen consumption experiments to avoid accumulation of ROS. Each experiment contains multiple injections of NADPH, and the results were averaged. The resulting O2 uptake at each addition was within ±3%. At the end of each experiment, an excessive amount of sodium dithionite was added to ensure depletion of oxygen. At least two different preparations of eNOS were used to confirm stoichiometry in each instance. In the absence of l-arginine or NOHA, the reaction was totally uncoupled. When either l-arginine or NOHA was added, eNOS was partially uncoupled (more in the discussion section), and the overall oxygen consumption equals the weighted sum of both the coupled and uncoupled reactions. The percentage of coupling is calculated by comparing the theoretical values of [O2]/[NADPH] to the experimental values. The Uncoupled Reaction and the Effect of CaM—The basic uncoupled reaction, performed in the presence of dHRP, CaM, and eNOS, free of BH4 and l-arginine, showed the formation of compound III of dHRP (Fig. 1A), indicating O2·¯ formation by eNOS. Sharp isosbestic points at 481, 530, and 605 nm were observed, indicating that the transition from ferric dHRP (λmax = 507 and 640 nm) to dHRP compound III is the only reaction occurring, and that O2·¯ was the only product formed (∼4 min-1) under such conditions. The control experiment, performed in the absence of eNOS, showed no spectral changes over 10 min. The abovementioned reaction was then repeated in the absence of CaM. Exactly the same optical changes were observed (spectra not shown) but at much slower rate (∼1 min-1). A plot of spectral changes at 583 nm is shown in Fig. 1B; in the first 2 min, the reaction rates in the presence and absence of CaM were both linear, but the (+)CaM rate is about three to four times faster than the (-)CaM rate. Our results are consistent with the CaM effect reported by Vásquez-Vivár et al. (30Vásquez-Vivár J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) using EPR spectroscopy. Quantitative analysis of the uncoupled reaction was performed by simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and O2·¯ formation (9Gao Y.T. Panda S.P. Roman L.J. Martásek P. Ishimura Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7921-7929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the uncoupled [O2]/[O2·¯] stoichiometry was obtained by comparing the rate of oxygen consumption to the rate of O2·¯ formation. Although the oxygen concentration was continuously monitored by the oxygen sensing system described under “Experimental Procedures,” a diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer recorded a series of spectra of the reaction mixture every 10 s. When a spectrum was recorded, the burst of light from the diode array spectrophotometer interfered with the oxygen sensor, leaving ticks visible on the oxygen concentration trace at 10-s intervals (Fig. 2A); time alignment was achieved using these small ticks as an internal reference. Difference spectra of dHRP compound III were produced by subtracting the spectrum of ferric dHRP from those recorded every 10 s after the reaction started (Fig. 2B). The sharp isosbestic points in Fig. 2B confirm that compound III formation (Reaction 7) is the only reaction occurring during the initial 2-min time course. The oxygen consumption trace, recorded simultaneously on the same sample, is shown in Fig. 2A. The rates of both O2·¯ formation and O2 consumption were calculated to be 5.4 μm/min, reflecting a stoichiometry of [O2]/[O2·¯] = 1/1 (Reaction 4). The Arginine Effect—l-Arginine was found to stimulate the oxygen consumption rate by eNOS ∼10-fold, depending on the enzyme preparation. This is a surprising finding given our previous publication (9Gao Y.T. Panda S.P. Roman L.J. Martásek P. Ishimura Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7921-7929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) indicating that the oxygen consumption rate by nNOS is strongly inhibited by l-arginine. A comparison is shown in Fig. 3A, in which the oxygen consumption rate by eNOS was stimulated from ∼4 to ∼40 min-1, whereas the oxygen consumption rate by nNOS was inhibited from ∼500 to ∼140 min-1. In contrast, nonhydrolyzable l-arginine analogs, such as Nω-nitro-l-arginine methylester, NG-monomethyl l-arginine citrate, and l-citrulline (the product of Reaction 3) did not stimulate oxygen consumption by eNOS (Fig. 3, B and C). The significance of these experiments and the comparison of the l-arginine effect on eNOS and nNOS will be addressed in detail under “Discussion.” The Tetrahydrobiopterin Effect—BH4 stimulates the oxygen consumption rate of eNOS by ∼3-fold in the presence of l-arginine (Fig. 4A) but has no effect on oxygen consumption in the absence of l-arginine (data not shown). To evaluate the amount of ROS generated in a reaction mixture, SOD and catalase were introduced sequentially to the reaction mixture, whereas oxygen concentration was monitored. For example, the reaction could start in the presence of SOD, which keeps ROS in the form of H2O2 (Reaction 6); after ∼100 μm of oxygen was consumed, catalase could be introduced to the reaction mixture, and H2O2 would be rapidly converted to molecular oxygen (Reaction 9), which can be monitored/recorded by the oxygen sensing system. BH4 almost totally inhibited ROS formation by eNOS, but ROS formation occurs in the absence of BH4 or the presence of BH2, a redox-incompetent BH4 analog (Fig. 4, B and C). Fig. 4B indicates that a significant amount of ROS was formed by BH4-free eNOS even in the presence of l-arginine (detailed conditions are indicated in the figure legend). Upon the addition of catalase, the evolution of oxygen was observed to be 20-30 μm. Repeating the experiment with BH2-bound eNOS produced a similar result (Fig. 4C), but repeating the experiment with BH4-replete eNOS yielded a negligible amount of oxygen evolution (Fig. 4D). Although these experiments are not strictly quantitative, they present a qualitative measure of ROS formation under different conditions. Because BH4 itself is a strong reducing reagent and may react with ROS directly, the experiment presented in Fig. 4D was repeated with a range of BH4 concentrations (500 μm to 10 mm). The same result was obtained (data not shown), indicating that the diminished formation of ROS by BH4-replete eNOS, rather than the ROS scavenging activity by BH4 itself, is responsible for the striking differences in the comparison of Fig. 4 (compare B and C with D). The literature indicates that free BH4 and eNOS-bound BH4 degrade at neutral pH at 0.017 and 0.006 min-1, respectively (31Berka V. Yeh H.C. Gao D. Kiran F. Tsai A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13137-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), rates that are insufficient to compete with eNOS-catalyzed oxygen consumption. Stoichiometry and eNOS Coupling—The determination of the [O2]/[NADPH] ratio is shown in Fig. 5. In the absence of l-arginine or NOHA, the reaction was fully uncoupled, and the measured [O2]/[NADPH] ratio was 0.50, the same as the theoretical value (Table 1). The same ratio measured with l-arginine or NOHA was slightly lower than the theoretical value (Table 1), indicating that eNOS was highly coupled under our experimental conditions. Repeating these experiments proved that our enzyme preparations consistently exhibited 92-96% coupling in the presence of l-arginine or 88-91% in the presence of NOHA. Oxygen consumption rates are calculated from the initial slope of oxygen traces in Fig. 5 and are listed in Table 2. Unlike the [O2]/[NADPH] ratio, enzyme preparations vary in terms of turnover numbers in a ±10% range.TABLE 1Oxygen stoichiometry of eNOS The experiments were performed in the presence of excessive amounts of SOD and catalase. Theoretical values were derived from equations listed in the introduction, and the experimental values are averaged from multiple measurements of multiple eNOS holoenzyme preparations. Note that the [O2]/[NADPH] ratio is extremely close to the theoretical value in the absence of substrate, and eNOS is highly coupled in the presence of either l-arginine or NOHA.Substrate/cofactor[O2]/[NADPH] ratioExperimental valueTheoretical valueeNOS coupling(-) l-arginine, (-) NOHA/(±) BH40.50 ± 0.010.50100% uncoupled(+) l-arginine/(+) BH41.28 ± 0.031.3392-96% coupled(+) l-arginine/(-) BH41.03 ± 0.03NAaNA, not applicableUncoupled(+) l-arginine/(+) BH20.94 ± 0.03NAUncoupled(+) NOHA/(+) BH41.84 ± 0.022.0088-91% coupleda NA, not applicable Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Oxygenase activities of eNOS and nNOS The nNOS data are obtained from previous publications by Gao et al.

https://openalex.org/W2003157316,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is an essential regulator of adipocyte differentiation, maintenance, and survival. Deregulations of its functions are associated with metabolic diseases. We show here that deletion of one PPARγ allele not only affected lipid storage but, more surprisingly, also the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake and utilization, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and glycerol export as well as in IR/IGF-1 signaling. These deregulations led to reduced circulating adiponectin levels and an energy crisis in the WAT, reflected in a decrease to nearly half of its intracellular ATP content. In addition, there was a decrease in the metabolic rate and physical activity of the PPARγ+/- mice, which was abolished by thiazolidinedione treatment, thereby linking regulation of the metabolic rate and physical activity to PPARγ. It is likely that the PPARγ+/- phenotype was due to the observed WAT dysfunction, since the gene expression profiles associated with metabolic pathways were not affected either in the liver or the skeletal muscle. These findings highlight novel roles of PPARγ in the adipose tissue and underscore the multifaceted action of this receptor in the functional fine tuning of a tissue that is crucial for maintaining the organism in good health. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is an essential regulator of adipocyte differentiation, maintenance, and survival. Deregulations of its functions are associated with metabolic diseases. We show here that deletion of one PPARγ allele not only affected lipid storage but, more surprisingly, also the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake and utilization, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and glycerol export as well as in IR/IGF-1 signaling. These deregulations led to reduced circulating adiponectin levels and an energy crisis in the WAT, reflected in a decrease to nearly half of its intracellular ATP content. In addition, there was a decrease in the metabolic rate and physical activity of the PPARγ+/- mice, which was abolished by thiazolidinedione treatment, thereby linking regulation of the metabolic rate and physical activity to PPARγ. It is likely that the PPARγ+/- phenotype was due to the observed WAT dysfunction, since the gene expression profiles associated with metabolic pathways were not affected either in the liver or the skeletal muscle. These findings highlight novel roles of PPARγ in the adipose tissue and underscore the multifaceted action of this receptor in the functional fine tuning of a tissue that is crucial for maintaining the organism in good health.

First, it is a tissue that responds to nutrient intake by storing excess energy in the form of triglycerides (TG) and to metabolic demands associated with fasting or exercise by releasing the stored TG as free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol (2Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Second, WAT is an endocrine organ in addition to its energy reserve functions. In fact, it integrates metabolic signals and secretes molecules, called adipokines, which in turn impact on multiple target organs, such as the liver, muscle, or brain. Therefore, it contributes significantly to the control of whole body energy homeostasis (3Juge-Aubry C.E. Somm E. Giusti V. Pernin A. Chicheportiche R. Verdumo C. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Burger D.

Thus, WAT functional integrity is required for the balanced body metabolism of a healthy organism.PPARγ (NR1C3) is highly expressed in the WAT, where it plays an important role in adipogenesis and in lipid metabolism (11Desvergne B.

Together, these facts underline the functions of PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation and survival and underscore its role in WAT integrity and whole body homeostasis.Although the homozygous deletion of PPARγ in a mouse model was shown to be embryonic lethal, the survival of PPARγ-/- mice by inactivation of PPARγ in all tissues except the trophoblasts was successful. These animals suffered from lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and hypotension (25Duan S.Z. Ivashchenko C.Y. Whitesall S.E. D'Alecy L.G. Duquaine D.C. Brosius F.C. Gonzalez F.J. Vinson C. Pierre M.A. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, deletion of only one PPARγ allele had some intriguing effects (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y.

Invest. 2000; 105: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In fact, PPARγ+/- mice were resistant to obesity induced by a high fat diet (HFD) and, under these conditions, remained more sensitive to insulin then their WT counterparts (27Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Murakami K. Motojima K. Komeda K. Ide T. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Miki H. Tsuchida A. Akanuma Y. Nagai R. Kimura S. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41245-41254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Decreased PPARγ activity under HFD conditions had a positive outcome on the development of obesity and diabetes. Based on these observations, a novel approach in type 2 diabetes therapy would include the use of PPARγ antagonists, potentially with fewer side effects compared with the present day synthetic agonists (thiazolidinediones).Taking advantage of our PPARγ+/- mouse model, we aimed at understanding how deletion of one allele of PPARγ, which significantly reduces the activity of the receptor via a gene dosage effect, would affect WAT function and whole body metabolism, when the mice are fed with a standard diet (SD), a condition which does not exacerbate the lipid storage function of the WAT. The results reported herein show that deletion of one PPARγ allele affects specifically the expression of genes associated with metabolic pathways in the WAT. In addition to genes involved in lipid storage, genes involved in glycolysis, de novo fatty acid synthesis, and lipolysis were also down-regulated in the PPARγ heterozygous mice, creating a strong energy deficit in these animals. These defects in WAT functions correlated with a lowering of the metabolic rate of the whole body and were accompanied by a reduction in physical activity. These results cast doubt on a potential long term use of PPARγ antagonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vivo Animal Study—WT and PPARγ+/- male mice, of a mixed background Sv129/C56BL/6, were maintained at 23 °C on a 12-h light-dark cycle. The animals studied were between 10 and 12 weeks of age. They had free access to water and to an SD, except during fasting, when they had free access to water only, food being withdrawn for 24 h. In some experiments, 5–6-week-old animals were fed with an SD containing 0.004% of Pioglitazone (w/w) for 5 weeks. The Pioglitazone treatment protocol was adapted from Ref. 15Kubota N. Terauchi Y.

Pioglitazone was kindly provided by Takeda Chemical Industries (Switzerland). The standard food pellets containing the Pioglitazone as well as the control pellets were produced by Provimi-Kliba (Switzerland). For analysis, the animals were killed in the morning between 9 and 11 a.m. by cervical dislocation, and tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The animal experimentation protocols were approved by the Commission de Surveillance de l'Expérimention Animale of the Canton de Vaud (Switzerland).RNA Preparation—The RNA from epidydymal WAT, gastrocnemius skeletal muscle, and liver was extracted from the frozen tissues using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA for microarray analyses was further purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns (Qiagen). The RNA quality was assessed by capillary electrophoresis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).Microarray Experiment and Data Processing—To minimize interindividual variation due to the mixed background of the mouse strain, each PPARγ+/- animal had a WT counterpart coming from the same litter.Three independent sets of total RNA samples (three WT and three PPARγ+/- animals) from epidydymal WAT and gastrocnemius skeletal muscle were isolated. cRNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA, according to Ref. 71. After purification using a Qiagen RNeasy column, aliquots of 20 μg of cRNA were fragmented. Each fragmented cRNA (15 μg) was then hybridized to an Affymetrix “Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array” Gene-Chip microarray. Hybridization, washing, and scanning were according to Affymetrix instructions.Data from the scanned chips were analyzed using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software (28Hubbell E. Liu W.M. Mei R.

Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). To identify differentially expressed transcripts, pairwise comparison analyses were carried out. Each experimental sample was compared with each reference sample, resulting in nine pairwise comparisons. Transcripts were considered to be differentially expressed if their levels changed in the same direction in seven of nine comparisons. Further data filtering and analyses were performed with the Genespring (Agilent) and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 4.0 software.Quantitative RT-PCR—Single-stranded cDNA templates for quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR analysis were synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and random priming, starting from the same RNAs used for the microarray analysis, and from additional independent experiments as described above. Amplicons were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and their sequences were checked by BLAST against the mouse genome to ensure that they were specific for the gene being assayed. The efficiency of each primer pair was tested in a cDNA dilution series. The list of primers is available on demand.Real time PCR was carried out in optical 384-well plates and labeled by using the SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems), and the fluorescence was quantified with a 7900HT SDS system (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression level of target genes was normalized according to geNorm, using β-actin, tubulin α2, and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 as references to determine the normalization factor (30Vandesompele J.

Fold changes were calculated from the ratio of means of the normalized quantities and their statistical significance was determined by a paired Student's t test.ATP Level Measurements—Frozen WAT homogenate was transferred into a plastic tube containing 6% HClO4. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered and neutralized with 5.5 m KOH. The ATP concentration was measured with an ATP determination kit, a time-stable assay from Biaffin GmbH&Co KG (Germany). The kit allows quantitative determination of small amounts of ATP by a bioluminescence assay involving the oxidation of the firefly luciferase depending on the ATP present in the extracts. The ATP concentration was derived according to the manufacturer's instructions.Glycerol Level Measurements—The glycerol content was measured with a glycerol measuring kit (Randox). Briefly, the glycerol present in the samples was converted into a colored product measured at a wavelength of 520 nm. The glycerol concentration was then determined according to the manufacturer's instructions.Metabolic Measurements—Metabolic cage studies were conducted in a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring System (8-chamber CLAMS system; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The mice were adapted to powdered food for 24 h before they were introduced into the metabolic cages, where a 48-h acclimation preceded the 24-h recording time. Information was collected on the metabolic activity, food intake, water drinking, and physical activity.Blood was collected from the orbital sinus between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m., using heparinized microcapillary tubes and immediately centrifuged. The serum fraction was frozen immediately. Depending on the experiment, the animals were either normally fed or fasted for 24 h.The plasma concentrations of TG, free fatty acids (FFAs), glycerol, and ketone bodies were measured at the Mouse Clinic Institute (ICS; Strasbourg, France) on a Olympus AU-400 automated laboratory work station (Olympus-SA France) using commercial reagents (Olympus Diagnostica GmbH, Lismeehan, Ireland).The plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured using the mouse leptin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and the mouse adiponectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Linco Reserach).The plasma glucose levels were measured with an Accu-Chek Sensor glucometer (Roche Applied Science), and the plasma insulin concentrations were measured with an Ultra mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Mercodia SA).RESULTSDecreased Metabolic Rate in PPARγ+/-Mice—In PPARγ+/- animals, PPARγ mRNA and protein (PPARγ1 and PPARγ2) levels were reduced by half compared with those of WT mice (31Rieusset J. Seydoux J. Anghel S.I. Escher P. Michalik L. Soon Tan N. Metzger D. Chambon P. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2363-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This prompted us to explore the impact of this reduced PPARγ expression on whole body metabolism in the absence of any excess energy challenge, as is usually done with HFD feeding in assessing the role of PPARγ in lipid storage. Instead, the PPARγ+/- mice were fed with an SD. Metabolic parameters of the PPARγ+/- mice and their WT littermates were determined using metabolic cages. As expected, both mutated and WT animals consumed more O2 and produced more CO2 during the dark cycle, when they are generally more active (Fig. 1A, left). Although the PPARγ+/- mice had a similar weight (Table S1) and ate an equal amount of food (data not shown), they consumed less oxygen and produced less CO2 during both the light and dark cycles when compared with their WT counterparts, a difference reflected in a decrease of 14% in the metabolic rate (heat production) of PPARγ+/- animals (Fig. 1A). This effect was clearly PPARγ-dependent, since a 5-week treatment with SD containing the PPARγ agonist Pioglitazone, at 0.004%, alleviated the metabolic rate difference between the two genotypes (Fig. 1A, right). Moreover, there was a trend, not statistically significant, for increased O2 consumption, CO2 production, and a higher metabolic rate in Pioglitazone-treated PPARγ+/- mice, whereas such a tendency was not observed in WT animals.FIGURE 1Metabolic rate, fuel consumption, and total physical activity in PPARγ+/- and control mice.A, oxygen (O2) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) production, and metabolic rate in the PPARγ+/- and control mice. O2 and CO2 were measured by indirect calorimetry and expressed as average VO2 and VCO2/kg of body weight/h during a 24-h monitoring session (light/dark). Metabolic rate (heat) is calculated from the oxygen production and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and is expressed as average kcal/h/kg of body weight during a 24-h monitoring session (light/dark). B, the fuel consumption (RER) is the ratio of CO2 produced to the amount of O2 consumed and serves as a guide of the fuel type consumption (carbohydrate (RER = 1.0) or fat (RER = 0.7)). C, the total physical activity was measured as the horizontal and rearing movements during the 24-h monitoring period (total of light and dark movements). The activity is expressed as the average number of times a mouse crosses both the x and y axes at least twice. n = 12 (CTL experiments); n = 5 (Pioglitazone experiments). Values are expressed as mean ± S.E.; *, p ≤ 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Deletion of One PPARγ Allele Does Not Affect the Carbohydrate to Lipid Ratio in Metabolic Fuel Utilization—To determine whether the decrease in the metabolic rate of PPARγ+/- animals was associated with alterations in the use of carbohydrates versus lipids as fuel molecules, we calculated the respiratory exchange ratio (RER). The RER (equal to VO2/VCO2) indicates whether lipids (RER = 0.7) or carbohydrates (RER = 1.0) are being oxidized to produce energy. Both genotypes consumed carbohydrates as the main energy source (Fig. 1B, left). This result disagrees with the notion of a metabolic compensation through increased fat oxidation in PPARγ+/- mice (9Koutnikova H. Cock T.A. Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Champy M.F. Dierich A. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14457-14462Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Pioglitazone treatment had no significant effect on the choice of fuel type (Fig. 1B, right).Decreased Physical Activity in PPARγ+/-Mice—Since a decreased metabolic rate in the mutated animals may correlate with a change in behavior, we measured their physical activity (horizontal and rearing movements). Interestingly, the PPARγ+/- mice presented a 23% decrease in total activity (Fig. 1C, left). This phenotype correlated with a strong decrease in the plasma adiponectin concentration in PPARγ+/- mice, whereas the leptin level remained unchanged (Figs. 2A and S1). This observation is in agreement with the reduced spontaneous motor activity of transgenic mice overexpressing an antisense adiponectin RNA, resulting in decreased circulating adiponectin levels (32Saito K. Arata S. Hosono T. Sano Y. Takahashi K. Choi-Miura N.H. Nakano Y. Tobe T. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Pioglitazone treatment corrected this decrease in physical activity, suggesting an implication of PPARγ (Fig. 1C, right). In brief, reduced PPARγ levels decreased the metabolic rate and the physical activity of mice without changing their fuel preference.FIGURE 2Plasma profile of PPARγ+/- and control mice.A, plasma adiponectin concentrations; B, plasma insulin concentrations; C, plasma glucose concentrations; D, FFA plasma levels; E, plasma glycerol concentrations; F, plasma ketone body concentrations; G, plasma TG concentrations.

The plasma insulin concentration was normal in unchallenged animals and was decreased after a 24-h fast as expected, but no difference was observed between WT and mutant mice (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the glycemia was also normal in PPARγ+/- mice, which however had a significantly attenuated response to fasting (Fig. 2C). In fact, the fasting glycemia was higher in the PPARγ+/- mice compared with that of the WT animals. Fasting for 24 h decreased the glucose level by 45% in WT mice, whereas it was decreased by only 30% in the PPARγ+/- animals. Thus, after fasting, PPARγ+/- mice presented a less pronounced hypoglycemia.The Plasma Lipid Profile of PPARγ+/-Mice Reveals an Alteration in Lipolytic Activity—In fed conditions, the plasma FFA concentrations were normal, and no deregulation was observed in PPARγ+/- mice (Fig. 2D). WT animals responded normally to fasting by liberating FFAs from the WAT into the circulation, thus increasing the plasma FFA concentration. Remarkably, no significant increase was observed in the PPARγ+/- mice, suggesting a deregulation of the lipolytic activity of the PPARγ+/- WAT. This defect was confirmed by measuring the circulating glycerol concentration. As for the FFAs, there was no difference in the fed glycerol concentration between WT and PPARγ+/- mice (Fig. 2E). However, the PPARγ+/- mice responded less well to fasting, since they increased their plasma glycerol concentration by only 32%, compared with the 62% monitored in WT mice. Given that the fasting glycerol and FFA concentrations are indicators of the lipolytic activity in the WAT, we concluded that PPARγ+/- mice might have a decreased lipolytic activity. This alteration should also be detectable in the WAT itself, in which the total glycerol (glycerol + glycerol-3-P) originates from glycolysis, glyceroneogenesis, and lipolysis. There was a 23% decrease in total glycerol content of the PPARγ+/- WAT, suggesting that at least one of the three above functions or all of them were impaired (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Glycerol content in white adipose tissue of fed PPARγ+/- and WT mice. WT, n = 11; PPARγ+/-, n = 12. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E.; *, p ≤ 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reduced circulating FFA levels should have consequences for ketone body synthesis in the liver, which depends on FFA availability. We measured the ketone body concentrations after fasting in both WT and PPARγ+/- mice (Fig. 2F). PPARγ+/- mice were less efficient in producing ketone bodies, since their plasma concentration of this peripheral organ fuel was 33% lower than in WT animals. Thus, this decreased supply in ketone bodies might reflect the reduced availability of FFAs in PPARγ+/- mice. The TG concentrations were increased by 38% after fasting in WT mice, which reflects the recycling to TG-very low density lipoprotein by the liver of a portion of the FFA liberated by the WAT during fasting (Fig. 2G). In agreement with the observations reported above, the plasma TG concentration was not increased in PPARγ+/- mice, in contrast to that measured in WT animals. The reason why fed PPARγ+/- animals also presented reduced ketone body levels remains to be elucidated (Fig. 2F).Based on the results described so far, we hypothesized that the PPARγ+/- mice decreased their metabolic rate and their physical activity to adapt to a diminished energy supply. Three organs, the liver, skeletal muscle, and WAT, are primarily involved in energy supply and consumption. Deletion of one PPARγ allele might have affected the expression pattern of PPARγ target genes. This possibility was tested by assessing the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways of the three key organs mentioned above by microarray analysis (WAT and skeletal muscle) and/or qRT-PCR (WAT and liver). The expression of genes not represented in the microarray was analyzed by qRT-PCR.The Expression of Metabolic Genes Is Not Affected in the Liver of PPARγ+/-Mice—The liver is one of the major organs responsible for whole body energy balance. PPARγ is expressed at low levels in the liver under normal conditions but is increased in steatosis induced by HFD or other pathophysiological conditions (11Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr.

Despite the functional importance of this protein in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, the functional correlation to the structural domain of RTN3 remained unclear. RTN3 has two long transmembrane domains, but its membrane topology was not known. We report here that the first transmembrane domain dictates membrane integration and its membrane topology. RTN3 adopts a omega-shape structure with two ends facing the cytosolic side. Subtle changes in RTN3 membrane topology can disrupt its binding to BACE1 and its inhibitory effects on BACE1 activity. Thus, the determination of RTN3 membrane topology may provide an important structural basis for our understanding of its cellular functions."

These cell stresses lead to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α shutting down global protein translation. However, the translation of ATF4 is enhanced. In this study, lovastatin treatment induced eIF2α phosphorylation and inhibited global protein translation. ATF4 expression was induced followed by increased ATF3 and CHOP expression, targets of ATF4 activity, in SCC25 HNSCC cells. In CHOP–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), lovastatin-induced apoptosis was attenuated indicating a role for CHOP in this response. Furthermore, the eIF2α kinase GCN2 mediates lovastatin induction of ATF4 and lovastatin-induced apoptosis was also attenuated in GCN2–/– MEFs. The pro-drug version of lovastatin has potential proteasome inhibitory activity and recently a variety of well established proteasome inhibitors were shown to activate the ISR. In this study, neither the pro-drug nor the active forms of lovastatin had any significant effect on proteasome activity. Therefore, lovastatin, by targeting mevalonate synthesis, is a potent inducer of the ISR through a novel and as yet unrecognized mechanism. Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis, can readily induce apoptosis in a subset of human tumor types including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). We recently identified activation of transcription factor (ATF) 4 as a lovastatin induced gene in HNSCC cells.

Therefore, lovastatin, by targeting mevalonate synthesis, is a potent inducer of the ISR through a novel and as yet unrecognized mechanism. The rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway is the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar). The mevalonate pathway produces various end products that are critical for many different cellular functions. These products are essential in maintaining cellular membrane structure and integrity, N-linked protein glycosylation, mitochondrial respiration, tRNA production, and the prenylation of a wide variety of cellular proteins (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar). These prenylated proteins include many GTP-binding proteins such as members of the Ras, Rab, and Rho families. These proteins regulate cell proliferation, intracellular trafficking, and cell motility (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and this post-translational modification functions as a membrane anchor critical for their activity. Blockade of the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors results in decreased levels of mevalonate and its downstream products (4Corsini A. Maggi F.M. Catapano A.L. Pharmacol. Res. 1995; 31: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and, thus, may have significant influences on many critical cellular functions. The statin family of drugs are potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase widely used as hypercholesterolemia treatments (4Corsini A. Maggi F.M. Catapano A.L. Pharmacol. Res. 1995; 31: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Malignant cells appear highly dependent on the sustained availability of the end products of the mevalonate pathway (5Buchwald H. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1154-1156Abstract PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent analyses have demonstrated that statin treatment can directly block tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastases both in vitro and in vivo (6Kusama T. Mukai M. Iwasaki T. Tatsuta M. Matsumoto Y. Akedo H. Inoue M. Nakamura H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 308-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). In initial clinical analyses of statins as anti-cancer therapeutics, no significant anti-tumor responses were observed (8Thibault A. Samid D. Tompkins A.C. Figg W.D. Cooper M.R. Hohl R.J. Trepel J. Liang B. Patronas N. Venzon D.J. Reed E. Myers C.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar, 9Larner J. Jane J. Laws E. Packer R. Myers C. Shaffrey M. Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 21: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). New optimism regarding the use of statins, however, has emerged from recent studies. We and others (10Dimitroulakos J. Ye L.Y. Benzaquen M. Moore M.J. Kamel-Reid S. Freedman M.H. Yeger H. Penn L.Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 158-167PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dimitroulakos J. Nohynek D.

Neurooncol. 1999; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a number of human tumor types including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), 2The abbreviations used are: HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; ISR, integrated stress response; Tg, thapsigargin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; ATF, activation of transcription factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; ISR, integrated stress response; Tg, thapsigargin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; ATF, activation of transcription factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein. are particularly susceptible to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. The identification of specific tumor types that are sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, spurred further clinical evaluation by our group, and a Phase I trial in recurrent HNSCC and cervical carcinoma patients was undertaken. Although no tumor regressions were observed, 23% of patients exhibited stable disease suggesting further clinical evaluation is warranted (13Knox J.J. Siu L.L. Chen E. Dimitroulakos J. Kamel-Reid S. Moore M.J. Chin S. Irish J. LaFramboise S. Oza A.M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of cellular apoptosis induced by lovastatin may uncover novel therapeutic approaches. A variety of cell stressors result in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α, which causes global translation attenuation (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The α subunit of eIF2 is the target of a family of serine or threonine kinases that are activated by different forms of environmental stress and include PKR, PERK, GCN2, and HRI (15Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For example, PKR senses viral infection (16Saunders L.R. Barber G.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), PERK detects endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress (15Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), GCN2 senses amino acid starvation (17Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HRI monitors changes in the availability of heme during erythrocyte differentiation (18McEwen E. Kedersha N. Song B. Scheuner D. Gilks N. Han A. Chen J.-J. Anderson P. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16925-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Each of these stress-activated kinases phosphorylates eIF2α on serine 51, a modification that prevents the assembly of the preinitiation complex, and halts global protein translation to aid in the cellular response to these stresses (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, however, the translation of activation of transcription factor (ATF) 4 is enhanced because of delayed translational re-initiation at upstream reading frames located at the 5′-end of the AFT4 mRNA (19Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). We recently identified ATF4 as a lovastatin-induced gene in HNSCC cells (20Dimitroulakos J. Marhin W.H. Tokunaga J. Irish J. Gullane P. Penn L.Z. Kamel-Reid S. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ATF4 is induced in response to a wide variety of cellular stresses playing a critical role in regulating this integrated stress response (ISR) (19Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Depending on the strength of the stress stimulus, these mediators can either alleviate the stress or alternatively induce apoptosis. Enhanced expression of the transcription factors ATF3 and CHOP, ATF4 target genes, can mediate this apoptotic response (21Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The closed ring prodrug form of lovastatin is readily converted, both chemically and enzymatically, to its open ring active form that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase activity (4Corsini A. Maggi F.M. Catapano A.L. Pharmacol. Res. 1995; 31: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A few studies have shown that the prodrug form of lovastatin can inhibit proteasome function (22Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitors are potent inducers of the ISR likely because of the accumulation of misfolded proteins (23Jiang H.-Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14189-14202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Upon chemical conversion of the prodrug to the active form of lovastatin, a residual concentration (up to 20%) of the prodrug can remain (22Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is the potential for lovastatin to trigger the ISR through proteasome inhibition. In this report we evaluated the potential of lovastatin to induce the ISR in HNSCC cells. We further characterized the role of the eIF2α kinases PERK and GCN2 as potential mediators of lovastatin-induced apoptosis. We also evaluated the role of proteasome inhibition in regulating this response. Delineating the mechanism of lovastatin-induced apoptosis may lead to more refined therapeutic approaches using this class of agents. Tissue Culture—The SCC25, HeLa, and the 293T cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The wild type+/+, CHOP–/–, and GCN2–/– murine embryonic fibroblast cell lines (MEFs) were kindly provided by Dr. David Ron (Skirball Institute, New York) while the PERK–/– MEFS were provided by Dr. John Bell (Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ottawa). These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's-MEM (Media Services, Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Medicorp, Montreal, QC). Cells were exposed to solvent control or to 0–100 μm lovastatin (generously provided by Apotex, Mississauga, Canada, diluted from a 10 mm stock in ethanol prepared as previously described (24Dimitroulakos J. Yeger H. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Thapsigargin (Tg) was purchased from Sigma. Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular protein was extracted using a buffer that consisted of 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), 0.1% SDS (Sigma), 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) in 2× PBS. Approximately 200 μl of extraction buffer was used to lyse 106 cells. Total protein was quantified with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as standard. Protein extracts representing 50 μg total protein were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Toronto, ON). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody, diluted in 5% skim milk powder in PBS, was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies used in this study included ATF4, ATF3, CHOP, GADD34, ubiquitin, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), BiP, eIF2α, and HSP70 (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI) and phosphoserine 51 eIF2α (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). The secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were applied at a 1:5000 dilution in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10% fetal bovine serum, in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (washes following antibody incubations are 3× 5 min in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) then processed for chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). After the desired exposure was obtained the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue (Sigma) to ensure equal loading of the samples. For visualizing exogenous GFP levels, the pEGFP-C1 plasmid with a degron domain added to the C terminus (GFPu) (25Bence N.F. Bennett E.J. Kopito R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) provided by Dr. Doug Gray (Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ottawa) was transfected into HeLa and 293T cells using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche, Mississauga, ON) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real Time RT-PCR—mRNA expression was measured using quantitative RT-PCR. cDNA was prepared from total RNA extracted from cells using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and p(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transcripts were amplified in 20-μl reactions containing 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl), 100 μm dNTPs, 200 μm gene specific primers, 100 ng of cDNA template, 0.02 units/μl Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and Sybr green I (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Amplification was carried out on a LightCycler thermocyler (Roche Applied Science) using 50 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 24 s. Fold changes, expressed as means (± S.E., n = 3), were calculated for drug treated groups versus vehicle control using ΔΔCt values following normalization to gapdH transcript levels. The primers for gene-specific RT-PCR analysis were as follows: atf3: TAGGCTGGAAGAGCCAAAG (5′) and TTCTCACAGCTGCAAACACC (3′); atf4: AGTGATATCCACTTCACTGCCCAG (5′) and AAGGAGTTCGCCTTGGATGCCCTG (3′); chop: CTCTGACTGGAATCTGGAGAGTG (5′) and CTGAGTCATTGCCTTTCTCTTCG (3′); Gapdh TTGATGTCATCATACTTGGCAGGT (5′) and CAG TCAAGGCTGAGAATGGGA (3′). RT-PCR-XBP—cDNAs were prepared as described above. The primers and amplification parameters to detect splicing of XBP-1 were previously described (26Shuda M. Kondoh N. Imazeki N. Tanaka K. Okada T. Mori K. Hada A. Arai M. Wakatsuki T. Matsubara O. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto M. J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: 605-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and were as follows: spliced version CCTTGTAGTTGAGAACCAGG (5′), unspliced version CAGCAGGTGCAGGCCCAGTT (5′) and XBP-1 total GGGGCTTGGTATATATGTGGG (3′). The PCR products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and documented using Gene Genius BioImaging System (Syngene, Frederick, MD). 35S Radiolabeling Assays—Treated SCC25 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were washed in PBS followed by 30 min incubation in translation labeling medium without methionine (Invitrogen). SCC25 cells were labeled with 20 μCi/ml [35S]Met (contents) for 15 min, then washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysates were prepared and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. MTT Assay—In a 96-well flat bottom plate (Nunc, Naperville, IL) ∼5,000 cells/150 μl of cell suspension was used to seed each well. The cells were incubated overnight to allow for cell attachment and recovery. Following treatment, 50 μl of a 5 mg/ml solution in phosphate buffered saline of the MTT tetrazolium substrate (Sigma) was added and incubated for up to 6 h at 37 °C. The resulting violet formazan precipitate was solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of a 0.01 m HCl/10% SDS (Sigma) solution shaking overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then analyzed on an MRX Microplate Reader from Dynex Technologies at 570 nm to determine the optical density of the samples. Flow Cytometry—Cell cycle parameters were determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide labeling of single cells as described previously (10Dimitroulakos J. Ye L.Y. Benzaquen M. Moore M.J. Kamel-Reid S. Freedman M.H. Yeger H. Penn L.Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 158-167PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions were labeled with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and ∼106 cells in the 1 ml analyzed by flow cytometry. Ten thousand cells were evaluated, and the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase was determined using the Modfit LT program (Verity Software House, Topsham, Maine). Fluorogenic Proteosome Assay—The fluorogenic substrates used in this study were as follows: Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) (PGPH activity; Calbiochem, Mississauga, ON), Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (ChTL activity; Calbiochem), and Bz-Val-Gly-Arg-AMC (TL activity; BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). SCC25 cells were treated with lovastatin, its prodrug form, MG132 (carbobenzoyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal, Calbiochem) and PSI (Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Alaleu-CHO, Calbiochem). Treated cells were washed in ice-cold Buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, plus 2 mm fresh ATP) then scraped in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm ATP. Lysates were vortexed for 1 min with glass beads (<106 μm acid washed; Sigma) to disrupt cells. The beads were subsequently removed by a 5-min centrifugation at 1500 × g, then cellular debris removed by a 10-min spin at 10,000 × g. Total protein was quantified by the BCA method (Pierce), and 10 μg of protein diluted to 50 μl with Buffer I. Each sample was then combined with 50 μl of Buffer I containing diluted substrate such that the final concentration of fluorogenic substrate was 50 μm (ChTL) or 100 μm (PGPH and TL). Samples were incubated with substrates for ∼30 min in the dark then fluorescence of the cleaved AMC molecule measured at 460 nm using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Nepean, ON). Each sample was assayed in replicates of five to derive a mean value, and the data shown represent the average of the means from at least three independent experiments. Lovastatin Induces eIF2α Phosphorylation— eIF2α plays a significant role in regulating the ISR (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). A variety of kinases activated by cellular stresses phosphorylate eIF2α shutting down global protein translation to allow for recovery from the insult (15Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). SCC25 cells were treated with 10 and 50 μm lovastatin for 3, 12, and 24 h as well as with 1 μm thapsigargin (Tg) for 24 h as a control. Tg is a potent inhibitor of the ER-resident calcium ATPase that results in calcium accumulation in the cytoplasm through the depletion of ER stores leading to ER stress (27Liang S.H. Zhang W. McGrath B.C. Zhang P. Cavener D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 was detected by Western blot analysis and compared with total eIF2α expression. The phosphorylation of eIF2α was enhanced with both lovastatin concentrations with Tg showing a more pronounced response (Fig. 1A). In similarly treated SCC25 cells, we were able to demonstrate global protein translation attenuation as lovastatin treatments dramatically reduced [35S]methionine-labeled incorporation into newly synthesized proteins (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that lovastatin induced the phosphorylation of eIF2α at functional levels that resulted in the shutdown of global protein translation, hallmarks of the cellular ISR (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we had demonstrated that the transcription factor ATF4 was up-regulated in lovastatin-treated HNSCC cell lines (20Dimitroulakos J. Marhin W.H. Tokunaga J. Irish J. Gullane P. Penn L.Z. Kamel-Reid S. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression levels of ATF4 are enhanced as a result of the phosphorylation of eIF2α (19Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). With the same concentration and time-course used above in SCC25 cells, we demonstrated a significant induction of ATF4 protein in these lovastatin-treated cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). This was accompanied by a relatively modest increase (<3 fold) of mRNA levels for ATF4 as determined by real time RT-PCR under similar experimental conditions and in the range of Tg treatment (1 μm, 24 h) (Fig. 1D). The increase in ATF4 protein levels in SCC25 lovastatin-treated cells was likely at the level of protein translation as mRNA levels showed only modest changes. Lovastatin Induces ATF3 and CHOP Expression—ATF4 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors (28Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 442-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consensus ATF4 binding sites are present on the promoters of a number of genes that play a role in regulating cellular stress responses including ATF3 and CHOP (28Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 442-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Expression of these genes has previously been shown to be regulated in part by ATF4. We evaluated the effects of lovastatin treatment on the expression of ATF3 and CHOP in SCC25 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated enhanced ATF3 protein expression at 24 h 10 μm lovastatin treatment (Fig. 2A). Using real time RT-PCR, 10 μm lovastatin induced a 10-fold increase in ATF3 mRNA levels by 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). The 50 μm lovastatin treatments induced both mRNA and protein levels at earlier time points and at higher levels. These results demonstrate that ATF3 expression is regulated by lovastatin treatment in SCC25 cells. CHOP is another member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors that plays a role in the induction of apoptosis when cellular stress cannot be controlled adequately (29Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). CHOP can modulate the expression of a number of apoptosis-regulating genes (30Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). CHOP protein and mRNA levels were significantly elevated within 12 h of 10 μm lovastatin treatment of SCC25 cells (Fig. 2B). At the higher 50 μm dose, CHOP mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated earlier (3 h) and to higher levels. To determine if this increase in CHOP expression results in the transcriptional regulation of CHOP targets, we evaluated the expression of GADD34. Consistent with other cellular stressors (28Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 442-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), GADD34 expression was up-regulated by 24 h with 10 μm lovastatin treatment with a more significant induction with 50 μm treatment (data not shown). These results demonstrate that CHOP expression is induced by lovastatin in SCC25 cells resulting in the activation of its transcriptional targets. CHOP Regulates Lovastatin-induced Apoptosis—CHOP is implicated in apoptosis induced by the ISR (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 31McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.-O. Aw T.-Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). MEFs derived from CHOP–/– animals display an attenuated apoptotic response when challenged with agents that induce the ISR (32Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Because MEFs are responsive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, we used wild-type and CHOP–/– MEFs as a model system to evaluate the role of this transcription factor in lovastatin-induced apoptosis. MTT viability assays were performed 48 h after 0.1–25 μm lovastatin treatments. Analysis of these data showed attenuation in CHOP–/– MEFs of lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometric analysis using PI staining to determine the effect on the sub-G1 apoptotic population induced by lovastatin was employed. After 24 h and 48 h lovastatin treatments at 10 μm, there was a significant reduction in the sub-G1 population in CHOP–/– MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3B). This differential response of CHOP+/+ and CHOP–/– MEFs to lovastatin treatment was also evident by observing changes in cell morphology. More significant cell rounding, typical of cells undergoing apoptosis, was evident in CHOP+/+ cells than in CHOP–/– cells treated with 10 μm lovastatin for 12 h (data not shown). This attenuation in cytotoxicity was also observed in CHOP–/– MEFS treated with 1 μm Tg as has previously been reported (29Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D.

These results demonstrate a role for CHOP in the regulation of lovastatin-induced apoptosis. GCN2 Mediates Lovastatin Induction of ATF4—Phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 results in global protein translation attenuation to allow for cell recovery from a number of cellular stressors (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The two relevant kinases that may regulate the ability of lovastatin to induce the ISR are PERK and GCN2 that are activated by ER stress and amino acid deprivation, respectively (15Proud C.G. Semin.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of lovastatin treatment to induce ATF4 expression in MEFs lacking either PERK or GCN2 kinases. Treatments of wild type+/+, PERK–/– or GCN2–/– MEFs with 10 μm lovastatin for 3, 12, and 24 h were evaluated by Western blot analysis for changes in ATF4 expression. Tg treatment (1 μm for 24 h) was also evaluated (Fig. 4A). ATF4 expression was readily induced by 24 h in lovastatin-treated +/+ and PERK–/– MEFs. Tg induced ATF4 expression in +/+ but this response was attenuated in PERK–/– MEFs. GCN2 MEFs failed to induce ATF4 expression following 10 μm lovastatin treatments while Tg readily induced ATF4 expression in these cells. To evaluate the roles of these eIF2α kinases in lovastatin induced cytotoxicity, MTT cell viability assays were performed 48 h following 0.1"
https://openalex.org/W2032421282,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis signals initiated by a variety of death stimuli such as hydrogen peroxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Owing to its critical role in inducing apoptosis, the activity of ASK1 is tightly regulated by various mechanisms such as post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Here we describe the identification of G(1) to S phase transition protein 1 (GSPT1), which is associated with protein translation, as a regulator of ASK1. GSPT1 interacts with ASK1 and enhances ASK1-induced apoptotic activity through the activation of caspase-3. In vitro kinase assay data show that GSPT1 enhances ASK1 autophosphorylation and its kinase activity. Cell cycle-dependent GSPT1 induction and small interfering RNA analyses show that ASK1 autophosphorylation is dependent on the expression level of endogenous GSPT1 in cells. GSPT1 inhibits the binding of ASK1 to the 14-3-3 protein, an ASK1 inhibitor, while GSPT1 has no effect on the interaction between ASK1 and TRAF2, a C-terminal-binding activator of ASK1. Thus, our results reveal a novel role of GSPT1 in the regulation of ASK1-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035016589,"De novo expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax results in cellular genomic instability. We demonstrated previously that Tax associates with the cell cycle check point regulator Chk2 and proposed that the inappropriate activation of Chk2 provides a model for Tax-induced loss of genetic integrity (Haoudi, A., Daniels, R. C., Wong, E., Kupfer, G., and Semmes, O. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 37736–37744). Here we provide an explanation for how Tax induces some Chk2 activities but represses others. We show that Tax interaction with Chk2 generates two activation signals in Chk2, oligomerization and autophosphorylation. However, egress of Chk2 from chromatin, normally observed in response to ionizing radiation, was repressed in Tax-expressing cells. Analysis of chromatin-bound Chk2 from Tax-expressing cells revealed phosphorylation at Thr378, Ser379, Thr383, Thr387, and Thr389. In contrast, chromatin-bound Chk2 in the absence of Tax was phosphorylated at Thr383 and Thr387 in response to ionizing radiation. We further establish that Tax binds to the kinase domain of Chk2. Confocal microscopy revealed a redistribution of Chk2 to colocalize with Tax in Tax speckled structures, which we have shown previously to coincide with interchromatin granules. We propose that Tax binding via the Chk2 kinase domain sequesters phosphorylated Chk2 within chromatin, thus hindering chromatin egress and appropriate response to DNA damage.

Thus, it is not unexpected that HTLV-1-transformed lymphocytes demonstrate a range of chromosomal abnormalities. However, the observation that HTLV-1-infected but not -transformed T-cells also display significant genomic instability (10Gabet A.S. Mortreux F. Charneau P. Riou P. Duc-Dodon M. Wu Y. Jeang K.T.

More specifically, the observation that Tax expression alone results in genomic instability provides a compelling cause-effect model for the development of adult T-cell leukemia (12Majone F.

Although Tax regulates a wide range of cellular functions, there is no evidence that Tax directly interacts with DNA in a manner that would result in DNA damage (11Majone F. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32906-32910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, most theories propose that Tax impairs the cellular DNA damage repair response, resulting in increased surviving mutation frequency (15Marriott S.J. Semmes O.J.

Luisetto R. Zamboni D. Iwanaga Y. Jeang K.T. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, Tax has been proposed to perturb the mitotic spindle checkpoint and to directly effect chromosomal segregation, resulting in aneuploidy (23Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Another possible mechanism proposes that disruption in the cytokinesis nuclear division coordination is via premature activation of the anaphase-promoting complex achieved by binding of Tax to the anaphase-promoting complex-associated protein Cdc20 (24Liu B. Hong S. Tang Z. Yu H. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In fact, a reasonable hypothesis is that cell cycle ablation, repair enzyme repression, and disruption in the regulation of cell division all contribute to genomic instability. Recently, in an elegant ex vivo approach, Sibon et al. (25Sibon D. Gabet A.S. Zandecki M. Pinatel C. Thete J. Delfau-Larue M.H. Rabaaoui S. Gessain A. Gout O. Jacobson S. Mortreux F. Wattel E. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, early in infection, CD4+ T-cells display striking genomic instability and cell cycle redistribution. These authors reported an increase in the number of HTLV-1-infected cells residing in G2/M phase, a result consistent with early observations in Tax-expressing cells (26Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37736-37744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Liang M.H. Geisbert T. Yao Y. Hinrichs S.H. Giam C.Z. J.

We demonstrated previously that Tax expression results in the accumulation of cells in 4N via inappropriate activation of the Chk2-regulated G2/M checkpoint (26Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37736-37744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because Chk2 plays a critical bridging role between DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis, a disruption in the intact spatiotemporal relationship of Chk2 activities could result in genomic instability. Consequently, Chk2 is considered to be a tumor suppressor, and Chk2 mutations are associated with an increasing range of clinical scenarios such as neoplasia associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and breast cancer (29Allinen M.

Thus, the physical association of Tax with Chk2 and the subsequent damage-independent phosphorylation of Chk2 present a valid model for Tax-induced genomic instability. In this study, we demonstrate that Tax expression stabilizes phosphorylated Chk2 protein. This population of phosphorylated Chk2 is sequestered into Tax nuclear complexes and is impaired in its ability to egress from cellular chromatin following ionizing radiation. Thus, it appears that Tax expression results in Chk2 that is able to generate activation of some of its cognate downstream targets, as is reflected in cellular G2/M accumulation, but that is impaired in its overall response to DNA damage. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed by standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were plated in 150-mm plates at 4 × 106 cells/plate. The following day, 20 μg of plasmid DNA in 2 m CaCl2 and 2× HEPES-buffered saline was added dropwise to cells in fresh medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, and fresh medium was added. The cells were harvested 48 h later following a single wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in 500 μl of M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and immediately frozen at -80 °C. Plasmid Construction—The S-tagged expression vectors provide a fusion of a 15-residue peptide (KETAAAKFERQHMDS) derived from pancreatic ribonuclease A. S-Tax-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed by inserting the tax-enhanced GFP fusion open reading frame into the SmaI site of pTriEx4-Neo (Novagen) in-frame with the N-terminal S and His tags. Full-length N-terminally Xpress-tagged Chk2 and its deletion mutants were generated by cloning the PCR-amplified sequences into pcDNA4/HisC (Invitrogen). Full-length Chk2 and deletion mutant sequences (forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, ΔFHA, and 1–221) were isolated by EcoRI restriction digestion from plasmids pGEX4T-Chk2, pGEX4T-FHA, pGEX4T-ΔFHA, and pGEX4T-1–221 (kindly provided by Dr. David F. Stern, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT), respectively, and cloned into EcoRI-digested pcDNA4/HisC. Sequences encoding the mutant lacking the serine/threonine catalytic domain and the mutant containing the kinase domain alone were PCR-amplified from the pcDNA4-Chk2 plasmid and cloned in the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA4/HisC. S-tagged Chk2 was generated by PCR-amplifying full-length Chk2 from pGEX4T-Chk2 and cloning into the EcoRI restriction site of pTriEx4 (Novagen). Hemagglutinin (HA)-Chk2 was also received from Dr. Stern. The generated recombinant DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Co-immunoprecipitation—Protein extracts from 2.5 × 106 cells transfected with the designated expression vectors were lysed in 500 μl of M-PER protein lysis buffer (Pierce) containing the Complete mini-mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubating cell lysates with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. 100 μl of a 30% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) in lysis buffer was added to this mixture, followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes bound to beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times each with 5% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 5 mm EDTA and with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. The bound proteins were eluted by incubation in Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, placed on ice for 1 min, and further centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 2 min. A portion (30 μl) of the supernatant was loaded, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Upstate). All subsequent steps were the same as described for Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well on ethanol-washed coverslips in 6-well plates. If appropriate, each well was transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids. Cells were washed with PBS and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin and PBS at a dilution of 1:500. Cells were washed twice with PBS/Tween 20 and twice with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000 in 3% bovine serum albumin and PBS. Cells were washed twice with PBS/bovine serum albumin and twice with PBS and then mounted on glass slides using VECTASHIELD with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were acquired on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using argon (488 nm), HeNe1 (543 nm), and HeNe2 (633 nm) lasers and imaged with LSM image browser software. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in M-PER protein lysis buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mini-mixture. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the proteins were collected and quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 50 μg of protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred by the semidry transfer method to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing the appropriate primary antibody: anti-Xpress (1:5000) and anti-HA (1:2000) (Invitrogen), anti-Chk2 (1:2000) (Upstate), anti-phospho-Chk2 Thr68 (1:1000) (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA), anti-p53 (1:500) and anti-phospho-p53 Ser15 (1:500) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-Orc-2 (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-tubulin (1:5000) (Sigma). The membranes were washed once for 15 min and then four times for 5 min each with PBST (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were incubated in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody and washed with PBST as described above. Detection was performed using the ImmunSTAR detection kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Chk2 Kinase Assays—Nuclear lysates were prepared from mock- or HpX (Tax-expressing plasmid)-transfected HEK293 cells. Lysates were incubated with 40 ng of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Chk2 (Upstate) for 2 h on ice. GST-Chk2-containing lysates were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 1× kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 2 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Pierce). The reaction mixture was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, and subjected to phosphorimaging using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). pcDNA4-Chk2 and pcDNA3-Tax (kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Grassmann, Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Schlossgarten, Germany) or a control plasmid expressing a nonspecific protein were subjected to in vitro transcription/translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A standard 50-μl reaction was performed following the recommendations of the manufacturer. 8 μl of the in vitro translation product was mixed with 300 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) for immunoprecipitation using 2 μg of anti-Xpress tag antibody. Precipitates were washed twice with NETN buffer lacking protease inhibitors, followed by a final wash with 1× kinase buffer. The precipitated Chk2 immune complexes were used in the kinase assays. Chromatin Egress Assays—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and protease inhibitor mixture). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Cytosolic proteins (S2) were separated from nuclei by centrifugation for 5 min at 1300 × g. Nuclei were washed once with buffer A and then lysed by incubation for 30 min in buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Insoluble chromatin was separated from soluble nuclear proteins (S3) by centrifugation for 4 min at 1700 × g, washed once with buffer B, and collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 10,000 × g. The final chromatin pellet was resuspended in M-PER protein lysis buffer with brief sonication. The chromatin-associated proteins (P3) were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The protein concentration in each fraction was determined by the Bradford assay as described above. Purification of S-Chk2 and Mass Spectrometry Analysis— pTriEx4-Chk2 (coding for the fusion protein S-Chk2) was transfected into 293T cells, and three cellular fractions (cytoplasmic, nuclear soluble, and chromatin) were generated using the method described above for the chromatin egress assays. Chromatin-bound fractions were sonicated prior to performing S-Chk2 purification. S-Chk2 was purified from the lysates using the protocol recommended by Novagen. The S-Chk2 protein was purified on a standard 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were excised and cut into 1–2-mm cubes, washed three with 500 μl of ultrapure water, and incubated in 100% acetonitrile for 45 min. Samples were reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 45 min and then alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature. The material was dried in a SpeedVac, rehydrated in a 12.5 ng/μl modified sequencing-grade trypsin solution (Promega Corp.), and incubated in an ice bath for 40–45 min. The excess trypsin solution was then removed and replaced with 40–50 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 10% acetonitrile (pH 8.0), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Elastase digestions were performed as described for trypsin at an enzyme concentration of 15 ng/μl without acetonitrile in the reaction buffer. Peptides were extracted twice with 25 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid and dried in a SpeedVac. Digests were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer containing 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, and 3–6 μl was loaded onto a fused silica capillary column (12 cm × 0.075 mm) packed with 5-μm diameter C18 beads (The Nest Group, Inc., South-borough, MA) using an N2 pressure vessel at 1100 p.s.i. Peptides were eluted over 55 min by applying a 0–80% linear gradient of buffer containing 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid at a flow rate of 150 μl/min with a pre-column flow splitter, resulting in a final flow rate of ∼200 nl/min directly into the source. An LTQ™ linear ion trap (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) was run in an automated collection mode with an instrument method composed of a single segment and five data-dependent scan events with a full mass spectrometry scan followed by four tandem mass spectrometry scans of the highest intensity ions. The normalized collision energy was set at 35, and activation Q was 0.250 with minimum full scan signal intensity at 1 × 105 with no minimum tandem mass spectrometry intensity specified. Dynamic exclusion was turned on utilizing a 3-min repeat count of 2 with the mass width set at m/z 1.0. Sequence analysis was performed with TurboSEQUEST™ (ThermoFinnigan) and MASCOT (Matrix Sciences, London, UK) using an indexed human subset data base of the NCBI non-redundant protein data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). An additional data base containing only the cDNA sequence of the Chk2 protein was created and used for mapping specific phosphopeptides. Tax Expression Results in Binding to and Activation of Endogenous Chk2—We demonstrated previously that Tax interacts with Chk2 by co-immunoprecipitation (26Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37736-37744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This interaction was determined via immunoprecipitation following cotransfection of plasmids expressing both Tax and Chk2 and by co-immunoprecipitation following immunoprecipitation of endogenous Chk2. In the studies described herein, we used affinity purification of S-Tax using a system we recently described (35Durkin S.S. Ward M.D. Fryrear K.A. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31705-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, the affinity isolation of Tax protein from cells resulted in a multiprotein complex containing endogenous Chk2 as a component (Fig. 1A). This complex also contained a known Chk2-interacting protein, 53BP1. The presence of both proteins was determined by gel excision and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Neither of these proteins was associated with expression of S-GFP under conditions normalizing total protein. The presence of Chk2 in the Tax complex was also confirmed by Western analysis of the same fractions (Fig. 1B). We next examined the impact of Tax upon endogenous Chk2 and the Chk2 target protein p53. When total protein and total Chk2 were normalized, we observed an increase in the steady-state levels of Chk2 phosphorylated at Thr68 and p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 or Ser20 (Fig. 1C). Thus, Tax expression results in the accumulation of “activated” Chk2 that is coincident with phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20, both targets of Chk2 kinase. Tax Induces Chk2 Kinase Activity In Vitro—Autophosphorylation within the transition loop (T-loop) of the kinase domain is an essential early event in the formation of a kinase-active form of Chk2 (36Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37Schwarz J.K. Lovly C.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 598-609PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to directly investigate the effect of Tax on Chk2 autophosphorylation, we performed in vitro Chk2 kinase assays. An identical concentration of purified GST-Chk2 was incubated with nuclear lysates prepared from either Tax-expressing or non-Tax-expressing cells. In parallel experiments, Tax or control cell nuclear lysate was added at increasing amounts to the purified GST-Chk2 protein, and kinase assays were performed to assess autophosphorylation of Chk2. The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging. The incorporation of labeled ATP into the GST-Chk2 100-kDa band was measured. The data presented in Fig. 2A show that phosphorylation of Chk2 increased with the amount of nuclear lysate containing Tax. The increasing amount of control nuclear lysate reflected the background levels of Chk2 phosphorylation. In another approach, we attempted to more directly assess the ability of Tax to induce Chk2 autophosphorylation in the absence of potential confounding factors present in nuclear extracts. Specifically, we repeated the kinase assays using the rabbit reticulocyte system to generate Tax and Chk2 proteins. The synthesized proteins were mixed in equal amounts with bovine serum albumin added to normalize for total protein under Tax-positive and Tax-negative conditions. An equivalent amount of Chk2 was then immunoprecipitated, and Chk2 immune complexes were used to perform kinase assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Fig. 2B shows that the autophosphorylation activity of Chk2 increased in the presence of Tax protein. This result is consistent with a direct action of Tax on Chk2 activation. Tax Induces Chk2 Oligomerization and Phosphorylation—It has been reported that oligomerization is a critical factor in the stabilization and activation of Chk2 (38Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that Tax expression, which results in increased phosphorylation of Chk2, enhances the oligomerization and increased stability of Chk2 protein complexes. To test this hypothesis, we employed a reciprocal tagging approach using molecular probes with different affinities to demonstrate homodimerization of Chk2. Our fusion constructs consisted of HA-Chk2 and Xpress-Chk2. Oligomerization of the Chk2 proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with HA and immunoblotting of the precipitates with anti-Xpress antibody. We normalized for equal amounts of affinity-isolated HA-Chk2 so that the quantity of reciprocal Xpress-Chk2 was directly proportional to the amount of oligomeric Chk2. The normalization for precipitated HA-Chk2 is critical for evaluating an increase in the proportion of oligomeric Chk2. Using this oligomerization assay, we analyzed the effect of Tax upon oligomerization of Chk2. Cells were transfected with constructs coding for HA-Chk2 and Xpress-Chk2 in the presence or absence of Tax. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation targeting of the HA domain of the Chk2 fusion protein with anti-HA polyclonal antibody. The immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and reciprocally probed for Xpress-Chk2. The results from this experiment are presented in Fig. 3A. We observed an increase in Xpress-Chk2 in the presence of Tax protein reflective of the level of oligomeric Chk2. Thus, Tax expression results in autophosphorylation, oligomerization, and stabilization of Chk2. We next confirmed that the reciprocal tag system faithfully reproduced the Tax-induced increase in steady-state Chk2 protein levels. Whole cell lysates were prepared, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described. The blots were probed for Xpress-Chk2. Fig. 3B shows that coexpression of Ta"

HCMV infection also induces high cellular levels of p53, seemingly in contradiction to the observed cell cycle progression. This study was undertaken to examine the mechanism(s) of the increased p53 abundance. HCMV infection caused a 4-fold increase in p53 that preceded a substantial increase in p53 transcripts by more than 24 h. p53 was stabilized in HCMV-infected cells (from a half-life of less than 30 min to about 8 h) and was less sensitive to proteasome-mediated degradation. Ubiquitination of p53 in mock-infected LU cells was sensitive to inhibition by trans-4-iodo, 4′-boranyl-chalcone, consistent with HDM2-catalyzing ubiquitination of p53. In HCMV-infected cells, ubiquitination of p53 was essentially undetectable. Although HDM2 had a nuclear distribution in mock-infected LU cells, in HCMV-infected cells HDM2 was translocated to the cytoplasm beginning at 12 h and demonstrated decreased cellular abundance thereafter. HDM2 was stabilized in the HCMV-infected cells by MG132, indicating a shift from p53 to HDM2 ubiquitination. p53 demonstrated a predominantly nuclear distribution in HCMV-infected cells through 48 h, resulting in p53 and HDM2 in distinct subcellular compartments. The principal mechanism responsible for increased p53 stabilization was nuclear export and degradation of HDM2. Thus, HCMV uses a shift from p53 to HDM2 ubiquitination and destabilization to obtain protracted high levels of p53, while promoting cell cycle traverse.

Efficient replication of HCMV in stationary cells is dependent on the progression of infected cells through the cell cycle to a point at or near the G1/S boundary (3Albrecht T. Boldogh I. Fons M.

Virology. 1996; 224: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Consistent with this requirement, HCMV infection stimulates potent mitogenic signaling in infected cells, with some evidence suggesting that HCMV mitogenic signaling is more robust than that of serum growth factors, because HCMV, but not serum growth factors, induces the entry of density-arrested cells into the cell cycle. Among the immediate early and early signaling events induced by HCMV are hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (5Valyi-Nagy T. Bandi Z. Boldogh I. Albrecht T. Arch.

Some of this signaling derives from HCMV binding to its cellular receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor (11Wang X. Huong S.M. Chiu M.L. Raab-Traub N. Huang E.S. Nature. 2003; 424: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and integrin αvβ3 (12Wang X. Huang D.Y. Huong S.M. Huang E.S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)), but HCMV infection also modifies the cell with induction of cellular (e.g. activation of m- and μ-calpains (13Chen Z. Knutson E. Kurosky A. Albrecht T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) and viral (e.g. cellular transcriptional activation by IE2-86 (14Bresnahan W.A. Albrecht T. Thompson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22075-22082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) activities that contribute to cell cycle entry and progression. These signaling events are related to substantially modified cellular transcription patterns (15Zhu H. Cong J.P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), including up-regulation of cyclin E (14Bresnahan W.A. Albrecht T. Thompson E.A. J. Biol.

In addition, HCMV infection stimulates the translocation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (16Bresnahan W.A. Thompson E.A. Albrecht T. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the degradation of p21Cip1 (p21 cyclin-dependent kinase-interacting protein 1) mediated by the ubiquitous calpains (13Chen Z. Knutson E. Kurosky A. Albrecht T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, HCMV uses cellular signaling pathways to drive infected cells into the cell cycle, providing this large DNA virus with the opportunity to replicate in the post-mitotic cells that are its cellular substrate in vivo (3Albrecht T.

In HCMV-infected cells stimulated to enter the cell cycle and progress through G1, the level of p53 has been reported to rise substantially (17Muganda P. Mendoza O. Hernandez J. Qian Q. J.

Expression of either of the prominent HCMV immediate early proteins (IE1-72 and IE2-86) results in increased p53 levels in transfected fibroblasts (20Castillo J.P. Kowalik T.F. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (21Wang J. Marker P.H. Belcher J.D. Wilcken D.E. Burns L.J. Vercellotti G.M. Wang X.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that HCMV-induced alterations in p53 are related to the pathogenesis of HCMV disease (22Collot-Teixeira S. Bass J. Denis F. Ranger-Rogez S. Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; 14: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Increased levels of p53 were observed in smooth muscle cells associated with restenosis (60Speir E. Modali R. Huang E.S. Leon M.B. Shawl F. Finkel T. Epstein S.E. Science. 1994; 265: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), and a correlation was reported between the presence of HCMV DNA and detection of p53 by immunohistochemistry (23Speir E. Huang E.S. Modali R. Leon M.B. Shawl F. Finkel T. Epstein S.E. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1995; 99: 78-81PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when other forms of HCMV infection were examined (24Rimsza L.M. Vela E.E. Frutiger Y.M. Richter L.C. Grogan T.M. Bellamy W.T. Mol. Diagn. 1996; 1: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which HCMV infection modifies the cellular levels of p53 is unknown, as is how the increased levels of p53 relate to cell cycle entry and progression or other cellular modifications required for HCMV replication. p53 is one of the pivotal molecules at which stress signal pathways converge, and its cellular abundance and activity are highly responsive to cellular stress (25Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar, 26Royds J.A. Iacopetta B.

The steady-state level of p53 protein depends on the balance between its synthesis and degradation. p53 protein is unstable in unstressed cells, with a half-life as short as 20 min (28Levine A.J. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1989; 20: 221-230PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, p53 is maintained at a low level in the absence of stress. As a result of its constitutive synthesis, increased levels of p53 in stressed cells largely depend on inhibition of its degradation (29Yang Y. Li C.C. Weissman A.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2096-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). HDM2/MDM2 is a major negative regulator of p53, which binds to p53 within the N-terminal transactivation domain (29Yang Y. Li C.C. Weissman A.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2096-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell.

Upon binding, the E3 ligase activity of HDM2 catalyzes p53 ubiquitination, which leads to the proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. The subcellular localization of p53 and HDM2 is important in the control of p53 function and stability. Degradation of p53 occurs mainly in the cytoplasm (34Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), after export from the nucleus following HDM2/p300-mediated p53 ubiquitination (35Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Kung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This investigation was undertaken to gain some insight into the effect of HCMV infection on the mechanisms regulating p53 abundance and to determine whether alterations in these pathways were related to HCMV-induced effects on cell cycle regulation. The results of this study indicate that ubiquitination of p53 is inhibited during HCMV infection, stabilizing p53. Stabilization of p53 was mostly the result of sequestering and degrading HDM2, resulting in a substantial and sustained increase in p53 protein. Thus, HCMV infection uses cellular mechanisms for accruing and preserving high cellular levels of p53 in association with HCMV-induced cell cycle entry and progression, when p53 would otherwise be marked for degradation by HDM2-catalyzed ubiquitination. Moreover, because it has been suggested that HDM2 is required for the G1/S transition (36Deb S.P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 1009-1016PubMed Google Scholar), the sequestration of HDM2 from the nucleoplasm and reduced cellular levels may be involved in preventing entry of infected cells into S phase, providing HCMV with uncompeted access to DNA precursors for its own replication. Cell Culture and Growth Arrest—Human diploid lung (LU) fibroblasts (37Albrecht T. Weller T.H. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1980; 73: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), passage 6–20, were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY) and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (growth medium) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 in air atmosphere. The cells were density-arrested as described previously (4Bresnahan W.A. Boldogh I. Thompson E.A. Albrecht T. Virology. 1996; 224: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Virus Stocks and Productive Infection—The AD169 strain of HCMV was propagated in LU cells as described previously (38Albrecht T. Li M.L. Cole N. Downing E. Funk F.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1980; 51: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The infectivity of virus stocks was determined by plaque assay (37Albrecht T. Weller T.H. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1980; 73: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Virus stocks typically had infectivities between 8.0 × 106 and 4.0 × 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. LU cells were infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of 5 PFU/cell to provide a uniform infection, as described in detail previously (38Albrecht T. Li M.L. Cole N. Downing E. Funk F.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1980; 51: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and re-fed with reserved growth medium (4Bresnahan W.A. Boldogh I. Thompson E.A. Albrecht T. Virology. 1996; 224: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Virus stocks and cell cultures were routinely examined for mycoplasma and were free from detectable contamination. Northern Hybridization—Northern hybridization was performed as described in our previous report (13Chen Z. Knutson E. Kurosky A. Albrecht T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Total cellular RNA (10 μg/lane) was evaluated under denaturing conditions in formaldehyde-agarose gels, containing 1% agarose, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm sodium acetate, and 2.2 m formaldehyde. After separation, the RNA was transferred to MSI nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA) for 18 h. The RNA was prehybridized in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences), containing 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 1 h. A 32P-labeled DNA probe was prepared from the plasmid pC-w53ASN (generously provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein), which harbors a p53 insert. A probe derived from the plasmid p5B (39Bowman L.H. Rabin B. Schlessinger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4951-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which contains the cDNA for 18 S rRNA, was used to ensure uniform loading of gels. Plasmids were introduced into competent DH5α Escherichia coli cells, and amplified DNA fragments comprising p53 and 18 S cDNA were excised from isolated plasmid DNA using the restriction endonucleases BamHI and BamHI-EcoRI, respectively. The probes were labeled using the multiprimer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). 32P-Labeled p53 or 18 S probe was added and hybridized for 3 h at 65 °C. Membranes were washed twice with 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C, once with 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, and twice with 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The probe remaining on the filter was detected by autoradiography (Eastman Kodak Omat film for 1–16 h at –80 °C). Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was performed as described in our previous report (13Chen Z. Knutson E. Kurosky A. Albrecht T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by dislodging the cells with a cell lifter in phosphate-buffered saline, collected by sedimentation, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO3, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamide, and 25 μg/ml pepstatin A) added just before use). Cellular debris was removed by sedimentation, and the supernatant fluids were reserved. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Whole cell extracts (40 μg/lane) were fractionated on 4–12% NuPAGE™ (1.0 mm × 10 wells, NP0321; Invitrogen) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Monoclonal antibody specific for p53 (DO-1, sc-126) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal antibody preparation specific for p300 (C-20, sc-585X) was also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody specific for HDM2 (2A9C1.18; target amino acids 153–222) was the gift of Dr. J. Chen (40Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J.

A second monoclonal antibody (Ab3; clone 4B11, target amino acids 383–491) specific for HDM2 was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (La Jolla, CA), and a polyclonal antibody preparation (C18, sc-812), which targets the C terminus of HDM2, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antigen-antibody reactions were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescent assay (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The Western blots were exposed to Biomax XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). After acquiring images of the ECL assay, the membranes were stripped and re-probed with antibody to m-calpain. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against m-calpain was kindly supplied by Dr. R. L. Mellgren (41Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). m-Calpain was used as a loading standard because it has a slow turnover rate with a half-life of about 1 week (41Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and its stability has been confirmed in extensive studies in LU cells (13Chen Z. Knutson E. Kurosky A. Albrecht T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—LU cells were grown on glass coverslips and density-arrested as described previously (16Bresnahan W.A. Thompson E.A. Albrecht T. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Coverslip cultures were infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of 5 PFU/cell. At the time of harvest, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, air-dried, and fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) at –20 °C for 10 min. The subcellular distribution of specific proteins was identified with antibody preparations specific for p53 (DO-1), HDM2 (2A9C1), p300 (C-20), or HCMV IE2-86 (ESH-IE2–84), and either fluorescein- or Alexa Fluor 546-labeled secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse IgG (F(ab′)2 fragment), AQ160F; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA; goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) [F(ab′)2 fragment)); Pierce; goat antimouse IgG (H + L) (F(ab′)2 fragment); A-11018; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody to HCMV IE2-86 was generously provided by Dr. E.-S. Huang. Fluorescence was localized with a Zeiss LSM 510 UV META microscope equipped with 40/1.2 and 63/1.2 C-planapochromat water immersion objectives. Images were captured as MDB files and analyzed using the Zeiss LSM software (version 3.2). Measurement of p53 Half-life—Density-arrested LU cells were HCMV- or mock-infected, and at selected times thereafter, protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide. At selected times after the cycloheximide block, HCMV- and mock-infected cell cultures were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared as described above. The polypeptides were separated by PAGE and evaluated by Western blot analysis for p53. The abundance of p53 was determined by densitometry (with normalization to the loading controls), and the p53 abundance at each harvest time was plotted relative to the time of harvest after initiating the cycloheximide block. The GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego) was used to calculate the half-life of p53 under the various treatment conditions. Image Processing and Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least twice, and either data from a representative experiment or means of data from two or more experiments were selected for presentation. Cell cultures (2 or more 100-mm dishes/datum point) were harvested at times selected to represent the major phases of HCMV replication as follows: 0–6 h, immediate early; 12–24 h, early; and 48–96 h, late. Chemiluminescent samples were exposed for intervals that ensured a linear response, as determined by standardization. All radiographic films were analyzed using an AlphaImager 2000 Documentation and Analysis System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) and the manufacturer's software (AlphaImager 2000, version 4.0). The images were quantified and recorded as tagged image format files (TIFF). The TIFF files were used to prepare the graphic images illustrated in this report. The image densitometric quantification data were expressed as mean ± S.D. The Origin computer program (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) was used for the statistical evaluation of the results and plotting of the data. Statistical significance was determined by independent t tests corrected for the number of comparisons. The twosided probability level of 0.05 was used as the criterion for significance. Chemicals—MG132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal) was purchased from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). trans-4-Iodo, 4′-boranyl-chalcone (TIBC) was obtained from EMD Biosciences (San Diego). Penicillin, streptomycin, cycloheximide, diethyl pyrocarbonate, Tris, Igepal CA-630, NaCl, NaVO3, NaF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, benzamide, and pepstatin A were purchased from Sigma. Increased Abundance of p53 Protein in HCMV-initiated Cells—Western blot analysis of protein extracts of mock-infected, density-arrested, LU cells revealed a relatively constant amount of p53 through 96 h (Fig. 1A). In parallel cultures of HCMV-infected cells, p53 levels began to increase by 3 h post-infection (PI) and continued to increase through 24 h, when the abundance of p53 started to plateau. From 24 to 72 h PI, the abundance of p53 in HCMV-infected cells was about 4-fold greater than that observed in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1C). By 96 h, the cellular level of p53 had declined somewhat. The levels of p53 in HCMV-infected cells were significantly (p < 0.01) greater than those observed in mock-infected cells from 6 to 96 h PI. p53 Transcription during Productive HCMV Infection—To evaluate if the elevation of p53 protein was temporally correlated with an increase in p53 transcription, LU cells were HCMV- or mock-infected, and total cellular RNA was evaluated by Northern blot hybridization. The results revealed that p53 transcripts increased in a bi-phasic manner in HCMV-infected cells (Fig. 1B). The first increase, observed at 3 h PI, although modest and not significantly different from the abundance of p53 transcripts in mock-infected cells, was consistently obtained. The p53 RNA levels dropped to near base line by 6 h and remained at a low level through 12 h. p53 RNA levels increased significantly between 24 and 48 h PI and remained at significantly elevated levels through 72 h PI (p < 0.05). The second increase in p53 RNA was much more robust than the first with nearly a 4-fold increase compared with a less than 1.6-fold increase at 3 h PI (Fig. 1D). The results illustrated in Fig. 1 failed to show a close temporal correlation between p53 RNA and protein levels, in that the increase in p53 protein preceded the major increase in p53 RNA by more than 24 h. These results suggest that mechanisms other than transcriptional regulation were involved in the p53 protein increase observed in HCMV-infected cells, particularly at early times. p53 Protein Is Stabilized in HCMV-infected LU Cells—The effect of HCMV infection on p53 stability was monitored by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide and following the decay of p53 by Western blot analysis beginning at 12 and 48 h PI. These two intervals were chosen because of the contrasting findings for the relative abundance of p53 protein and RNA (Fig. 1) at these times (12 h PI; high protein, low RNA: 48 h PI; high protein, high RNA). Analysis of p53 protein decay (Fig. 2) demonstrated that p53 protein was stabilized in HCMV-infected cells, even when monitored from 48 to 72 h PI (Fig. 2B) when there were abundant p53 transcripts (Fig. 1B). Decay of p53 in mock-infected cells at 12–36 h (Fig. 2A) or 48–72 h (Fig. 2B) demonstrated a biphasic pattern, with substantially more rapid decay evident in the first component of the decay curves than the second. The half-life of p53 was less than 0.5 h in mock-infected cells evaluated at either time, which is consistent with previous results (28Levine A.J. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1989; 20: 221-230PubMed Google Scholar). In the HCMV-infected cells evaluated from 12 to 36 or from 48 to 72 h PI (Fig. 2), p53 protein stability was increased significantly (p < 0.05). Only a single component was evident in the decay curves for p53 in HCMV-infected cells at either of the intervals monitored. The slope of the p53 protein decay curve in HCMV-infected cells was similar to the slope of the slower component of the p53 decay curves in mock-infected LU cells. The half-life of p53 protein in HCMV-infected cells was about 7.6 h, when monitored from 12 to 36 h PI, and about 8.4 h when measured from 48 to 72 h PI. These results suggest that the initial component in the p53 decay curves in mock-infected cells, which depicts the rapid degradation of p53, was compromised by HCMV infection. Proteasome-mediated Degradation of p53 in LU Cells—The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is the principal degradative mechanism through which p53 levels are regulated in unstressed cells (29Yang Y. Li C.C. Weissman A.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2096-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Inhibition of degradation by MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome-mediated proteolysis (42Saito Y. Tsubuki S. Ito H. Kawashima S. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 120: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), beginning at 12 (Fig. 3A) or 48 h PI (Fig. 3B), significantly (p < 0.05) increased the half-life of p53 in mock-infected cells from less than 0.5 h to about 8 h (Fig. 3C) or to more than 24 h (Fig. 3D), respectively. MG132 had no significant effect on the half-life of p53 in HCMV-infected cells evaluated from 12 to 36 h PI (Fig. 2A), suggesting that proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 was inhibited in HCMV-infected cells at this t"
https://openalex.org/W2011565990,"The penta-EF hand protein sorcin participates in the modulation of Ca2+-induced calcium-release in the heart through the interaction with several Ca2+ channels such as the ryanodine receptor. The modulating activity is impaired in the recently described natural F112L mutant. The F112 residue is located at the end of the D helix next to Asp113, one of the calcium ligands in the EF3 hand endowed with the highest affinity for the metal. The F112L-sorcin X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution displays marked alterations in the EF3 hand, where the hydrogen bonding network established by Phe112 is disrupted, and in the EF1 region, which is tilted in both monomers that give rise to the dimer, the stable form of the molecule. In turn, the observed tilt is indicative of an increased flexibility of the N-terminal part of the molecule. The structural alterations result in a 6-fold decrease in calcium affinity with respect to the wild-type protein and to an even larger impairment of the interaction with annexin VII and of the ability of sorcin to interact with and inhibit ryanodine receptors. These results provide a plausible structural and functional framework that helps elucidate the phenotypic alterations of mice overexpressing F112L-sorcin."
https://openalex.org/W2026534287,"The phagocyte oxidase (Phox) protein p40phox contains a Phox homology (PX) domain which, when expressed alone, interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns (3)P). The functions of the PX domain in p40phox localization, association with the cytoskeleton, and superoxide production were examined in transgenic COS-7 cells expressing gp91phox, p22phox, p67phox, and p47phox (COSphox cells). Full-length p40phox exhibited a cytoplasmic localization pattern in resting cells. Upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or fMet-Leu-Phe, p40phox translocated to plasma membrane in a p67phox- and p47phox-dependent manner. Heterologous expression of p40phox markedly enhanced superoxide production in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate - and fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated COSphox cells. Unexpectedly, mutation of Arg-57 in the PX domain to Gln, which abrogated PtdIns (3)P binding, produced a dominant inhibitory effect on agonist-induced superoxide production and membrane translocation of p47phox and p67phox. The mutant p40phox (p40R57Q) displayed increased association with actin and moesin and was found enriched in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction along with p67phox and p47phox. The enhanced cytoskeleton association of p67phox and p47phox and the dominant inhibitory effect produced by the p40R57Q were alleviated when a second mutation at Asp-289, which eliminated p40phox interaction with p67phox, was introduced. Likewise, cytochalasin B treatment abolished the dominant inhibitory effect of p40R57Q on superoxide production. These findings suggest a dual regulatory mechanism through the PX domain of p40phox; its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton may stabilize NADPH oxidase in resting cells, and its binding of PtdIns (3)P potentiates superoxide production upon agonist stimulation. Both functions require the association of p40phox with p67phox.

Initially named for their presence in the two cytosolic factors of NADPH oxidase, p47phox and p40phox (1Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), PX domains have been identified in more than 150 eukaryotic proteins including the sorting nexins (SNX1-15), vacuolar sorting and morphogenesis proteins (Vam7p, Vps5p, and Vps17p), yeast bud-emergence proteins (Bem1p and Bem3p), and phospholipase D2 (2Sato T.K.

J. 2001; 360: 513-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The PX domains from these proteins interact with a variety of phosphoinositides. Published studies have shown that the PX domain in p40phox binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns (3)P), and the PX domain in p47phox preferentially interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3,4-phosphates (4Kanai F.

In studies using a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused PX domain of p40phox, membrane localization was observed in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner (4Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J.

Structural analysis of the PX domain of p40phox reveals a positively charged binding pocket for the negatively charged PtdIns (3)P. Binding of p40phox to the phosphoinositide requires three conserved arginine residues (Arg-57, Arg-58, and Arg-105) that stabilize a critical lipid binding loop within the PX domain (8Bravo J.

Mutation of any one of the three arginines can cause a significant reduction in binding of PtdIns (3)P (4Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat.

Studies have been conducted for the function of p40phox in NADPH oxidase activation since its initial discovery as a p67phox-associated protein (9Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Someya A. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Tsunawaki S.

These studies have resulted in different and sometimes conflicting observations. Evidence supporting a positive regulatory role of p40phox came from studies using both cell-free reconstitution and whole-cell assays. The possible mechanisms for p40phox-mediated potentiation of NADPH oxidase include increasing the affinity of p47phox for flavocytochrome b558 (12Cross A.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 113-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binding to membrane-associated PtdIns (3)P through its PX domain (5Ellson C.D. Gobert-Gosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Other investigators, using essentially the same cells and cell-free reconstitution assays, found p40phox to be a negative regulator for NADPH oxidase. The negative regulatory mechanisms include SH3 domain-mediated interference of p40phox association with other cytosolic factors (14Sathyamoorthy M. de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9141-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and inhibition of p67phox membrane translocation (15Vergnaud S. Paclet M.H. El Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). More recent studies have examined the roles of p40phox in NADPH oxidase activation using transfected cells and mouse models. Suh et al. (16Suh C.I. Stull N.D. Li X.J. Tian W. Price M.O. Grinstein S. Yaffe M.B. Atkinson S. Dinauer M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported that p40phox is required for FcγR receptor-mediated superoxide generation after phagocytosis, a function that was lost when critical residues for PtdIns (3)P binding were mutated. Ellson et al. (17Ellson C.D. Davidson K. Ferguson G.J. O'Connor R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) found that neutrophils from p40phox knock-out mice displayed defective oxidant production in response to several types of stimuli. Moreover, replacement of the mouse p40phox gene with one that contains a Arg-58 to Ala mutation caused embryonic lethality in homozygous offspring, with the heterozygous mice displaying compromised ability to kill Staphylococcus aureus (18Ellson C. Davidson K. Anderson K. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4468-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate a physiological function of p40phox in regulating NADPH oxidase activation that involves its PX domain. Despite recent progress in p40phox research, the function of p40phox in resting cells remains undefined. p40phox was originally discovered as a p67phox-associated protein (9Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In unprimed neutrophils, p40phox forms a complex with p67phox, whereas p47phox was not a part of the complex (19Brown G.E. Stewart M.Q. Liu H. Ha V.L. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients who lack p67phox contain very little p40phox (11Tsunawaki S. Mizunari H. Nagata M. Tatsuzawa O. Kuratsuji T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Vergnaud S. Paclet M.H. El Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that interaction between the two cytosolic factors helps to stabilize their structures. Moreover, p40phox, like the other cytosolic factors, associates with the actin cytoskeleton in resting neutrophils and with membrane skeleton in activated neutrophils (20El Benna J. Dang P.M. Andrieu V. Vergnaud S. Dewas C. Cachia O. Fay M. Morel F. Chollet-Martin S. Hakim J. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One of the proteins that helps to mediate protein association with the actin cytoskeleton is moesin, which interacts with the PX domain of p40phox (21Wientjes F.B. Reeves E.P. Soskic V. Furthmayr H. Segal A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we speculate that the PX domain in p40phox may have dual regulatory functions through its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and with PtdIns (3)P. In the current study, we employed a COS-7-based whole-cell reconstitution system (22Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to examine the effects of a full-length p40phox and a PX domain mutant on NADPH oxidase activity. We observed that expression of the wild type p40phox could enhance superoxide generation in response to both PMA and fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF), a finding consistent with recent publications suggesting that p40phox enhances NADPH oxidase activation (16Suh C.I. Stull N.D. Li X.J. Tian W. Price M.O. Grinstein S. Yaffe M.B. Atkinson S. Dinauer M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Ellson C.D. Davidson K.

Surprisingly, an Arg to Gln mutation at position 57 (R57Q), which abolishes p40phox interaction with PtdIns (3)P through its PX domain (4Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), switched p40phox to a different mode of action. It not only abrogated the potentiation effect but also produced a dominant inhibitory effect on superoxide generation. We found an increased association of p40R57Q with actin and moesin compared with the wild type p40phox. In cells expressing p40R57Q, more cytosolic factors were targeted to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction than in cells expressing the wild type p40phox. The dominant inhibitory effect of p40R57Q was eliminated when the cells were treated with cytochalasin B, which prevents actin polymerization, or when the association of p40phox with p67phox was eliminated. These intriguing findings suggest that p40phox can positively and negatively regulate NADPH oxidase through its PX domain interaction with PtdIns (3)P and with the actin cytoskeleton. Materials—PMA, fMLF, isoluminol, cytochalasin B, anti-moesin, and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Roche Applied Science. The anti-p67phox (against amino acids 317-469) and early endosome antigen 1 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-actin and anti-p22phox polyclonal antibodies (against amino acids 1-195) were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-p40phox (against a C-terminal 6-histidine-tagged full-length human p40phox) and anti-p47phox (against a glutathione S-transferasefused full-length human p47phox) polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Plasmid Constructs—Preparation and characterization of the expression constructs of formyl peptide receptor (FPR), protein kinase Cδ and p40phox were described in a previous publication (23He R. Nanamori M. Sang H. Yin H. Dinauer M.C. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA encoding the human p40phox was subcloned in-frame with GFP in pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to produce a p40phox protein fused to the N terminus of GFP. Point mutations of p40phox were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotide primers used for the PCR-based mutagenesis were 5′-GTACCTCATCTACCAACGCTACCGCCAGTTC-3′ and its reverse and complementary sequence for the R57Q mutant and 5′-CTGAATTACCGGGCCGCTGAGGGGGATC-3′ and its reverse and complement primer for the D289A mutant. Both primer pairs were used for construction of the double mutant p40R57Q/D289A. All DNA constructs were verified by automated sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—The transgenic COSphox and COS91/22 cells were generated as described previously (22Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). COS91/22 expresses gp91phox and p22phox. Subsequent transfection resulted in COSphox, which expresses p67phox and p47phox in addition to gp91phox and p22phox (22Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The stable cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics for proper selection (22Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 90-mm (diameter) tissue culture dishes (0.5-1 × 106 cells per dish) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 6.5 μg of DNA was used in each transfection. Transient transfection efficiency of 45-50% was routinely obtained based the expression of a co-transfected GFP construct using flow cytometry. The human myelomonoblastic cell line PLB-985 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were grown in suspension at a density between 2 × 105/ml and 1 × 106/ml. Cell line Nucleofector Kit V (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) was used for transient transfection of 3 × 106 PLB-985 cells with 5 μg of DNA using Program C-023. Transfection efficiency was ∼30% as determined by flow cytometry based on the fluorescence of a co-expressed green fluorescent protein. Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activity—Superoxide produced by COSphox and PBL-985 cells was determined using an isoluminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, as previously described (23He R. Nanamori M. Sang H. Yin H. Dinauer M.C. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Oxidant production was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (250 units) as reported previously (23He R. Nanamori M. Sang H. Yin H. Dinauer M.C. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained horseradish peroxidase (see below) to offset the possible effect of myeloperoxidase. Briefly, COSphox cells were harvested with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Both COSphox and PLB-985 cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 1-3 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were incubated in the dark with 100 μm isoluminol and 40 units/ml horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 10 min, and 200-μl aliquots were transferred into 6-mm diameter wells of a 96-well, flat-bottom, white tissue culture plate (E&K Scientific, Campbell, CA). Chemiluminescence (CL) was measured at 37 °C in a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The CL CPS were continually recorded at 1-min intervals for 5-15 min before and 20-40 min after stimulation with PMA (200 ng/ml) or fMLF (1 μm). The relative amount of superoxide produced was calculated based on the integrated CL during the first 20 min after agonist stimulation. Western Blotting—Protein samples were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS/T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at RT.The blots were washed with TBS/T and incubated with primary antibodies (0.2-1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) or anti-mouse (Calbiochem) peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added to the membranes at a dilution ratio of 1:3000, and incubation was continued to for 1 h at RT.The protein bands on the membrane were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem). For immunoprecipitation with moesin and actin, a buffer containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture set I was used instead. The cell lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein content in the cell lysate was measured using a DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and standardized before immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose was added to the samples for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then once in PBS. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Fractionation—Cell fractionation was performed as described (25Zhan Y. He D. Newburger P.E. Zhou G.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with a modification in buffer composition. Briefly, 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 20 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to separate Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The insoluble fraction was dissolved in 500 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Membrane Translocation Assay—Twenty-four hours after transfection, COSphox or COS91/22 cells were stimulated with or without agonists. Cells (1 × 107/sample) were lysed with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:50 dilution of Protease inhibitor mixture set I). The lysate was then subjected to 3 cycles of freeze/thaw in liquid nitrogen and at 37 °C. Samples were then centrifuged, and the pellets were washed twice in the hypotonic buffer and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The samples were mixed for 30 min at 4 °C to dissociate membrane-bound proteins and then spun down at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant were collected as the Triton-soluble membrane fraction. The proteins in the sample were detected by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed using indirect immunofluorescence. Six hours after transfection, cells were seeded on glass coverslips pre-coated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and grown for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were stimulated with or without PMA (200 ng/ml) for 5 min, washed 3 times in PBS, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed 3 more times in PBS at RT and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at RT. Coverslips were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at RT. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Anti-p47phox and anti-p67phox were used at 2 μg/ml each. After washing 5 times with PBST (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) at RT, cells were incubated with rhodamine red-X-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (secondary antibody; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1.5 μg/ml for 1 h at RT. After additional washes with PBST and H2O, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using the ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with heliumneon, argon, and krypton laser sources. Statistic Analysis—Data were analyzed by paired Student's t test using the PRISM software (Version 4.0, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Localization of the Full-length p40phox in Transfected Cells—The PX domain of p40phox is thought to preferentially bind PtdIns (3)P for its membrane targeting (4Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H.

In this study we examined the full-length p40phox for its intracellular localization and redistribution before and after agonist stimulation. A full-length p40phox fused to GFP (p40phox-GFP) was transfected into COSphox cells, a stable cell line of COS-7 that expresses gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox but lacks p40phox (22Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Imaging analysis of the transfected COSphox cells (Fig. 1, A-F) revealed cytoplasmic localization of the GFP fluorescence in resting state (Fig. 1, A and C). Slightly more intense fluorescence was observed in the perinuclear region and in membrane ruffles. In comparison, an antibody against early endosome antigen 1 (EEA-1) stained punctate structures in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B). There were very few punctate structures with both green (p40phox-GFP) and red (anti-early endosome antigen 1) fluorescence (Fig. 1C). Upon stimulation with PMA (Fig. 1, D-F) or fMLF (data not shown), there was a marked increase in plasma membrane-associated green fluorescence (Fig. 1, D and F). PMA stimulation did not increase or decrease double-stained fluorescence in the periphery of the cells (Fig. 1F), indicating the absence of fusion between early endosome and the plasma membrane. To determine whether agonist-induced membrane translocation of p40phox requires p67phox and p47phox, p40phox-GFP was expressed in COS91/22 cells, a stable cell line of COS-7 expressing gp91phox and p22phox but not p67phox and p47phox (22Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, G-L, the GFP fluorescence remained cytoplasmic in the resting state (G and I) as well as following PMA stimulation (J and L). This result suggests that p40phox membrane translocation requires the presence of p67phox and p47phox, which is consistent with the notion that p40phox translocates to plasma membrane in a complex with p67phox and p47phox. A recent study conducted by Ueyama et al. (28Ueyama T. Tatsuno T. Kawasaki T. Tsujibe S. Shirai Y. Sumimoto H. Leto T.L. Saito N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) showed that in the RAW267.4 macrophage cell line, which contains very low level of endogenous p67phox, PMA and fMLF was unable to induce membrane transloc"

U-deletion editing involves endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the editing site followed by U-specific 3′–5′-exonucleolytic removal of nonbase-paired Us prior to ligation of the two mRNA cleavage fragments. We showed previously that an exonuclease/endonuclease/phosphatase (EEP) motif protein from Leishmania major, designated RNA editing exonuclease 1 (REX1) (Kang, X., Rogers, K., Gao, G., Falick, A. M., Zhou, S.-L., and Simpson, L. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 1017–1022), exhibits 3′–5′-exonuclease activity. Two EEP motif proteins have also been identified in the Trypanosoma brucei editing complex. TbREX1 is a homologue of LmREX1, and TbREX2 shows homology to another editing protein in L. major, which lacks the EEP motif (LmREX2*). Here we have expressed the T. brucei EEP motif proteins in insect cells and purified them to homogeneity. We showed that these are U-specific 3′–5′-exonucleases that are inhibited by base pairing of 3′ Us. The recombinant EEP motif alone also showed 3′–5′ U-specific exonuclease activity, and mutations of the REX EEP motifs greatly reduced exonuclease activity. The absence of enzymatic activity in LmREX2* was confirmed with a purified recombinant protein. We showed that pre-cleaved U-deletion editing could be reconstituted with either TbREX1 or TbREX2 in combination with either RNA ligase, LmREL1, or LmREL2. Down-regulation of TbREX2 expression by conditional RNA interference had little effect on parasite viability or sedimentation of the L-complex, suggesting either that TbREX2 is inactive in vivo or that TbREX1 can compensate for the loss of TbREX2 function in down-regulated cells.

The majority of mitochondrial pre-mRNAs in kinetoplastid protists are edited through the insertion and deletion of uridylate residues (Us). 3The abbreviations used are:Usuridylate residuesREXRNA editing exonucleaseENRNA editing endonucleaseREELRNA editing RNA ligaseRETRNA editing terminal uridylyltransferaseEEPexonuclease/endonuclease/phosphatase motifTAPtandem affinity purificationgRNAguide RNAcbpcalmodulin-binding peptideTEVtobacco etch virusRNAiRNA interferencedsRNAdouble-stranded RNArrecombinant. The editing process is directed by guide RNAs (gRNAs) that initially anneal to the pre-edited mRNA at the first downstream editing site via a region of complementarity termed the “anchor sequence.” An editing cycle involves an enzyme cascade (2Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) initiated by specific RNA editing endonucleases (REN), one of which (REN1) cleaves the mRNA immediately 5′ to the mRNA/gRNA duplex at U-deletion sites and the other (REN2) cleaves at U-insertion sites (3Trotter J.R.

The upstream gRNA sequence directs the modification of the 3′ end of the 5′ mRNA fragment by either the insertion of complementary Us by an RNA editing terminal uridylyltransferase (RET2) or by the removal of nonbase-paired Us by an RNA editing exonuclease (REX). Ligation of the mRNA fragments by an RNA editing ligase (REL) terminates the single site editing cycle. Editing then proceeds to the adjacent upstream site until all sites mediated by the single gRNA are edited resulting in an edited mRNA/gRNA duplex. Multiple overlapping gRNAs are required for extensive editing (pan-editing). Editing is catalyzed by a ribonucleoprotein complex (editosome) consisting of the RNA ligase-containing complex (L-complex) together with several additional complexes involved with RNA binding and 3′ U addition to the gRNAs linked by bound RNA (6Aphasizhev R.

TbREX2 is a component of the REL1 subcomplex of the L-complex that is competent for “pre-cleaved” deletion editing in vitro (18Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the Leishmania orthologue of TbREX2 lacks an EEP domain, suggesting an absence of exonuclease activity, and we have named the Leishmania orthologue REX2*. Here we further investigate the kinetoplastid REX proteins by purification and enzymatic characterization of recombinant REX proteins from T. brucei, and we demonstrate for the first time a difference in enzymatic content of the Leishmania and Trypanosoma L-complexes. Cloning of REX Proteins into Baculovirus Expression Vectors— TbREX1, TbREX2, and LmREX2* were amplified from T. brucei and L. major genomic DNA using the respective primer pairs 5′-GGATCCAAGCTTATGGCATTGGCTCAGTCATG-3′, 5′-AAGCTTCTATCTAGAAAGGGCACCAATAATCTGAACTTCCG-3′;5′-GGATCCAAGCTTATGTTGCGCCGCAGTCGCTT-3′,5′-AAGCTTCTATCTAGAAACCACCTGAAACTCAACAAGGAGACCG-3′; and 5′-CGGGATCCATGTACGGCGTGACAC-3′,5′-AAGCTTTCTAGAGCCGGGCATGCCACT-3′ and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Restriction sites are indicated in boldface type. Genes were released with BamHI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding sites of a modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) containing C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) (calmodulin-binding peptide (cbp), TEV protease site, protein A) epitope tags to generate pFastBac1-LmREX2*-TAP, pFast-Bac1-TbREX1-TAP, and pFastBac1-TbREX2-TAP vectors (9Gao G.

Double amino acid mutations were made in the TbREX1 and TbREX2 EEP domains using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-GCATATTTGTTCCCATCCGCTAACTACGGCGTAAGTATA-3′ and 5′-GAGTATTTGTACCCGTCTGCCAATTTCGGTCTCCTTGTTG-3′ (mutations indicated in boldface) to generate the plasmids pFastBac1-TbREX1(D881A,H882N)-TAP and pFast-Bac1-TbREX2(D896A,H897N)-TAP respectively. Expression and Purification of LmREX2*, TbREX1, and TbREX2—TAP-tagged LmREX2*, TbREX1, TbREX1(D881A, H882N), TbREX2, and TbREX2(D896A,H897N) were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pFastBac1 fusion protein constructs for transposition into Bacmid shuttle vectors. Sf9 cells were maintained in Sf900II (Invitrogen) or CCM3 media (HyClone) and were transfected with shuttle vector DNA using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) to generate recombinant baculovirus stocks. Sf9 cultures at 1 × 106 cells/ml were infected with recombinant baculovirus for 48 h. Optimal virus titer used to initiate expression was determined empirically. rLmREX2*-cbp, rTbREX1-cbp, rTbREX1(D881A,H882N)-cbp, rTbREX2-cbp, and rTbREX2(D896A,H897N)-cbp were purified from total cell lysates of baculovirus infected cells. Tandem affinity purification was performed as described previously (6Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified protein was diluted into 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, loaded onto a Mono S 5/50 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted over a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing recombinant protein were concentrated by ultrafiltration in Ultrafree centrifugal filter units (10-kDa nominal molecular weight limit, Millipore) and applied to a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate and 300 mm NaCl. Purity of protein preparations was monitored by SDS-PAGE in 8–16% acrylamide Novex gels (Invitrogen) stained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes). Purified protein was stored at –80 or at –20 °C in 50% glycerol (v/v). Protein concentration was determined in-gel by comparison to pre-diluted bovine serum albumin protein assay standards (Pierce). Cytosolic Expression of the TbREX1 EEP Domain—A TbREX1 gene fragment coding for amino acids 606–902 was PCR-amplified using the primer pair 5′-GGATCCATGGCAAAAGAGGTT-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCTATCTAGAAAGGGCACCAATAATCTGAACTTCCG-3′ and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. A modified TAP tag containing a protein C epitope instead of cbp was PCR-amplified from the pC-PTP-NEO vector (19Schimanski B. Nguyen T.N. Gunzl A. Eukaryot.

An internal BamHI site was removed from the protein C epitope using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and the primer 5′-CCGGCTCCATGGAAGAAGATCAGGTGGACCCTCGTCTTATTGATG-3′. The TbREX1-(606–902) sequence was released from pCR2.1-TOPO with BamHI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the modified TAP vector. L. tarentolae UC strain cells were maintained in BHI media (Difco) supplemented with 10 mg/ml hemin-HCl. Cells were electroporated with the TAP vector and selected for retention of plasmid by plating on agarose in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Transformed cells were maintained in 100 μg/ml G418 (20Coburn C.M. Otteman K.M. McNeely T. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of TbREX1-(606–902)-protein C was performed as described previously (19Schimanski B. Nguyen T.N.

Tandem Affinity Purification of LmREX2*—L-complex containing TAP-tagged LmREX2* was purified from L. tarentolae. LmREX2* released from pCR2.1-TOPO-Lm-REX2* with BamHI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding sites of LtREL1-TAP (6Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to generate LmREX2*-TAP vector for transformation of cells was conducted as described above. Tandem affinity purification of L-complex was performed as described previously (6Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Exonuclease Activity of Recombinant REX Proteins—Purified proteins were tested for exonuclease activity with the following synthetic RNAs: 6U, 5′-GCUAUGUCUGCUAACUUGUUUUUU-3′; 6G, 5′-GCUAUACAUGCUACAUUGGGGGG-3′; 6C, 5′-GCUAUGUCUGCUAACUUGCCCCCC-3′; 6A, 5′-GCUAUGUCUGCUAACUUGAAAAAA-3′; and 1U, 5′-GCUAUGUCUGCUAACUUGUAUCGU-3′. RNAs were 5′-radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP. In 10-μl reactions 1 pmol of 5′-labeled RNA was diluted into a standard 10-μl reaction containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Either 28 fmol of rTbREX1 or 54 fmol of rTbREX2 were added to reactions and incubated at 27 °C from 1 to 16 min before termination of reactions by the addition of urea-saturated formamide. rLmREX2* activity was tested by varying the concentration of recombinant protein from 0.01 to 1 μm in 32-min reactions. Activity of rTbREX mutants was assayed against 1U RNA substrate in time course reactions containing 53 fmol of either rTbREX1 or rTbREX1(D881A,H882N) or 152 fmol of either rTbREX2 or rTbREX2(D896A,H897N). Reaction products were resolved by denaturing PAGE in 8 m urea, 15% acrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to storage phosphor screens for visualization by PhosphorImager. Cloning of RNAi Vector and Down-regulation of TbREX2—A 500-bp fragment of the TbREX2 gene was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GGATCCAAGCTTATGTTGCGCCGCAGTCGCTT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCTAGACGAGGTCAAGCATCCACGCA-3′ and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. The gene fragment was released first with HindIII and XbaI and subsequently with BamHI for insertion into the corresponding sites of the pLew100-HX-GFP vector as inverted copies separated by a spacer element (21Hutchings N.R. Donelson J.E. Hill K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fragment was also released with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into the corresponding sites of the p2T7Ti-177 vector (22Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). RNAi vectors were linearized with NotI and electroporated into strain 29-13 T. brucei procyclic form cells that express T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor. Procyclic cells were maintained in SDM79 media supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 15 μg/ml G418, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. After electroporation, cultures were selected for genomic integration of the construct at the rDNA spacer (pLew100-HX-GFP) or the 177-bp satellite (p2T7Ti-177) by plating on agarose in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin (23Carruthers V.B. Cross G.A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8818-8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transcription of TbREX2 dsRNA was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. For growth curve analysis, cells were maintained in log phase by dilution to 106 cells/ml every 48 h. Mitochondria were isolated from log phase cultures as described (24Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Extracts from 100 mg of purified mitochondria were prepared by sonication in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100.4 rotor and sedimented in a 10–30% glycerol gradient for 20 h at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Gradient fractions were auto-adenylated for 20 min at 27 °C with 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP per 10 μl and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% acrylamide NOVEX gels (Invitrogen) prior to transfer to Protran BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) for immunodetection or autoradiography. TbREX2 mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was purified and DNase treated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis. The primer pairs 5′-TGATCATGTCGCCGTCGACG-3′, 5′-TTGAAGTTCACGCCCAGGCC-3′; and 5′-TGACTACGTTGCGGTGGACGCC-3′, 5′-CTCGCGGTCGCGCTTTGAGA-3′ were used to PCR-amplify regions of TbREX2 and TbREX1 respectively. Kinetic Analysis of TbREX1 and TbREX2 Activities— rTbREX1 and rTbREX2 were incubated with 5′ end-labeled 1U substrate RNA in standard reaction buffer. To determine the linear range of product accumulation, time course reactions at various REX protein concentrations were monitored by denaturing PAGE. Kinetic parameters were determined by incubating 22 fmol of rTbREX1 or 54 fmol of rTbREX2 in 10-μl reactions with varying concentrations of 1U substrate for 10 and 15 min, respectively. Substrate concentration ranged from 50 nm to 1.5μm. The percent of substrate cleavage visualized by PhosphorImager was quantified using ImageQuant (version 5.2, GE Healthcare) and used to calculate enzyme velocity (fmol/min). Kinetic parameters were calculated from nonlinear regression of velocity versus substrate concentration plots using GraphPad Prism (version 4.01, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Pre-cleaved RNA Editing Assays—The following synthetic RNAs were used in pre-cleaved editing assays: 5′ UU fragment, 5′-GCACUACACGAUAAAUAUAAAAAGUU-3′; 3′ fragment, 5′-AACAUUAUGCUUCUUCGddC-3′; –0 gRNA, 5′-AAGAAGCAUAAUGUUagCUUUUUAUAUUUAUCGUGUAGUCddG-3′ (guiding nucleotides in lowercase); –1gRNA, 5′-AAGAAGCAUAAUGUUaCUUUUUAUAUUUAUCGUGUAGUCddG-3′ (guiding nucleotide in lowercase); –2 gRNA, 5′-AAGAAGCAUAAUGUUCUUUUUAUAUUUAUCGUGUAGUCddG-3′. Reactions contained 1 pmol of kinase-labeled 5′ UU fragment, 2 pmol of 3′ fragment, and 4 pmol of a single gRNA. RNAs were annealed by heating to 70 °C and slowly cooling to 4 °C prior to addition of reaction buffer. Recombinant TbREL1 and TbREL2 purified from Sf9 cells were added to some reactions (9Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Rogers K. Nebohacova M. Li F. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4712-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of the T. brucei and L. major REX Proteins—PFAM analysis of the TbREX1, TbREX2, and LmREX1 amino acid sequences indicated the presence of the EEP motif in all three sequences (Fig. 1A), as demonstrated previously. Also as noted previously, the LmREX2 homologue sequence lacks any vestige of this motif, leading us to use the LmREX2* nomenclature for this protein. As discussed in the Introduction, this finding raises a paradox because the REL1 subcomplex of the L-complex in T. brucei and L. tarentolae, which has been proposed to be mainly involved in U-deletion editing, appears to contain only REX2 (6Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To address the possible functional role of LmREX2*, we decided to analyze a recombinant LmREX2* protein in addition to recombinant TbREX1 and TbREX2 proteins. The purification to homogeneity of insect cell-expressed TAP-tagged recombinant TbREX1, TbREX2, and LmREX2* proteins by successive affinity and chromatographic steps is shown in Fig. 1B. Exonuclease Activity of Recombinant REX Proteins—The recombinant TbREX1 and TbREX2 proteins were found to exhibit a robust 3′–5′-exonuclease activity (Fig. 2, A and B). This activity was specific for 3′ uridylates, and no degradation was observed with RNAs terminating in 3′ A, G, or C residues. This exouridylase activity appeared distributive in nature. A processive type activity was observed using only affinity-purified proteins (data not shown). The rTbREX activity was dependent on magnesium cation and was sensitive to chelating agents (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, the recombinant LmREX2* did not exhibit detectable 3′–5′-exonuclease activity against any substrate RNA tested (Fig. 2D). No exonuclease activity was observed even when the rLmREX2* concentration was increased by 2 orders of magnitude versus the concentrations of rTbREX1 and rTbREX2 used previously. The presence of LtREX2* in the L-complex was demonstrated by transfecting L. tarentolae cells with TAP-tagged LmREX2* and showing that the TAP pulldown had an identical polypeptide profile as L-complex isolated by use of known L-complex components (data not shown). Down-regulation of TbREX2 Expression Has a Minor Effect on Cell Growth—TbREX2 gene expression was down-regulated by tetracycline-inducible RNA interference. A procyclic stage T. brucei cell line was generated in which transcription of stemloop RNA from inverted copies of a 500-bp TbREX2 gene fragment was driven by a tetracycline-inducible PARP promoter. Induction of RNAi for 3 days resulted in reduction of TbREX2 mRNA levels as detected by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA (Fig. 3A, right panel). Loss of TbREX2 expression had little effect on parasite viability and growth (Fig. 3A, left panel). However, after 5 days of induction a slight but consistent reduction in growth rate was observed. An alternate RNAi cell line expressing TbREX2 dsRNA from opposing T7 RNA polymerase promoters exhibited no growth phenotype after RNAi induction (data not shown). This behavior contrasts to the previously reported strong effect of down-regulation of TbREX1 expression on cell growth (1Kang X. Rogers K. Gao G. Falick A.M. Zhou S.-L. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The effect of TbREX2 down-regulation on L-complex stability was assayed by sedimentation of mitochondrial lysate before and after 9 days of RNAi induction. Only minor changes in L-complex sedimentation were apparent (Fig. 3B), suggesting that TbREX2 is not required to maintain the stability or the structure of the L-complex. In addition, no major differences were detected among the distribution of the L-complex components LC1 (MP81), LC4 (MP63), LC7b (MP42), and REL2. The increased level of REL1 detected in fraction three after RNAi is consistent with previous findings that suggest the presence of a REL1 subcomplex consisting of REX2, REL1, and LC4 (18Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). REX2 may help stabilize the interaction of REL1 with the L-complex. REX EEP Domains Are Required for Exonuclease Activity— The EEP domains from diverse proteins share several highly conserved amino acids (25Dlakic M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 272-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which are also conserved in the TbREX1 and TbREX2 EEP domains (Fig. 4A) (26Worthey E.A. Schnaufer A. Mian I.S. Stuart K. Salavati R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6392-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Mian I.S. Worthey E.A. Salavati R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 305Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To confirm that the ribonuclease activity of both TbREX1 and TbREX2 is because of the EEP domains, TbREX proteins mutated in the conserved EEP motif amino acids were tested for exonuclease activity in vitro. Two amino acids were mutated in both TbREX1(D881A,H882N), and TbREX2(D896A,H897N), and the mutant proteins were purified after overexpression in insect cells (Fig. 1B). The exonuclease activity of the mutant proteins was evaluated with a single-stranded RNA substrate terminating in a single 3′ uridylate. Time course analysis of both wild type and mutant protein reactions showed decreased activity of mutant versus wild type REX proteins (Fig. 4B). The role of the EEP motif in catalysis was further examined through expression of the TbREX1 C-terminal EEP domain. A truncated TbREX1 peptide containing amino acids 606–902 was purified after overexpression in the cytosol of L. tarentolae. rTbREX1-(606–902) was sufficient for 3′–5′-exonuclease activity, and the exonuclease activity was U-specific (Fig. 4C). Our previous observation that, during the purification of LmREX1, C-terminal proteolytic fragments co-fractionated with a nonspecific exonuclease activity (1Kang X. Rogers K. Gao G. Falick A.M. Zhou S.-L. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) could represent contamination with nonspecific nucleases, conformational changes induced by proteolysis, or authentic differences in the structural stability and determinants of specificity for EEP domains from L. major and T. brucei. Kinetic Analysis of REX 3′–5′-Exonuclease Activity—Steady state kinetics of the TbREX exonuclease reactions were determined using a single-stranded RNA substrate terminating in a single 3′ U residue. The rTbREX1 and rTbREX2 reactions yielded similar apparent Km values of 536.1 ± 84.99 and 224.5 ± 25.83 nm, indicating a high affinity of these enzymes for the RNA substrate (Fig."

This phosphorylation results in its cytoplasmic export and inactivation, although lack of ERK activity allows its immediate nuclear accumulation and repressor function. Nuclear ERFs arrest cell cycle progression in G1 and can suppress ras-dependent tumorigenicity. Here we provide evidence that ERF function is mediated by its ability to repress transcription of c-Myc.

Cellular systems overexpressing nuclear ERF exhibit reduced c-Myc mRNA and tumorigenic potential. Elimination of Erf in animal models results in increased c-Myc expression, whereas Erf-/- primary fibroblasts fail to down-regulate Myc in response to growth factor withdrawal.

ERF is shown to be bound and phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by ERKs (1Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J.

In the absence of growth factors, ERF is dephosphorylated and located in the nucleus, whereas upon mitogenic stimulation and in exponentially growing cells, it is actively transported into the cytoplasm through a CRM-dependent mechanism (4Le Gallic L.

Phosphorylation-deficient ERF mutants are able to reverse RAS-induced tumorigenicity and arrest fibroblasts in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, determining ERF as a bona fide ERK substrate and an effector of the RAS/ERK pathway (2Le Gallic L.

Homozygous deletion of Erf leads to a block of chorionic trophoblast differentiation, the absence of chorioallantoic fusion, persisting chorion layer, the absence of labyrinth formation, expansion of the giant cell layer, diminishing of the spongiotrophoblast layer, and eventual embryo death by 10.5 dpc (5Papadaki C.

Trophoblast stem cell lines derived by Erf-/- embryos exhibit delayed differentiation kinetics and decreased expression of spongiotrophoblast terminal differentiation markers suggesting that the ERF is required for extraembryonic ectoderm and trophoblast stem cell differentiation. Thus, there is emerging evidence for ERF contribution in cell cycle inhibition and promotion of differentiation. However, relevant downstream ERF targets have not yet been identified, rendering unclear its mechanism of action. c-MYC is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that in physiological levels binds about 10% of the human promoters (6Fernandez P.C.

Heterozygous c-Myc fibroblasts show slower growth rates (18Shichiri M. Hanson K.D. Sedivy J.M.

Tight regulation of c-Myc expression is achieved in transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. c-Myc mRNA expression is driven mainly by two promoters, P1 and P2, with the latter being responsible for producing the majority of c-Myc transcripts under physiological conditions. Early studies have shown that c-Myc transcripts are present in low levels in growing cells, drop even more in the absence of growth factors, and re-emerge upon induction by mitogens and subsequent G0 exit (22Dean M.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1411-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). No single growth factor or signaling pathway appears to be responsible for c-Myc promoter full activity. Rather, the c-Myc promoter is regulated by different pathways that converge to a large panel of transcription factors acting at different time points, cell types, and developmental stages, ensuring proper and accurate c-Myc transcription (32Liu J. Levens D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 302: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The RAS pathway, which is involved in cell cycle regulation in response to mitogens, tumorigenesis, and differentiation, has been established that can affect c-MYC levels primarily at a post-translational level. Upon serum stimulation, the RAS/ERK pathway phosphorylates c-MYC at serine 62, whereas at the same time the RAS/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway inhibits GSK3 activity preventing the destabilizing phosphorylation at threonine 58 (33Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 34Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). There is also indirect evidence that the RAS/ERK pathway can affect c-Myc mRNA levels. ETS1/2 transcription factors have been shown to bind the c-Myc promoter in vitro and to regulate c-Myc transcription (35de Nigris F. Mega T. Berger N. Barone M.V. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Verde P. Fusco A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2267-2275PubMed Google Scholar, 36Roussel M.F. Davis J.N. Cleveland J.L. Ghysdael J. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 405-415PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of an activated or a dominant negative mutation of Raf1 led to c-Myc mRNA up-regulation or down-regulation, respectively (37Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Loffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Serine 10 phosphorylation of histone H3 at the c-Myc coding region is observed in mouse fibroblasts upon stimulation of ERK activity (38Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, transcriptome analysis after ERK activation revealed c-Myc mRNA up-regulation (39Grill C. Gheyas F. Dayananth P. Jin W. Ding W. Qiu P. Wang L. Doll R.J. English J.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, direct molecular links between the RAS/ERK pathway and the c-Myc transcriptional regulation are missing. In this study, we use biochemical and genetic approaches to provide evidence that ERF when nuclear represses c-Myc transcription and that this repression mediates ERF function. Promoter reporter assays indicate that ERF can repress c-Myc promoter-driven transcription in an ERF localization-, DNA binding domain-, and repressor domain-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that endogenous ERF binds the P1-P2 promoter region in serum-deprived primary MEFs consistent with c-Myc transcriptional repression. Overexpression of nuclear ERF represses c-Myc mRNA levels in normal and RAS-transformed fibroblasts and in MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells, and suppresses transformation in RAS-transformed fibroblasts and MCF7 cells. Elimination of Erf increases c-Myc expression in the mouse embryo and placenta and attenuates its repression upon growth factor withdrawal in MEFs. Finally, the cell cycle arrest induced by nuclear ERF is abrogated in the absence of c-Myc. Thus, c-Myc is identified as the first cellular target of the ERF transcriptional repressor, providing insight into the mechanism of Erf function and the first direct linking between the RAS/ERK signaling pathway and c-Myc transcriptional regulation. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Plasmids—Primary Erf KO and WT mouse embryos at embryonic day 10 or 13.5 were dissected and plated in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). Ref1 and MEF3T3 cells (Clontech) were grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), whereas for the MCF-7 cell lines low glucose DMEM was used. Finally, the RAS3T3 cell lines were maintained in low glucose medium supplemented with 8% bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed with the calcium phosphate method. Stable MCF7 cell lines were selected with 1000 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks, and individual clones were tested for ERF expression by Western blot. MEF3T3 Tet-Off cell lines were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 weeks, and individual clones were tested by Northern blot and GFP expression. MEF3T3 Tet-Off cells were maintained in 100 ng/ml doxycycline. To induce ERF expression, cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh media, without doxycycline, were added. Cells were harvested 3 days after doxycycline removal. RAS 3T3 ERF WT and M1-7 cell lines and RB KO MEFs were described previously (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell.

All cell lines were maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. pBI-ERF WT and pBI-ERF M1-7 constructs were made by inserting the XhoI/XbaI fragment of the pEGFP-ERF WT or pEGFP-ERF M1-7 plasmids, respectively, into the XhoI/NheI sites of a modified pBI vector (40Yu J.

The -1100/+580 and -140/+340 p19Luc c-Myc promoter plasmids were described previously (41Wong K.K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell.

The samples were immediately plated in 6-well plates coated with 0.5% agarose in medium and cultured in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were fed every 3 days with 0.35% agarose in medium, and colony formation was observed after 3 weeks. Photographs were taken with a Leica DFC 300 camera on an inverted microscope. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—WT and c-Myc knock-out primary MEFs were transfected either with empty vector or ERF M1-7, and BrdUrd incorporation assay was performed as described previously (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—Ref1 cells were plated in 35-mm plates at a density of 200 cells/mm2 and were transfected overnight by calcium phosphate with 0.1 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid, 2 μg of the effector plasmid, and 1 μg of the RSV-GAL plasmid to normalize transfection efficiency. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in an FB12 luminometer. RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR—Cells were harvested and lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted and DNase I-treated, and 5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with the Amersham Biosciences first-strand cDNA synthesis kit. Quantitative PCR was performed with RNA-specific primers in an ABI Prism 7000 real time PCR machine, using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master mix (Stratagene). Results were normalized and quantified by the manufacturer's software and further analyzed with Microsoft Office Excel software. The primer sets used were the following: mouse c-Myc mRNA, 5′-mouse Erf mRNA, 5′-CACCGAGATTCCTGAGAGC-3′ and 5′-AATCCTGTACCTCGTCCGAT-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTCCACAGACACCACA-3′; AGAGACTAAAGAGAGCTGTCC-3′; mouse Cph mRNA, 5′-AGACCAGCAAGAAGATCACC-3′ and 5′-GGAAAATATGGAACCCAAAG-3′; human c-MYC mRNA, 5′-CTCAACGACAGCAGCTCG-3′ and 5′-CAGAAGGTGATCCAGACTC-3′; human GAPDH mRNA, 5′-TCGACAGTCAGCCGCATCTT-3′ and 5′-CGCCCAATACGACCAAATCC-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and qPCR—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (42Hatzis P. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1467-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, 5-10 × 106 primary MEFs grown under the indicated conditions in 150-mm plates were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature or at 37 °C. Cells were scraped off the plate and incubated in a hypotonic buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the nuclei were isolated after cell disruption in a Dounce homogenizer with a glass pestle B. Nuclear extracts were sonicated in sonication buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and were pre-cleared with protein A beads. The pre-cleared extracts were incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies, and protein A beads were added for 1 h. The immunoprecipitated material was washed twice with each of the following buffers: sonication buffer, wash buffer A (sonication buffer with 500 mm NaCl), wash buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate), and TE and eluted twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS at 65 °C. The extracts were de-cross-linked in elution buffer supplemented with 250 mm NaCl at 65 °C overnight and treated with RNase and proteinase K, and DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted. Radioactive PCRs were done by adding 0.1 μCi of radiolabeled ATP and CTP, and the products were electrophoresed in 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. qPCR was performed as described with the following primer sets: 5′-distal, 5′-GAATACTACGCTGTGCATTC-3′ and 5′-AGGATAAGCAAATCCCGAGG-3′;5′-proximal, 5′-ACGCAGGGCAAGAACACAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTATTACTGTTTACACC-3′; P1-P2, 5′-TTGGAAGAGCCGTGTGTGC-3′ and 5′-AGTGAGAAGTGTCTGCCCG-3′; Intron1, 5′-CCTGAGCTGTTTGGAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TCCCAGGCTGTCAGAAATGC-3′; and mouse GAPDH, 5′-CCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG-3′ and 5′-GACTCCACGACATACTCAGC-3′. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridizations of frozen placenta sections were performed as described previously (5Papadaki C. Alexiou M. Cecena G. Verykokakis M. Bilitou A. Cross J.C. Oshima R.G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5201-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections were hybridized overnight at 55 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.25 mg/ml yeast RNA, 0.5 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 1 ng/μl of each c-Myc and Erf riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP or fluorescein-12-UTP (Roche Applied Science), respectively. After hybridization, the sections were washed, treated with RNase, blocked with 10% fetal calf serum, incubated with the appropriate antibody, developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or 2-[4-iodophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates, and photographed. ERF Can Inhibit Transcription from the c-MYC Promoter—ERF can arrest cells in the G1 phase in an RB-dependent manner, can suppress ras- and ets-induced tumorigenicity, and is required for chorion cell differentiation (1Sgouras D.N.

Cell. 2007; 18: 2864-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that have been identified as ERF targets could not account for ERF function. c-Myc, a ubiquitously expressed gene that contains functional ets-binding sites, has been shown to accelerate cell proliferation and block differentiation, and its expression pattern mirrors ERF nuclear localization and could be a valid ERF target and could account for most of the ERF-associated phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we performed promoter reporter assays in Ref1 cells using plasmids containing a 1680-bp region of the murine c-Myc gene flanking the major P1-P2 promoters (41Wong K.K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6535-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). WT ERF could repress transcription from the c-Myc promoter by 2-fold, whereas the phosphorylation-deficient nuclear ERFm1-7 mutant decreased transcription by 4-fold (Fig. 1A). Direct DNA binding onto the c-Myc promoter is required for ERF repression as indicated by the ERFΔDBD mutation that eliminates the ETS DNA binding domain (Fig. 1A, ERF ΔDBD). The ERF repression domain is also required for the c-Myc promoter repression (Fig. 1A, ERF ΔRD), suggesting that the observed repression is not because of the displacement of endogenous activating factors but to active and direct repression by ERF. Identical results were observed when a minimal c-Myc promoter fragment from +140 to -340 bp was used (Fig. 1B) indicating that the interaction occurs within the previously identified ets-responsive region. To examine if the observed difference between the WT ERF and ERFm1-7 was because of differences in nuclear accumulation, transfected cells were grown in the absence of serum for 14 h. Under these conditions WT ERF could repress c-Myc promoter-driven transcription to the same extent as the constitutively nuclear mutant ERFm1-7 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the WT ERF can repress c-Myc transcription when nuclear in a physiologically relevant setting.FIGURE 2Nuclear ERF decreases c-Myc mRNA levels. WT ERF protein and ERFm1-7 constitutive nuclear mutant protein were expressed from an inducible promoter (Tet-Off) in the respective stably transfected MEF3T3 cell lines, and c-Myc mRNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR during exponential growth and after 4 h of serum starvation. Normalization was performed against CPH mRNA levels. 100% represents the c-Myc mRNA level for each cell line under growth conditions in the presence of doxycycline (DOX). The values shown are the average of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inducible MEF3T3 cell lines that could express WTERF or ERFm1-7 in the absence of doxycycline (supplemental Fig. S1A) were generated to test the effect of ERF expression on endogenous c-Myc. Under growth conditions induction of WTERF expression had negligible effect on c-Myc mRNA levels compared with the uninduced or the induced parental cells. In contrast, expression of ERFm1-7 decreased c-Myc expression to 30%. Serum withdrawal had a modest effect on parental or uninduced cells but resulted in 75% reduction of c-Myc mRNA levels in both WT and ERFm1-7-expressing induced cells (Fig. 2). These data suggest that nuclear ERF can repress the endogenous c-Myc expression under normal growth conditions and that increased ERF levels enhance c-Myc repression during growth factor withdrawal. ERF Interacts with c-MYC Promoter in Vivo—To establish that indeed ERF could regulate transcription from the c-Myc promoter, we investigated the association of the endogenous ERF protein with the c-Myc promoter. WT primary MEFs were utilized for ChIP experiments. MEFs were grown from 13.5 dpc embryos to passage 3, and at this point were either serum-starved for 4 h or continued to grow in 10% serum. ChIP assays were performed using the ERF-specific S17S rabbit polyclonal antibody, and the precipitated material was PCR-amplified using primers either from the P1-P2 region of the c-Myc promoter or a proximal 5′ primer set. An increased specific interaction of ERF with the P1-P2 promoter region of the c-Myc gene could be observed only during serum withdrawal, whereas ERF was nuclear and the c-Myc transcription decreased (Fig. 3A). We further analyzed the specificity and the kinetics of the ERF binding on c-Myc promoter region in conjunction with c-Myc expression. MEFs were serum-starved for 1 and 4 h or starved for 4 h and then indu"
https://openalex.org/W1983004202,"The Sec61 protein translocation complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is composed of three subunits.

Here we show that co-translational protein translocation into the ER is reduced in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells, whereas there is a limited reduction of post-translational tranlocation and no effect on export of a mutant form of α-factor precursor for ER-associated degradation in the cytosol. The translocation defect and the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells were rescued by expression of the transmembrane domain of Sbh1p alone, and the Sbh1p transmembrane domain was sufficient for coimmunoprecipitation with Sec61p and Sss1p. Furthermore, we show that Sbh1p co-precipitates with the ER transmembrane protein Rtn1p. Sbh1p-Rtn1p complexes do not appear to contain Sss1p and Sec61p. Our results define the transmembrane domain as the minimal functional domain of the Sec61β homologue Sbh1p in ER translocation, identify a novel interaction partner for Shb1p, and imply that Sbh1p has additional functions that are not directly linked to protein translocation in association with the Sec61 complex.

Our results define the transmembrane domain as the minimal functional domain of the Sec61β homologue Sbh1p in ER translocation, identify a novel interaction partner for Shb1p, and imply that Sbh1p has additional functions that are not directly linked to protein translocation in association with the Sec61 complex. During biosynthesis proteins destined for secretion or for intracellular membranes of the secretory or the endocytic pathways are first translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 7The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; TM, transmembrane; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; WT, wild type; UTA, ubiquitin-assisted translocation assay. (1Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The channel mediating protein translocation is conserved in evolution from bacteria to eukaryotic cells (2Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. van den Berg B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). This channel is formed by the Sec61 complex in eukaryotic cells and the SecY complex in eubacteria and Archaea. The largest of the Sec61/SecY complex subunit is Sec61α in eukaryotes and SecY in eubacteria and Archaea. This subunit forms the actual protein conducting channel. The β subunit is termed Sec61β in mammals, and SecG in eubacteria and Archaea. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae two homologous β subunits, Sbh1p and Sbh2p, exist. The γ subunit is called Sec61γ in mammalian cells, Sss1p in S. cerevisiae, and SecE in eubacteria and Archaea. In S. cerevisiae two homologous trimeric Sec61 complexes exist. The Sec61 complex is composed of Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sss1p (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The Sec61 complex mediates also post-translational protein translocation in association with Kar2p, Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p (6Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 9Young B.P. Craven R.A. Reid P.J. Willer M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This heptameric complex is called the Sec complex. In addition to its role in co- and post-translational translocation the Sec61 complex is also involved in retro-translocation of misfolded proteins to the cytosol for degradation (10Romisch K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The second S. cerevisiae translocation complex, the Ssh1 complex, consists of the Sec61p homologue Ssh1p, the Sbh1p homologue Sbh2p, and Sss1p (2Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. van den Berg B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 8Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The Ssh1 complex has been shown to contribute to co- and post-translational translocation and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Wilkinson B.M. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of the Sec61α subunit as the protein conducting channel is well established, whereas the functions of the β and γ subunits remain largely unclear. The β subunit is not essential but has a facilitating role in translocation in mammalian cells (12Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to its interactions with Sec61p, the mammalian β subunit has been shown to interact with signal peptidase (12Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the ribosome (13Levy R. Wiedmann M. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2340-2346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the yeast β subunit, Sbh1p, was shown to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for signal recognition particle receptor (14Helmers J. Schmidt D. Glavy J.S. Blobel G. Schwartz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23686-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The two yeast β subunits, Sbh1p and Sbh2p (previously also called Seb1p and Seb2p), are encoded by non-essential genes. Deletion of either gene alone has no effect on growth, whereas the deletion of both SBH1 and SBH2 was shown to result in temperature sensitivity for growth at 38 °C (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Soderlund H.

Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In a heterologous in vitro translation-translocation system a stronger translocation defect was observed in cells lacking both Sbh1p and Sbh2p (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Previously, a stabilizing role in the translocation complex has been suggested for both β and γ subunits (15Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.O. Schekman R. Kepes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both in mammalian and yeast cells, β subunits have been shown to interact with proteins that are not obviously functionally linked with protein translocation. The β subunit has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with Sec15p and Sec8p, two components of the exocyst complex (16Lipschutz J.H. Lingappa V.R. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20954-20960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Toikkanen J.H. Miller K.J. Soderlund H. Jantti J. Keranen S. J. Biol.

Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 61-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of the translocon-exocyst interaction is presently unknown. Overexpression of one of the exocyst subunits, SEC3, results in accumulation of Sec61p in the emerging bud in yeast (19Wiederkehr A. De Craene J.O. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results have led to the proposal that translocon-exocyst interactions may play a role in ER inheritance during cytokinesis (18Guo W. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 61-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Du Y. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2871-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the function of Sbh1 protein using a set of SBH1 mutants. We show that the transmembrane (TM) domain of Sbh1p on its own can functionally substitute the full-length protein in the ER. We demonstrate that the TM domain of Sbh1p is sufficient for interaction with Sec61p and Sss1p. In addition, we identify Rtn1p, an ER membrane protein, as a novel interaction partner for Sbh1p. These results define a functionally important domain in the Sec61 β subunit Sbh1p and reveal novel interactions of this protein that support the idea that Sbh1p has functions outside the Sec61 complex. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strains used in this study are shown in supplementary Table S1. All strains excluding WCG4a (From D. Wolf, University of Stuttgart), H956, H1107, and H1109 (S. Ferro-Novick (Yale University) are congenic to H304 or H973 (obtained from P. Novick (Yale University)). Gene deletions and carboxyl-terminal tagging of proteins were achieved with the PCR-based methods using pFA6a-kanMX, pFA6a-natNT2, pYM-hphNT1, and pYM1 as templates (from M. Knop, EMBL, Heidelberg) as previously described (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar, 22Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E. Knop M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). H3384, H3386, and H3387 were obtained by integration of the ClaI cut YIpαa-L, encoding Bacillus amyloliquefaciens α-amylase gene, in the leu2 locus. To generate sbh1Δ (H3386), sbh2Δ (H3387), and sbh1Δ sbh2Δ (H3388) strains for analysis of α-amylase secretion and to ensure that the same number of the α-amylase expression cassette is presents in these integrant strains, H3384 was crossed with H3235. The resulting diploid strain was sporulated, dissected, and spores were analyzed to obtain strains for α-amylase expression in combination of sbh1Δ, sbh2Δ, and sbh1Δ sbh2Δ. Strain H3543 was generated by deletion of the TRP1 gene from H3232 with a PCR cassette generated using pFA6a-natNT2 as a template. The yeast growth media were prepared essentially as previously described (23Sherman, F. (1991) in Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology (Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R., eds) pp. 3-21, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Synthetic media lacking uracil or appropriate amino acids were used for plasmid selection. G418 (Invitrogen) was used at a concentration of 200 μg/ml, nourseothricin at 100 μg/ml (Werner BioAgents, Germany), and hygromycin (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) at 300 μg/ml. Yeast was cultivated aerobically on plates or in shaker flasks at 30 °C if not stated otherwise. Complementation and suppression tests on a dilution series of yeast strains were performed essentially as described (17Toikkanen J.H. Miller K.J. Soderlund H. Jantti J. Keranen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20946-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Sporulation and tetrad analysis were done as described (24Davydenko S.G. Feng D. Jantti J. Keranen S. Yeast. 2005; 22: 993-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasmids—Standard DNA methods were used. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys. The sequences of oligonucleotides used are available on request. The plasmids used for gene expression in yeast are listed in supplementary Table S2. Construction of the full-length YEpSBH1-(1–82) and plasmids encoding the truncated forms of Sbh1p, full-length Sss1p, and Sss1p-TM domain were constructed with PCR. Briefly, DNA fragments encoding the corresponding genes were generated by oligonucleotides containing XbaI and XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sites and cloned into the XbaI/XhoI cut pVT102U (25Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) or p425 (26Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). SBH2 or sbh2-tm domain (amino acids 57–82) encoding sequences were generated by oligonucleotides containing XbaI and XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sites and cloned into the XbaI/XhoI cut pVT102U. The YIpαa-L was constructed by cloning the α-amylase expression cassette with ADH1 promoter and terminator as a BamHI/SalI fragment from YIpαa6 (27Ruohonen L. Aalto M.K. Keranen S. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 39: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) into BlueScript SK(-). From there the same fragment was cloned as the BamHI/SalI fragment into pRS405 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate YEpBIO-SBH1-(1–82) and YEpBIO-SBH1-(50–75), a DNA fragment encoding biotin acceptor peptide (BIO-tag) derived from Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase was added in front of SBH1 or SBH1(50–75) by nested PCR using pFA6a-HBH-kanMX6 (29Tagwerker C. Zhang H. Wang X. Larsen L.S. Lathrop R.H. Hatfield G.W. Auer B. Huang L. Kaiser P. Yeast. 2006; 23: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (gift from Peter Kaiser, University of California) as the template for BIO-tag with oligonucleotides containing BamHI/XhoI sites and then cloned into vector p426ADH (26Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). All constructs generated by PCR were sequenced. Antibodies—The α-amylase antibodies have been described before (30Ruohonen L. Toikkanen J. Tieaho V. Outola M. Soderlund H. Keranen S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Sss1p were a gift from Randy Schekman (31Pilon M. Romisch K. Quach D. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3455-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sso1/2 have been described previously (17Toikkanen J.H. Miller K.J. Soderlund H. Jantti J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies were from Roche Applied Science. Antibody dilutions used in Western blotting were 1:1000 for α-amylase and anti-Sbh1p, 1:50000 for anti-Sso1/2p, 1:1000 for anti-Sss1p, and 1:2000 for anti-Sec61p. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) were diluted 1:2000. Quantification of the band intensities was done by scanning the films with GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One program, version 4.0 (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Microsomes and Cytosol and in Vitro ERAD Assays—Wild type and mutant cells were grown in YPD at 30 °C to early logarithmic phase and microsomes were prepared by spheroplasting and hypotonic lysis as described previously (34Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared from exponentially growing WCG4a by liquid nitrogen lysis as described previously (34Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In vitro ERAD of the non-glycosylated mutant form of pro-α-factor (Δgpαf) was assayed as in Pilon et al. (34Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) using 2 μl of microsomes OD280 = 30, and 2 μl of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled pΔgpαf (500,000 cpm) per sample. Immunoprecipitations and Pulldowns—For 35S labeling of α-factor, cells were grown in complete minimal medium without methionine and cysteine at 30 °C. Labeling, lysis, and immunoprecipitation were performed as in Gillece et al. (35Gillece P. Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. de La Cruz F.J. Romisch K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1443-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) using 1.5 A600 of cells and 10 μl of polyclonal anti-Sbh1p anti-serum per sample. For pulldown of BIO-tagged or immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins, a membrane protein-enriched fraction was isolated as described (6Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 ∼ 1). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 25 mm KAC, 5 mm MgAC, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) supplemented with Complete protease inhibition mixture (Roche), and homogenized by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g and the supernatant subjected to centrifugation at 72,000 × g for 35 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 800 mm KAC, 16 mm MgAC, 10% glycerol, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 2.5% saponin supplemented with Complete protease inhibition mixture and incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 126,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were resuspended in buffer C (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 400 mm KAC, 16 mm MgAC, 10% glycerol, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 3% digitonin and Complete protease inhibition mixture and incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 304,000 × g for 30 min, thereafter the pellets were resuspended in buffer B and used for pull-downs or immunoprecipitations. Streptavidin or anti-HA (12CA5) antibody-coupled Dynabeads (Dynal) were used for precipitation of Rtn1p-3HA, BIO-Sbh1p, or BIO-Sbh1-TM. Coupling of anti-HA antibodies to Protein G-coupled magnetic beads was carried out according to guidelines of the manufacturer (Dynal). Incubation with the lysate was carried out at 4 °C by end over rotation for 1 h followed by 5 washes at 4 °C by rotation, 15 min each. The bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.1% SDS at 95 °C. The eluted samples were pooled and used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The protein bands were detected with specific antibodies or HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:5000 and visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Post-translational Translocation in Vitro and N-Glycosidase F Treatment—In vitro translated ppαf was translocated into wild type or mutant microsomes at the indicated temperatures in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system as described (36Lyman S.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using 0.3 eq of membranes per sample (1 eq = 1 μl of microsomes OD280 = 50). At the end of the incubation, samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and proteins resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE gels. For N-glycopeptidase F treatment, membranes were lysed and glycosylated gpαf precipitated with concanavalin A-Sepharose as reported previously (37Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Washed beads were subsequently incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with or without 2 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche) in 40 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). Beads were heated in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and proteins analyzed on 18% polyacrylamide, 2 m urea gels. For inhibition of glucosidase or mannosidase activities, membranes were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of castanospermine and/or 1-deoxymannojirimycin (Calbiochem) for 15 min at 20 °C, and the drugs present at the same concentrations during the translocation reactions. Co-translational Translocation in Vitro—Microsomes (0.3 eq) were incubated with 2.3 μg in vitro transcribed ppαf mRNA (using SP6 polymerase, (38Hansen W. Garcia P.D. Walter P. Cell. 1986; 45: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) at the indicated temperatures in a final volume of 10 μl containing 8 μCi (=0.3 MBq) of translation grade [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), 3 μl of nuclease-treated, gel-filtered yeast cytosol, 7 units of RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), 3.3 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 3.3 μl of 3× translation buffer (66 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm creatine phosphokinase, 2.25 mm ATP, 300 μm GTP, 120 μm amino acid mixture without methionine (Amersham Biosciences), 360 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 5.1 mm dithiothreitol) and diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. At the end of the incubation, membranes were sedimented and washed once in B88 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate), before resuspension in 2× SDS samples buffer, heating to 65 °C for 10 min, and analysis by 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Secretion and Translocation of α-Amylase—To analyze intracellular and secreted forms of α-amylase, yeast strains H3384, H3386, H3387, and H3388 were grown overnight in YPD medium at 24 °C. The overnight cultures were diluted with fresh medium to A600 = 0.3 and re-grown to A600 = 2. Cultures (3 ml) were centrifuged at 3000 × g and the pellets were washed once with water. Cells and culture medium were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-α-amylase antibodies. To analyze α-amylase translocation, H304, H956, H1107, H1109, and H3232 cells containing YEpαa6 expression plasmid, or H3384 and H3388 cells transformed with different Sbh1p mutant encoding plasmids, were grown overnight at 24 °C. Cultures were diluted with fresh medium to A600 = 2, shifted to 37.5 °C, and grown for the indicated times. Cells were collected, washed once with water followed by resuspension in 2% SDS containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche), and a 5-min incubation at 95 °C. Thereafter cells were vortexed in the presence of glass beads and 2% SDS and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche). The protein concentration of the lysates was measured with BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and equal amounts of lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purified B. amyloliquefaciens α-amylase (Sigma A7595) was used as a control for the non-glycosylated form of α-amylase. Ubiquitin-assisted Translocation Assay (UTA)—Strain H3543 was transformed with plasmids encoding Suc223, Sec2277, Dap2300, or the empty vector pRS314 (39Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2686-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Mason N. Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4164-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (gifts from N. Johnsson, University of Muenster, Germany, and J. Brown, Newcastle University, United Kingdom). Patches of transformants grown on SCD-Trp-Leu were replicated on SCD-Trp-Leu-Ura plates and their growth was followed for 3 days at 24 °C. Sbh1p and Sbh2p Participate in Protein Import into the ER, but Are Dispensable for ERAD—The function of the non-essential β-subunit Sbh1p in association with Sec61p and Sss1p is poorly understood. We have previously shown that overexpression of SBH1 has a positive effect on production of secreted bacterial α-amylase in S. cerevisiae (17Toikkanen J.H. Miller K.J. Soderlund H. Jantti J. Keranen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20946-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied possible effects of deletion of the SBH genes on secretion of this reporter protein. The wild type (H3384), sbh1Δ (H3386), sbh2Δ (H3387), and sbh1Δ sbh2Δ (H3388) strains containing an integrated copy of the α-amylase gene were grown in liquid culture and the secreted and intracellularly retained α-amylase were detected by Western blotting with α-amylase-specific antibodies. Compared with the wild type cells, cells with single deletions of SBH1 or SBH2 secreted 59 and 56% of α-amylase, respectively, whereas in the sbh1Δ sbh2Δ strain substantially less (33%) of the enzyme was secreted into the growth medium (Fig. 1A). In the sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cell lysate, the majority of the intracellular α-amylase migrated at the position of the unglycosylated bacterial enzyme (Fig. 1A). This faster migrating form of α-amylase co-migrated with the form of α-amylase that accumulated in translocation mutants sec61-2 and sec63-1 cells shifted to 37.5 °C for 2 h (Fig. 1B). To verify that the faster migrating band represents untranslocated α-amylase, sbh1Δ sbh2Δ and wild type cells were lysed and fractionated by differential centrifugation. The faster migrating band was still detected in the supernatant of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells after pelleting the membranes for 1 h at 100,000 × g (supplementary Fig. S1) indicating that it represents the untranslocated form of the protein. Together these results suggest that translocation of α-amylase is defective in vivo in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells at restrictive temperatures. Previously, only a moderate defect was observed in in vivo translocation of the α-factor precursor and Kar2p in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A more pronounced defect was, however, evident in in vitro experiments using a heterologous translation-translocation system (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because of the differences in the results, we re-examined the in vitro translocation of yeast α-factor using a homologous yeast translation-translocation system. For post-translational translocation 0.3 eq yeast microsomes were incubated with ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and 300,000 cpm of ppαf translated in vitro in a yeast cell extract for the indicated periods of time at 10, 30, or 37 °C. At the end of the incubations, samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Translocation was quantified and expressed as the ratio of N-glycosylated protein (3gpαf) to total radiolabeled protein in each lane (3gpαf + ppαf). In contrast to previous results (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we observed only a modest post-translational import defect into the ER for ppαf at 37 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). The import defect was more pronounced when co-translational import was examined (Fig. 2B, lower right). In our in vitro translocation experiments, we observed that 3gpαf initially migrated as a group of bands at a higher molecular weight in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ membranes at all temperatures (Fig. 2A and not shown). After 10–20 min the most prominent of these bands migrated at the same position as 3gpαf in wild type membranes (Fig. 2A). Because Sec61β in mammalian cells has been shown to anchor signal peptidase to the translocon (12Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) we asked if the abnormal size of 3gpαf in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ membranes was due to delayed signal cleavage. We translocated in vitro translated ppαf into wild type and mutant membranes for"
https://openalex.org/W2151736048,"The tegument is a layer of proteins between the nucleocapsid and the envelope of herpesviruses. The functions of most tegu- ment proteins are still poorly understood. In murine gamma- herpesvirus 68, ORF52 is an abundant tegument protein of 135 residues that is required for the assembly and release of infec- tious virus particles. To help understand the molecular basis for the function of this protein, we have determined its crystal structure at 2.1 Aresolution. The structure reveals a dimeric association of this protein. Interestingly, an N-terminal -helix that assumes different conformation in the two monomers of the dimer mediates the formation of an asymmetrical tetramer and contains many highly conserved residues. Structural and sequence analyses suggest that this helix is more likely involved in interactions with other components of the tegument or nucle- ocapsid of the virus and that ORF52 functions as a symmetrical dimer. The asymmetrical tetramer of ORF52 may be a latent form of the protein, when it is not involved in virion assembly. The self-association of ORF52 has been confirmed by co-immu- noprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. Deletion of the N-terminal -helix, as well as mutation of the conserved Arg 95 residue, abolished the function of ORF52. The results of the functional studies are fully consist- ent with the structural observations and indicate that the N-ter- minal -helix is a crucial site of interaction for ORF52."

A critical requirement for the PCC is to maintain the membrane barrier for ions and other small solutes both under idle and active conditions. This is particularly important in bacteria and Archaea as the cytoplasmic membrane plays a key role in proton and sodium ion-based energy transduction. Only recently, an understanding is emerging how the membrane integrity is preserved during protein translocation. A cryo-electron microscopy study indicates that the active PCC bound to the ribosome consists of a dimer of SecYEG (15Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks III, C.L. Ban N. Frank J. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Mitra K. Frank J. Driessen A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2006; 157: 262-270Google Scholar), whereas both structural and biochemical studies indicate an oligomeric, possibly dimeric, assembly of the SecA-bound PCC (17Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Duong F.

Biol. 2005; 354: 258-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). X-ray structural analysis indicates that the SecY protein of a single SecYEG complex has a clamshell-like shape that encompasses a central channel. The channel in this monomeric complex is constricted and closed at the center by a ring of hydrophobic amino acid residues, termed the pore. In addition, a periplasmic re-entrance loop (TM2a) closes the pore at the extracellular side like a plug. The pore and the plug domains have been proposed to seal the channel under idle conditions (20van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The plug is a flexible structure that can be cross-linked to SecE at the periplasmic membrane interface peripheral to the translocation pore (21Harris C.R. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3438-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the channel is opened upon the insertion of the signal sequence forming a wedge at the membrane lateral opening of the clamshell. The recently proposed peristalsis model suggests that channel opening is induced by SecA (or the ribosome) rather than the signal sequence (22Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this model, SecA controls the juxtapositioning of two SecYEG protomers of a dimeric complex with their lateral gates facing each other (15Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks III, C.L. Ban N. Frank J. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Mitra K. Frank J. Driessen A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2006; 157: 262-270Google Scholar). In either model, the enlargement of the pore will result in a destabilization of the plug, which is subsequently displaced, enabling the vectorial membrane passage of unfolded preproteins. Biochemical studies indeed show that the plug domain is more readily cross-linked to SecE in the presence of a proOmpA preprotein (23Tam P.C.K. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K.Y. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the role of the plug as a sealing entity seems questionable, as it is not essential for viability and preprotein translocation (24Maillard A.P. Lalani S. Solva F. Belin D. Duong F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 1281-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that in the absence of a plug, other periplasmic loops of SecY substitute for the plug domain to seal the periplasmic exit site (26Li W. Schulman S. Boyd D. Erlandson K. Beckwith J. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments have shown that a ribosome-bound proOmpA translocation intermediate preferentially localizes in the neighborhood of pore residues at the center of the PCC, while minimizing contact with the remainder of the structure (27Cannon K.S. Or E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Shibata Y. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A close association of the hydrophobic pore with the preprotein may provide a way to prevent ions and solutes from leaking through the channel (1Clemons W.M.J. Menetret J.F. Akey C.W. Rapoport T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A.

Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, in a recent MD simulation, few water molecules and no ions seemed to permeate the Sec61 channel in the presence of a polypeptide chain (28Gumbart J. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2356-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a functional hydrophobic constriction in the translocation channel in its active state remains to be demonstrated experimentally, because previous fluorescent studies on the polarity of the active PCC in endoplasmic reticulum membranes argue that the channel is hydrophilic throughout (29Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Crowley K.S. Liao S.R. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Moreover, fluorophores positioned along the PCC spanning part of the nascent polypeptide chain were found to be accessible to bulky water-soluble quenchers, giving rise to the hypothesis that the active PCC forms a large aqueous channel with a diameter of up to 60 Å (31Hamman B.D. Chen J.C. Johnson E.E. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Instead, a PCC sealing function in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen has been attributed to the chaperone BiP (32Hamman B.D. Henderschot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), whereas at the cytosolic face of the membrane a tight seal would be provided by the ribosome (30Crowley K.S.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, most secretory proteins translocate in a post-translational manner. It is unknown if any of the PCC ligands, such as SecA, contribute to sealing of the translocation channel. Previous studies have demonstrated that disulfide-bridged loops of up to 13 amino acids introduced into the preprotein proOmpA do not block translocation provided that a proton motive force is present (35Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tani K. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The translocation of such bulky structures requires a high flexibility of the channel, and the pore needs to widen considerably while maintaining a close seal with the preprotein. To examine the molecular environment of the PCC of E. coli, while active in SecA-mediated post-translational translocation, we have inserted the environmentally sensitive probe N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) at defined positions inside the channel, while conjugated to a proOmpA-DHFR translocation intermediate (37Arkowitz R.A.

NBD was conjugated to the protein by means of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and thiol chemistry. By varying the position of NBD along the chain of the translocation intermediate, we aimed at analyzing the polarity at evenly spaced positions throughout the channel. Our results demonstrate that a hydrophobic locality exists in the active PCC that corresponds to the central region of the translocation channel. Materials—SecA (39Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C.

Thiols were reduced with 25 μm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for 30 min at room temperature. Labeling was performed with 250 μm of fluorophore for 30 min (fluorescein, Oregon Green) or 2 h (NBD) at room temperature under constant stirring. Reactions were quenched with 2.5 mm DTT for 10 min at room temperature, and free probe was removed by precipitation of the protein with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The protein was resuspended in 1:10 of the labeling volume of buffer A, and aliquots were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Labeling was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and imaged using a Lumi-imager F1 (Roche Applied Science), with a bandpass filter at 520 nm (±20 nm). In Vitro Translocation Assay—The activity of IMVs was analyzed by means of a standard translocation and protease protection assay. ProOmpA-DHFR (37Arkowitz R.A. Joly C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was used as a substrate, which optionally contained a fluorescent label conjugated to a unique cysteine in the proOmpA moiety. Standard translocation reactions were performed in a total volume of 50 μl. Folding of the DHFR domain was induced by diluting the proOmpA-DHFR (0.5 mg/ml), denatured in buffer A, 25-fold into a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 30 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 18 μg/ml SecB, 1 mm NADPH, and 50 μm methotrexate, with a final volume of 25 μl. The mixture was incubated for 5 min on ice, another 5 min at 37 °C, and stored at 4 °C. The folding mixture was then added to 25 μl of the translocation buffer and kept at 4 °C. The translocation buffer contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μg/ml IMVs, 20 μg/ml SecA, 18 μg/ml SecB, 1 mm NADPH and 50 μm methotrexate and optionally 20 mm creatine phosphate and 20 μg/ml creatine kinase. Typically, 0.5 μg of proOmpA-DHFR was used in the translocation assay. Reactions were started by the addition of 2 mm of nucleotide in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, when indicated, samples were digested for 15 min with 0.1 mg/ml protease K on ice, and proteolysis was terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid and further incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. After 12% SDS-PAGE, labeled protein was visualized in gel with a Lumi-imager F1 (Roche Applied Science), using a bandpass filter at 520 nm. Fluorescence Assay—Spectrophotometric assays were performed in a total volume of 150 μl, by scaling up the standard translocation reaction three times but leaving out the energy-regenerating system of creatine kinase/creatine phosphate. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min, and started by the addition of 2 mm nucleotide in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction was followed in time for 10 min on an Aminco-Bowman series II spectrophotometer. Measurements were performed at 37 °C, using a 4 nm slit width. F/F0 was calculated by dividing the average emission intensity after addition of nucleotide by the average intensity before addition of nucleotide at 530 nm (±2 nm), both after subtraction of the cysteineless sample. Disulfide Cross-link Assay—The standard translocation reaction was scaled up five times and performed in a total volume of 250 μl, in the absence of DTT. After translocation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were cross-linked by the addition of 0.5 mm tetrathionate or received 10 mm DTT as a control. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. To remove nontranslocated preprotein, the reaction mixture was centrifuged through 200 μl of buffer B: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm NADPH and 50 μm methotrexate in a Beckman Airfuge at 210,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended into nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and blotted according to standard laboratory techniques, using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotting system. Blots were developed with polyclonal antibodies against proOmpA or SecY and an alkaline phosphatase assay and imaged on a Lumi-imager F1 (Roche Applied Science). Miscellaneous—Protein determinations were performed by means of the Lowry method, using the Protein DC assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. The enzyme activity of DHFR was measured using a spectrophotometric NADPH oxidation assay (37Arkowitz R.A. Joly C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ProOmpA-DHFR and Labeling of Cysteines—To generate in vitro defined translocation intermediates trapped inside the PCC, a fusion protein of proOmpA with DHFR was used as a model secretory protein. Upon the folding of the DHFR moiety, a stable translocation intermediate can be obtained after translocation of the proOmpA-DHFR into inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) (37Arkowitz R.A. Joly C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the folded DHFR, the endogenous cysteine (Cys7) is not accessible to fluorescent maleimides but becomes readily labeled upon urea denaturation of the protein. Because labeling of this position interferes with folding of DHFR, a proOmpA-DHFR mutant was used in which Cys7 of DHFR was replaced by a serine. The C7S (C334S in the proOmpA-DHFR protein) substitution did not affect the folding properties of the enzyme when refolded from a ureadenatured state, as verified by NADPH oxidation (data not shown) and protease protection (see below). In a previous study, the C7S/S42C/N49C triple mutant of DHFR was reported to be highly sensitive to protease and not able to bind the substrate analog methotrexate (43Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutations at positions 42 and 49 seem to infer the labile phenotype. Next, we introduced unique cysteines in the C-terminal tail of the cysteine-less proOmpA(C290S, C302S) fused to DHFR(C334S), further referred to as cysteine-less proOmpA-DHFR (Fig. 1). This region of proOmpA was previously found to cross-link to SecY when trapped in the PCC as a translocation intermediate (38Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, this region must be in proximity to SecY. All the proOmpA-DHFR mutants were overexpressed at high levels and purified to homogeneity. To verify the accessibility of the newly introduced cysteines, urea-denatured proteins were labeled with the Oregon Green 488 maleimide (OG) fluorophore. This reagent is very reactive toward thiols and efficiently labeled all the single cysteine proOmpA-DHFR proteins with essentially no signal with the cysteine-less proOmpA-DHFR protein ( supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). A second incubation with the spectrally distinct fluorophore Texas Red C2-maleimide indicated a labeling efficiency (>80% for all the cysteine proteins). Similar results were obtained with the fluorescent dye NBD ( supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). These results show that each of the proOmpA-DHFR proteins is labeled efficiently with a fluorophore at specific cysteine positions. In particular with NBD and to a lesser extent with OG, position-specific differences in fluorescence intensity were observed between the proOmpA-DHFR proteins in the gel, whereas the same amount of protein was loaded ( supplemental Fig. 1, A–D), and the same extent of labeling was obtained as verified by absorbance measurements. This indicates that in particular NBD is responsive to the local environment of the polypeptide chain in the gel. Generation of Fluorescent Translocation Intermediates—The fluorescently labeled proOmpA-DHFR proteins were subjected to translocation experiments, using a protease protection assay. In this assay, preproteins translocated into the IMVs become protected against digestion from externally added protease. Because of the presence of a fluorophore, translocated proteins can be visualized directly in gel after SDS-PAGE. When proOmpA-DHFR was first unfolded in urea and subsequently diluted into translocation buffer, the protein was completely translocated in the presence of ATP, yielding protease-protected proOmpA-DHFR at the expected position in the gel, i.e. 58 kDa for the cysteine proteins (Fig. 2A). However, when the DHFR moiety first was allowed to fold by pre-dilution and incubation in a buffer containing SecB and the folding ligands NADPH and methotrexate, it becomes too large to pass the channel and will not translocate to its full length. Under those conditions, the folded DHFR has the additional property that it becomes protease-resistant, and only the junction between proOmpA and folded DHFR is partially protease-accessible (37Arkowitz R.A. Joly C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, a proOmpA-DHFR translocation intermediate yields two protein bands on a gel after protease digestion, i.e. at the position of the full-length proOmpA-DHFR preprotein (58 kDa) and as protected proOmpA (37 kDa, I37) (Fig. 2C) (37Arkowitz R.A. Joly C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With all fluorescent proOmpA-DHFR proteins, the level of translocation intermediate formation was similar, showing that the presence of the label at the different positions does not dramatically alter the translocation efficiency (Fig. 2, C and D). Next, the conditions resulting in the formation of the fluorescent translocation intermediates were analyzed in more detail. The translocation intermediate was observed only after energizing the system with ATP and not when ADP or AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, were added (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 3). The amount of translocation intermediate depended on the level of SecYEG expression in the membranes, with significantly higher levels observed with membranes containing overproduced SecYEG as compared with wild-type IMVs (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 1 and 4). To show that the full-length proOmpA-DHFR protease-protected band (Fig. 2, C and E, lane 1) represents a true translocation intermediate, the preprotein was forced to shift to other intermediate positions. Here, the DHFR domain was first unfolded by removing the folding ligands by means of a centrifugation step through a sucrose cushion (37Arkowitz R.A. Joly C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Next, the sample was subjected to thermal incubation at 37 °C and mechanically sheared by bath sonication, whereupon the IMVs were protease-treated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This treatment resulted in reduced amounts of full-length proOmpA-DHFR and increased levels of proOmpA and OmpA (Fig. 3, lane 5). In addition, distinctive protease-resistant bands appeared that were smaller and larger than proOmpA (Fig. 3) and that were previously indicated as the intermediates I26 (13van der Wolk J.P.W.

Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and is also known as FXYD1. It is found in liver, skeletal muscle, and most abundantly in the cardiac sarcolemma (2Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over recent years, conclusive experimental evidence has been presented that PLM acts as a tissue-specific modulator of the Na+/K+-ATPase similar to the other members of the FXYD family, each of which is prevalent in a different tissue, summarized in several recent reviews (3Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 431-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Na+/K+-ATPase consists of a catalytic α-subunit with 10 transmembrane segments and a β-subunit involved in membrane insertion and as a modulator of transport properties (5Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, cross-linking and modeling studies revealed the direct interaction between the Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit and members of the FXYD family (γ and CHIF), which involves the binding of a single transmembrane domain into a groove formed by M2, M6, and M9 transmembrane helices of the Na+/K+-ATPase (6Lindzen M.

PLM appears to be a major control point in the function of heart cells, although its specific physiological role is unclear, complicated by the possibility that its regulatory effect on the Na+/K+-ATPase may depend on the phosphorylation state of PLM (8Mounsey J.P.

PLM knock-out mice expressed a complex response, including increased cardiac mass, larger cardiomyocytes, and ejection fractions in the absence of hypertension, whereas the overall Na+/K+-ATPase activity was reduced by 50% (11Jia L.G.

A PLM peptide of residues 12–39 comprising the transmembrane domain forms α-helical tetramers in lipid bilayers, which are tilted by less than 17° against the membrane normal (19Beevers A.J. Kukol A.

Here we present a detailed three-dimensional structure of the tetrameric transmembrane domain based on site-specific infrared dichroism (SSID) (21Kukol A. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Arkin I.T.

Each peptide contains one 1-13C=18O-labeled residue in the positions shown in boldface type.Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Peptides were mixed with dimyristoylphosphocholine lipids in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol at a ratio of ∼1:30 (w/w). Liposomes were then made by complete evaporation of the hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and the addition of water to a lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. The lipid suspension was then sonicated and subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle three times.Infrared Spectroscopy—The liposome suspensions were deposited onto a trapezoidal germanium refraction element (50 × 2 × 20 mm), and bulk water was removed under a stream of nitrogen, forming a thick film compared with the penetration depth of the IR light on the element.ATR FTIR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Tensor FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Coventry, UK) with a high sensitivity liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT/A detector. One spectrum was calculated from the average of 1000 interferograms at a resolution of 2 cm–1 per data point in the 4000 to 1000 cm–1 range of the electromagnetic spectrum In each case, the spectrum was recorded at parallel and perpendicular polarization to the plane of incidence, and the dichroic ratio was calculated as the ratio between the integrated absorption of parallel and perpendicular polarized light for the amide I absorption band centered at a wave number of 1658 cm–1 and for the 13C=18O absorption band centered at 1594 cm–1. For each labeled peptide, at least three independent measurements were taken.Data Analysis—The spectra were analyzed according to the theory of SSID presented elsewhere (22Kukol A. Spectroscopy. 2005; 19: 1-16Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Kass I. Arbely E. Arkin I.T. Biophys.

Briefly, the dichroic ratios of the amide I absorption band and the absorption band of the label for two peptides with labels in positions 1 and 2 were analyzed together in order to obtain the local helix tilt angle β and the rotational pitch angle ω for the label in position 1. Another peptide with a label in position 3 was analyzed in order to give the orientational parameters for position 2, and so on. In that way, the following pairs of labels were analyzed: Gly20/Leu21, Leu21/Val22, Val22/Ile23, Ile23/Gly25, Gly25/Ile26, Ile26/Leu27, Leu27/Gly31, Gly31/Ile32, Ile32/Leu33.The angle between the C=O bond and the z axis θz used as orientational constraint was calculated as cosθz = cosαcosβ – sinαsinβcos(ω + 17°), with α = 180° – 38° = 142° denoting the angle between the transition dipole moment and the molecular director given by Marsh et al. (30Marsh D. Muller M. Schmitt F.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2499-2510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All calculations were carried out using the Mathematica 5 software (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL).High Throughput Molecular Dynamics Conformational Searching—The conformational search of PLM tetrameric helical bundles was carried out as described elsewhere for a dimeric system (23Beevers A.J.

Briefly, α-helical bundles were generated by symmetrically rotating the helices in 10° increments in order to produce an array of starting structures for MD simulation. Both left- and right-handed crossing bundles (crossing angle of ±25°) were generated, giving 72 different orientations, with each being simulated at four different initial random velocities, resulting in a total of 288 starting structures. Each structure was subjected to a 200-ps MD simulation using the GROMACS software (31Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol.

The initial coordinates of the dimyristoylphosphocholine bilayer were obtained from Gurtovenko et al. (32Gurtovenko A.A. Patra M. Karrttunen M. Vattulainen I. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3461-3472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Constraints were placed on each α-helical bundle, and the angle between the z axis and the C=O bond of the label was constrained to the derived value from SSID. The local tilt angle was also constrained by defining the angle between the z axis and a vector between the Cα atoms of the residue in question and a residue seven positions along in the helix. Also, since the peptide is known to be α-helical (as detected from IR), the distances between hydrogen-bonding pairs of amine hydrogens and carbonyl oxygens were constrained between 1.6 and 2.3 nm, and a harmonic potential was applied outside these boundaries. All constraints were added to the GROMACS force field with a force constant of 5000 kJ mol–1. For the unconstrained search, the same procedure was followed without applying any constraints. All MD simulations were performed in parallel on an eight-node dual 2.66-GHz Xeon processor cluster (Streamline Computing, Warwick, UK).Clustering of Structures—Cα root mean square deviation comparisons were made between all resulting structures from the search. Structures were then clustered according to their root mean square deviation values. The adopted criteria for structure clustering were that of a maximum root mean square deviation value of 2 Å between two structures. For a cluster to be created, a minimum of five structures possessing root mean square deviation values within this limit was required.The structures contributing to this cluster were then used to create an average structure, which was subjected to experimentally constrained MD simulation for 2 ns in a lipid bilayer followed by energy minimization.RESULTSATR Infrared Spectroscopy—Altogether, 10 PLM transmembrane peptides containing residues 12–39 with 13C=18O-labeled residues in the positions indicated in Fig. 1 have been reconstituted in dimyristoylphosphocholine vesicles and analyzed by polarized attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. The symmetric amide I absorption band centered at ∼1658 cm–1 revealed that in all cases, the peptide adopted a predominantly α-helical conformation (33Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar), confirming earlier observations (19Beevers A.J. Kukol A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The absorption band of the labeled sites centered at 1594 cm–1 showed that the label is also in an α-helical environment (26Torres J. Kukol A. Goodman J.M. Arkin I.T. Biopolymers. 2001; 59: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In some cases, a shoulder existed at 1618 cm–1 (Fig. 1) representing the absorption of a residue with a 13C=16O carbonyl bond, which is caused by incomplete labeling of the amino acid with H 182O prior to peptide synthesis. However, in all cases, the 13C=18O bond was of sufficient intensity for analysis.The dichroic ratio of the amide I peak varied from 2.5 to 4.2, depending on sample order, whereas the dichroic ratio of the 13C=18O peak varied from 2.1 to 5.8, depending on position and sample order. The dichroic ratio of the label is in all cases different from the dichroic ratio of the unlabeled amide I peak, which is indicative of oligomerization. A label in a monomeric helix would adopt an average dichroic ratio similar to the unlabeled residues due to rotational symmetry with respect to the membrane normal. The local helix tilt shows variation between (3 ± 4)° and (10 ± 4)°, whereas the change in rotational pitch angle ω is in the region of 100° for successive residues in accordance with α-helical geometry (Table 1). The angle between the C=O bond and the z axis, calculated from ω and β, is used as an experimental constraint for the MD simulation.TABLE 1Experimentally determined orientations: rotational pitch angle ω, local tilt angle β, and the derived angle of the carbonyl bond to the z axis θ for all labels in the transmembrane domain, calculated from the SSID dataLabelβωθdegreesdegreesdegreesGly208.96440.2Leu218.311944.3Val224.923536.8Ile238.832746.6Gly258.720632.0Ile2610.130246.0Leu276.21543.4Gly312.521336.4Ile327.329843.4 Open table in a new tab Constrained High Throughput MD—At each stage of the MD simulation and energy minimization, a total of 37 experimental constraints have been applied, composed of nine orientational constraints obtained from SSID of 10 labeled peptides (Table 1), in order to set the local helix tilt and distance constraints between the carbonyl oxygen of residue n and the amide hydrogen of residue n + 4 in order to maintain the experimentally determined α-helical geometry, although unconstrained simulations of helices in lipid bilayers have shown that α-helices are retained even after long term MD simulations (23Beevers A.J.

Following the MD simulation of 72 different starting structures, each at four different random initial atom velocities (288 simulations), a cluster analysis provided six structures (Fig. 2). Of these, structure 6 showed the closest agreement with the rotational pitch angles obtained from SSID experiments (Table 2), although structure 6 was of slightly higher energy than other structures. It is generally accepted that similarity to experimental studies is a far more accurate determinant than force field energy.FIGURE 2A, polar plot of the energies of structures obtained from MD simulation of PLM in dependence of the helix rotation angle ϕ changing clockwise from 0 to 360°.

This is in accordance with previous conventional ATR-FTIR experiments, which indicated an average tilt angle between 0° and 17° (19Beevers A.J. Kukol A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), if the sample order is not taken into account.FIGURE 3Resulting structure (structure 6) from MD simulation.

This region does not possess any constraints, and therefore this effect is most likely due to the greater freedom of movement these residues will have. The center of structure 6 is occluded by interactions between residues Tyr27, Gln31, Leu35, Phe42, Ile46, Leu50, and Arg53.Unconstrained High Throughput MD—In order to explore the range of all possible packing models of PLM in lipid bilayers, we performed a high throughput MD search without any constraints applied. In this simulation, we found nine clusters of structures and calculated an average structure for each cluster (Fig. 4A). The starting structure for the helix rotation ϕ = 0° is the same as shown in Fig. 2B. Each cluster average structure reveals a well packed α-helical tetramer. In order to find a model that would support the experiments of PLM ion channel activity, we analyzed visually each structure for the possibility of the formation of a hydrophilic pathway through the center of the tetramer. For most structures, the center of the tetramer is completely occluded by interactions between several residues, but in structure number 4 only the side chains of Val34 and Tyr27 occlude the center of the structure as shown in Fig. 4B, whereas other side chains are either pointing to the outside or are involved in close packing interaction at the helix-helix interface. Tyr27 is located in the water phase at the N-terminal end of the peptide and shows a high conformational flexibility in MD simulations and thus would not contribute significantly to occlusion of the pore, whereas Val34 is located in the transmembrane domain. Structure number 4 has the lowest energy of all unconstrained packing models of –1299 kJ, whereas the next lowest energy structure is structure 3 with –1253 kJ.FIGURE 4A, polar plot of the energies of structures obtained from MD simulation of PLM in dependence of the helix rotation angle ϕ changing clockwise from 0 to 360°.

This is caused on the one hand by the interplay between the experimental constraints and the tendency of the structure to adopt an energy minimum in the “imperfect” computational force field, which also takes into account side chain packing and protein-lipid interaction, for which we have no experimental data. On the other hand, the rotational pitch angle for a residue is a derived parameter assuming ideal α-helix geometry, which is not the case for PLM and other helices; thus, calculation of this angle leads to deviations, whereas the angles between the C=O bond and the z axis used as actual constraints in the simulation were matched precisely (data not shown). However, since the rotational pitch angle of a residue defines the interaction side of helices in a bundle, comparisons based on this angle have been proven most reliable, even allowing the determination of the preferred oligomerization state (34Kukol A.

In our model, the residues Ile18, Gly19, and Gly20 all point outward toward the lipid environment and therefore do not form interhelical interactions; however, the Leu21 residues are in the interior of the α-helical complex and appear to pack uniformly. The Leu36 and Ser37 residues protrude outward into the surrounding environment; however, this region is in the water phase. In the residue"
https://openalex.org/W2075029742,"Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and phosphophoryn (PP) are the two noncollagenous proteins classically linked to dentin but more recently found in bone, kidney, and salivary glands. These two proteins are derived from a single copy DSP-PP gene. Although this suggests that the DSP-PP gene is first transcribed into DSP-PP mRNAs, which later undergo processing to yield the DSP and PP proteins, this mechanism has not yet been demonstrated because of the inability to identify a DSP-PP precursor protein from any cell or tissue sample. To study this problem, we utilized a baculovirus expression system to produce recombinant DSP-PP precursor proteins from a DSP-PP240 cDNA, which represents one of several endogenous DSP-PP transcripts that influence various tooth mineralization phases. Our in vitro results demonstrate that DSP-PP240 precursor proteins are produced by this system and are capable of self-processing to yield both DSP and PP proteins. We further demonstrated that purified recombinant DSP-PP240, purified recombinant PP240, and the native highly phosphorylated protein (equivalent to the PP523 isoform) have proteolytic activity. These newly identified tissue proteases may play key roles in tissue modeling during organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2163376410,"Transcription antitermination by N proteins of lambdoid phages involves specific interactions of the C-terminal domain of N with the elongation complex (EC). The interacting surface of N on the EC is unknown, knowledge of which is essential to understand the mechanism of antitermination. Specific cleavage patterns were generated near the active site Mg2+of the RNA polymerase of an N-modified stalled EC using iron-(S)-1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)ethylenediaminetetraacetate conjugated to the only cysteine residue in the C-terminal domain of N from a lambdoid phage H-19B. Modification of EC by N also induced conformational changes around the same region as revealed from the limited trypsin digestion and in situ Fe-dithiothreitol cleavage pattern of the same EC. These data, together with the previously obtained H-19B N-specific mutations in RNA polymerase, β (G1045D), and β′ (P251S, P254L, G336S, and R270C) subunits, suggest that the active center cleft of the EC could be the site of action of this antiterminator. H-19B N induced altered interactions in this region of EC, prevented the backtracking of the stalled EC at the ops pause site and destabilized RNA hairpin-β subunit flap domain interactions at the his pause site. We propose that the physical proximity of the C-terminal domain of H-19B N to the active center cleft of the EC is required for the process of transcription antitermination and that it involves both stabilization of the weak RNA-DNA hybrid at a terminator and destabilization of the interactions of terminator hairpin in the RNA exit channel."
https://openalex.org/W2138302670,"In the absence of mitogenic stimuli, cells normally arrest in G(1/0), because they fail to pass the G1-restriction point. However, abrogation of the G1-restriction point (by loss of the retinoblastoma gene family) reveals a second-restriction point that arrests cells in G2. Serum-starvation-induced G2 arrest is effectuated through inhibitory interactions of p27(KIP1) and p21(CIP1) with cyclins A and B1 and can be reversed through mitogen re-addition. In this study, we have investigated the pathways that allow cell cycle re-entry from this G2 arrest. We provide evidence that recovery from G2 arrest depends on the rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways and show that oncogenic hits, such as overexpression of c-MYC or mutational activation of RAS can abrogate the G2-restriction point. Together, our results provide new mechanistic insight into multistep carcinogenesis."
