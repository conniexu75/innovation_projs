Here we demonstrate that BX795, a potent and relatively specific inhibitor of TBK1 and IKKϵ, blocked the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of interferon regulatory factor 3 and, hence, the production of interferon-β in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast, BX795 had no effect on the canonical NFκB signaling pathway. Although BX795 blocked the autophosphorylation of overexpressed TBK1 and IKKϵ at Ser-172 and, hence, the autoactivation of these protein kinases, it did not inhibit the phosphorylation of endogenous TBK1 and IKKϵ at Ser-172 in response to LPS, poly(I:C), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), or tumor necrosis factor α and actually enhanced the LPS, poly(I:C), and IL-1α-stimulated phosphorylation of this residue. These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Ser-172 and the activation of TBK1 and IKKϵ are catalyzed by a distinct protein kinase(s) in vivo and that TBK1 and IKKϵ control a feedback loop that limits their activation by LPS, poly(I:C) and IL-1α (but not tumor necrosis factor α) to prevent the hyperactivation of these enzymes.

IntroductionInvading bacteria and viruses are sensed by the host pattern recognition receptors, which bind components of these organisms, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns to pattern recognition receptors activates signaling cascades that culminate in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferons, which are released from immune cells into the circulation, where they mount responses to combat the invading pathogen (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8550) Google Scholar). The interaction between pathogen-associated molecular patterns and pattern recognition receptors leads invariably to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 3The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; MAP3K, MAPK kinase kinase; ASK1, apoptosis-stimulating kinase-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IFN, interferon; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; JNK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; TAK1, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GST, glutathione S-transferase. kinases, termed p38 MAP kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK1/2) and the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The latter contains the protein kinases IKKα and IKKβ, which switch on the transcription factor NFκB and, hence, NFκB-dependent gene transcription, by phosphorylating IκBα and other IκB isoforms (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). IKKβ also activates the protein kinase Tpl2 by phosphorylating its p105 regulatory subunit, leading to the activation of two other MAP kinases, termed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 (3Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Together, the MAP kinases and NFκB regulate the production of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.A subset of pattern recognition receptors, namely Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 (TLR3, TLR4) and the cytosolic receptors RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), also activate a distinct signaling pathway requiring the IKK-related kinases, IKKϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) (5Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 6Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Early studies, largely based on overexpression experiments, suggested that a major role of TBK1 and IKKϵ was to activate NFκB and NFκB-dependent gene transcription, and for this reason, TBK1 has also been called NFκB-activating kinase (7Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Nature. 2000; 404: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, later studies using cells from mice that do not express TBK1 and/or IKKϵ failed to support this conclusion (10Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 11Perry A.K. Chow E.K. Goodnough J.B. Yeh W.C. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Instead, they indicated that these protein kinases play an essential role in regulating the production of type I interferons (IFNs) by phosphorylating the transcription factor, termed interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (10Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 11Perry A.K. Chow E.K. Goodnough J.B. Yeh W.C. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions IRF3 is cytosolic, but after the TBK1/IKKϵ-mediated phosphorylation of its C terminus, IRF3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates a gene transcription program leading to the production of IFN-β (12McWhirter S.M. Fitzgerald K.A. Rosains J. Rowe D.C. Golenbock D.T. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 13Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M.

The production of IFN-β may additionally require the TBK1/IKKϵ-catalyzed phosphorylation of other proteins, such as the Dead-box RNA-helicase DDX3 (14Schroder M. Baran M. Bowie A.G. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Soulat D. Burckstummer T. Westermayer S. Goncalves A. Bauch A. Stefanovic A. Hantschel O. Bennett K.L. Decker T. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and MITA (16Zhong B. Yang Y. Li S. Wang Y.Y. Li Y. Diao F. Lei C. He X. Zhang L. Tien P. Shu H.B. Immunity. 2008; 29: 538-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). IKKϵ has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of the STAT1 transcription factor at Ser-708 in a pathway that protects cells against infection by influenza A virus (17Tenoever B.R. Ng S.L. Chua M.A. McWhirter S.M. Garcia-Sastre A. Maniatis T. Science. 2007; 315: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).However, mouse knock-out studies are not always definitive because the complete loss of a protein kinase(s) may be compensated for by other protein kinases, whereas the prolonged absence of a protein kinase may result in long term changes in gene transcription programs so that the effects observed may be indirect. The embryonic lethality of the TBK1 knock-out mouse also limits its use in understanding the physiological roles of this protein kinase. Moreover, papers continue to be published proposing roles for TBK1 and IKKϵ in phosphorylating defined sites on the RelA and c-Rel components of the NFκB transcription complex that are thought to control the expression of a subset of NFκB-dependent genes (18Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55633-55643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 19Mattioli I. Geng H. Sebald A.

Hiscott J. Grandvaux N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, there is considerable evidence that TBK1 and IKKϵ play additional roles in cells. For instance, TBK1 is activated by TNF, and TBK1 knock-out mice die just before birth because the fetal hepatocytes undergo TNFα-induced apoptosis (21Bonnard M. Mirtsos C. Suzuki S. Graham K. Huang J. Ng M. Itie A. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Henzel W.J. Elia A.J. Shillinglaw W. Mak T.W. Cao Z. Yeh W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations imply that TBK1 plays a key role in preventing apoptosis in the fetal hepatocytes of wild type mice. TBK1 is also reported to be activated by hypoxia and to control the production of angiogenic factors, such as vasoendothelial growth factor (22Korherr C. Gille H. Schafer R. Koenig-Hoffmann K. Dixelius J. Egland K.A. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the overexpression of IKKϵ in breast cancer lines is reported to contribute a survival signal to the transformed cells (23Boehm J.S. Zhao J.J. Yao J. Kim S.Y. Firestein R. Dunn I.F. Sjostrom S.K. Garraway L.A. Weremowicz S. Richardson A.L. Greulich H. Stewart C.J. Mulvey L.A. Shen R.R. Ambrogio L. Hirozane-Kishikawa T. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Meyerson M. Grenier J.K. Hinkle G. Root D.E. Roberts T.M. Lander E.S. Polyak K. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1065-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The direct substrates of TBK1 and IKKϵ or molecular pathways underlying any of these responses and the possible roles of these protein kinases in the pathogenesis of human cancer are unknown.The identification of the physiological substrates and biological roles of protein kinases has been greatly aided by the use of relatively specific, small cell-permeable inhibitors of these enzymes. These compounds can be used simply and rapidly and provide a complementary approach to the use of mouse knockouts or RNA interference technology, avoiding the potential drawbacks in ablating the expression of a protein kinase that were mentioned above. The compound BX795 was originally developed as a small molecule inhibitor of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) (24Feldman R.I. Wu J.M. Polokoff M.A. Kochanny M.J. Dinter H. Zhu D. Biroc S.L. Alicke B. Bryant J. Yuan S. Buckman B.O. Lentz D. Ferrer M. Whitlow M. Adler M. Finster S. Chang Z. Arnaiz D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19867-19874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but we recently found that it also inhibited TBK1 and IKKϵ at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro (25Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Moreover, BX795 only inhibited a few other protein kinases significantly out of 70 tested and, importantly, did not inhibit IKKβ (25Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that BX795 might be the first pharmacological inhibitor suitable for studying the regulation and roles of TBK1 and IKKϵ in cells. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of this compound and exploit it to show that, unexpectedly, the activation of TBK1 and IKKϵ is not an autophosphorylation event but is mediated by a distinct “upstream” protein kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—BX795 was synthesized as described (25Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar), dissolved in DMSO, and stored as a 10 mm solution at –20 °C. Poly(I:C) and LPS were from InvivoGen, and mouse IL-1α and TNFα were from Sigma.DNA Constructs—TBK1 (NCBI NP_037386.1) was amplified from IMAGE EST 5492519 (Geneservice) using KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen). The PCR product was cloned into pSC-b (Stratagene) and sequenced to completion. The insert was excised using BamHI and NotI and inserted into pCMV-FLAG-1 or pEBG6P to generate FLAG-TBK1 and GST-TBK1, respectively. IKKϵ (NCBI NP_054721.1) was cloned in a similar manner using IMAGE EST 3062062. Point mutations were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) but using KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase. IRF3 (GenBank™ CAA91227.1) was amplified by PCR using IMAGE EST 5494536, ligated with pSC-b, and sequenced. The insert was subcloned into NotI sites of pGEX6P-2. PRDII (NFκB) and PRDIII-I (IRF3) elements from the IFN-β promoter cloned into the pLuc-MCS vector were a kind gift from Katherine Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts). pTK-RL was obtained from Stratagene.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR3-FLAG (termed HEK293-TLR3 cells) were provided by Katherine Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts), immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were from wild type mice, and mice expressing a truncated, inactive form of TAK1 (26Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) were provided by Professor Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Japan). HEK293-TLR3, RAW264.7 cells (hereafter termed RAW cells) and MEFS were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin. Bone-marrow derived macrophages were generated from mice as described (27Ananieva O. Darragh J. Johansen C. Carr J.M. McIlrath J. Park J.M. Wingate A. Monk C.E. Toth R. Santos S.G. Iversen L. Arthur J.S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Antibodies—Antibodies were raised in sheep against the human TBK1 protein expressed in insect Sf21 cells (Sheep S041C, bleed 2) (25Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal peptide of mouse IKKϵ (NRLIERLHRVPSAPDV) (Sheep S277C, bleed 2) and used for immunoprecipitation. The phosphopeptide CEKFVS*VYGTE (where S* indicates phosphoserine) corresponding to the sequence surrounding Ser-172 of TBK1 and IKKϵ was used to generate an antibody that immunoprecipitated the phosphorylated forms of these protein kinases (Sheep S051C, bleed 2). The phosphopeptide was coupled separately to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin, then mixed and injected into sheep at Diagnostics Scotland (Edinburgh, UK). The antisera were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized TBK1 or the peptide antigen, respectively, in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (University of Dundee. The phospho-specific antibody was incubated with the unphosphorylated form of the peptide immunogen (10 μg of peptide per μg of antibody) before use to neutralize any antibodies recognizing the unphosphorylated forms of TBK1 and IKKϵ. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Research Diagnostics Inc.), anti-GST (Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce), anti-IRF3, anti-TAK1 (Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG, anti-IKKϵ (Sigma), anti-TBK1, anti-TANK and anti-IκBα (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Ser-933 (Ser(P)-933) of p105 (NFκB1), Ser(P)-32/Ser(P)-36 of IκBα, Ser(P)-468 of RelA, Ser(P)-536 of RelA, Ser(P)-396 of IRF3, the Thr(P)-Glu-Tyr(P) sequence of ERK1 and ERK2, the Thr(P)-Gly-Tyr(P) sequence of p38 MAP kinases and a pan-PDK1 phosphorylation site antibody which recognizes the phosphorylated activation loop (Thr(P)-229) of S6 kinase 1 (28Collins B.J. Deak M. Murray-Tait V. Storey K.G. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5023-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were also from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibody recognizing the Thr(P)-Pro-Tyr(P) sequence of JNK1/2 was from BIOSOURCE, whereas that recognizing Ser(P)-172 of TBK1 was from BD Biosciences.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Pharmacological inhibitors dissolved in DMSO or an equivalent volume of DMSO for control incubations were added to the culture medium of cells grown as monolayers. After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were stimulated with LPS, poly(I:C), IL-1α, or TNFα as described in all the figure legends. Thereafter, the cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerol 1-phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.27 m sucrose, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 1 mg of cell extract protein with 10 μg of antibody for 90 min at 4 °C followed by the addition of Protein G-Sepharose. After mixing for 15 min at 4 °C and brief centrifugation, the immunocomplexes were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, denatured in SDS, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To detect proteins in cell lysates, 40 μg of protein extract was separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, proteins were detected by immunoblotting and visualized by treating the blots with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography.Protein Kinase Assays—IRF3 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. Endogenous TBK1 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysate protein using the sheep anti-TBK1 (sheep S041C, bleed 2) antibody and overexpressed FLAG-TBK1 with an anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate and then resuspended in the same buffer containing 2 μm GST-IRF3 (endogenous TBK1) or the peptide KKKKERLLDDRHDSGLDSMKDEE (0.3 mm), corresponding to the sequence surrounding Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα, plus four lysine residues at the N terminus to facilitate binding to phosphocellulose paper (termed IκBα peptide substrate). Assays were initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. When GST-IRF3 was used as the substrate, the reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of SDS containing 40 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, heated for 5 min at 100 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Quantification was performed by phosphorimaging analysis. For assays with the IκBα substrate peptide, reactions were terminated after 10 min at 30 °C by spotting an aliquot of the reaction on to a 2 × 2-cm2 piece of phosphocellulose P81 paper (Whatman) followed by immersion in 75 mm phosphoric acid. After washing six times in phosphoric acid and once in acetone, the papers were dried and counted. One unit of TBK1 activity was defined as that amount of enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphate into substrate in 1 min.Luciferase Assays—Cells were co-transfected with PRD(II)2 or PRD(III-I)3-pLuc-MCS and pTK-RL plasmid DNA. 24 h later cells were stimulated and extracted in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with a dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Measurement of IFN-β Production—Cells were treated for 1 h with or without inhibitors then stimulated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS or 10 μg/ml poly(I:C). The cell culture medium was removed and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the concentration of mouse IFN-β was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's protocol.Microscopy—Cells seeded on glass coverslips were serum-starved overnight before stimulation with poly(I:C). The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described (29Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G. Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. van Leeuwen F.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using anti-IRF3 (1:100; Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with Alexa546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes). The cells were then visualized using a Zeiss-LSM 510-meta microscope fitted with an alpha Plan-Fluar 100x/1.45 oil objective.Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences between experimental groups was assessed with Student's t test. Differences in means were considered significant if p < 0.05.RESULTSSpecificity of BX795 in Vitro—We reported previously that six protein kinases were inhibited by >90% in vitro in the presence of 0.1 μm BX795, namely TBK1, IKKϵ, PDK1, Aurora B, ERK8, and MARK3, but 60 other protein kinases tested were unaffected or only slightly inhibited at this concentration (25Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). The IC50 values for these six protein kinases are shown in Table 1. MARK3 is a member of the subgroup of protein kinases that include the AMP-activated protein kinase. In the present study we found that the other MARK isoforms (MARK1, MARK2, and MARK4) and another AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinase (NUAK1) were inhibited with similar potency to MARK3 (Table 1). We also studied the effect of BX795 on a number of additional kinases not examined previously. These experiments showed that BX795 did not inhibit the following protein-tyrosine kinases at 1 μm: ephrin receptors A2 and B3, Syk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. However, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor was inhibited, albeit much less potently than TBK1 (Table 1). We reported previously that BX795 did not inhibit IKKβ (25Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar), and in the present study we found that the IKKα isoform is also unaffected at 1 μm in vitro (results not shown). For reasons discussed later, we also examined the effect of BX795 on a number of MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) and MAP kinase kinase kinases (termed MAP3Ks). At 1 μm, BX795 did not inhibit MKK1, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, and MKK7, or the MAP3Ks Tpl2 and c-Raf (results not shown) but did potently inhibit the mixed lineage kinases, termed MLK1 (MAP3K9), MLK2 (MAP3K10), and MLK3 (MAP3K11)) (Table 1). MAP3K7, also called transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), and MAP3K5, also called apoptosis-stimulating kinase-1 (ASK1), were inhibited >100-fold less potently than TBK1 (Table 1). The ability of BX795 to inhibit the TBK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser-396 declined as the ATP concentration in the assay was increased (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that BX795 is an ATP competitive inhibitor of TBK1 as is the case for PDK1 (24Feldman R.I.

IRF3 migrated as a doublet in unstimulated cells. Stimulation with poly(I:C), a synthetic TLR3 agonist, led to the appearance of a more slowly migrating species whose level became maximal after 2 h (Fig. 1A). The appearance of this species, which has been shown by others to result from phosphorylation (30Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), was prevented by prior incubation with BX795 (Fig. 1A). We also observed that IRF3 accumulated in the nucleus on a similar time scale after poly(I:C) treatment, which was blocked by BX795 (Fig. 1B). The next step in this pathway is IRF3-stimulated gene transcription. As expected from the results presented above, BX795 inhibited IRF3-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 1C). Finally, BX795 blocked the secretion of IFN-β from macrophages whether stimulated by LPS, a TLR4 agonist (Fig. 1, D and E), or poly(I:C) (Fig. 1E).BX795 was originally developed as an inhibitor the protein kinase PDK1, but BX795 had no effect on the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 at Thr-229, the site that is targeted by PDK1 (31Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), under conditions where it completely blocked the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser-396 (Fig. 1F). This experiment demonstrated that TBK1/IKKϵ was inhibited much more potently than PDK1 by BX795 in cells and excluded the possibility that BX795 suppressed the activation of IRF3 and production of IFN-β by inhibiting PDK1.BX795 Does Not Affect Activation of the IKKα/β Complex or NFκB-dependent Gene Transcription by LPS, poly(I:C), IL-1α, or TNFα—The question of whether TBK1 and IKKϵ play a role in regulating NFκB-dependent gene transcription is an issue that is still not fully resolved (see the Introduction). We, therefore, studied the effect of BX795 on the activation of NFκB and NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity. Under conditions where BX795 completely blocked the LPS (Fig. 2A)- or poly(I:C)-stimulated (Fig. 2B) phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser-396, this compound did not affect the phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36 or degradation of the IκBα inhibitory component of the NFκB transcription complex or the phosphorylation at Ser-933 of the p105 (NFκB1) regulatory subunit of the protein kinase Tpl2 (Fig. 2, A and B), which are established physiological substrates of the IKKα/β complex. These results demonstrated that BX795 did not inhibit any of the steps involved in the LPS- or poly(I:C)-stimulated activation of the IKKα/β complex or the ability of IKKα/β to phosphorylate downstream substrates. Nor did BX795 inhibit the LPS- or poly(I:C)-stimulated phosphorylation of the RelA component of the NFκB transcription factor at Ser-468 and Ser-536 (Fig. 2, A and B), amino acid residues reported to become phosphorylated when TBK1 and/or IKKϵ were overexpressed in cells (18"

Here we show that E-selectin is crucial for generating a secondary wave of activating signals, transduced specifically by E-selectin ligand-1, that induces polarized, activated alpha(M)beta(2) integrin clusters at the leading edge of crawling neutrophils, allowing capture of circulating erythrocytes or platelets. In a humanized mouse model of sickle cell disease, the capture of erythrocytes by alpha(M)beta(2) microdomains leads to acute lethal vascular occlusions. In a model of transfusion-related acute lung injury, polarized neutrophils capture circulating platelets, resulting in the generation of oxidative species that produce vascular damage and lung injury. Inactivation of E-selectin or alpha(M)beta(2) prevents tissue injury in both inflammatory models, suggesting broad implications of this paradigm in thromboinflammatory diseases. These results indicate that endothelial selectins can influence neutrophil behavior beyond its canonical rolling step through delayed, organ-damaging, polarized activation."
https://openalex.org/W2082031245,"PsbS plays a major role in activating the photoprotection mechanism known as ""non-photochemical quenching,"" which dissipates chlorophyll excited states exceeding the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport. PsbS activity is known to be triggered by low lumenal pH. However, the molecular mechanism by which this subunit regulates light harvesting efficiency is still unknown. Here we show that PsbS controls the association/dissociation of a five-subunit membrane complex, composed of two monomeric Lhcb proteins (CP29 and CP24) and the trimeric LHCII-M. Dissociation of this supercomplex is indispensable for the onset of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching in high light, strongly suggesting that protein subunits catalyzing the reaction of heat dissipation are buried into the complex and thus not available for interaction with PsbS. Consistently, we showed that knock-out mutants on two subunits participating to the B4C complex were strongly affected in heat dissipation. Direct observation by electron microscopy and image analysis showed that B4C dissociation leads to the redistribution of PSII within grana membranes. We interpreted these results to mean that the dissociation of B4C makes quenching sites, possibly CP29 and CP24, available for the switch to an energy-quenching conformation. These changes are reversible and do not require protein synthesis/degradation, thus allowing for changes in PSII antenna size and adaptation to rapidly changing environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2157648093,"The leukocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is key to normal host defense mechanisms. Dysregulated MPO, however, is linked to acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis and cancer. The authors describe a luminol-based bioluminescence imaging system that provides an optical readout of physiological levels of MPO activity in vivo. The system is demonstrated in animal models of acute dermatitis, focal arthritis and spontaneous large granular lymphocytic tumors. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) system of activated phagocytes is central to normal host defense mechanisms, and dysregulated MPO contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease states ranging from atherosclerosis to cancer. Here we show that upon systemic administration, the small molecule luminol enables noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of MPO activity in vivo. Luminol-BLI allowed quantitative longitudinal monitoring of MPO activity in animal models of acute dermatitis, mixed allergic contact hypersensitivity, focal arthritis and spontaneous large granular lymphocytic tumors. Bioluminescence colocalized with histological sites of inflammation and was totally abolished in gene-deleted Mpo−/− mice, despite massive tissue infiltration of neutrophils and activated eosinophils, indicating that eosinophil peroxidase did not contribute to luminol-BLI in vivo. Thus, luminol-BLI provides a noninvasive, specific and highly sensitive optical readout of phagocyte-mediated MPO activity in vivo and may enable new diagnostic applications in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1989441414,"RNA silencing functions as an important antiviral defense mechanism in a broad range of eukaryotes. In plants, biogenesis of several classes of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) requires RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RDR) activities. Members of the RDR family proteins, including RDR1and RDR6, have also been implicated in antiviral defense, although a direct role for RDRs in viral siRNA biogenesis has yet to be demonstrated. Using a crucifer-infecting strain of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV-Cg) and Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, we analyzed the viral small RNA profile in wild-type plants as well as rdr mutants by applying small RNA deep sequencing technology. Over 100,000 TMV-Cg-specific small RNA reads, mostly of 21- (78.4%) and 22-nucleotide (12.9%) in size and originating predominately (79.9%) from the genomic sense RNA strand, were captured at an early infection stage, yielding the first high-resolution small RNA map for a plant virus. The TMV-Cg genome harbored multiple, highly reproducible small RNA-generating hot spots that corresponded to regions with no apparent local hairpin-forming capacity. Significantly, both the rdr1 and rdr6 mutants exhibited globally reduced levels of viral small RNA production as well as reduced strand bias in viral small RNA population, revealing an important role for these host RDRs in viral siRNA biogenesis. In addition, an informatics analysis showed that a large set of host genes could be potentially targeted by TMV-Cg-derived siRNAs for posttranscriptional silencing. Two of such predicted host targets, which encode a cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) and an unknown protein similar to translocon-associated protein alpha (TRAP alpha), respectively, yielded a positive result in cleavage validation by 5'RACE assays. Our data raised the interesting possibility for viral siRNA-mediated virus-host interactions that may contribute to viral pathogenicity and host specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2139174791,"Research into the metabolic phenotype of autism has been relatively unexplored despite the fact that metabolic abnormalities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several other neurobehavioral disorders. Plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress have been reported in autistic children; however, intracellular redox status has not yet been evaluated. Lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) derived from autistic children and unaffected controls were used to assess relative concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized disulfide glutathione (GSSG) in cell extracts and isolated mitochondria as a measure of intracellular redox capacity. The results indicated that the GSH/GSSG redox ratio was decreased and percentage oxidized glutathione increased in both cytosol and mitochondria in the autism LCLs. Exposure to oxidative stress via the sulfhydryl reagent thimerosal resulted in a greater decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio and increase in free radical generation in autism compared to control cells. Acute exposure to physiological levels of nitric oxide decreased mitochondrial membrane potential to a greater extent in the autism LCLs, although GSH/GSSG and ATP concentrations were similarly decreased in both cell lines. These results suggest that the autism LCLs exhibit a reduced glutathione reserve capacity in both cytosol and mitochondria that may compromise antioxidant defense and detoxification capacity under prooxidant conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2108696643,"The fusion between EWS and ETS family members is a key oncogenic event in Ewing tumors and important EWS-FLI1 target genes have been identified. However, until now, the search for EWS-FLI1 targets has been limited to promoter regions and no genome-wide comprehensive analysis of in vivo EWS-FLI1 binding sites has been undertaken. Using a ChIP-Seq approach to investigate EWS-FLI1-bound DNA sequences in two Ewing cell lines, we show that this chimeric transcription factor preferentially binds two types of sequences including consensus ETS motifs and microsatellite sequences. Most bound sites are found outside promoter regions. Microsatellites containing more than 9 GGAA repeats are very significantly enriched in EWS-FLI1 immunoprecipitates. Moreover, in reporter gene experiments, the transcription activation is highly dependent upon the number of repeats that are included in the construct. Importantly, in vivo EWS-FLI1-bound microsatellites are significantly associated with EWS-FLI1-driven gene activation. Put together, these results point out the likely contribution of microsatellite elements to long-distance transcription regulation and to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1974917583,"Excessive activation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways has been linked to prostate cancer metastasis. Rac activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) plays an important role in directional cell migration, a critical step of tumor metastasis cascades. We found that the upregulation of P-Rex1, a Rac-selective GEF synergistically activated by Gbetagamma freed during GPCR signaling, and PIP3, generated during either RTK or GPCR signaling, strongly correlates with metastatic phenotypes in both prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer specimens. Silencing endogenous P-Rex1 in metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells selectively inhibited Rac activity and reduced cell migration and invasion in response to ligands of both epidermal growth factor receptor and G-protein-coupled CXC chemokine receptor 4. Conversely, expression of recombinant P-Rex1, but not its 'GEF-dead' mutant, in non-metastatic prostate cancer cells, such as CWR22Rv1, increased cell migration and invasion through Rac-dependent lamellipodia formation. More importantly, using a mouse xenograft model, we showed that the expression of P-Rex1, but not its mutant, induced lymph node metastasis of CWR22Rv1 cells without an effect on primary tumor growth. Thus, by functioning as a coincidence detector of chemotactic signals from both GPCRs and RTKs, P-Rex1-dependent activation of Rac promotes prostate cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2147375005,"Background The stress hormone corticosterone has the ability both to enhance and suppress synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes. However, until today there is very little known about the molecular mechanism that underlies the bidirectional effects of stress and corticosteroid hormones on synaptic efficacy and learning and memory processes. In this study we investigate the relationship between corticosterone and AMPA receptors which play a critical role in activity-dependent plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning. Methodology/Principal Findings Using immunocytochemistry and live cell imaging techniques we show that corticosterone selectively increases surface expression of the AMPAR subunit GluR2 in primary hippocampal cultures via a glucocorticoid receptor and protein synthesis dependent mechanism. In agreement, we report that corticosterone also dramatically increases the fraction of surface expressed GluR2 that undergo lateral diffusion. Furthermore, our data indicate that corticosterone facilitates NMDAR-invoked endocytosis of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GluR2 under conditions that weaken synaptic transmission. Conclusion/Significance Our results reveal that corticosterone increases mobile GluR2 containing AMPARs. The enhanced lateral diffusion properties can both facilitate the recruitment of AMPARs but under appropriate conditions facilitate the loss of synaptic AMPARs (LTD). These actions may underlie both the facilitating and suppressive effects of corticosteroid hormones on synaptic plasticity and learning and memory and suggest that these hormones accentuate synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2061216487,"Background Palmitate is a potent inducer of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in β-cells. In type 2 diabetes, glucose amplifies fatty-acid toxicity for pancreatic β-cells, leading to β-cell dysfunction and death. Why glucose exacerbates β-cell lipotoxicity is largely unknown. Glucose stimulates mTORC1, an important nutrient sensor involved in the regulation of cellular stress. Our study tested the hypothesis that glucose augments lipotoxicity by stimulating mTORC1 leading to increased β-cell ER stress. Principal Findings We found that glucose amplifies palmitate-induced ER stress by increasing IRE1α protein levels and activating the JNK pathway, leading to increased β-cell apoptosis. Moreover, glucose increased mTORC1 activity and its inhibition by rapamycin decreased β-cell apoptosis under conditions of glucolipotoxicity. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin did not affect proinsulin and total protein synthesis in β-cells incubated at high glucose with palmitate. However, it decreased IRE1α expression and signaling and inhibited JNK pathway activation. In TSC2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, in which mTORC1 is constitutively active, mTORC1 regulated the stimulation of JNK by ER stressors, but not in response to anisomycin, which activates JNK independent of ER stress. Finally, we found that JNK inhibition decreased β-cell apoptosis under conditions of glucolipotoxicity. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, our findings suggest that mTORC1 mediates glucose amplification of lipotoxicity, acting through activation of ER stress and JNK. Thus, mTORC1 is an important transducer of ER stress in β-cell glucolipotoxicity. Moreover, in stressed β-cells mTORC1 inhibition decreases IRE1α protein expression and JNK activity without affecting ER protein load, suggesting that mTORC1 regulates the β-cell stress response to glucose and fatty acids by modulating the synthesis and activity of specific proteins involved in the execution of the ER stress response. This novel paradigm may have important implications for understanding β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2108691088,"Background Epigenetic alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of solid tumors, however, proto-oncogenes activated by promoter demethylation have been sporadically reported. We used an integrative method to analyze expression in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and pharmacologically demethylated cell lines to identify aberrantly demethylated and expressed candidate proto-oncogenes and cancer testes antigens in HNSCC. Methodology/Principal Findings We noted coordinated promoter demethylation and simultaneous transcriptional upregulation of proto-oncogene candidates with promoter homology, and phylogenetic footprinting of these promoters demonstrated potential recognition sites for the transcription factor BORIS. Aberrant BORIS expression correlated with upregulation of candidate proto-oncogenes in multiple human malignancies including primary non-small cell lung cancers and HNSCC, induced coordinated proto-oncogene specific promoter demethylation and expression in non-tumorigenic cells, and transformed NIH3T3 cells. Conclusions/Significance Coordinated, epigenetic unmasking of multiple genes with growth promoting activity occurs in aerodigestive cancers, and BORIS is implicated in the coordinated promoter demethylation and reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1971710874,"Adipose tissue is a critical mediator in obesity-induced insulin resistance. Previously we have demonstrated that pharmacological lowering of glycosphingolipids and subsequently GM3 by using the iminosugar AMP-DNM, strikingly improves glycemic control. Here we studied the effects of AMP-DNM on adipose tissue function and inflammation in detail to provide an explanation for the observed improved glucose homeostasis. Leptin-deficient obese (Lep(Ob)) mice were fed AMP-DNM and its effects on insulin signalling, adipogenesis and inflammation were monitored in fat tissue. We show that reduction of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in adipose tissue of Lep(Ob) mice restores insulin signalling in isolated ex vivo insulin-stimulated adipocytes. We observed improved adipogenesis as the number of larger adipocytes was reduced and expression of genes like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, insulin responsive glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 and adipsin increased. In addition, we found that adiponectin gene expression and protein were increased by AMP-DNM. As a consequence of this improved function of fat tissue we observed less inflammation, which was characterized by reduced numbers of adipose tissue macrophages (crown-like structures) and reduced levels of the macrophage chemo attractants monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1/Ccl2) and osteopontin (OPN). In conclusion, pharmacological lowering of glycosphingolipids by inhibition of glucosylceramide biosynthesis improves adipocyte function and as a consequence reduces inflammation in adipose tissue of obese animals."
https://openalex.org/W2016050368,"Syndecan-1 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycan known to regulate multiple biological functions at the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix. Its functional activity can be modulated by heparanase, an enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate chains and whose expression has been associated with an aggressive phenotype in many cancers. In addition to remodeling syndecan-1 by cleaving its heparan sulfate chains, heparanase influences syndecan-1 location by upregulating expression of enzymes that accelerate its shedding from the cell surface. In the present study we discovered that heparanase also alters the level of nuclear syndecan-1. Upon upregulation of heparanase expression or following addition of recombinant heparanase to myeloma cells, the nuclear localization of syndecan-1 drops dramatically as revealed by confocal microscopy, western blotting and quantification by ELISA. This effect requires enzymatically active heparanase because cells expressing high levels of mutated, enzymatically inactive heparanase, failed to diminish syndecan-1 levels in the nucleus. Although heparan sulfate function within the nucleus is not well understood, there is emerging evidence that it may act to repress transcriptional activity. The resulting changes in gene expression facilitated by the loss of nuclear syndecan-1 could explain how heparanase enhances expression of MMP-9, VEGF, tissue factor and perhaps other effectors that condition the tumor microenvironment to promote an aggressive cancer phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2042789416,"In mammals, a major circadian pacemaker that drives daily rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), at the base of the hypothalamus. The SCN receive direct light input via the retino-hypothalamic tract. Light during the early night induces phase delays of circadian rhythms while during the late night it leads to phase advances. The effects of light on the circadian system are strongly dependent on the photoperiod to which animals are exposed. An explanation for this phenomenon is currently lacking.We recorded running wheel activity in C57 mice and observed large amplitude phase shifts in short photoperiods and small shifts in long photoperiods. We investigated whether these different light responses under short and long days are expressed within the SCN by electrophysiological recordings of electrical impulse frequency in SCN slices. Application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced sustained increments in electrical activity that were not significantly different in the slices from long and short photoperiods. These responses led to large phase shifts in slices from short days and small phase shifts in slices from long days. An analysis of neuronal subpopulation activity revealed that in short days the amplitude of the rhythm was larger than in long days.The data indicate that the photoperiodic dependent phase responses are intrinsic to the SCN. In contrast to earlier predictions from limit cycle theory, we observed large phase shifting responses in high amplitude rhythms in slices from short days, and small shifts in low amplitude rhythms in slices from long days. We conclude that the photoperiodic dependent phase responses are determined by the SCN and propose that synchronization among SCN neurons enhances the phase shifting capacity of the circadian system."
https://openalex.org/W2083774373,"We previously reported that maternal protein restriction in rodents influenced the rate of growth in early life and ultimately affected longevity. Low birth weight caused by maternal protein restriction followed by catch-up growth (recuperated animals) was associated with shortened lifespan whereas protein restriction and slow growth during lactation (postnatal low protein: PLP animals) increased lifespan. We aim to explore the mechanistic basis by which these differences arise. Here we investigated effects of maternal diet on organ growth, metabolic parameters and the expression of insulin/IGF1 signalling proteins and Sirt1 in muscle of male mice at weaning. PLP mice which experienced protein restriction during lactation had lower fasting glucose (P = 0.038) and insulin levels (P = 0.046) suggesting improved insulin sensitivity. PLP mice had higher relative weights (adjusted by body weight) of brain (P = 0.0002) and thymus (P = 0.031) compared to controls suggesting that enhanced functional capacity of these two tissues is beneficial to longevity. They also had increased expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (P = 0.021) and protein kinase C zeta (P = 0.046). Recuperated animals expressed decreased levels of many insulin signalling proteins including PI3 kinase subunits p85α (P = 0.018), p110β (P = 0.048) and protein kinase C zeta (P = 0.006) which may predispose these animals to insulin resistance. Sirt1 protein expression was reduced in recuperated offspring. These observations suggest that maternal protein restriction can affect major metabolic pathways implicated in regulation of lifespan at a young age which may explain the impact of maternal diet on longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2032509844,"Anthrolysin O (ALO) is a pore-forming, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) secreted by Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent for anthrax. Growing evidence suggests the involvement of ALO in anthrax pathogenesis. Here, we show that the apical application of ALO decreases the barrier function of human polarized epithelial cells as well as increases intracellular calcium and the internalization of the tight junction protein occludin. Using pharmacological agents, we also found that barrier function disruption requires increased intracellular calcium and protein degradation. We also report a crystal structure of the soluble state of ALO. Based on our analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering studies, ALO exists as a monomer. Our ALO structure provides the molecular basis as to how ALO is locked in a monomeric state, in contrast to other CDCs that undergo antiparallel dimerization or higher order oligomerization in solution. ALO has four domains and is globally similar to perfringolysin O (PFO) and intermedilysin (ILY), yet the highly conserved undecapeptide region in domain 4 (D4) adopts a completely different conformation in all three CDCs. Consistent with the differences within D4 and at the D2-D4 interface, we found that ALO D4 plays a key role in affecting the barrier function of C2BBE cells, whereas PFO domain 4 cannot substitute for this role. Novel structural elements and unique cellular functions of ALO revealed by our studies provide new insight into the molecular basis for the diverse nature of the CDC family."

It appears that their use will continue to expand in both targets and disease indications. However, a fundamental problem for full-size mAbs that limits their applications is their poor penetration into tissues (e.g. solid tumors) and poor or absent binding to regions on the surface of some molecules (e.g. on the HIV envelope glycoprotein) that are accessible by molecules of smaller size. Antibody fragments, e.g. Fabs (∼60 kDa) or single chain Fv fragments (scFvs) (20∼30 kDa), are significantly smaller than full-size antibodies (∼150 kDa), and have been used as imaging reagents and candidate therapeutics. Even smaller fragments of antibodies are of great interest and advantageous for pharmaceutical applications including cancer targeting and imaging.

Cambillau C. Wyns L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Not only is the overall size of the dAbs much smaller than that of full-size antibodies but also their paratopes are concentrated over a smaller area so that the dAbs provide the capability of interacting with novel epitopes that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies or antibody fragments with paired light and heavy chain variable domains. The structure of the constant antibody domains is similar to that of the variable domains consisting of β-strands connected mostly with loops or short helices. The second domain of the α, δ, and γ heavy chain constant regions, CH2, is unique in that it exhibits very weak carbohydrate-mediated interchain protein-protein interactions in contrast to the extensive interchain interactions that occur between the other domains. The expression of murine CH2 in bacteria, which does not support glycosylation, results in a monomeric domain (11Feige M.J. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the CH2 domain (CH2 of IgG, IgA, and IgD, and CH3 of IgE and IgM) could be used as a scaffold and could offer additional advantages compared with those of dAbs because it contains binding sites or portions of binding sites conferring effector and stability functions (12Dimitrov D.S. mAbs. 2009; 1: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was found previously that an isolated murine CH2 is relatively unstable at physiological temperature with a temperature of 50% unfolding (Tm) slightly higher than 37 °C (11Feige M.J. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that human CH2 would exhibit different stability because of significant differences in the sequence compared with its murine counterpart. Therefore, we have extensively characterized the stability of an isolated unglycosylated single CH2 domain. We found that its stability is significantly higher than the previously reported for the murine CH2. We further increased the stability of the human CH2 by engineering an additional disulfide bond between the A and G strands. One of the newly developed mutants, denoted as m01, exhibited significantly higher stability (Tm = 73.8 °C) than that of wild type CH2. We suggest that both the wild type CH2 and the newly developed mutant, m01, could be used as scaffolds for binders. These results also demonstrate for the first time that the stability of constant antibody domains can be dramatically increased by engineering of an additional disulfide bond. The increase in stability of isolated domains may result in an increase in stability of larger antibody fragments, e.g. Fc, and therefore could have implications as a general method for increasing antibody stability. Thus, it appears that further development of CH2 and its more stable variants as scaffolds could provide new opportunities for identification of potentially useful therapeutics. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CH2 Domains—Human γ1 CH2 was cloned in bacterial expression vectors and used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain HB2151 cells, which were grown at 37 °C in SB medium to an optical density of A600 ∼0.6–0.8. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris·Cl, 450 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) at 1:10 (volume of Buffer A:culture volume). Polymyxin B sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.5 mu/ml) was added to the suspension (1:1000, volume of polymyxin B sulfate: culture volume). The cell lysate was subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C and tested for expression by SDS-PAGE and Western. The clarified supernatant was purified by using 1 ml of HiTrap Chelating HP Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare). After elution with Buffer B (50 mm Tris·Cl, 450 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), the imidazole was removed by Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore), and the purified proteins were kept in Buffer A or PBS (9.0 g/liter NaCl, 144 mg/liter KH2PO4, 795 mg/liter Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). The proteins were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, and their concentrations were determined by measuring the UV absorbance (13Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). CH2 Mutant Design and Plasmid Construction—To design the CH2 mutants we used the IgG1 b12 crystal structure (14Saphire E.O. Parren P.W. Pantophlet R. Zwick M.B. Morris G.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Stanfield R.L. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of an isolated unglycosylated human CH2 (15Prabakaran P. Vu B.K. Gan J. Feng Y. Dimitrov D.S. Ji X. Acta Crystallogr. B. 2008; 64: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Five mutants, V10/E103 to C10/C103, F11/K104 to C11/C104, L12/T105 to C11/C105, L12/K104 to C12/C104, and V10/K104 to C10/C104,were selected for characterization by analyzing the structure with the computer program VMD 1.8.6 (16Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39018) Google Scholar). They were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into bacterial expression vectors. The clones were verified by direct sequencing and used for transformation of the E. coli strain HB2151. The mutants were expressed and purified similarly to the wild type CH2. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The purified CH2, m01, and m02 were loaded into the Hiload 26/60 Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) running onÄKTA BASIC pH/C chromatography system (GE Healthcare) to assess possible oligomer formation. Buffer A was selected as mobile phase. A gel filtration of standards consisting of aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) was used to define the molecular weight of CH2, m01, and m02. Determination of Disulfide Bonds by Mass Spectrometry—The total number of disulfide bonds in purified CH2, m01, and m02 were determined using a Voyager 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) by comparing the molecular masses after (A) reduction and alkylation of all SH groups and (B) alkylation of the original free SH groups without reduction of disulfide bonds. Reduction was carried out using TCEP, and alkylation was performed using iodoacetamide. Circular Dichroism—The secondary structures of CH2, m01, and m02 were determined by CD spectroscopy. The purified proteins were dissolved in PBS at the final concentration of 0.49 mg/ml, and the CD spectra were recorded on AVIV Model 202 CD Spectrometer (Aviv Biomedical). Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a 0.1-cm path-length cuvette for native structure measurements. Thermal stability was measured at 216 nm by recording the CD signal in the temperature range of 25–90 °C with heating rate 1 °C/min. The temperature was recorded with an external probe sensor and the temperature inside the microcuvette was calculated by calibration; it was about 2–3 °C (range from 1.9 to 3.8 °C for temperatures from 20 to 80 °C) lower than the one measured by the external sensor. After heating, wavelength spectra were recorded at 90 °C. For evaluation of the refolding, all the samples were kept at 4 °C overnight and measured at 25 °C again. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—The thermal stabilities of CH2, m01, and m02 were further monitored with a VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The concentrations of the three proteins were 1.5 mg/ml in PBS (pH 7.4). The heating rate used was 1 °C/min, and the scanning was performed from 25 to 100 °C. Spectrofluorometry—The intrinsic fluorescence of CH2, m01, and m02 were recorded on a Fluorometer Fluoromax-3 (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, NJ). Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were performed using a protein concentration of 10 μg/ml with excitation wavelength at 280 nm, and emission spectra recorded from 320 to 370 nm at 25 °C. Buffer A in the presence of urea from 0 to 8 mm was used. With all samples, fluorescence spectra were corrected for the background fluorescence of the solution (buffer + denaturant). Fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was used for unfolding evaluation. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)—For the NMR experiments E. coli was first grown in 2×YT medium. Single colony was inoculated in 3 ml of 2×YT medium for about 3 h, then turbidity was checked and bacteria were transferred to 1 liter of 2×YT medium for further growth at 37 °C until A600 ∼0.8–0.9 was reached. The cell culture was then centrifuged to remove the 2×YT medium and replaced with a M9 minimum medium with [15N]NH4Cl and [13C]glucose as sole 15N and 13C sources, respectively (17Koenig B.W. Rogowski M. Louis J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 30 °C overnight, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Harvested cells were suspended in TES buffer (10 ml of buffer for 1 liter of culture) for 1 h on ice. Osmotic shock to release periplasmic proteins was induced by adding 1.5 volume TES/5 on ice for 4 h. The supernatant was then dialyzed in a dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, 0.5 m NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. The protein was purified by the method described above for an initial purification. Fractions containing a significant amount of the protein were then loaded on Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare) for further purification. The separated fractions samples were collected in Buffer A. NMR experiments were performed in 40 mm Tris·Cl buffer at pH 7.8 containing 64 mm NaCl in 95% H2O, 5% D2O and a sample volume of ∼300 μl in a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi Inc) with a protein concentration of 0.5–0.8 mm at 25 °C. NMR experiments were conducted using Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer, which is equipped with a cryogenic probe (Bruker Instruments). Water-flip back sequences were used for 1H-15N HSQC and 1H-15N NOE experiments to minimize exchange between amide protons and water protons (18Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded with 1024 complex points for an acquisition dimension with a spectral width of 8012 Hz, and 256 complex points for an indirect (t1) dimension. 1H-15N NOE experiments were conducted with similar number of points by recording two sets of spectra, with and without proton saturation at 3 and 4 s repetition delays, respectively (19Gong Q. Ishima R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 37: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Uncertainties of the NOE values were estimated from root mean square deviation (RMSD) noise of the two spectra and peak heights. Signal assignments were performed based on HNCA, CBCACONH, CCONH experiments for the CH2 domain, and HNCACB and CBCACONH and 13C, 15N simultaneous evolution NOESY for m01 (20Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 496-514Google Scholar, 21Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Res. Series B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (836) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed and analyzed using the nmrPipe and CARA (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar, 23Masse J.E. Keller R. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 174: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To color significance of chemical shift changes on the CH2 backbone structure, a normalized chemical shift changes (Equation 1), δnorm=(δCα)2+(γCα/γN)2(δN)2(Eq. 1) its average, and S.D. were calculated, and are grouped to four classes: δnorm > 3.0 (red), 3.0 > δnorm > 2.0 (orange), 2.0 > δnorm > 1.0 (yellow), and (4Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Pluckthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) δnorm < 1 (blue). Isolated, Unglycosylated Human γ1 CH2 Domain Is Relatively Stable—Human γ1 heavy chain CH2 (Fig. 1A) was cloned in a bacterial expression vector, expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It expresses at high levels as soluble protein (more than 10 mg per liter of bacterial culture) and is highly soluble (more than 10 mg/ml). It is monomeric in PBS at pH 7.4 as determined by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B) (15Prabakaran P. Vu B.K. Gan J. Feng Y. Dimitrov D.S. Ji X. Acta Crystallogr. B. 2008; 64: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and runs on SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent molecular mass (MW) of about 14–15 kDa, which is close to the calculated MW (14.7 kDa, including the His and FLAG tags) and as expected is much smaller than the MWs of scFv, Fab, and IgG1 (Fig. 1C). Previously, it has been found that an isolated unglycosylated murine CH2 domain is relatively unstable at physiologically relevant temperatures (Tm = 41 °C as measured by CD (11Feige M.J. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The sequence of human CH2 differs from its murine counterpart (Fig. 1A), which could lead to different stabilities. To test the thermal stability of human γ1 CH2 we used both CD and DSC. As measured by CD the secondary structure of CH2 consisted primarily of β strands at 25 °C (Fig. 2A). The CH2 unfolding started at about 42 °C and was completed at about 62 °C with a calculated Tm of 54.1 ± 1.2 °C (Fig. 2B). The unfolding was reversible (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained by DSC (Tm = 55.4 °C) (Fig. 2C). Although we were not able to test the murine CH2 used in the previous study concurrently with human CH2, it appears that human γ1 CH2 is significantly more stable than its murine counterpart. Design and Generation of Engineered Human γ1 CH2 Domains with an Additional Disulfide Bond—To further improve the stability of human CH2, we engineered an additional disulfide bond between the N-terminal strand A and the C-terminal one G. We reasoned that constraining the degrees of freedom of these two strands could lead to a decrease in the extent of unfolding. The mutants were initially designed based on the crystal structure of CH2 in an intact IgG1 (14Saphire E.O. Parren P.W. Pantophlet R. Zwick M.B. Morris G.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Stanfield R.L. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), which is very similar to the crystal structure of isolated CH2, which we recently reported although there are certain differences in some loops and at both termini (15Prabakaran P. Vu B.K. Gan J. Feng Y. Dimitrov D.S. Ji X. Acta Crystallogr. B. 2008; 64: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the distance between two α-carbons of two cysteines in proteins with known structure (24Dani V.S. Ramakrishnan C. Varadarajan R. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Pellequer J.L. Chen S.W. Proteins. 2006; 65: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the orientation of the bonds we selected five amino acid pairs, V10/E103, F11/K104, L12/T105, L12/K104, and V10/K104 (the numbering starts with 1:Ala (Fig. 1A) corresponding to number 231 in the γ1 heavy chain), which were substituted by Cys residues. Two mutants (L12/K104 to C12/C104, distance between the Cαs in L12 and K104 = 6.53 Å, and V10/K104 to C10/C104, distance between the Cαs in V10 and K104 = 7.25 Å) (Fig. 3), designated m01 and m02, respectively, were highly soluble and expressed at levels comparable or higher than that of CH2 (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4High level of expression of m01 and m02. Soluble expression of m01 and m02 is compared with that of CH2 by SDS-PAGE. The expressed proteins are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The existence of an additional disulfide bond was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The number of disulfide bonds in CH2 was one, while the mutants m01 and m02 contained two, as expected (Table 1). These mutants were selected for further characterization.TABLE 1Number of disulfide bonds determined by mass spectrometryProteinIntactDenatured (D)Reduced (R)Reduced/Alkylate (R/A)Alkylated (A)NcysaNcys = (MR/A-MR)/57.NSHbNSH = (MA-MD)/57.Number of -S-S-cNumber of disulfide bonds (-S-S-) = (Ncys-NSH)/2.DaDaDaDaDaCH214707.360714714.597714710.916014822.671914708.5791201m0114674.344714677.753914676.339814899.923814669.0400402m0214688.956114686.246114695.654314901.807614686.1230402a Ncys = (MR/A-MR)/57.b NSH = (MA-MD)/57.c Number of disulfide bonds (-S-S-) = (Ncys-NSH)/2. Open table in a new tab m01 and m02 Are Significantly More Stable Than CH2—The thermal stability of m01 and m02 was measured using CD and DSC, and their stability against chemical agents, by using urea and spectrofluorimetry. In all cases the two mutants were much more stable than CH2 (Fig. 5). The CD spectra of m01 and m02 showed that they had high β-sheet content at 25 °C (Fig. 5, A and B). The β-sheet structure was gradually disrupted as the temperature increased (Fig. 5C). At 90 °C, the structure was in an unfolded state (Fig. 5C). The sigmoidal curve was fitted by a two-state model, which was also previously used (11Feige M.J. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Notably, 50% unfolding of m01 and m02 occurred at temperatures (Tm = 73.8 ± 1.7 °C and 65.3 ± 0.6 °C, respectively) that were significantly higher than that of native CH2 (54.1 ± 1.2 °C) (Fig. 5C). CH2 and m01 unfolding was reversible while that of m02 only partially reversible (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar results were obtained by DSC. The Tm values of m01 (73.4 °C) and m02 (66.5 °C) were much higher (by about 20 and 10 °C, respectively) than that of native CH2 (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, the unfolding of m02 occurred over a much broader temperature range and with a lower maximum peak intensity than that observed for CH2 and m01. This phenomenon could be caused by the presence of dimers in m02 (see below). The stability against chemically induced unfolding of m01 and m02 was also higher than that of CH2 (Fig. 5E). Urea was used as the chemical agent and intrinsic fluorescence was used to monitor protein unfolding. The unfolding dependence on the urea concentration can be also fitted using a two-state model. The 50% unfolding of m01 and m02 occurred at higher urea concentrations (6.8 and 5.8 m, respectively) than that of CH2 (4.2 m). Only the monomeric state was observed for m01 while m02 contained small amounts of higher molecular species (mostly dimers) as determined by SEC (Fig. 6). Because of its superior physical properties m01 was selected for further characterization. Structural Conservation of m01—To examine structural perturbation caused by the cysteine mutations, solution NMR experiments were performed for the CH2 domain and the mutant m01. 1H-15N HSQC spectrum generally shows a correlation of nitrogen atoms and their directly bounded protons, and provides a “finger print” of the protein backbone. Each of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of CH2 and m01 (recorded using identical experimental conditions) exhibited only one set of peaks, indicating that the protein was well-folded in solution (supplemental Fig. S1). Of the structure region of the proteins, the chemical shifts of backbone 15N, C′, and Cα were ∼75% assigned in both proteins. In m01, the measured chemical shifts for Cα and Cβ of residue Cys-12 were 57.6 ppm and 37.7 ppm, respectively, whereas the Cα and Cβ chemical shifts of Cys-104 were 54.5 and 34.2 ppm, respectively. These values fall within the expected range for oxidized cysteine residues (26Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the additional disulfide bridge is formed in the mutant m01. Comparison of the overall backbone chemical shits of N and Cα also showed the overall similarity of the protein structures between CH2 and m01 (Fig. 7). However, interestingly changes in chemical shifts were observed around residues Cys-31 and Cys-91 as well as around the newly introduced Cys residues 12 and 104. This is reasonable because the newly introduced disulfide bridge is proximal to the native Cys-31—Cys-91 by linking the adjacent β-strands in the same β-sheet with the Cys-31—Cys-91 bridge (Fig. 8A). The newly introduced disulfide bond in m01 most likely affected microscopic environments of the native disulfide bond between Cys-31 and Cys-91.FIGURE 8Ribbon structure presentations of CH2 domain structure. In A, the regions that show largest (red), medium (orange), and small (yellow) chemical shift changes are shown by the colors in parentheses, the regions that show insignificant changes in chemical shifts are in blue.

In both A and B, the regions that were not assigned are shown in white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relatively High Loop Flexibilities and Rigid Framework of CH2 and m01—To determine whether the loops are flexible in both CH2 and m01, 15N-1H NOE spectra were recorded. We found that the framework is rigid as indicated by the high NOE values (above 0.7); in contrast the loops were on average more flexible (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, the local dynamics of CH2 and m01 were comparable (Fig. 9), indicating that the conformational entropy of the m01 at the native states is likely very similar to that of CH2. Although the 15N-1H NOE is inherently not measurable for the proline residues and, therefore, the NOE reside-by-residue profile provides no information at the locations of the prolines it is most likely that the essential structure and dynamics of the CH2 domain is maintained while thermal stability is increased upon introduction of the cysteine mutation. Such a dynamics profile is also consistent with the b-factors observed for the CH2 crystal structure (PDB 3DJ9) (15Prabakaran P. Vu B.K. Gan J. Feng Y. Dimitrov D.S. Ji X. Acta Crystallogr. B. 2008; 64: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The increase in the flexibility of the loops also indicates that both CH2 and m01 could be used as scaffolds for grafting to or mutating residues in the loops. The major findings of this study are that isolated unglycosylated human γ1 CH2 domain is relatively stable and that its stability can be significantly increased by engineering an additional disulfide bond between the N- and C-terminal strands. Human CH2 is significantly more stable (Tm = 54.1 °C) than previously thought based on the results for a murine CH2 (Tm = 41 °C) as measured by CD (11Feige M.J. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have not investigated possible molecular mechanisms that determine the higher stability of the human CH2, but in general such differences can be attributed to the significant differences in their amino acid sequences and composition (Fig. 1A). It has been recently shown that an additional disulfide bond naturally occurring or engineered in llama heavy chain variable domains (VHH) can significantly increase their stability (27Saerens D. Conrath K. Govaert J. Muyldermans S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Hagihara Y. Mine S. Uegaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36489-36495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this case disulfide bonds between strands C′ and D, and C and E resulted in significant stabilization. Previously, shark new antigen receptor (IgNAR) domain exhibiting an Ig fold was also found to have some noncanonical Cys residues that form disulfide bonds linking frameworks regions 2 and 4 to CDR3 (Type I) and CDRs 1 to 3 (Type II) (29Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Science. 2004; 305: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For the human constant CH2 domain, we found that an additional disulfide bond between strands A and G leads to significant stabilization. There is a similarity between the CH2 domain and the IgNAR V domain in that the C strand directly connects to the D strand without the C′ and C″ strands as seen within human variable domains. Further studies are needed to determine whether a combination of these disulfide bonds as observed in VHH and IgNAR variable domains could lead to additional gain in stability and whether there are differences between variable and constant domains in terms of best localization of stabilizing disulfide bonds. We also found that the introduction of an additional disulfide bond between strands A and G does not perturb to any significant degree the structural integrity and in general the structure of the CH2. In addition, in both CH2 and the mutant m01 the frameworks are relatively rigid and the loops more flexible. These data indicate that grafting of loops (e.g. from antibody variable domains) may not significantly affect the overall structure of the CH2 and m01 (i.e. they are both promising as scaffolds for generations of binders). In addition, both are highly expressible, soluble, and monomeric, which makes them appropriate for further development with potential implications as scaffolds for libraries of binders. These findings could have implications for exploration of the unfolding mechanisms of antibody domains and for the development of candidate therapeutic antibodies with increased stability. Whether the observed increase in stability to temperature and chemical agents in vitro will result in increased stability in vivo remains to be seen.

Although it is known that macrophages and fibroblasts are co-localized and express MMPs in the diseased periodontal tissue, the effect of interaction between these two cell types on MMP expression has not been well elucidated. Furthermore although it is known that diabetes is associated with accelerated periodontal tissue destruction, it remains unknown whether hyperglycemia, a major metabolic abnormality in diabetes, regulates MMP expression by affecting the cross-talking between fibroblasts and macrophages. In this study, human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages were cocultured in a two-compartment transwell culture system, and the cells were treated with normal or high glucose. We found that coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, and high glucose further enhanced this augmentation. Similar observations were also made in the coculture of fibroblasts and human primary monocytes. We also found that interleukin 6 (IL-6) released by fibroblasts was essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages. Furthermore our results showed that high glucose, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression. Finally our study indicated that MAPK pathways and activator protein-1 transcription factor were involved in the coculture- and high glucose-augmented MMP-1 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that IL-6 derived from fibroblasts is essential for MMP-1 up-regulation by cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to high glucose, revealing an IL-6-dependent mechanism in MMP-1 up-regulation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in periodontal disease. Although it is known that macrophages and fibroblasts are co-localized and express MMPs in the diseased periodontal tissue, the effect of interaction between these two cell types on MMP expression has not been well elucidated. Furthermore although it is known that diabetes is associated with accelerated periodontal tissue destruction, it remains unknown whether hyperglycemia, a major metabolic abnormality in diabetes, regulates MMP expression by affecting the cross-talking between fibroblasts and macrophages. In this study, human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages were cocultured in a two-compartment transwell culture system, and the cells were treated with normal or high glucose. We found that coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, and high glucose further enhanced this augmentation. Similar observations were also made in the coculture of fibroblasts and human primary monocytes. We also found that interleukin 6 (IL-6) released by fibroblasts was essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages. Furthermore our results showed that high glucose, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression. Finally our study indicated that MAPK pathways and activator protein-1 transcription factor were involved in the coculture- and high glucose-augmented MMP-1 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that IL-6 derived from fibroblasts is essential for MMP-1 up-regulation by cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to high glucose, revealing an IL-6-dependent mechanism in MMP-1 up-regulation. Periodontal disease is characterized by inflammation of periodontal tissues, eventually leading to degeneration of the periodontium (1Socransky S.S. Haffajee A.D. J.

Periodontol. 1993; 64: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). MMPs are expressed in inflamed periodontal tissue by inflammatory cells including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells and also by resident cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (6Reynolds J.J. Oral Dis. 1996; 2: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria, the major pathogens involved in periodontal disease, is a potent stimulator for MMP expression (1Socransky S.S. Haffajee A.D. J. Periodontal Res. 1991; 26: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).It has been well established that patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes have increased prevalence and severity of periodontal disease (8Mealey B. J. Periodontol. 1999; 70: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Considering the crucial role of MMPs in periodontal disease, it was believed that the periodontal MMP expression was increased in patients with diabetes, leading to an increase in tissue destruction (8Mealey B. J. Periodontol. 1999; 70: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Indeed studies have shown that the periodontal MMP expression is higher in patients with both diabetes and periodontal disease than in those with periodontal disease alone. For example, it was reported that MMP-8 and MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in the gingival tissue of diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis (9Kumar M.S. Vamsi G. Sripriya R. Sehgal P.K. J. Periodontol. 2006; 77: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our recent study showed a trend of increase in MMP-1 expression in periodontal tissues across patients with neither diabetes nor periodontal disease, patients with periodontal disease alone, and patients with both diseases (10Cole C.M. Sundararaj K.P. Leite R.S. Nareika A. Slate E.H. Sanders J.J. Lopes-Virella M.F. Huang Y. J. Periodontal Res. 2008; 43: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In our effort to understand the mechanisms involved in diabetes-promoted MMP expression, we demonstrated that elevated glucose concentration (high glucose) augmented LPS-stimulated MMP expression in macrophages by enhancing LPS-triggered signaling and transcriptional activity (11Maldonado A.

We further demonstrated that lactate, which is associated with hyperglycemia and increased in plasma and saliva of diabetic patients (13DiGirolamo M. Newby F.D. Lovejoy J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Petrovich I.A. Borovskii E.V. Petrova N.G. Vopr. Pitan. 1983; 5: 28-32Google Scholar), also had a synergistic effect with LPS on MMP expression (15Nareika A. He L. Game B.A. Slate E.H. Sanders J.J. London S.D. Lopes-Virella M.F. Huang Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E534-E542Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a molecular mechanism potentially involved in periodontal disease in diabetic patients.Both macrophages and gingival fibroblasts are present in periodontitis-inflamed periodontal tissue (16Hou L.T. Liu C.M. Liu B.Y. Lin S.J. Liao C.S. J. Periodontal Res. 2003; 38: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Skaleric U. Gaspirc B. McCartney-Francis N. Masera A. Wahl S.M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 7010-7013Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and their interaction has been shown to increase MMP expression (18Domeij H. Modeer T. Quezada H.C. Yucel-Lindberg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Huybrechts-Godin G. Hauser P. Vaes G. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism has not been investigated. Furthermore it is unclear whether hyperglycemia alters MMP expression regulated by the interaction between macrophages and fibroblasts. In the current study, we demonstrated that coculture of U937 human histiocytes (resident macrophages) and human gingival fibroblasts in a two-compartment transwell coculture system led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression, and IL-6 released by fibroblasts played an essential role in the augmentation. We also demonstrated that high glucose further enhanced the augmentation of MMP-1 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment with LPS—Human monocytes were isolated as described previously (20Seager Danciger J. Lutz M. Hama S. Cruz D. Castrillo A. Lazaro J. Phillips R. Premack B. Berliner J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 288: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) from blood obtained from healthy donors. U937 histiocytes (21Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) and human gingival fibroblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing normal glucose (5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm), 10% fetal calf serum, 1% minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acid solution, and 0.6 g/100 ml HEPES either independently or in Corning Transwell plates (Sigma) that have two compartments separated by a polycarbonate membrane with 0.4-μm pores. Fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence in the lower compartment, and U937 cells or human monocytes were grown (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) in the upper compartment. For cell treatment, LPS from E. coli was used (Sigma). The LPS was highly purified by phenol extraction and gel filtration chromatography and was cell culture-tested. We compared the potency of this LPS with that of LPS isolated from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a kind gift provided by Dr. Edward Lally, University of Pennsylvania, in the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by U937 cells. Results showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS was more potent than E. coli LPS at concentrations of 5, 10, and 50 ng/ml but had no difference at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—MMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and IL-6 in conditioned medium were quantified using sandwich ELISA kits according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.25 μg of total RNA, 4 μl of 5× iScript reaction mixture, and 1 μl of iScript reverse transcriptase. The complete reaction was cycled for 5 min at 25 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C using a PTC-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The reverse transcription reaction mixture was then diluted 1:10 with nuclease-free water and used for PCR amplification of MMP cDNA in the presence of the primers. The Beacon designer software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA) was used for primer designing. Primers for MMP-1 (5′ primer, CTGGGAAGCCATCACTTACCTTGC; 3′ primer, GTTTCTAGAGTCGCTGGGAAGCTG) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), and real time PCR was performed in duplicate using 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 1.0 μl of reverse transcription mixture, 0.2 μm both primers, and 12.5 μl of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was run in the iCycler™ real time detection system (Bio-Rad) with a two-step method. The hot start enzyme was activated (95 °C for 3 min), and cDNA was then amplified for 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s and annealing/extension at 53 °C for 45 s. A melt curve assay was then performed (55 °C for 1 min and then the temperature was increased by 0.5 °C every 10 s) to detect the formation of primer-derived trimers and dimers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5′ primer, GAATTTGGCTACAGCAACAGGGTG; 3′ primer, TCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTG) served as a control. Data were analyzed with the iCycler iQ™ software. The average starting quantity of fluorescence units was used for analysis. Quantification was calculated using the starting quantity of the cDNA of interest relative to that of GAPDH cDNA in the same sample.IL-6 siRNA Transfection—Human gingival fibroblasts were transfected with 200 nm stealth siRNA directed against IL-6 (CAGACAGCCACUCACCUCUUCAGAA) or control siRNA (CAGGACCCACUCAUCUCCUACAGAA) (GenBank accession number NM 000600; Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. After the transfection for 24 h, cells were cultured independently or cocultured with U937 cells in the presence or absence of LPS.PCR Array—The first strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD). Human inflammatory cytokines and receptor PCR array (catalog number PAHS-011, SuperArray Bioscience Corp.) was used to profile the cytokine expression by fibroblasts in the coculture by following the instructions from the manufacturer.Extraction of Nuclear Proteins—Nuclear protein was extracted using the NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). The concentration of protein was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).AP-1 and NFκB Activity Assays—Two micrograms of nuclear protein of each sample was applied to the assay for AP-1 and NFκB activities using TransAM kits produced by Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. These kits contain a 96-stripwell plate to which the consensus-binding site oligonucleotides were immobilized. TransAM assays are up to 100 times more sensitive than gel mobility shift assay and detect transcription factors with specific antibodies.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Ten micrograms of nuclear proteins was used for EMSA to determine AP-1 DNA binding activity. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Trizma (Tris base), pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5% (v/v) glycerol, and ∼0.3 pmol of AP-1 oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) labeled with digoxigenin-ddUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Applied Science). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from protein-free DNA in 5% polyacrylamide gels in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.38 m glycine, and 2 mm EDTA at room temperature and electroblotted onto positively charged nylon membranes. The chemiluminescence detection of digoxigenin-labeled probes was conducted by following the instructions provided by the Roche Applied Science. For competition studies, unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotides that were in 30-fold excess of the labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture. Supershift assays were performed by adding 1 μg of anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) to the reaction mixture. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used as a control antibody.Statistic Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t tests were performed to determine the statistical significance of MMP expression among different experimental groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSThe Coculture of Fibroblasts and U937 Macrophages Was Similar to That of Fibroblasts and Human Monocytes in Its Capacity of Stimulating MMP-1 Secretion—It was reported previously that when fibroblasts were cocultured with human primary monocytes MMP-1 secretion was stimulated (18Domeij H. Modeer T. Quezada H.C. Yucel-Lindberg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, we first determined whether the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells also stimulated MMP-1 secretion. Results showed that the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells in the absence or presence of LPS was similar to that of fibroblasts and human monocytes in stimulation of MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 2, A and B). The amount of MMP-1 secreted by the coculture of fibroblasts with either human monocytes or U937 cells was much more than the sum of MMP-1 released by independent culture of fibroblasts and that of monocytes or U937 cells.FIGURE 2The similarity between the coculture of human monocytes/fibroblasts and U937 macrophages/fibroblasts in the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion. Human monocytes (A) or U937 cells (B) were cultured independently or cocultured with human fibroblasts in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h. After the treatment, culture medium was collected for quantification of MMP-1. Cell numbers per well for human monocytes and U937 cells were the same (1 × 106/well). The data (mean ± S.D.) are from one of three independent experiments with similar results.

Results (Fig. 3A) showed that in the absence of LPS the coculture exposed to normal glucose led to a significant augmentation of MMP-1 secretion as compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages (1.71 versus 0.67 ng/ml for fibroblasts and 0.22 ng/ml for U937 macrophages). Although the coculture exposed to high glucose also had a marked augmentation of MMP-1 secretion compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages (5.49 versus 0.58 ng/ml for fibroblasts and 0.98 ng/ml for U937 cells) (Fig. 3A), it is noteworthy that the coculture exposed to high glucose had a 3-fold increase in MMP-1 secretion when compared with that exposed to normal glucose (5.49 versus 1.71 ng/ml) (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3The increased MMP-1 secretion by coculture of fibroblasts with U937 macrophages and further enhancement of the coculture-increased MMP-1 secretion by high glucose. Human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages in the independent cultures or cocultures preexposed to normal (5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) were challenged with or without 100 ng/ml LPS. After 24 h, medium was collected to quantify MMPs using ELISA. A, the stimulatory effect of the coculture and high glucose on MMP-1 secretion in the absence or presence of LPS.

In the presence of LPS, the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to normal glucose also markedly augmented MMP-1 secretion as compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages (14.71 versus 1.47 ng/ml for fibroblasts or 2.8 ng/ml for U937 cells) (Fig. 3A), and high glucose further increased MMP-1 secretion by about 3-fold when compared with normal glucose (42.75 versus 14.75 ng/ml). These results showed that although the coculture augmented MMP-1 secretion high glucose further increased the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture.The effect of high glucose on MMP-1 secretion was also examined in the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts. Results showed that, similar to the coculture of U937 cells and fibroblasts, high glucose significantly increased MMP-1 secretion from the coculture of monocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). Furthermore results showed that the independent culture of monocytes and U937 cells had similar responses to high glucose in MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 3, A and B).The effect of the coculture and high glucose on MMP-13, MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 secretion was also investigated. Results showed that the coculture in the absence of LPS did not increase MMP-13 secretion as compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages, and the coculture in the presence of LPS increased MMP-1 secretion only when the cells were exposed to high glucose (Fig. 3C). The coculture or high glucose did not increase MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 secretion (data not shown). These results indicate that the genes targeted for up-regulation by the coculture are highly selective.Fig. 4A shows glucose concentration-dependent stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells. In the presence of LPS, glucose at 10, 15, and 25 mm increased MMP-1 secretion by 1.4-, 1.8-, and 3.1-fold, respectively, as compared with cells treated with 5 mm glucose. A similar effect of high glucose on MMP-1 secretion was observed in the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). Glucose at 15 mm increased MMP-1 secretion from the coculture of monocytes and fibroblasts by 2-fold as compared with glucose at 5 mm either in the absence or in the presence of LPS. Fig. 4C shows that 5 mm glucose plus 20 mm mannitol had no effect on MMP-1 secretion from the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells as compared with 5 mm glucose, suggesting that the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by 25 mm glucose is not due to increased osmolarity.FIGURE 4The effect of increasing glucose concentrations and mannitol on MMP-1 secretion by coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages or human monocytes. A, the cocultures of fibroblasts and U937 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of glucose (5–25 mm) in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h. After the treatment, culture medium was collected for quantification of MMP-1 using ELISA. The coculture treated with 5 mm glucose without LPS was designated as control. All data are presented as -fold of the control. B, an experiment similar to that described above was performed in the coculture of fibroblasts and human monocytes. C, the cocultures of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages were treated with 5 mm glucose, 25 mm glucose, or 5 mm glucose plus 20 mm mannitol in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h.

Results showed that as compared with the independent fibroblast culture fibroblasts in the cocultured exposed to either normal or high glucose did not have an increase in MMP-1 mRNA (Fig. 5). In contrast, U937 macrophages in the coculture had markedly increased MMP-1 mRNA expression when compared with the independent U937 macrophage culture, and high glucose further increased MMP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5). After exposure to both high glucose and LPS, the MMP-1 mRNA level in U937 cells in the coculture system was 8-fold higher than that in the independent U937 cell culture (Fig. 5). These results suggest that a soluble factor(s) derived from fibroblasts may stimulate MMP-1 expression in U937 cells and thus augment the MMP-1 level in the coculture.FIGURE 5Increased MMP-1 mRNA level in U937 cells, but not fibroblasts, in the cocultures.

Indeed we found that the addition of fibroblast-conditioned medium to U937 cell culture increased MMP-1 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Conversely we also collected U937 cell-conditioned medium and applied it to fibroblast culture. Results showed that the addition of U937 cell-conditioned medium to fibroblasts did not increase MMP-1 secretion by fibroblasts (data not shown). MMP-1 expression analysis using quantitative PCR also showed no change in the MMP-1 mRNA level in fibroblasts after incubation with U937 cell-conditioned medium (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggested that a soluble factor(s) derived from fibroblasts is essential to stimulate MMP-1 expression in U937 cells and hence augments MMP-1 level in the coculture.FIGURE 6Increased MMP-1 secretion from U937 macrophages by exposing cells to fibroblast-conditioned medium. The conditioned medium from fibroblast culture was collected after 18 h of incubation. U937 cells were incubated with 2, 1.5, or 1 ml of fresh medium plus 0, 0.5, or 1 ml of fibroblast-conditioned medium (total 2 ml for each well) for 24 h.

From the array analysis, we found that IL-6 was the major cytokine released by fibroblasts and up-regulated by LPS and high glucose (Table 1). In contrast, the expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNFα was low and not stimulated by LPS and high glucose. We also found that IL-6 secretion by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells was increased when compared with that by the independent cultures of fibroblasts or U937 cells and was further increased by high glucose (Fig. 7A). High glucose also increased IL-6 secretion from the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 7B). Because IL-6 is known to stimulate MMP expression (22Kristiansen O.P. Mandrup-Poulsen T.

https://openalex.org/W1997513231,"Although alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) perform substantial roles in the maintenance of alveolar integrity, the extent of their contributions to immune defense is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that AECII activates alveolar macrophages (AM) functions, such as phagocytosis using a conditioned medium from AECII infected by P. aeruginosa. AECII-derived chemokine MCP-1, a monocyte chemoattractant protein, was identified as a main factor in enhancing AM function. We proposed that the enhanced immune potency of AECII may play a critical role in alleviation of bacterial propagation and pneumonia. The ability of phagocytosis and superoxide release by AM was reduced by MCP-1 neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, MCP-1−/− mice showed an increased bacterial burden under PAO1 and PAK infection vs. wt littermates. AM from MCP-1−/− mice also demonstrated less superoxide and impaired phagocytosis over the controls. In addition, AECII conditioned medium increased the host defense of airway in MCP-1−/− mice through the activation of AM function. Mechanistically, we found that Lyn mediated NFκB activation led to increased gene expression and secretion of MCP-1. Consequently Lyn−/− mice had reduced MCP-1 secretion and resulted in a decrease in superoxide and phagocytosis by AM. Collectively, our data indicate that AECII may serve as an immune booster for fighting bacterial infections, particularly in severe immunocompromised conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1966569650,"The study of Parkinson's disease (PD), like other complex neurodegenerative disorders, is limited by access to brain tissue from patients with a confirmed diagnosis. Alternatively the study of peripheral tissues may offer some insight into the molecular basis of disease susceptibility and progression, but this approach still relies on brain tissue to benchmark relevant molecular changes against. Several studies have reported whole-genome expression profiling in post-mortem brain but reported concordance between these analyses is lacking. Here we apply a standardised pathway analysis to seven independent case-control studies, and demonstrate increased concordance between data sets. Moreover data convergence increased when the analysis was limited to the five substantia nigra (SN) data sets; this highlighted the down regulation of dopamine receptor signaling and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathways. We also show that case-control comparisons of affected post mortem brain tissue are more likely to reflect terminal cytoarchitectural differences rather than primary pathogenic mechanisms. The implementation of a correction factor for dopaminergic neuronal loss predictably resulted in the loss of significance of the dopamine signaling pathway while axon guidance pathways increased in significance. Interestingly the IGF1 signaling pathway was also over-represented when data from non-SN areas, unaffected or only terminally affected in PD, were considered. Our findings suggest that there is greater concordance in PD whole-genome expression profiling when standardised pathway membership rather than ranked gene list is used for comparison."

Immunoblot analysis indicates that KCC2b is the major KCC2 isoform in the adult brain, whereas in the neonatal mouse central nervous system, half of total KCC2 protein is KCC2a. At this stage, the two KCC2 isoforms are largely colocalized and show similar patterns of distribution in the brain. When coexpressed in HEK293 cells, KCC2a and KCC2b proteins form heteromeric complexes. Moreover, the two isoforms can be coimmunoprecipitated from the neonatal brain, suggesting the presence of endogenous KCC2a-KCC2b heteromers. Consistent with this, native gel analysis shows that a substantial part of endogenous KCC2 isoforms in the neonatal brain constitute dimers. The neuron-specific K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 maintains the low intracellular chloride concentration required for the fast hyperpolarizing actions of inhibitory neurotransmitters. The KCC2 gene codes for two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b, which differ in their N termini. The relative expression and cellular distribution of the two KCC2 protein isoforms are unknown. Here, we characterize an antibody against the KCC2a isoform and show that a previously described antibody against KCC2 is specific for the KCC2b isoform (Hubner, C. A., Stein, V., Hermans-Borgmeyer, I., Meyer, T., Ballanyi, K., and Jentsch, T. J. (2001) Neuron 30, 515–524).

The neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter KCC2 extrudes potassium and chloride ions from neurons, thus maintaining the low intracellular chloride concentration [Cl]i necessary for the fast hyperpolarizing actions of inhibitory neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine (1Blaesse P.

CCCs, including KCC2, are thought to exist in the plasma membrane as functional oligomers, although the mechanisms whereby oligomerization affects their transport activity are unclear (4Blaesse P.

We have recently shown that the KCC2 gene (alias Slc12a5) generates two mRNAs, KCC2a and KCC2b, by an alternative promoter and first exon usage (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P.

The difference between the KCC2a and KCC2b proteins lies in the most N-terminal part; the 40 unique amino acids in KCC2a include a putative binding sequence for the Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK). KCC2 null mutant mice deficient for both KCC2 isoforms show a disrupted breathing rhythm and die immediately after birth (10Tornberg J. Voikar V. Savilahti H. Rauvala H. Airaksinen M.S. Eur. J.

In general, KCC2 expression in the CNS follows neuronal maturation; it is first detected in the postmitotic neurons of the spinal cord and brainstem and is then gradually increased in higher brain structures (13Li H. Tornberg J. Kaila K. Airaksinen M.S. Rivera C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2358-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Jentsch T.J. Hubner C.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 468: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our previous work has shown that during postnatal development, KCC2a mRNA expression remains relatively constant, whereas KCC2b mRNA is strongly up-regulated in the cortex during postnatal development (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P. Kaila K. Delpire E. Timmusk T. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30570-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This indicates that KCC2b is responsible for the developmental shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABAergic responses. Here, we study the relative expression and cellular distribution of KCC2a and KCC2b proteins in the mouse brain. We characterize a new antibody specific for the KCC2a isoform and demonstrate that a previously described antibody against KCC2 (11Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) is specific for the KCC2b isoform. The relative expression of the KCC2 protein isoforms determined by immunoblot analysis correlates well with their mRNA levels (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P. Kaila K. Delpire E.

KCC2a and KCC2b proteins have a similar level and pattern of expression in the neonatal mouse brain and are colocalized in most neurons in non-cortical lower brain areas. Coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments and coexpression followed by native gel analysis indicate that KCC2a-KCC2b heteromers can form in vitro and may exist in vivo. Expression Constructs—KCC2a and KCC2b expression constructs were described previously (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P. Kaila K. Delpire E. Timmusk T. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30570-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For GFP-KCC2b and Myc-KCC2b fusion constructs, the tags were fused in-frame to the N terminus of rat KCC2b using the EGFP-C1 (Clontech-Takara) and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression vectors, respectively. Hemagglutinin-tagged SPAK (15Dowd B.F.X. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27347-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Forbush. Production of Anti-KCC2a Polyclonal Antibodies—A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against a polypeptide comprising the predicted 21 N-terminal residues of rat KCC2a protein (DPESRRHSVADPRRLPREDVK). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via a terminal cysteine and maleimide cross-linker. The anti-KCC2a antiserum was produced and purified by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (CLR-1573, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected using jetPEI cationic polymer transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection Inc., New York, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Standard dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 17 (E17) mice, as described previously (16Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT press, Cambridge, UK1998: 339-370Google Scholar), with small modifications. Briefly, hippocampal cells were dissociated by enzymatic treatment (0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C) and plated on poly-dl-ornithine-coated coverslips (50,000 cells/cm2). The cells were grown in Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and preincubated on astroglial cultures for 24 h. After the indicated period of time, the neuronal cultures were fixed for 10 min in -20 °C cold methanol, washed in PBS, and blocked for 1 h at 24 °C in blocking solution (4% bovine serum albumin, 3% sheep serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, in PBS). The cells were first incubated in 2% bovine serum albumin, 1.5% sheep serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS containing anti-KCC2a rabbit polyclonal (1:1000) and anti-neuronal class III β-tubulin (TUJ-1) mouse monoclonal (Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA; 1:5000) or anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) mouse monoclonal (Chemicon-Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:1000) antibodies at 24 °C for 2 h and then washed three times for 10 min with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:400) and Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (1:400) secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After three washings for 10 min in PBS and one washing in water, coverslips were mounted in VECTASHIELD HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). SDS-PAGE—For the analysis of KCC2 protein levels, HEK293 cells or tissue samples were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After centrifugation for 10 min (15,000 × g) at 4 °C, protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The standard 2× Laemmli loading buffer contained (4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The samples were not heated because this may cause transmembrane proteins to form unspecific higher order complexes (17Sagne C. Isambert M.F. Henry J.P. Gasnier B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated using 10% Criterion XT precast Bis-Tris gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). PFO-PAGE—Analysis of protein complexes in native gels was done as described (18Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), with small modifications. Briefly, cell and tissue samples were prepared in TNE buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), supplemented with the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and 25 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) to prevent formation of artificial disulfide bonds. The 2× sample buffer contained 8% (w/v) sodium perfluoro-octanoate (NaPFO, Fluorochem Ltd., Derbyshire, UK), 25 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma), 0.004% bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm Tris base. Proteins were separated using 5% Criterion Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) in PFO-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% NaPFO, pH 8.5). Immunoblotting—Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies (all diluted 1:2000) made in rabbit (anti-KCC2a (this study), anti-KCC2b (11Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), anti-KCC2pan (19Ludwig A. Li H. Saarma M. Kaila K. Rivera C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), anti-SPAK (20Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. H. Ushiro), and anti-GFP (Invitrogen)) or in mouse (anti-GAPDH (Chemicon-Millipore) and anti-Myc tag (clone 9E10, Sigma)) with subsequent probing with horseradish peroxidase-linked ECL anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare) or anti-mouse (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) antibodies. Blots were developed with Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce Biotechnology), visualized with the luminescent image analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan), and analyzed with Advanced Image Data Analysis (AIDA) imaging software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). All measurements were within the linear range of the sensitivity of the camera. To estimate the relative contribution of KCC2a to total KCC2 protein (KCC2a/total KCC2) in different brain areas and time points, we included known dilutions of KCC2a-expressing HEK293 cell lysates as standards. Membranes were stained with the KCC2a antibody, stripped, and then stained with the KCC2pan antibody. A standard curve for each antibody was made by plotting the concentration (-fold dilution) of the KCC2a standard on the x axis and measuring band intensity on the y axis and then fitting a line to the data using the “least squares” method. The ratio between their slopes was used as a coefficient to account for the different ability of the KCC2a and KCC2pan antibodies to bind KCC2a. The method is also based on the fact that the KCC2pan antibody is directed against the C terminus that is identical in both KCC2a and KCC2b. Similarly, by using KCC2b standards, we estimated the ratio of KCC2b/total KCC2 in the same samples (data not shown). Summation of the obtained KCC2a/total KCC2 and KCC2b/total KCC2 percentage values for each sample resulted in ∼100%. Immunohistochemistry—Brains obtained from E18 wild-type or KCC2 null mutant mouse embryos were embedded unfixed in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands). Cryosections were dried at 24 °C for 30 min, postfixed in ice-cold methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min, and washed three times for 10 min with PBS. Sections were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 24 °C. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antisera against KCC2a (1:500), KCC2b (1:200), or KCC2pan (1:800) dissolved in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing three times in PBS, sections were incubated for 2 h at 24 °C with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe, Suffolk, UK) dissolved in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100. After three more washings in PBS, coverslips were mounted in PBS-glycerol. For detection of KCC2a and KCC2b in the same section using two primary antibodies from the same species, we used the method of tyramine signal amplification followed by heating after the first secondary antibody step that prevents binding of the second secondary antibody to the first primary antibody (21Toth Z.E. Mezey E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The sections were first blocked for 1 h with a blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.5% blocking reagent (supplied by the TSA kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal donkey serum followed by staining with the KCC2b antibody (1:3000) overnight at 4 °C. Then, a SuperPicture horseradish peroxidase polymer conjugate for rabbit primary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Invitrogen) was applied at a 1:2 dilution for 1 h followed by the tyramine-Cy3 reaction (TSA Plus system; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were then heated in PBS to boiling point in a microwave oven for 10 min. This was followed by blocking for 1 h with 10% normal donkey serum, staining with the KCC2a antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C, and finally labeling with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Similar results were obtained when sections were first labeled with the KCC2a antibody and detected with tyramine-Cy3, and then heated and stained for KCC2b with Alexa Fluor 488 detection. In both cases, no specific Alexa Fluor 488 labeling was seen in control sections when the second primary antibody was omitted (data not shown). coIP—CoIP experiments were performed according to Cai et al. (22Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with small modifications. HEK293 cells, grown on 10-cm plates and transfected with appropriate expression constructs, were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed for 15 min in ice-cold TNE buffer, supplemented with the Complete protease inhibitor mixture and the PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and centrifuged for 10 min (12,000 × g) at 4 °C. Supernatant was preclarified for 1 h at 4 °C with blocked protein-G-Sepharose beads (GammaBind G-Sepharose, GE Healthcare) and incubated overnight with 2 μg of the appropriate antibody. Thereafter, the blocked beads were added again, and incubation continued for 2 h. After washing of the beads twice with the ice-cold TNE buffer for 10 min and twice with PBS for 5 min, the bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and separated by SDS-PAGE. CoIP using E18 rat brainstem as a starting material was performed as above, with small modifications. Lysis time was increased to 1 h, and 1% Triton X-100 was added into the lysis buffer. The lysis was followed by a prolonged (30 min, 6000 × g) centrifugation at 4 °C. For each coIP reaction, 5 mg of the total protein was used. The Sepharose beads were washed four times in TNE buffer and once in PBS. Characterization of Antibodies Specific for the KCC2a and KCC2b Isoforms—To study KCC2a protein expression in vivo, we developed a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal part of KCC2a (amino acids 20–40 of mouse KCC2a sequence, see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoblot analysis of neonatal (postnatal day 2 (P2)) mouse brain lysates indicated that the antibody detects a protein product of the size (∼140 kDa) expected for endogenous KCC2a monomer (Fig. 1A). This signal was absent when the antibody was preincubated with the immunizing peptide. The ∼140-kDa band corresponding to the KCC2 protein was absent from brain lysates of KCC2 knock-out (10Tornberg J. Voikar V. Savilahti H. Rauvala H. Airaksinen M.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) embryos (Fig. 1B). To further verify the specificity of the KCC2a antibody, we analyzed protein lysates of HEK293 cells (which do not express KCC2 endogenously) transfected with either KCC2a or KCC2b expression vectors. A previously described KCC2pan antibody against a C-terminal peptide common for both KCC2 isoforms (19Ludwig A. Li H. Saarma M. Kaila K. Rivera C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) detected both KCC2a and KCC2b proteins, as expected, whereas the KCC2a antibody revealed a protein product of the expected size from cells transfected with the KCC2a but not with the KCC2b plasmid (Fig. 1C). In addition, we found that a previously published antibody against KCC2 (11Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) specifically recognized the KCC2b but not the KCC2a isoform from HEK293 lysates transfected with the corresponding expression plasmids (Fig. 1C). Here, this antibody is renamed as the KCC2b antibody. KCC2a Protein Is Expressed Only in the CNS—To study the distribution of KCC2a in adult mouse tissues, equal amounts of protein lysates from five brain regions, the spinal cord, and six non-neural tissues were analyzed by immunoblotting using the KCC2a antibody. A product of 140 kDa, close to the predicted molecular mass of 126 kDa for the KCC2a protein, was detected in the spinal cord and in all brain regions analyzed, being the strongest in the brainstem (Fig. 2). No bands corresponding to the KCC2a protein were seen in any of the non-neural tissues (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with our previous data showing that KCC2a mRNA is detectable exclusively in the CNS (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P. Kaila K. Delpire E. Timmusk T. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30570-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). KCC2a Protein Expression Remains Relatively Constant during Postnatal Development—KCC2a and KCC2b isoforms are transcribed from different promoters, and thus, their expression is differently regulated (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P. Kaila K. Delpire E. Timmusk T. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30570-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To study the expression of the KCC2 isoforms during postnatal development, we analyzed protein lysates of the brainstem, cortex, and spinal cord taken from P2 and adult (48-week-old) mice by immunoblotting. The samples were prepared and separated under standard reducing and denaturing conditions that resulted in the KCC2 proteins migrating as monomers in the gel. The blots were probed sequentially with the KCC2a, KCC2pan, and GAPDH antibodies (Fig. 3). KCC2a expression in the P2 brainstem and spinal cord was similar and ∼3-fold higher than expression in the P2 cortex (Fig. 3, A and B). When compared with P2, KCC2a protein levels in adults were ∼2-fold lower in the brainstem and spinal cord but ∼2-fold higher in the cortex, resulting in comparable KCC2a protein levels between the adult brain areas. KCC2pan antibody staining indicated an ∼15-fold higher expression of total KCC2 (KCC2a+KCC2b) in the adult than in the P2 cortex. Total KCC2 expression, by contrast, was increased only moderately (2-fold) in the brainstem and not significantly in the spinal cord between the P2 and adult time points (Fig. 3, A and C). In summary, KCC2a protein expression shows only moderate changes during postnatal mouse development, whereas total KCC2 (and thus KCC2b) expression is strongly up-regulated especially in the cortex. Approximately Half of Total KCC2 Protein in Neonatal Mouse CNS Is KCC2a—Expression of KCC2 mRNA and protein is high in mouse brainstem and spinal cord neurons already at birth (11Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 23Balakrishnan V. Becker M. Lohrke S. Nothwang H.G. Guresir E. Friauf E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study indicated that KCC2a contributes up to 50% of total KCC2 mRNA expression in these areas (9Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Pruunsild P. Kaila K. Delpire E. Timmusk T. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30570-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To estimate the relative abundance of KCC2a versus total KCC2 protein in different regions of neonatal and adult mouse CNS, we exploit the KCC2pan antibody that is directed against the common C terminus and is thus expected to recognize the two KCC2 isoforms with equal affinity. Lysates of spinal cord and several brain regions from P2 and adult mice were analyzed by immunoblotting in parallel with KCC2a standards (known dilutions of a lysate of HEK293 cells overexpressing KCC2a). Membranes were stained with the KCC2a antibody, stripped, and then stained with the KCC2pan antibody (Fig. 4A). Standard curves for the KCC2a and KCC2pan antibodies were derived from measured band intensities of known KCC2a amounts (Fig. 4C) and used to quantify the ratio of KCC2a to total KCC2 protein in the CNS samples. In newborn mice, KCC2a protein made up about 60% of the total KCC2 expression in the brainstem and cortex and about 50% in the spinal cord (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the KCC2b isoform was the prevalent KCC2 form in all adult CNS areas analyzed. The lowest relative expression of KCC2a in the adult mouse CNS was seen in the cerebellum (∼5% of total KCC2 protein), and the highest (∼20%) was seen in the brainstem and spinal cord (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained by analyzing the ratio of KCC2b to total KCC2 protein from the same samples including KCC2b protein standards using the KCC2b and KCC2pan antibodies (data not shown). To sum up, the KCC2a and KCC2b protein levels are comparable in the neonatal mouse CNS, whereas most of the KCC2 protein in the adult mouse is of the KCC2b isoform. Neuron-specific Expression and Subcellular Localization of the KCC2a Isoform—To test whether the KCC2a antibody is able to detect endogenous KCC2a in neurons, parallel cultures of hippocampal neurons (cultured for 11 days in vitro, DIV11) from wild-type and KCC2 null mutant (10Tornberg J. Voikar V. Savilahti H. Rauvala H. Airaksinen M.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) embryos were fixed in methanol and double-immunostained with the KCC2a and TUJ-1 (neuron-specific β-III-tubulin) antibodies. A strong KCC2a immunoreactive signal was detected in the TUJ1-positive neurons from wild-type embryos, whereas only weak background labeling was observed in the TUJ1-positive neurons from the KCC2 null mutant embryos (Fig. 5A). To confirm that the KCC2a antibody labeling is neuron-specific, co-cultures of hippocampal neurons and astroglial cells were double-stained with the KCC2a and GFAP (marker for astroglial cells) antibodies. All of the GFAP-positive glial cells were KCC2a-negative (Fig. 5B). To study the subcellular localization of the KCC2a protein during neuronal development, DIV5 and DIV19 neuron cultures were fixed and double-stained for the KCC2a and TUJ-1 as above and analyzed by confocal microscopy. KCC2a immunoreactivity was located throughout the cell soma and dendritic shafts already in DIV5 neurons (Fig. 5C). We did not find any apparent change in KCC2a expression levels or localization between DIV5 and the more mature DIV19 cultures; the KCC2a signal was always neuron-specific and was equally distributed in the cell bodies and dendritic shafts (Fig. 5C). To summarize, the results indicate that the KCC2a antibody can detect the endogenous KCC2a isoform in methanol-fixed cultures and confirm the exclusively neuron-specific expression of KCC2a protein. KCC2a and KCC2b Have Similar Expression Patterns in Perinatal Mouse Brain—Applicability of the KCC2a antibody for immunohistochemistry was tested on cryosections from E18 wild-type and KCC2 null mutant mice. A standard 4% paraformaldehyde fixation protocol led to a high background (data not shown), whereas staining of sections fixed in cold methanol-acetone (1:1) gave a clear signal in the wild-type mice (Fig. 6A) and little or no signal in the KCC2 null mutant mice (Fig. 6B). As expected, no staining above background was seen in sections stained with the KCC2a antibody that was preadsorbed with the peptide used for immunization (data not shown). Strong KCC2a immunoreactivity was seen in non-cortical regions of E18 mouse brain (including olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain), whereas labeling of cerebral corte"

The amino acid substitutions that were selected were conservative and occurred in the second half of the membrane-associated N terminus. AtNHX1 complemented the lack of endogenous ScNHX1 in endosomal protein trafficking assays. Growth enhancement on hygromycin B and vanadate media agreed with a generally improved endosomal/prevacuolar function of the mutated proteins. In vivo measurements by 31P NMR revealed that wild-type and mutant AtNHX1 transporters did not affect cytosolic or vacuolar pH. Surprisingly, when yeast cells were challenged with lithium, a tracer for sodium, the main effect of the mutations in AtNHX1 was a reduction in the amount of compartmentalized lithium. When purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes or assayed in intact vacuoles isolated from yeast cells, a representative mutant transporter (V318I) showed a greater cation discrimination favoring potassium transport over that of sodium or lithium. Together, our data suggest that the endosome/prevacuolar compartment is a target for salt toxicity. Poisoning by toxic cations in the endosome/prevacuolar compartment is detrimental for cell functions, but it can be alleviated by improving the discrimination of transported alkali cations by the resident cation/H+ antiporter.

https://openalex.org/W2028764351,"The phagocytic oxidative burst is a primary effector of innate immunity that protects against bacterial infection. However, the mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) kill or inhibit bacteria is not known. It is often assumed that DNA is a primary target of oxidative damage, consistent with known effects of endogenously produced ROS in the bacterial cytoplasm. But most studies fail to distinguish between effects of host derived ROS versus damage caused by endogenous bacterial sources. We took advantage of both the ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to survive in macrophages and the genetic tractability of the system to test the hypothesis that phagocytic superoxide damages cytoplasmic targets including DNA.SodCI is a periplasmic Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) that contributes to the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium in macrophages. Through competitive virulence assays, we asked if sodCI has a genetic interaction with various cytoplasmic systems. We found that SodCI acts independently of cytoplasmic SODs, SodA and SodB. In addition, SodCI acts independently of the base excision repair system and RuvAB, involved in DNA repair. Although sodCI did show genetic interaction with recA, this was apparently independent of recombination and is presumably due to the pleiotropic effects of a recA mutation.Taken together, these results suggest that bacterial inhibition by phagocytic superoxide is primarily the result of damage to an extracytoplasmic target."
https://openalex.org/W2005453082,"Nucleus accumbens-1 (Nac1 or NAC-1) belongs to the BTB/POZ (Pox virus and Zinc finger/Bric-a-brac Tramtrack Broad complex) transcription factor family and is a novel protein that potentially participates in self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. In human cancer, NAC-1 is upregulated in several types of neoplasms, but particularly in recurrent chemoresistant ovarian carcinomas, suggesting a biological role for NAC-1 in the development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer. We have assessed this possibility and shown a correlation between NAC-1 expression and ex vivo paclitaxel resistance in ovarian serous carcinoma tissues and cell lines. We found that expression of Gadd45-γ-interacting protein 1 (Gadd45gip1), a downstream target negatively regulated by NAC-1, was reduced in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Ectopic expression of NAC-1 or knockdown of Gadd45gip1 conferred paclitaxel resistance, whereas NAC-1 knockdown or ectopic expression of Gadd45gip1 increased paclitaxel sensitivity. Furthermore, silencing NAC-1 expression or disrupting NAC-1 homodimerization by a dominant negative NAC-1 protein that contained only the BTB/POZ domain induced the expression of Gadd45γ, which interacted with Gadd45gip1. Reducing Gadd45γ expression by small hairpin RNAs partially enhanced paclitaxel resistance. Thus, this study provides new evidence that NAC-1 upregulation and homodimerization contribute to tumor recurrence by equipping ovarian cancer cells with the paclitaxel-resistant phenotype through negative regulation of the Gadd45 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2021556274,"A new virus called the Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) has recently been found in Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC). MCC is a rare aggressive small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma primarily derived from the skin, morphologically indistinguishable from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). So far the actual presence of the virus in MCC tumour cells on a morphological level has not been demonstrated, and the presence of MCPyV in other small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas has not been studied yet.We investigated MCC tissue samples from five patients and SCLCs from ten patients for the presence of MCPyV-DNA by PCR and sequencing. Electron microscopy was used to search ultrastructurally for morphological presence of the virus in MCPyV-DNA positive samples. MCPyV was detected in two out of five primary MCCs. In one MCC patient MCPyV-DNA was detected in the primary tumour as well as in the metastasis, strongly suggesting integration of MCPyV in the cellular DNA of the tumour in this patient. In the primary MCC of another patient viral particles in tumour cell nuclei and cytoplasm were identified by electron microscopy, indicating active viral replication in the tumour cells. In none of the SCLCs MCPyV-DNA was detected.Our results strongly suggest that MCPyV is an oncogenic polyomavirus in humans, and is potentially causally related to the development of MCC but not to the morphological similar SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2063695292,"NKCC1 is highly expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, where it is involved in gating sensory information. In a recent study, it was shown that peripheral nerve injury results in increased NKCC1 activity, not due to an increase in cotransporter expression, but to increased phosphorylation of the cotransporter (Pieraut, S., Matha, V., Sar, C., Hubert, T., Méchaly, I., Hilaire, C., Mersel, M., Delpire, E., Valmier, J., and Scamps, F. (2007) J. Neurosci. 27, 6751-6759). Our laboratory has also identified two Ste20-like kinases that bind and phosphorylate NKCC1: Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative-stress response 1 (OSR1). In this study, we show that both kinases are expressed at similar expression levels in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and that both kinases participate equally in the regulation of NKCC1. Using a novel fluorescence method to assay NKCC1 activity in single cells, we show a 50% reduction in NKCC1 activity in DRG neurons isolated from SPAK knockout mice, indicating that another kinase, e.g. OSR1, is present to phosphorylate and activate the cotransporter. Using a nociceptive dorsal root ganglion sensory neuronal cell line, which expresses the same cation-chloride cotransporters and kinases as native DRG neurons, and gene silencing via short hairpin RNA, we demonstrate a direct relationship between kinase expression and cotransporter activity. We show that inactivation of either kinase significantly affects NKCC1 activity, whereas inactivation of both kinases results in an additive effect. In summary, our study demonstrates redundancy of kinases in the regulation of NKCC1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons."

We assessed the devastating effects on people's post-earthquake concern about safety and health.From June 4 to July 15, 2008, we surveyed a convenience sample of 2,262 adults on their post-earthquake concern about safety and health. Residents in non-devastated areas (Fujian and Hunan Provinces, and Beijing) and devastated areas (Sichuan and Gansu Provinces) responded to a questionnaire of 5 questions regarding safety measures, epidemic disease, medical workers, psychological workers, and medication. The ANOVAs showed a significant effect of residential devastation level on the estimated number of safety measures needed, the estimated probability of the outbreak of an epidemic, and the estimated number of medical and psychological workers needed (Ps<0.001). The post-earthquake concern decreased significantly as the level of residential devastation increased. Because of the similarity with the meteorological phenomenon of the eye of a typhoon, we dubbed these findings a ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"": the closer to the center of the devastated areas, the less the concern about safety and health a resident felt.Contrary to common perception and ripple effect that the impact of an unfortunate event decays gradually as ripples spread outward from a center, a ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"" effect was observed where the post-earthquake concern was at its lowest level in the extremely devastated areas. The resultant findings may have implications for Chinese governmental strategies for putting ""psychological comfort"" into effect."

Here we identify for the first time a multifunctional surface lipoprotein of B. recurrentis, termed HcpA, and demonstrate that it binds human complement regulators, Factor H, CFHR-1, and simultaneously, the host protease plasminogen. Cell surface bound factor H was found to retain its activity and to confer resistance to complement attack. Moreover, ectopic expression of HcpA in a B. burgdorferi B313 strain, deficient in Factor H binding proteins, protected the transformed spirochetes from complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, HcpA-bound plasminogen/plasmin endows B. recurrentis with the potential to resist opsonization and to degrade extracellular matrix components. Together, the present study underscores the high virulence potential of B. recurrentis. The elucidation of the molecular basis underlying the versatile strategies of B. recurrentis to escape innate immunity and to persist in human tissues, including the brain, may help to understand the pathological processes underlying louse-borne relapsing fever."
https://openalex.org/W2081538118,"Germline mutations in two major susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for nearly 20% of familial breast cancers. A majority of the remaining genetic factors involved in heritable breast cancer susceptibility are, however, unknown. Recently, a new BRCA1-interacting protein, receptor associated protein 80 (RAP80), was identified. RAP80 plays an important role in BRCA1-mediated DNA damage responses (DDRs) by recruiting BRCA1 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A comprehensive screening of DNA from affected index cases of 112 BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-negative Finnish breast cancer families revealed altogether 10 alterations in RAP80, one of which, c.241-243delGAA, resulted in a single glutamic acid deletion at residue 81 in a highly conserved region of ubiquitin interaction motif 1. The resultant delE81 protein product displayed significantly reduced ubiquitin binding and DSB localization. Expression of the RAP80 delE81 allele impaired both BRCA1 and ABRA1 DSB recruitment, thus compromising BRCA1-mediated DDR signaling. Compared with wild-type RAP80, expression of the delE81 allele was associated with a significant increase in cytogenetically detectable chromosomal aberrations, particularly chromatid breaks. Although evidently quite rare, these results suggest that critical constitutional mutations in RAP80 abrogate DDR function and may be involved in genetic predisposition to cancer."

We found a double dissociation whereby remembering nameable odorants was reflected in sustained activity in prefrontal language areas, and remembering unnameable odorants was reflected in sustained activity in primary olfactory cortex.These findings suggest a novel dedicated mechanism in primary olfactory cortex, where odor information is maintained in temporary storage to subserve ongoing tasks."

The cardinal manifestation of late stage LD in the U.S. is Lyme arthritis (LA), with ∼70% of the untreated EM cases developing this syndrome (10Steere A.C. Schoen R.T. Taylor E. Ann. Intern.

Currently, diagnosis of LD is generally based on assessment of clinical features in combination with immunologic serum testing, where both ELISA and a confirming immunoblot are required (12Reed K.D.

However, because in Europe and Asia at least three species are causing LD, there is a substantial variation of immunodominant antigens, which requires the combination of various homologous antigens for effective serodiagnosis (14Wilske B.

Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In comparison to diagnostic procedures, vaccination strategies directed against LD so far have also been based on proteinaceous antigens: in the 1990s, recombinant vaccines based on OspA were found to be effective (17Steere A.C. Sikand V.K. Meurice F. Parenti D.L. Fikrig E. Schoen R.T. Nowakowski J. Schmid C.H. Laukamp S. Buscarino C. Krause D.S. N. Engl. J.

Coburn J. Glickstein L. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Another concern raised against this approach was a potential triggering of autoimmune diseases by vaccination with Osps due to a similarity between an immunodominant epitope in OspA and human leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (18Gross D.M. Forsthuber T. Tary-Lehmann M. Etling C. Ito K. Nagy Z.A. Field J.A. Steere A.C. Huber B.T. Science. 1998; 281: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast to proteins, information on membrane glycolipids in Borrelia available today is rather scarce. In 1978, a preliminary compositional analysis of lipid extracts of B. hermsii causing relapsing fever (RF) indicated the presence of monoglucosyldiacylglycerol and acylated as well as non-acylated cholesteryl glucosides (19Livermore B.P. Bey R.F. Johnson R.C. Infect. Immun. 1978; 20: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later, studies on Bbu indicated the presence of complex glycolipids as well, but no chemical analysis was performed (20Honarvar N. Schaible U.E. Galanos C. Wallich R. Simon M.M.

A more recent study identified mono-α-d-galactosyldiacylglycerol (MGalD) in Bbu, and first data indicated that antibodies present in sera obtained from LD patients detected this antigen (22Hossain H. Wellensiek H.J. Geyer R. Lochnit G. Biochimie. (Paris). 2001; 83: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

The aim of this study was to elucidate whether ACGal is a common structure present in the most relevant B. burgdorferi species of clinical importance, and whether it is a specific feature of Borrelia causing LD. Furthermore, we aimed at defining the frequency of the occurrence of antibodies against this antigen in patients suffering from LD. To this end, we performed a comparative structural analysis of glycolipid fractions of Bbu as well as the two other B. burgdorferi s.l. species of clinical importance, Baf and Bga, in comparison with B. hermsii (Bhe), the causative agent of relapsing fever. We found ACGal to be present in all B. burgdorferi species tested, whereas Bhe exhibited cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (ACGlc) instead. Antibodies against ACGal could be detected in the majority of patients diagnosed for arthritis or acrodermatitis, and these failed to cross-react with ACGlc. These data demonstrate that ACGal is an abundant, but still highly specific antigen in B. burgdorferi and thus a promising candidate for vaccine development and improvement of serologic methods. Borrelia Strains—B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B31, tick isolate, ATCC 35210) was kindly provided by B. Hammer, Institute for Microbiology and Hygiene, Charité, Berlin, Germany; B. garinii (A, tick isolate) was a gift by R. Ackermann, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. B. afzelii (PKo, human skin isolate) was provided by B.W., Munich, Germany. B. hermsii (HS1, tick isolate) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cultivation of Borrelia—Glycerol stocks of Borrelia were stored at –80 °C. 100 μl was transferred to 5 ml of BSK-H complete medium containing 6% rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). After 3–4 days of culture at 34 °C and microaerophilic conditions, viability of bacteria was ensured by darkfield microscopy, and cultures were transferred to 50 ml of medium. After culturing for another 4 days, bacteria were transferred to the final volume of 500 ml. Borrelia were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min followed by two washing steps with endotoxin-free water (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) under similar conditions. Bacteria were then subjected to analytical and preparative procedures. Sonicates were prepared by suspending dried Borrelia (5 mg) in 5 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate followed by sonication four times for 2 min. The sonicate then was centrifuged for 3 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were harvested and spun for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) and stored at –20 °C. Cell Disintegration and Total Lipid Extraction—Lyophilized Borrelia cells were suspended in 15 ml of pyrogen-free water and subsequently disrupted by a sonifier (250 watts, Branson, Danbury, CT, using a 5-mm micro tip, output control 6, duty cycle 50%) 3 times for 5 min in ice-cooled water. 15 ml of n-butanol (LiChrosolv, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were added to the suspension, and the tube was shaken for 15 min. For phase separation it was centrifuged at 6200 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the butanol phase was taken off. The remaining phases (water, interphase, and pellet) were extracted again with 15 ml of n-butanol. Both butanol phases were united and re-extracted with 15 ml of pyrogen-free water. The total lipids were yielded after vacuum evaporation of the butanol phase as an oily solid. Analytical TLC and Preparative TLC—To analyze the lipids, three solvent systems were used: CHCl3/MeOH (85:15, v/v) for glycolipids, CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v) for phospholipids, and toluene/EtOH (85:15, v/v) for cholesteryl β-d-galactopyranoside (βCGal)/cholesteryl β-d-glucopyranoside (βCGlc) separation. The latter was applied 5 times (run and dried) for a clear distinction. The runs were performed on silica gel-coated aluminum plates (Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.2 mm, Merck) and stained with molybdenum stain solution (1 m H2SO4, 40 mm ammoniumheptamolybdat [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O], 3 mm Cer(IV)-sulfate [Ce(SO4)2·4H2O]). For staining the plates were immersed into the molybdenum stain solution and heated to ∼250 °C using a heat gun. To purify βCGlc we employed an additional preparative step: The sample was loaded onto a 20-cm-length aluminum TLC plate (Kieselgel 60, 0.2 mm, Merck) and run in a saturated 20-cm-height chamber with CHCl3/MeOH (85:15, v/v). According to reference sample Rf values, the βCGlc was scraped off, eluted with MeOH (Chromasolv for high-performance liquid chromatography, Riedel de Haen, Seelze, Germany) on a suction filter (35 mm, porosity 4), and membrane-filtered (as above). Standard substances used as TLC references were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich for cholesterol, cholesteryl oleate, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl glycerol, or from Research Plus (Manasquan, NJ) for cholesteryl β-d-glucopyranoside (βCGlc). Cholesteryl α-d-galactopyranoside (αCGal) was kindly provided by Dirk Warnecke, Biozentrum Klein Flottbek, Hamburg, Germany. Flash Column Chromatography—A glass column (diameter, 2.2 cm) was filled with 125-cm3 silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 40–63 μm, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and equilibrated with CHCl3 under N2 overpressure. The column was loaded with the extracted total lipids and eluted under N2 overpressure sequentially each with 2 column volumes of CHCl3, CHCl3/MeOH (49:1, v/v), CHCl3/MeOH (48:2, v/v), CHCl3/MeOH (47:3, v/v), CHCl3/MeOH (46:4, v/v), and finally 12 column volumes of CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (39:10:1, v/v). Fractions (10 ml) were collected, and every second one was checked by molybdenum stain staining for lipid content. The fractions comprising the same lipid were filtered through a PVDF membrane filter (TE 35, 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and were combined. GLC and Combined GLC-MS—Compositional analysis employing GLC-MS was performed with 100 μg of each sample after mild methanolysis with 1.5 ml of 0.5 m HCl/MeOH for 1 h at 85 °C in sealed ampoules. The liquid was blown off by N2, and the sample was subsequently peracetylated with 1 ml of pyridine/acetanhydride (2:1, v/v) for 1 h at 80 °C and concentrated. The chromatography was run on a Hewlett Packard, model 5890 Series II (column: HP-5MS 30 m, Agilent, Böblingen, Germany) with a temperature gradient from 150 °C (3 min) to 320 °C at 5 °C/min. The mass spectra were detected and recorded by electron impact and chemical ionization (HP 5989A, Agilent). NMR Spectroscopy—The glycolipids and phospholipids were dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform-d/methanol-d4 (9:1, v/v) and DMSO-d6, respectively (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA), and the NMR spectra were recorded in 5-mm high precision NMR tubes (Promochem, Wesel, Germany) at 300 K. Proton (1H) and all proton-detected two-dimensional NMR spectra were run on a Bruker DRX-600 Avance spectrometer at 600 MHz. Carbon (13C) and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT 135) spectra were measured on a Bruker DPX-360 spectrometer at 90.6 MHz. The chemical shift values were referenced to internal tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.00 ppm) or CDCl3 (δc = 77.0 ppm). 1H/1H correlated spectroscopy (COSY), 1H/1H total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H/13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and 1H/13C heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) experiments were performed using standard Bruker software (XWinNMR 3.5). Patient Sera—Sera derived from patients diagnosed for LD as well as sera derived from controls were provided by B.W. and V.F., Munich, Germany. Serodiagnosis was based on ELISA and subsequent confirmative immunoblotting. In total, 68 samples from patients (20 for EM, 19 for early NB, 14 for ACA, and 15 for LA), and 20 samples from healthy controls were tested. Immunoblotting of Glycolipids—MGalD derived from Bbu, ACGal from Bbu, Bga and Baf and ACGlc from Bhe (1 μg each), dissolved in tert-butanol/H2O (4:1), and Borrelia sonicate (30 μl, corresponding to 30 μg of dried bacteria) were pipetted directly on PVDF membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) previously immersed in MeOH and PBS. Membranes were blocked with PBS/5% skim milk (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland)/0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS/0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with sera diluted 1,000-fold in PBS/5% skim milk/0.05% Tween 20 for 3 h at room temperature. After washing, a rabbit anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 10,000-fold in PBS/5% skim milk/0.05% Tween 20 was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with PBS, and bands were detected with the ECL-system (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol using Hyperfilm ECL-films (Amersham Biosciences). The same procedure was employed for detecting IgM using anti-human IgM-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For TLC immunoblotting, Borrelia extracts were separated on TLC as described above. The run TLC plate was transferred to a membrane by application of heat employing a published protocol (25Taki T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: The dried TLC plate was slowly submersed into transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10.4, 20% MeOH) for 10 s. The plate was gently dried using a soft tissue leaving only a little wetness. The PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with the same dimensions was put on top and was quickly straightened with a glass rod. Covered by a glass microfiber sheet (GF/A, Whatman, Brentford, UK), a 150 °C preheated electric iron was placed on the membrane and plate for 30 s. The membrane was peeled off and let dry. The development of the blots was similar as described above for immunoblotting of membranes. ACGal Antibody Titer Determination—A 96-well plate (Nunc maxisorb, Nunc a/s, Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with 50 μl per well of a 30 μg/ml ACGal solution (in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2) for 16 h at 4 °C. The plate was washed twice with distilled water, blocked with 200 μl per well blocking buffer (0.05 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed three times with 200 μl of washing buffer (0.05 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and incubated with 100 μl per well of sera diluted in washing buffer for 2 h. After washing (3×) the plate was incubated with 100 μl per well of a 1:1000 dilution of secondary antibody HRP conjugate (rabbit anti-human IgG-HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in washing buffer for an additional 2 h. Following a washing step (3×) the staining was started by addition of 100 μl per well tetramethylbenzidine solution (SeramunBlau slow (ELISA), Seramun Diagnostica, Heidese, Germany), incubated in the dark for a few minutes and stopped with 50 μl per well 2 m H2SO4. The optical density was measured at 450 nm in an ELISA reader (SPECTRA Fluor Plus, Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). As a cut-off, the mean value of negative samples at the corresponding dilution plus the 2-fold standard deviation was used. Comparative Analysis of Lipid Extracts from Different Borrelia burgdorferi Strains—Bbu, Bga, Baf, and Bhe were grown in BSK-H medium, harvested, and lyophilized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Butanol extraction yielded 161 mg of total lipids for Bbu, 16.6 mg for Bga, 11.3 mg for Baf, as well as 25.0 mg for Bhe, respectively, corresponding to 26.7, 28.6, 24.7, and 28.8% of total dry weight (Table 1). The total lipids were subjected to TLC in CHCl3/MeOH 85:15 (v/v) to separate glycolipids and visualized with Mostain (Fig. 1A). In the lipid extract derived from Bbu, all previously described lipids (23Schröder N.W. Schombel U. Heine H. Göbel U.B. Zähringer U. Schumann R.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the phospholipid fraction F5 revealed two spots, which were subdivided into fractions F5a and F5b (Fig. 1, A and B).TABLE 1Lipid proportions of total lipids and borrelial dry weight for the species B. burgdorferi s.s.

Upon analytical TLC in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v), fraction F5 formerly identified as phosphatidylcholine (23Schröder N.W. Schombel U. Heine H. Göbel U.B. Zähringer U. Schumann R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33645-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) now revealed two distinct spots (Fig. 1B). Further analysis showed that lipid F5b co-migrates with the phosphatidylcholine standard, whereas F5a co-migrates with the phosphatidylglycerol standard. Both chemical structures were confirmed by NMR in DMSO-d6 and MALDI-TOF (data not shown) and are in line with previous reports (21Radolf J.D. Goldberg M.S. Bourell K. Baker S.I. Jones J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Belisle J.T. Brandt M.E. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon analytical TLC in different solvents (CHCl3/MeOH 85:15 (v/v), hexane/ethyl acetate 1:1 (v/v)) the fractions F1a and F1b, which are present only in minor portions of the total lipids (2–3%, Table 1), were compared with cholesterol and cholesteryl oleate standards and revealed that F1a co-migrated with cholesteryl oleate and F1b with cholesterol (not shown), which is part of the BSK-H medium (486 nm). Both were not further analyzed. Presence of ACGal in B. garinii and B. afzelii—In Bbu, the fractions F2, F3, and F4b were analyzed by GLC-MS, NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS and gave identical results as published before (23Schröder N.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33645-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with F2 identified as cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ACGal), F3 as mono-α-d-galactopyranosyldiacylglycerol (MGalD), and F4b as cholesteryl β-d-galactopyranoside (βCGal, data not shown), respectively. Bga and Baf exhibited glycolipids migrating at identical Rf values (Fig. 1). The major lipid in all three strains was fraction F2. It was identified in Baf and Bga by GLC-MS (Fig. 2A), NMR (Fig. 2B), and MALDI-TOF-MS (not shown) as cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, thus being identical with ACGal formerly identified in Bbu (Fig. 3). No significant differences in the fatty acid distribution could be observed, because in all three LD strains palmitic acid (16:0) and oleic acid (18:1) dominated.FIGURE 3Chemical structures of identified acylated cholesteryl glycosides in LD and RF Borrelia. The structural analysis of fraction F2 in the three LD Borrelia revealed 6-O-acylated cholesteryl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ACGal), whereas the RF-causing B. hermsii contains 6-O-acylated cholesteryl-β-d-glucopyranoside (ACGlc) instead; depicted are the structures with oleic acid (18:1). The only difference in both structures is the configuration of the hydroxyl group of C-4 in the carbohydrate: in d-glucopyranoside equatorial and in d-galactopyranoside axial.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of βCGlc in B. burgdorferi—As mentioned above, fraction F4a was not detected previously, potentially because it is present only in trace amounts (Table 1) and stains also faintly with sulfuric acid/EtOH, used in the first studies (23Schröder N.W.

Under conditions used for TLC, α-glycosides possess slightly higher Rf values as compared with β-glycosides; therefore we first considered F4a as cholesteryl α-d-galactopyranoside (αCGal). A comparison of chemically synthesized αCGal standard with F4a derived from Bbu applied to TLC in toluene/EtOH 85:15 (v/v) gave clearly distinct Rf values, ruling out αCGal. Next we compared F4a with cholesteryl β-d-glucopyranoside standard by the same procedure and found no differences in the retention of either. The column chromatography yielded a mixed pool of MGalD and F4a where the purity of F4a could be further enhanced by a preparative TLC step. A GLC-MS of isolated F4a revealed glucose and cholesterol but also galactose and glycerol, probably due to contaminations with MGalD. A 1H NMR spectrum of F4a was too weak to reveal clear evidence.

https://openalex.org/W2037667562,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutants are constitutively active and induce ligand-independent transformation in non-malignant cell lines. We investigated the possibility that the ability of mutant EGFRs to transform cells reflects a constitutive cooperativity with Src using a system in which the overexpression of mutant, but not wild-type, EGFR induced anchorage-independent cell growth. Src was constitutively activated and showed enhanced interaction with mutant EGFRs, suggesting that constitutive EGFR–Src cooperativity may contribute to mutant EGFR-mediated oncogenesis. Indeed, the mutant EGFR-mediated cell transformation was inhibited by Src- as well as EGFR-directed inhibitors. Importantly, a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of the major Src phosphorylation site on EGFR, Y845, reduced the constitutive phosphorylation of NSCLC-EGFR mutants, as well as that of STAT3, Akt, Erk and Src, and reduced the mutant EGFR–Src association as well as proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth. Reduced anchorage-independent growth and migration were also observed when dominant-negative-Src was expressed in mutant EGFR-expressing cells. Overall, our findings show that mutant EGFR–Src interaction and cooperativity play critical roles in constitutive engagement of the downstream signaling pathways that allow NSCLC-associated EGFR mutants to mediate oncogenesis, and support the rationale to target Src-dependent signaling pathways in mutant EGFR-mediated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2101281033,"The cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) produced by enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli was the first cyclomodulin to be identified that is injected into host cells via the type III secretion machinery. Cif provokes cytopathic effects characterized by G1 and G2 cell cycle arrests, accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1 and formation of actin stress fibres. The X-ray crystal structure of Cif revealed it to be a divergent member of a superfamily of enzymes including cysteine proteases and acetyltransferases that share a conserved catalytic triad. Here we report the discovery and characterization of four Cif homologs encoded by different pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria isolated from vertebrates or invertebrates. Cif homologs from the enterobacteria Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Photorhabdus luminescens, Photorhabdus asymbiotica and the β-proteobacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei all induce cytopathic effects identical to those observed with Cif from pathogenic E. coli. Although these Cif homologs are remarkably divergent in primary sequence, the catalytic triad is strictly conserved and was shown to be crucial for cell cycle arrest, cytoskeleton reorganization and CKIs accumulation. These results reveal that Cif proteins form a growing family of cyclomodulins in bacteria that interact with very distinct hosts including insects, nematodes and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2139157724,"Background Electrical impulses in animals play essential roles in co-ordinating an array of physiological functions including movement, secretion, environmental sensing and development. Underpinning many of these electrical signals is a fast Na+-based action potential that has been fully characterised only in cells associated with the neuromuscular systems of multicellular animals. Such rapid action potentials are thought to have evolved with the first metazoans, with cnidarians being the earliest representatives. The present study demonstrates that a unicellular protist, the marine diatom Odontella sinensis, can also generate a fast Na+/Ca2+ based action potential that has remarkably similar biophysical and pharmacological properties to invertebrates and vertebrate cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Methodology/Principal Findings The kinetic, ionic and pharmacological properties of the rapid diatom action potential were examined using single electrode current and voltage clamp techniques. Overall, the characteristics of the fast diatom currents most closely resemble those of vertebrate and invertebrate muscle Na+/Ca2+ currents. Conclusions/Significance This is the first demonstration of voltage-activated Na+ channels and the capacity to generate fast Na+-based action potentials in a unicellular photosynthetic organism. The biophysical and pharmacological characteristics together with the presence of a voltage activated Na+/Ca2+ channel homologue in the recently sequenced genome of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, provides direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that this rapid signalling mechanism arose in ancestral unicellular eukaryotes and has been retained in at least two phylogenetically distant lineages of eukaryotes; opisthokonts and the stramenopiles. The functional role of the fast animal-like action potential in diatoms remains to be elucidated but is likely involved in rapid environmental sensing of these widespread and successful marine protists."

CDPK4 has emerged as an important enzyme for parasite development, because its gene disruption in rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei causes major defects in sexual differentiation of the parasite (Billker, O., Dechamps, S., Tewari, R., Wenig, G., Franke-Fayard, B., and Brinkmann, V.

We report the biochemical characterization and elucidation of molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PfCDPK4. PfCDPK4 was detected on gametocyte periphery, and its activity in the parasite was regulated by phospholipase C. Even though the Junction Domain (JD) of PfCDPK4 shares moderate sequence homology with that of the plant CDPKs, it plays a pivotal role in PfCDPK4 regulation as previously reported for some plant CDPKs. The regions of the J-domain involved in interaction with both the kinase domain and the calmodulin-like domain were mapped.

Plasmodium falciparum is an intracellular protozoan parasite, which propagates in human erythrocyte and hepatocytes. It causes millions of deaths annually, which occur mostly in third world countries. It is very important to understand the molecular events involved in parasite development and growth in detail to develop effective drugs against this disease. In the human host, the parasite from an infected mosquito bite enters the bloodstream as a sporozoite. The sporozoite migrates and resides in the hepatocytes and replicates to yield merozoites. Upon rupture of the host cells, released merozoites invade red blood cells (RBCs), 3The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood corpuscles; aa, amino acid(s); CDPK, calcium-dependent protein kinase; CLD, calmodulin-like domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JD, junctional domain; MBP, myelin basic protein; PLC, phospholipase C; RT, reverse transcription; TFE, trifluoroethanol; PfCDPK1, P. falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1; Pep, peptide.3The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood corpuscles; aa, amino acid(s); CDPK, calcium-dependent protein kinase; CLD, calmodulin-like domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JD, junctional domain; MBP, myelin basic protein; PLC, phospholipase C; RT, reverse transcription; TFE, trifluoroethanol; PfCDPK1, P. falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1; Pep, peptide. and the asexual development takes place inside the RBC resulting in the formation of ring and trophozoite stages. During the schizont stage, the parasite undergoes nuclear division resulting in the formation of ∼24 merozoites, which infect fresh RBCs upon release. Some parasites commit to sexual differentiation resulting in the formation of male and female gametocytes. Upon ingestion into the mosquito gut, gametocytes are activated in response to environmental cues like lower temperature and xantheurenic acid (2Arai M. Billker O. Morris H.R. Panico M. Delcroix M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Detailed understanding of calcium-mediated signaling pathways could provide insights into novel molecular mechanisms involved in parasite development. For instance, calcium regulation of a protein kinase B-like enzyme (12Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) via calmodulin seems to be important for erythrocyte invasion (8Vaid A. Thomas D.C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5589-5597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Plasmodium contains calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) (13Ward P. Equinet L. Packer J. Doerig C. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), which have been found only in plants and some protists but are absent from almost all metazoans (14Harper J.F. Harmon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These enzymes have a catalytic domain at their N terminus and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (CLD) composed of four calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (14Harper J.F. Harmon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), a junction domain (JD) separates the catalytic domain from the CLD. Biochemical studies done on plant CDPKs have revealed that the JD regulates CDPK activity by interacting with both the kinase domain and the CLD (14Harper J.F. Harmon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C. McCaffery C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Work reported here reveals that, despite modest homology between the amino acid sequences of JD of plant CDPKs (like AtCPK1 and Soybean CDPKα) and PfCDPK4, there are some similarities between the mechanism of regulation between these kinases.Plasmodium has at least five CDPKs (13Ward P. Equinet L. Packer J. Doerig C. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and the importance of CDPKs in Plasmodium signaling has been highlighted by recent gene disruption studies. PfCDPK1 seems to be an essential gene as its disruption has not been possible in P. falciparum (7Kato N. Sakata T. Breton G. Le Roch K.G. Nagle A. Andersen C. Bursulaya B. Henson K. Johnson J. Kumar K.A. Marr F. Mason D. McNamara C. Plouffe D. Ramachandran V. Spooner M. Tuntland T. Zhou Y. Peters E.C. Chatterjee A. Schultz P.G. Ward G.E. Gray N. Harper J. Winzeler E.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Studies performed using an inhibitor against this kinase suggest that it may be important for RBC invasion and egress (7Kato N. Sakata T. Breton G. Le Roch K.G. Nagle A. Andersen C. Bursulaya B. Henson K. Johnson J. Kumar K.A. Marr F. Mason D. McNamara C. Plouffe D. Ramachandran V. Spooner M. Tuntland T. Zhou Y. Peters E.C. Chatterjee A. Schultz P.G. Ward G.E. Gray N. Harper J. Winzeler E.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Reverse genetic studies done in P. berghei suggest that CDPK3 may play an important role in ookinete gliding motility and invasion (9Ishino T. Orito Y. Chinzei Y. Yuda M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Siden-Kiamos I. Ecker A. Nyback S. Louis C. Sinden R.E. Billker O. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The gene disruption of CDPK4 in P. berghei caused severe defects in sexual reproduction and mosquito transmission (1Billker O. Dechamps S. Tewari R. Wenig G. Franke-Fayard B. Brinkmann V. Cell. 2004; 117: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These studies highlighted the importance of CDPK4 in Plasmodium biology and suggested that it may serve as a target for transmission-blocking drugs. The biochemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of this enzyme have remained unknown. In this study, we have explored the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PfCDPK4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESP. falciparum Cultures—P. falciparum 3D7 strain was cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented either with 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen) or 10% AB+ human serum as described earlier (12Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27126-27133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6077) Google Scholar). For sexual stage studies, 3D7A, a variant of P. falciparum strain 3D7, was used to obtain gametocyte-enriched culture as described previously (18Williams J.L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Molecular Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of PfCDPK4—Initially, PfCDPK4 gene sequence was obtained by using either TgCDPK1 or the published sequence of other CDPKs to BLAST search the P. falciparum genome sequence. Subsequently, PlasmoDb annotation (19Bahl A. Brunk B. Crabtree J. Fraunholz M.J. Gajria B. Grant G.R. Ginsburg H. Gupta D. Kissinger J.C. Labo P. Li L. Mailman M.D. Milgram A.J. Pearson D.S. Roos D.S. Schug J. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Whetzel P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) appeared in the public domain, and the gene sequence PF07_0072, which matched the PfCDPK4 sequence obtained by our studies. For PCR amplification, primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the PfCDPK4 gene were used. Total RNA from asynchronous P. falciparum cultures was used for reverse transcription (RT) along with random hexamers provided with the RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Both cDNA or genomic DNA were used as template for PCR. The reaction was carried out using Hi-fi Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following cycling parameters: 94 °C for 2 min initial denaturation followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Following sets of primers were used for amplification of the full-length gene PfCDPK4 forward (CDPK4F): 5′-ATGGGACAAGAGGTATCGAGTGTTAACAA-3′ and PfCDPK4 reverse (CDPK4R): 5′-TTAATAATTACAAAGTTTGACTAGCATAT-3′. PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the sequence for the cloned PfCDPK4 gene was obtained by automated DNA sequencing. For cloning in the expression vector pGEX4T1, PfCDPK4 or its variants were amplified using primers with overhangs containing restriction sites for SmaI and XhoI. All site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the standard protocol described by the manufacturer. Primer sets used for making mutants are provided in the supplemental materials.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Plasmid DNA was transformed in Escherichia coli BL21-RIL (Stratagene) strain for the expression of GST-PfCDPK4 and its mutants. Protein expression was induced by overnight incubation of cells with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18-20 °C. Subsequently, cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer, containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and proteases inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin), and sonication was performed for 6 cycles of 1 min each. The resulting cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Fusion proteins from the cell lysates were affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose resin as described previously (20Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the resin was washed with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 10 mm glutathione. Finally, purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by densitometry analysis of Coomassie-stained gels.For expression of PfCDPK1, PfCDPK1 (PFB0815w) was amplified from the asexual stage cDNA of P. falciparum and cloned in BamHI and XhoI pET-28a vector (see Table S1 in supplemental material for primer sequences) to facilitate its expression as a His6-tagged protein. Briefly, plasmid transformed BL21(DE3)RIL strain of Escherichia coli was grown in LB media containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and protein expression was induced using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), sonicated for 8 cycles of 1 min each. The soluble protein was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) with end-to-end shaking for 6 h at 4 °C, and the protein was eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol.Assay of PfCDPK4 Activity—The catalytic activity of PfCDPK4, PfCDPK1, or their variants was assayed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Either 6 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) or 150 μm Syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK, custom synthesized by Peptron Inc., South Korea) was used as phosphate-acceptor substrate. Reactions were performed in the presence of 2 mm calcium chloride or 2 mm EGTA (0 mm Ca2+) for 40 min at 30 °C. When MBP was used as the substrate, reactions were stopped by boiling the assay mix for 5 min followed by SDS-PAGE. Phosphate incorporation was adjudged by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE gels. When Syntide-2 was used as substrate, reactions were stopped by spotting the reaction mix on P81 phosphocellulose paper (Millipore), followed by washing of the paper strips with 75 mm ortho-phosphoric acid. Phosphate incorporation was assessed by scintillation counting of P81 paper. In PfCDPK4 inhibition assays, peptide inhibitors were preincubated with proteins in a kinase assay buffer at 25 °C for 30-60 min prior to the addition of substrate and ATP.Generation of Anti-PfCDPK4 Serum, Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence—A synthetic peptide (KMMTSKDNLNIDIPS) based on PfCDPK4 sequence was custom synthesized (Peptron Inc.), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an additional N terminus cysteine residue, and was used to raise antisera against PfCDPK4. Cell-free protein extracts were prepared from specific parasite stages as described previously (8Vaid A. Thomas D.C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5589-5597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After separation on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, lysate proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-PfCDPK4 antisera, and blots were developed using West-pico chemiluminescence (Pierce) reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence assays, thin blood smears of parasite cultures were fixed with cold methanol, and a previously published protocol was followed (20Kumar A. Vaid A. Syin C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24255-24264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axio Imager fluorescence microscope, and images were processed using the AxioVision software.Inhibitor Treatment and Immunoprecipitation—Gametocytes were distributed in six-well culture dishes and treated with various inhibitors for 30 min. Subsequently, protein lysates were prepared in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitors (20 μm NaF, 20 μm β-glycerophosphate, and 100 μm sodium vanadate) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 100 μg of soluble lysate protein was incubated with PfCDPK4 anti-sera for 6 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, Protein A+G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the antibody-protein complex and incubated on a end-to-end shaker for 2 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline-Sepharose, beads were suspended in the lysis buffer. PfCDPK4-IP was used for kinase assays as described above for the recombinant protein.Homology Modeling—The CLD-J domain shares ∼51% similarity with the CDPK from Arabidopsis thaliana AtCPK-1. The homology model of CLD-JD was determined using Swiss Model from EMBL. The template model used was CLD-JD of AtCPK-1, which was crystallized as a dimer. The J-domain helices from the two monomers were swapped with each other in this structure (21Chandran V. Stollar E.J. Lindorff-Larsen K. Harper J.F. Chazin W.J. Dobson C.M. Luisi B.F. Christodoulou J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the initial homology model generated for the complementary CLD-J domain for PfCDPK4 was also a dimer. To understand the interaction of this helix (Gln358-Lys371) with CLD of the monomer, this helix was rotated and translated keeping residues 372-375 as the flexible linker region and superimposed on to the helix from the other monomer, which resulted in the initial model for the CLD-J domain monomer. Initially, these flexible linker residues (372-375) were locally minimized using COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar), and the overall structure was refined with slow cooling using annealing of CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) to remove all the short contacts. Finally, the model quality was checked with the Procheck software (24Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar).CD—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter with a constant dispersion of 1 nm. Spectra were measured with a time constant of 1s, scan speed of 100 nm/min. Signals were averaged 10 times before measurement. The peptide concentration was between 185 and 350 μm, and a 0.1-cm path length cell was used.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of PfCDPK4 Gene—Gene-specific primers were used to amplify PfCDPK4 from genomic DNA and cDNA. The larger size of the PCR product obtained from genomic PCR suggested the presence of introns (data not shown) in PfCDPK4. Sequencing of RT-PCR product confirmed that PfCDPK4 contains an intron of 347 nucleotides (Fig. 1A), which was similar to the predictions made by PlasmoDb. The deduced amino acid sequence suggested that PfCDPK4 possesses a calmodulin-like domain at the C terminus and an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain, which are characteristic of CDPKs (14Harper J.F. Harmon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). PfCDPK4 catalytic domain possesses all 11 sub-domains that are representative of most protein kinases (supplemental Fig. S1). A glycine residue at the second position suggests that it has a putative myristoylation signal, a similar myristoylation signal in PfCDPK1 is important for its membrane targeting (25Moskes C. Burghaus P.A. Wernli B. Sauder U. Durrenberger M. Kappes B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 676-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The CLD of PfCDPK4 consists of an N and C lobe and each lobe comprises of two EF-hand motifs (Fig. 1B). A ∼34 amino acid (aa) junction domain links the CLD and the kinase domain.PfCDPK4 Is Expressed in Sexual Stages of the Parasite Life Cycle—Even though previously published transcriptome in PlasmoDb and proteome (26Khan S.M. Franke-Fayard B. Mair G.R. Lasonder E. Janse C.J. Mann M. Waters A.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) analyses suggested gametocyte-specific expression of PfCDPK4, localization of CDPK4 in the parasite had remained unknown. PfCDPK4-specific antisera were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a unique motif in the J-domain, and Western blots were performed using protein lysates from different asexual stages as well as the gametocytes. A band corresponding to ∼60 kDa, which was consistent with the predicted molecular mass of PfCDPK4, was observed only in the gametocyte lysates (Fig. 2A). These data confirmed that PfCDPK4 is expressed mainly in the sexual stages. To further confirm this, immunofluorescence studies were performed, which revealed PfCDPK4 staining mainly on gametocyte periphery (Fig. 2B). Control assays performed with pre-immune sera did not show any staining (Fig. 2A, left panel). It is likely that the presence of a myristoylation signal in this kinase (Fig. 1B) is responsible for targeting this kinase to the parasite periphery.FIGURE 2Stage-specific expression and localization of PfCDPK4. A, Western blot was performed using PfCDPK4 antisera and protein lysates from different parasitic stages: R, ring; T, trophozoite; S, schizont; and G, gametocyte. A ∼60-kDa band corresponding to the predicted size of PfCDPK4 was observed mainly in the gametocyte stages. Antiserum prepared from preimmune bleeds was used as a control (left panel). B, immunofluorescence assays were performed on gametocyte smears using anti-PfCDPK4 antisera and Alexa-594-anti rabbit IgG. Parasite nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33224 (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calcium Stimulates Autophosphorylation and Catalytic Activity of Recombinant PfCDPK4—To characterize PfCDPK4, it was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. The recombinant PfCDPK4 was active only in the presence of calcium as adjudged by its ability to phosphorylate MBP (Fig. 3A). Recombinant PfCDPK4 also exhibited calcium-dependent autophosphorylation (Fig. 3A). A small peptide, syntide-2, which has been used as an in vitro substrate for several CDPKs (15Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12029-12037Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was effectively phosphorylated by PfCDPK4 in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Recombinant PfCDPK4 is autophosphorylated and activated by calcium. A, PfCDPK4 was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography. Protein kinase assays were performed using recombinant GST-PfCDPK4 in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA (absence of calcium) with MBP as phosphor-acceptor substrate. Subsequently, the kinase assay mix was electrophoresed on a SDS-PAGE gel, and phosphorimaging was performed. PfCDPK4 phosphorylates MBP only in the presence of calcium (lane 1). PfCDPK4 also exhibited calcium-dependent autophosphorylation. B, kinase assay was performed as described in panel A except syntide was used as a substrate instead of MBP. PfCDPK4 effectively phosphorylated syntide in the presence of calcium. The activity is measured in nanomoles/mg/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phospholipase C Acts as an Upstream Regulator of PfCDPK4 in the Parasite—It has been demonstrated that the release of calcium from intracellular stores in Plasmodium is controlled by PLC (4Garcia C.R. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 488-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Gazarini M.L. Thomas A.P. Pozzan T. Garcia C.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which is used by the parasite for various purposes. A strong correlation between increase in the levels of PLC hydrolysis product, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and gametogenesis has also been reported (30Martin S.K. Jett M. Schneider I. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is suggestive of a role for PLC in this important parasitic process. Given the dependence of recombinant PfCDPK4 on calcium and its role in gamete formation, it was worth exploring whether PLC regulates its activity in the parasite. Gametocytes were treated with PLC inhibitor, which have been used successfully in Plasmodium (8Vaid A. Thomas D.C. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5589-5597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Vaid A. Sharma P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the activity of immunoprecipitated PfCDPK4 was assayed. In one of the experiments, an intracellular chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester), was included (Fig. 4A). This inhibitor caused a significant decrease in PfCDPK4 activity, which emphasized the importance of intracellular calcium on PfCDPK4 activation. Treatment with the PLC inhibitor, U73122, caused a significant decrease in PfCDPK4 kinase activity. In contrast, U73343, the inactive analogue of this inhibitor, failed to alter the activity of this kinase. The levels of PfCDPK4 did not change significantly upon inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that PLC acts as a regulator of PfCDPK4, which is most likely a result of its ability to control levels of free calcium in the parasite.FIGURE 4Phospholipase C acts as an upstream regulator of PfCDPK4. A, gametocytes were treated with DMSO, 30 μm U73122 or U73343, 100 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM). Subsequently, PfCDPK4 was immunoprecipitated from protein lysates (see “Experimental Procedures”) and PfCDPK4-IP associated kinase activity was assayed using syntide as substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1964882696,"We report here a high-resolution NMR structure of the complete receptor-binding domain of human apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3-NT). Similar to the crystal structure of apoE-NT, the NMR structure displayed an elongated four-helix bundle. However, additional unique structural features were also observed. The segments in the N and C termini, which were missing in the crystal structure, formed alpha-helices having extensive tertiary contacts with the bundle, which oriented these short helices at specific positions for receptor binding activity. Several buried hydrophilic residues observed in the bundle were located strategically between helices 1 and 2 and between helices 3 and 4, significantly destabilizing these helix-helix interfaces. In addition, these buried hydrophilic residues formed buried H-bonds, which may play a key role in specific lipid-free helix bundle recovery. A short helix, nHelix C, was fully solvent-exposed and nearly perpendicular to the bundle. This short helix likely plays a critical role in initiating protein-lipid interaction, causing a preferred conformational adaptation of the bundle at the weaker helix-helix interfaces. This produces an open conformation with two lobes of helices, helices 1 and 4 and helices 2 and 3, which may be the competent conformation for receptor binding activity. Thus, the NMR structure suggests a unified scheme for the initiation and helix bundle opening of apoE-NT upon lipoprotein-binding and for receptor binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W2065115929,"The transcription factor Etsrp is required for vasculogenesis and primitive myelopoiesis in zebrafish. When ectopically expressed, etsrp is sufficient to induce the expression of many vascular and myeloid genes in zebrafish. The mammalian homolog of etsrp, ER71/Etv2, is also essential for vascular and hematopoietic development. To identify genes downstream of etsrp, gain-of-function experiments were performed for etsrp in zebrafish embryos followed by transcription profile analysis by microarray. Subsequent in vivo expression studies resulted in the identification of fourteen genes with blood and/or vascular expression, six of these being completely novel. Regulation of these genes by etsrp was confirmed by ectopic induction in etsrp overexpressing embryos and decreased expression in etsrp deficient embryos. Additional functional analysis of two newly discovered genes, hapln1b and sh3gl3, demonstrates their importance in embryonic vascular development. The results described here identify a group of genes downstream of etsrp likely to be critical for vascular and/or myeloid development."
https://openalex.org/W2030009629,"Background Primary bacterial endosymbionts of insects (p-endosymbionts) are thought to be undergoing the process of Muller's ratchet where they accrue slightly deleterious mutations due to genetic drift in small populations with negligible recombination rates. If this process were to go unchecked over time, theory predicts mutational meltdown and eventual extinction. Although genome degradation is common among p-endosymbionts, we do not observe widespread p-endosymbiont extinction, suggesting that Muller's ratchet may be slowed or even stopped over time. For example, selection may act to slow the effects of Muller's ratchet by removing slightly deleterious mutations before they go to fixation thereby causing a decrease in nucleotide substitutions rates in older p-endosymbiont lineages. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine whether selection is slowing the effects of Muller's ratchet, we determined the age of the Candidatus Riesia/sucking louse assemblage and analyzed the nucleotide substitution rates of several p-endosymbiont lineages that differ in the length of time that they have been associated with their insect hosts. We find that Riesia is the youngest p-endosymbiont known to date, and has been associated with its louse hosts for only 13–25 My. Further, it is the fastest evolving p-endosymbiont with substitution rates of 19–34% per 50 My. When comparing Riesia to other insect p-endosymbionts, we find that nucleotide substitution rates decrease dramatically as the age of endosymbiosis increases. Conclusions/Significance A decrease in nucleotide substitution rates over time suggests that selection may be limiting the effects of Muller's ratchet by removing individuals with the highest mutational loads and decreasing the rate at which new mutations become fixed. This countering effect of selection could slow the overall rate of endosymbiont extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2045642173,"Yeast mitochondrial (YMt) and phage T7 RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are two divergent representatives of a large family of single subunit RNAPs that are also found in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of higher eukaryotes, mammalian nuclei, and many other bacteriophage. YMt and phage T7 promoters differ greatly in sequence and length, and the YMt RNAP uses an accessory factor for initiation, whereas T7 RNAP does not. We obtain evidence here that, despite these apparent differences, both the YMt and T7 RNAPs utilize a similar promoter recognition loop to bind their respective promoters. Mutations in this element in YMt RNAP specifically disrupt mitochondrial promoter utilization, and experiments with site-specifically tethered chemical nucleases indicate that this element binds the mitochondrial promoter almost identically to how the promoter recognition loop from the phage RNAP binds its promoter. Sequence comparisons reveal that the other members of the single subunit RNAP family display loops of variable sequence and size at a position corresponding to the YMt and T7 RNAP promoter recognition loops. We speculate that these elements may be involved in promoter recognition in most or all of these enzymes and that this element's structure allows it to accommodate significant sequence and length variation to provide a mechanism for rapid evolution of new promoter specificities in this RNAP family.

S. cerevisiae YMt 2The abbreviations used are: YMt, yeast mitochondrial; Mt, mitochondrial; RNAP, RNA polymerase; IC, initiation complex; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotides; Fe-BABE, iron (S)-1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl) EDTA. 2The abbreviations used are: YMt, yeast mitochondrial; Mt, mitochondrial; RNAP, RNA polymerase; IC, initiation complex; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotides; Fe-BABE, iron (S)-1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl) EDTA. and phage T7 RNAPs are both members of the single subunit RNAP family, but their promoter sequences are very different. The T7 promoter is a 21-nucleotide (nt) duplex that includes 4 nt downstream of the transcription start site and 17 nt upstream of +1 (1Bailey J.N. Klement J.F. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2814-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The promoters of the closely related T3 phage or the more distantly related Sp6 phage(2Brown J.E. Klement J.F. McAllister W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3521-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are identical in size to the T7 promoter but differ in sequence. In contrast, the YMt promoter is only 8 nt in length and is therefore similar in size to chloroplast promoters or the mitochondrial promoters of plants and other fungi, which are typically 8–10 nt in length although highly disparate in sequence (3Jaehning J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Liere K. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The mechanisms of promoter recognition by the YMt and T7 RNAP also appear to be distinct. T7 RNAP, like many of the phage polymerases, binds, melts, and initiates transcription as single subunit enzyme without any accessory transcription factor (5Chamberlin M. Kingston R. Gilman M. Wiggs J. deVera A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 540-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, the YMt RNAP requires a specific accessory factor (Mtf1 (yeast mitochondrial transcription factor)) to initiate transcription from its promoter (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This seeming disparity may, however, obscure underlying mechanistic similarity. For example, it was originally suggested (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Mtf1 might be homologous and analogous to prokaryotic RNAP σ-factor, which would mean that Mtf1 contributes directly to promoter recognition, a mechanism distinct from that seen with T7 RNAP, where the polymerase contains all of the promoter recognition elements. However, subsequent work showed that YMt RNAP can initiate transcription without Mtf1 if the promoter is supercoiled or contains a heterduplex (“bubble”) around the transcription start site to facilitate melting (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This implies that the YMt RNAP itself contains the elements required for specific binding to the promoter sequence, whereas Mtf1 is needed only for promoter melting. These observations raise a number of questions. First, what structures in YMt RNAP are involved in recognizing the YMt promoter? Second, given the differences in YMt and T7 promoter sequence and length, is it possible that both of these RNAPs use similar or corresponding elements in their structures for promoter recognition? Finally, given the extreme divergence in promoter structure observed within the single subunit RNAP family, may all or many of these polymerases nevertheless utilize a similar promoter recognition mechanism? T7 RNAP recognizes its promoter using two distinct elements. The -3 to -11 region of its promoter is recognized primarily by the promoter specificity loop, an extended β-hairpin that emerges from the polymerase C-terminal domain, and the -12 to -17 region of the promoter is recognized by elements in the N-terminal domain of the polymerase (8Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Raskin C.A. Diaz G. Joho K. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and chloroplast RNAPs are unlikely to have a structural element that is homologous or functionally analogous to the T7 RNAP N-terminal domain, since the N-terminal domains of these enzymes are highly divergent (11Cermakian N. Ikeda T.M. Miramontes P. Lang B.F. Gray M.W. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the promoter sequences recognized directly by the mitochondrial and chloroplast RNAPs do not extend upstream of -9. However, it has been suggested that the YMt RNAP has a promoter recognition loop like that seen in T7 RNAP (12Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the recently described structure of N4 RNAP exhibits a promoter loop similar to that of T7 RNAP (13Murakami K.S. Davydova E.K. Rothman-Denes L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5046-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), although this RNAP uses a hairpin promoter (Fig. 1) that is very different in structure from the T7 promoter. To determine if a nonphage RNAP that is distantly related to T7 RNAP also contains an element that is structurally and functionally analogous to the T7 promoter recognition loop, we carried out cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the region of the YMt RNAP that is predicted to encompass this putative recognition loop. We found that such mutations disrupt promoter utilization without affecting promoter-independent transcriptional activity. By tethering chemical nucleases to these mutants, we were able to position this putative promoter recognition loop in the YMt initiation complex (IC) and to define the architecture of the complex. Assessment of the effects of the YMt RNAP mutations on transcription of a set of mutant promoters identifies a likely amino acid-base pair interaction and corroborates the loop placement suggested by the tethered nuclease studies. In all, our results indicate that the YMt RNAP IC architecture is similar to that of T7 RNAP and that both polymerases have nearly identically positioned loops that play similar roles in recognizing their respective promoters. Enzyme and Template Preparations—Single cysteine-substituted mutants of YMt RNAP were constructed with the Stratagene PCR site-directed mutagenesis kit following manufacturer's instructions. Expression and purification of mutant polymerases and Mtf1 transcription factor were carried out as described (14Matsunaga M. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored at -20 °C in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. Poly(dI-dC) was from Sigma. A duplex template containing a consensus 14S rRNA YMt promoter sequence was prepared by annealing a synthetic 63-base oligonucleotide (Operon Biotechnologies) with the (nontemplate strand) sequence AATTCATTTATTTATTATTATATAAGTAATAAAGAATAGTTTTATATACTAATAATAATATAG (where the -1 to -8 bases are in boldface type, and the +1 base is in boldface and underlined) to its reverse complement (template strand). To create a “bubble” promoter template in which the region around the transcription start site is premelted, the -4 to +2 sequence of the nontemplate strand was changed to GCAGCT to generate a heteroduplex in this region. Twelve different fully duplex promoter variants based on this template were generated by introduction of single base substitutions between -1 and -8, as specified under Results. For chemical nuclease experiments the 5′-end of the template (T)-strand was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol; ICN) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) as described (15Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Transcription Assays—In vitro transcription reactions were carried out at room temperature for 15 min in 10 μl in transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing a 0.5 mm concentration of each NTP (Trilink) and 0.1 μm duplex template or 0.01 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC). RNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of 0.3 μm YM tRNAP and 0.6 μm Mtf1. Transcripts were labeled by inclusion of 1% (v/v) 3000 Ci/mm 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]ATP from ICN (promoter template) or [α-32P]GTP (poly(dI-dC) template). Reaction samples were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% xylene cyanol). Transcription products were resolved by electrophoresis in 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (19% acrylamide, 1% bisacrylamide, 7 m urea) in TBE buffer and analyzed with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. DNA Cleavage with Iron (S)-1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl) EDTA (Fe-BABE)-conjugated RNAPs—Fe-BABE (Dojindo Laboratories) was conjugated to cysteine-substituted YMt RNAPs as described (16Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ICs halted at +0, +3, or +7 were formed at room temperature in transcription buffer containing labeled bubble or duplex 14S rRNA template at 0.01 μm and Fe-BABE-conjugated YMt RNAP at 0.03 μm. After a 10-min incubation with varying NTP mixes to form complexes halted at different positions, cleavage was initiated by the addition of sodium ascorbate and H2O2 as described (16Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cleavage reactions were quenched after 5 s by the addition of one reaction volume of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol). Cleavage products were analyzed by electrophoresis in denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels (14.2% acrylamide, 0.8% bisacrylamide, and 7 m urea) and visualized on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Cleavage positions were mapped by reference to a Maxam-Gilbert G + A ladder prepared as described (15Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All Single Subunit RNAPs Exhibit a Variable 26 ± 3-Amino Acid Element, Corresponding to the T7 Promoter Recognition Loop, Embedded between Two Well Conserved Blocks of Residues—Hundreds of single subunit RNAP sequences are currently deposited in the data banks. Fig. 2 shows an alignment that includes the T7 and S. cerevisiae Mt RNAPs and a representative sampling of other phage RNAPs; mitochondrial enzymes from plants, fungi, protozoa, and animals; and a chloroplast enzyme. This alignment is centered on the region corresponding to the T7 RNAP promoter recognition loop. The sequences flanking this element are well conserved in this family and include the G, H, and I blocks of conserved elements previously identified in a comprehensive analysis of sequence conservation patterns in the single subunit RNAP family (11Cermakian N. Ikeda T.M. Miramontes P. Lang B.F. Gray M.W. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, within the region corresponding to the T7 promoter recognition loop, conservation breaks down, although all of these RNAPs exhibit a 23–29-residue element of variable sequence between the conserved G/H and I blocks. The consensus secondary structure prediction, based solely on the aligned sequences of all identifiable members of the single subunit RNAPs in the data bases, is that this element forms a β-hairpin, as it is actually observed to do in T7 RNAP (Fig. 2). This pattern of conservation raises the possibility that this element is involved in promoter recognition in many of these enzymes, with the observed variations in its sequence and length providing a mechanism for recognition of distinct promoter sequences. Mutations in the Putative YMt RNAP Promoter Recognition Loop Disrupt Promoter-dependent but Not Promoter-independent Transcription—To test this hypothesis in the specific case of YMt RNAP, we carried out cysteine scanning of residues 1125–1136 and 1140 of the S. cerevisiae enzyme. These residues were selected because homology modeling of the YMt RNAP based on the structure of a T7 RNAP IC containing a 3-mer RNA (IC3) identified them as most likely to be involved in Mt promoter recognition. All of the mutant enzymes were well expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli and, when tested for promoter-independent transcription on poly(dI-dC), displayed activity similar to that of the WT enzyme (Fig. 3). However, when tested on the YMt 14S rRNA promoter, mutants K1127C, Q1129C, Q1135C, and T1136C were ∼10-fold less active than the WT enzyme, and mutants K1128C, T1132C, and L1134C were 2–5-fold less active. The identification of these residues as important for promoter recognition is in excellent agreement with the model of the YMt RNAP IC that we built based on the T7 IC3. Within the stretch of 13 residues that we mutated, this model places only 4 amino acids within hydrogen bonding distance (≤3.8 Å) of the -1 to -8 nucleotides of the promoter, corresponding to the segment of the yeast Mt promoter recognized by the S. cerevisiae Mt RNAP. These 4 residues are Lys-1127, Gln-1129, Gln-1135, and Thr-1136, exactly the residues identified by our mutational analysis as being most critical for Mt promoter utilization. A Double Mutant Cycle Indicates That YMt RNAP Gln-1129 and Thr-1136 Are Involved in Recognizing the -7 Base Pair of the Mt Promoter—To try to identify specific side chain-base pair interactions between the YMt RNAP and its promoter, we tested our library of loop mutants with a panel of 12 Mt promoters mutated at individual base pairs. In such a double mutant cycle, potentially interacting groups are identified as those whose combined mutations do not additively disrupt the interaction between the two molecules in an intermolecular complex (17Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The 12 mutant promoters tested were -1T→ A, -1T→ G, -2G→ A, -3A→ G, -3A→ C, -3A→ T, -4A→ G, -5T→ A, -6A→ G, -6A→ C, -7T→ G, and -7T→ C. These mutants were selected because a previous study of the YMt promoter found that these substitutions reduced transcription initiation by 5-fold or more (20Biswas T.K. Ticho B. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these bases are important for promoter recognition. Nevertheless, all of these mutant promoters displayed at least some (≥2%) residual activity, so that it was still possible to quantitatively compare the WT and mutant RNAP activities on these templates. With most of these promoters, the reductions in transcriptional activity were similar for the WT and mutant polymerases (data not shown). However, the substitutions at the -7-position of the promoter exhibited a distinct pattern: with the WT enzyme and most of the mutant RNAPs, these substitutions reduced initiation by ∼20-fold, but with the T1136C and Q1129C RNAPs, substitutions at -7 had little to no effect on transcriptional activity (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that the T1136C and Q1129C mutations disrupt interactions with the -7 base pair, so that substitutions at this promoter position have no further significant effect on the activity of these two mutants. Consistent with this possibility, we observe that in the structural model of the YMt RNAP IC, Gln-1129 and Thr-1136 are both within 4 Å of the -7 base pair (Fig. 4C). Moreover, in this model, Gln-1129 superimposes on T7 RNAP Arg-746, which recognizes the guanosine base of the -7 G:C base pair of the T7 promoter (8Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Chemical Nucleases Tethered to the Putative Promoter Recognition Loop Reveal Loop Position and IC Architecture—To further define the position of the putative recognition loop in the YMt IC, we tethered the sulfhydryl-reactive chemical nuclease Fe-BABE (21Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to either the E1125C or E1131C mutant RNAPs. These mutants were selected because neither mutation appeared to affect promoter utilization (Fig. 3) and because they are at opposite ends of the putative promoter recognition loop. Residue 1131 is at the distal end of this loop, at a point predicted by the model to be close to the upstream DNA. Specifically, a nuclease tethered to 1131 is predicted to cleave the T-strand around -8 in an IC with a 3-mer RNA. Residue 1125 is at the proximal end of the loop and is predicted to be close to the downstream DNA. A nuclease tethered to residue 1125 allows us to test the model's prediction that the DNA downstream of the transcription start site is sharply bent back toward the upstream DNA, as seen in the T7 IC (22Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4936-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Turingan R.S. Liu C. Hawkins M.E. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Nayak D. Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Durniak K.J. Bailey S. Steitz T.A. Science. 2008; 322: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such an architecture would predict that a nuclease at 1125 would cleave the T-strand around +6 in an IC3. Fig. 5 shows the results of T-strand cleavage by WT, E1125C, and E1131C polymerases derivatized with Fe-BABE. The WT enzyme exhibits T-strand cleavage around -2/-3 in a preinitiation complex (Fig. 5A, lane 3) or in an IC reaction allowing synthesis of a 3-mer RNA (lane 4). The addition of nucleotides allowing synthesis of a 7-mer causes the center of cleavage to shift downstream to +1(lane 5). The Fe-BABE-derivatized E1125C enzyme shows the same pattern, but in addition a new cleavage site appears centered at +6 in the IC3 (lane 7) and at +10 in the IC7 (lane 8). With the E1131C enzyme, a strong cleavage at -8 is seen in IC3 (lane 10; weaker cutting at the same site is seen in the pre-IC in lane 9), but in the IC7, cutting extends between -8 and -3, and two new sets of cleavages appear centered around +11/12 and +21/22 (lane 11). These cleavage patterns in the 3-mer IC are in perfect agreement with the predictions from the model based on the structure of a T7 IC3, since the nucleases at 1125 and 1131 are seen to cut at +6 and -8, respectively. The movement of the 1125 cleavage site from +6 to +10 upon RNA extension from 4 to 7 nt can be interpreted as reflecting simple translocation of the downstream DNA through the polymerase, but the other changes suggest more complex structural changes during initiation. Downstream cutting by the nuclease at 1125, for example, is not observed in the pre-IC (lane 7), suggesting that the downstream DNA may not bend toward the upstream DNA in the pre-IC. The changes seen, particularly with the 1131 nuclease, upon extension of the RNA from 3 to 7 nt, are likely to reflect structural changes required to accommodate the growth of the RNA during initiation and/or to allow promoter release and formation of the elongation complex. Understanding these changes will require more extensive experimentation, since they are likely to differ from the well characterized structural changes seen during T7 RNAP initiation (see “Discussion”). The experiments shown in Fig. 5A were done with a promoter containing a heteroduplex (bubble) between -4 and +2. Such “premelting” increases RNAP affinity for the promoter (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to enhance saturation and signal strength from the nucleases, especially in the pre-IC. To make sure that our results were not being affected by use of a promoter with this artificial structure, we also looked at cleavage patterns using a normal, fully duplex promoter. As seen in Fig. 5B, the cleavage patterns on this promoter in an IC3 were like those seen on the bubble promoter. We conclude that the cleavage patterns in the IC3 are not being altered by use of the bubble promoter and that the early IC architectures of the YMt RNAP and T7 RNAP are similar, with the putative recognition loop of the YMt RNAP being similarly positioned and fulfilling a similar function as the T7 RNAP recognition loop. Our observations reveal that the sequence in YMt RNAP that aligns with the T7 RNAP promoter recognition loop plays a role in recognizing the Mt promoter. Although the T7 and YMt RNAPs exhibit less than 30% overall identity (26Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), a homology model of the YMt RNAP built on the basis of the T7 RNAP early IC accurately places the YMt RNAP promoter recognition loop on the Mt promoter. In fact, this homology model is unexpectedly precise in its predictive power. First, the model places residues Lys-1127, Gln-1129, Gln-1135, and Thr-1136 closest to the promoter, and mutation of exactly these residues is found to have the strongest effects on promoter utilization. Second, the model places residues Gln-1129 and Thr-1136 near the -7 base pair and superimposes Gln-1129 on a T7 RNAP residue that recognizes the -7 base of the T7 promoter, and we find that mutation of Gln-1129 or Thr-1136 eliminates discrimination of the Mt promoter -7 base. Last, the model predicts cleavage at +6 and -8 in an IC3 by nucleases tethered, respectively, to residues 1125 and 1131, and this is exactly what is observed. The nuclease-cut sites also indicate that the early ICs of both the T7 and yeast enzyme have a similar architecture, with the DNA downstream of the transcription bubble similarly bent toward the upstream DNA. Phylogenetic analyses divide the single subunit RNAP family into three main branches: the phage genome encoded, the mitochondrial plasmid encoded, and the nuclear genome encoded, with the last including mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear enzymes (11Cermakian N. Ikeda T.M. Miramontes P. Lang B.F. Gray M.W. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Conservation of the promoter recognition loop function in the T7 phage RNAP and the YMt RNAP therefore encompasses two of these three major branches. Since all members of the single subunit RNAP family display a variable 26 ± 3-residue element with a predicted β-hairpin structure, which aligns with the T7 promoter recognition loop, we speculate that most, if not all, members of this family use this element to recognize the promoter sequence immediately upstream of the transcription start site. Evolution of new promoter specificities in these RNAPs could then occur rapidly (and may be reflected in the sequence variation of the loop itself), since the loop would extend out from the polymerase and make a limited number of contacts with the rest of the protein, so that variation in its sequence is relatively unconstrained by intramolecular interactions. A conserved promoter recognition mechanism and similar IC architecture for most single subunit RNAPs would appear inconsistent with the extent of the upstream DNA recognized by the transcription apparatus of different members of this RNAP superfamily. The YMt promoter, for example, extends only to -8, whereas the T7 promoter extends to -17, and the human Mt promoter requires sequences that extend to -28 (Fig. 1). Structural and footprinting studies, however, indicate that the core RNAP structure that is present in all the single subunit RNAPs covers and recognizes a similarly sized region around the transcription start site for all of these enzymes. For example, sequences upstream of -10 in the mammalian Mt promoter are recognized and bound by mitochondrial transcription factor A, an HMG-box protein required for initiation of mammalian mitochondrial transcription but not for initiation at YMt promoters. The mammalian Mt RNAP alone recognizes and protects the promoter from DNase I only to about -10 (27Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), similar to the recognition and protection provided by YMt RNAP on its promoter (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, although T7 RNAP protects its promoter up to -17 or -20 from DNase I or MPE-Fe2+ footprinting (28Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14956-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3306-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), its IC crystal structure reveals that recognition and protection of the region upstream of -11 involves the functionally and structurally nonconserved N-terminal domain, whereas the conserved polymerase domain and recognition loop contact promoter elements downstream of this point (8Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Other members of this RNAP family may fit this pattern, with recognition of promoter elements more than ∼10 bp upstream of the transcription start site carried out by accessory factors or domains that are distinct in different members of the family. Such a pattern suggests a point of necessary divergence in the mechanism of transcription initiation and promoter release by these polymerases. For T7 RNAP, a combination of DNA scrunching and conformational movements of the N-terminal domain accommodates increasing amounts of RNA and DNA in the IC during initial transcription and prior to promoter release (15Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Durniak K.J. Bailey S. Steitz T.A.

Roy R. Ha T. Patel S.S. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To release the promoter then requires movements of the N-terminal domain relative to the promoter recognition loop, which together form a contiguous promoter recognition surface. If the recognition loop and N-terminal domain are locked together via an engineered disulfide bond, T7 RNAP cannot disengage its promoter (15Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Given that the YMt RNAP N-terminal domain is structurally and functionally distinct from that of T7 RNAP, it is likely that the conformational mechanisms of initial transcription and promoter release differ significantly between these enzymes. One indication of this is that the cleavage patterns of an Fe-BABE tethered to YMt RNAP loop residue 1131 change significantly upon RNA extension from 3 to 7 nt (Fig. 5), whereas the cleavage patterns of nucleases tethered to the T7 RNAP recognition loop remain unaltered as the RNA is extended from 2 to 8 nt in length (16Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), consistent with the crystallographic observation that loop-T7 promoter contacts in an IC with a 7- or 8-base RNA are identical to those in a pre-IC (25Durniak K.J. Bailey S. Steitz T.A. Science. 2008; 322: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More extensive experimentation, however, will be required to determine the details of how the variations in the structures of the N-terminal regions of these polymerases alter the conformational mechanisms of initial transcription and promoter release.

https://openalex.org/W2051784874,"Alternative splicing (AS) is an intrinsic regulatory mechanism of all metazoans. Recent findings suggest that 100% of multiexonic human genes give rise to splice isoforms. AS can be specific to tissue type, environment or developmentally regulated. Splice variants have also been implicated in various diseases including cancer. Detection of these variants will enhance our understanding of the complexity of the human genome and provide disease-specific and prognostic biomarkers. We adopted a proteomics approach to identify exon skip events - the most common form of AS. We constructed a database harboring the peptide sequences derived from all hypothetical exon skip junctions in the human genome. Searching tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data against the database allows the detection of exon skip events, directly at the protein level. Here we describe the application of this approach to human platelets, including the mRNA-based verification of novel splice isoforms of ITGA2, NPEPPS and FH. This methodology is applicable to all new or existing MS/MS datasets."

IntroductionThe hypoxic response is mainly regulated by the hypoxia-inducibl efactor-1 (HIF-1), 2The abbreviations used are: HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; MSP, macrophage-stimulating protein; RON, recepteur d'origine nantais; HRE, hypoxia responsive element; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor composed of two subunits HIF-1α and HIF-1β (1Kimbro K.S. Simons J.W. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). HIF-1α forms heterodimers with HIF-1β, and this complex binds to hypoxia-responsive element (HRE: 5′-RCGTG-3′) within the promoter regions of target genes. Multiple studies of HIF-1α and breast cancer have shown a significant association between HIF-1α overexpression and poor prognosis coupled to increased patient mortality (2Bos R. Vander Groep P.

Cancer. 2006; 118: 2609-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The levels of HIF-1α in human primary breast tumors increased with the progression of the pathologic stage (7Bos R. Zhong H. Hanrahan C.F. Mommers E.C.M. Semenza G.L. Pinedo H.M. Abeloff M.D. Simons J.W. Van diest P.J. Van der Wall E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In a large retrospective study of 745 patients with high levels of HIF-1α at diagnosis, early relapse and metastatic disease were predicted (5Dales J.P. Garcia S. Meunier-Carpentier S. Andrae-Meyer L. Haddad O. Lavaut M.N. Allasia C. Bonnier P. Charpin C. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). HIF-1α expression is closely linked to an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer, and HIF-1α expression enhanced osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer (8Yamamoto Y. Ibusuki M. Okumura Y. Kawasoe T. Kai K. Iyama K. Iwase H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 110: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Hiraga T. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Hirota K. Hiraoka M. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4157-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). After prolonged treatment hormone-sensitive breast tumors frequently become resistant to hormonal therapy, and it was hypothesized that hypoxia may promote estrogen-independent growth. Deletion of HIF-1α in the mammary epithelium resulted in delayed tumor onset and retarded tumor growth as well as decreased pulmonary metastasis (10Liao D. Corele C. Seagroves T.N. Johnson R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HIF-1α is a negative prognostic factor in breast cancer progression. The HIF-1β subunit is constitutively expressed, whereas expression of HIF-1α is regulated by oxygen tension. HIF-1α protein is not detected in cells under normoxic conditions (20–22% O2) and is rapidly induced by hypoxic conditions (1–2% O2). However, in the invasive carcinoma cells, including breast, steady-state HIF-1α expression can be detected even under normoxia. The synthesis of HIF-1α protein has been shown to be regulated in an O2-independent fashion, for example, through activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (11Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38295-38311Google Scholar, 12Zhong H. Chiles K. Feldser D. Laughner E. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M-M. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1541-1545PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular targets of HIF-1α that contribute to breast tumorigenesis are under active investigation.Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is the only known ligand for recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), a tyrosine kinase receptor. MSP is an 80-kDa heterodimer consisting of a 53-kDa α-chain and a 30-kDa β-chain linked by a disulfide bond. The β-chain of MSP binds to RON (13Wang M.H. Lee W. Luo Y.L. Weis M.T. Yao H.P. J. Pathol. 2007; 213: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RON is initially synthesized as a single chain precursor, 170-kDa pro-RON, which is subsequently cleaved into 40-kDa alpha chain and 150-kDa beta chain. The alpha chain is completely extracellular, whereas the beta chain traverses the cell membrane and contains the intracellular tyrosine kinase (13Wang M.H. Lee W. Luo Y.L. Weis M.T. Yao H.P. J. Pathol. 2007; 213: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The RON receptor also participates in cross-talk with other receptor tyrosine kinases such as MET and epidermal growth factor receptor. Several human tumor tissues show increased RON expression, including tumors of the breast, colon, lung, liver, kidney, ovary, stomach, pancreas, bladder, and prostate (14Leonis M.A. Thobe M.N. Waltz S. Future Oncol. 2007; 3: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Gene expression analyses indicated increase in RON expression is associated with metastatic disease. Transgenic mice that overexpress a wild-type or constitutively active RON receptor in the mammary epithelium induced mammary transformation and associated with a high degree of metastasis with metastatic foci detected in the liver and lungs of >86% of all the transgenic animals (15Zinser G.M. Leonis M.A. Toney K. Pathrose P. Thobe M. Kader S.A. Peace B.F. Beauman S.R. Collins M.H. Waltz S.E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11967-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that RON overexpression can be a causative factor for metastatic breast cancer. RON overexpression in human breast cancer is associated with an aggressive cancer phenotype with decreased disease free survival time in patients and an increase in breast cancer metastasis (16Lee W-Y. Chen H.H. Chow N.H. Su W.C. Lin P.W. Guo H.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2222-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).We have recently shown that MSP promotes invasion of RON expression positive but not RON-negative breast cancer cells (17Thangasamy A. Rogge J. Ammanamanchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5335-5343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since the published clinical data suggested a correlation between HIF-1α, RON expression, and metastatic status of tumors, we have investigated whether HIF-1α/RON axis plays a role in breast cancer cell invasion. Screening of a panel of breast cancer cell lines indicated a correlation between steady-state HIF-1α and RON protein expression. A small molecule inhibitor, echinomycin, has been shown to specifically inhibit HIF-1α DNA-binding activity to the HRE site on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter resulting in the loss of VEGF expression (18Kong D. Park E.J. Stephen A.G. Calvani M. Cardellina J.H. Monks A. Fisher R.J. Shoemaker R.H. Melillo G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9047-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Treatment of HIF-1α/RON expression-positive MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells with echinomycin resulted in the inhibition of HIF-1α activity and RON protein expression. We have identified a novel HRE site on the RON promoter. ChIP analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the RON promoter confirmed the authenticity of the HIF-1α binding site on the RON gene. HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin- as well as shRNA-mediated selective knockdown of HIF-1α or HIF-1α target RON tyrosine kinase demonstrated the role of HIF-1α in the regulation of RON tyrosine kinase and the RON ligand MSP-associated invasion of breast cancer cells. These data presented herein identified RON tyrosine kinase as a novel target of HIF-1α and suggest a potential therapeutic role in the inhibition of HIF-1α/RON axis for the blockade of invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), amino acids, antibiotics, pyruvate, and vitamins (Invitrogen). All the cell lines were cultured in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Generation of HIF-1α and RON Knockdown Stable Cell Lines—Scramble shRNA and shRNA HIF-1α expression plasmid was provided by Dr. John Copland and Dr. Jenny Wang provided the scramble and shRNA RON expression plasmids. We have transfected control scramble shRNA or shRNA HIF-1α or shRNA RON expression plasmids into HIF-1α/RON-positive MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells and, following selection in the puromycin medium, obtained HIF-1α and RON expression knockdown clones for characterization.Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of cell lysates from breast cancer cells were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was performed as described previously (17Thangasamy A. Rogge J. Ammanamanchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5335-5343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human RON, actin polyclonal, and HIF-1α monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To analyze the effect of echinomycin cells were treated for 16 h with 0.5 and 1.0 μm echinomycin prior to Western analysis. To determine the effect of shRNA HIF-1α or shRNA RON knockdown on RON expression, MDA MB 231 cells stably expressing scrambled shRNA control or shRNA HIF-1α or shRNA RON were analyzed for RON expression by Western blots. To determine if PI3K/AKT pathways are involved in the RON receptor-mediated signaling, cells were starved for 16 h and stimulated with RON ligand, MSP either in the presence or absence of PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 and ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059. Western analysis using pAKT, total AKT, pERK, and total ERK was performed.Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 100 ng of total RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR reaction with SYBR Green real-time PCR mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The Primers for RON were: sense primers, 5′-AGC CCA CGC TCA GTG TCT AT-3′; antisense primers, 5′-GGG CAC TAG GAT CAT CTG TCA-3′. Primers for HIF-1α were: sense primers, 5′-CTCAAAGTCGGACAGCCTCA-3′; antisense primers, 5′-CCCTGCAGTAGGTTTCTGCT-3′. Primers for actin were: sense primers, 5′-ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG AGG-3′; antisense primers, 5′-AGG GGC CGG ACT CGT CAT ACT-3′. The β-actin mRNA was amplified simultaneously for an endogenous control.In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assay to analyze RON kinase activity was performed as described previously for RON protein (19Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Miagkov A. Skeel A. Nakaigawa N. Zbar B. Leonard E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5857-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, RON was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by RON polyclonal antibody. IgG antibody was used as a negative control for the immunoprecipitation. The exogenous substrate, myelin basic protein was added to the kinase reaction mixture at a concentration of 1.0 μg/reaction tube. Reactions were stopped with 5 μl of 4% sample buffer. Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was visualized after SDS-PAGE by autoradiography.RT-PCR—Total RNA from breast cancer cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR analysis was then performed to determine RON expression using the cDNA as template. Primers for actin were used as a control to determine the RON expression levels. RT-PCR analysis allows a rough estimate of the differences in RON expression in the cell lines tested. A total of 30 cycles of amplification was performed. For the studies involving echinomycin MDA MB 231, MDA MB 468 cells were treated for 16 h with 0.5 and 1.0 μm echinomycin before RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis. Primers for RON generate a 246-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, 5′-AGC CCA CGC TCA GTG TCT AT-3′; antisense primers, 5′-GGG CAC TAG GAT CAT CTG TCA-3′. Primers for actin generate a 621-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, 5′-ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG AGG-3′; antisense primers, 5′-AGG GGC CGG ACT CGT CAT ACT-3′.Invasion Assay—The invasive behavior of breast cancer cells was analyzed in a trans-well Boyden chamber (Costar, Bethesda, MD) using a polycarbonate filter (8-μm pores) and a 0.1% gelatin matrix in the upper chamber. Briefly, 3 × 104 cells/well were plated in Matrigel invasion upper chambers in 0.3 ml of serum-free medium. The lower chambers contained 0.7 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum medium. The cells were treated with 2.5 ng of MSP. After 24-h incubation at 37 °C the cells on the top surface of the chamber were gently removed with cotton swabs. The migrant cells on the undersurface of the membrane were fixed in 70% methanol and stained with crystal violet. Images of migrant cells were captured by a photomicroscope (Nikon Eclipse-TE 2000-U, Japan). The invasion values were determined by eluting crystal violet in 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance was taken using a Fluorostar Optima plate reader at 585 nm. Quantification data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate invasion assays. To assess the effect of echinomycin, an inhibitor of HIF-1α binding MDA MB 231, MDA MB 468 cells were treated with 0.5 and 1.0 μm echinomycin for 16 h, trypsinized, and plated for Matrigel invasion assay. To determine the effect of shRNA HIF-1α- or shRNA RON-mediated RON expression knockdown on MSP-mediated invasion, MDA MB 231 cells stably expressing scramble shRNA or shRNA HIF-1α or shRNA RON were used for the Matrigel invasion assay.ChIP—The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (17Thangasamy A. Rogge J. Ammanamanchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5335-5343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). RON promoter primers covering the HRE site were used to carry out PCR on DNA isolated from chromatin immunoprecipitation using control IgG or HIF-1α antibodies. The optimal reaction conditions for PCR were determined for each primer pair. Parameters included denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min and annealing at 64 °C for 1 min followed by elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed by 1.0% agarose/ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. The following primers were used for PCR to generate a 293-bp fragment covering the HIF-1α binding site on the RON promoter. Forward: 5′-CTC CAA GGG CCG GAA GAG TCG GAT GG-3′; reverse: 5′-TTA AGC AGC GGT CCC GAC AGC CCC AA-3′.Construction of –400-bp Wild-type/Mutant RON Promoter-luciferase Reporter Constructs—The 400-bp RON promoter-luciferase reporter was described previously (17Thangasamy A. Rogge J. Ammanamanchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5335-5343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The HRE site-specific mutation construct of the RON promoter was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) based on the 400-bp RON promoter-luciferase reporter construct as a template. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotide sequences used to generate HRE mutant construct were: wild-type primer, 5′-GCGTTGCTGTCGTGCGTCCGCAGG-3′; mutant primer, 5′-GCGTTGCTGTAAAGCGTCCGCAGG-3′.Luciferase Assay—Breast cancer cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 15 × 104 cells/well the day before transfection. The wild-type or HRE mutant RON-Luc constructs (1 μg) or control null vector without the RON promoter insert (pGL3) were transiently transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 h following transfection, and luciferase activity was measured following normalization to protein levels (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI). To determine the effect of echinomycin on wild-type RON promoter activity, cells transfected with –400-bp wild-type RON promoter were treated for 16 h with varying concentrations of echinomycin prior to luciferase assay.RESULTSExpression of HIF-1α, RON, MSP, and RON Kinase Activity in Breast Cancer Cells—We have recently shown that the RON ligand, MSP, promotes invasion of RON-positive but not RON-negative breast cancer cells (17Thangasamy A. Rogge J. Ammanamanchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5335-5343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine if HIF-1α-mediated RON expression is the contributing factor for the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells, we have determined HIF-1α and RON expression levels in these cell lines. We have carried out Western analysis on equal amounts of total cell lysates from breast cancer cells using rabbit anti-human RON, actin polyclonal, and HIF-1α monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1A). RON antibody recognizes 170-kDa pro-RON and intracellular 150-kDa β-chain of mature RON receptor. HIF-1α antibody recognizes 120-kDa protein species. RON expression correlated with HIF-1α protein expression levels in these cells. We have carried out real-time RT-PCR analysis to determine RON and HIF-1α mRNA expression. Total RNA from breast cancer cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. We have performed real-time RT-PCR analysis using RON, HIF-1α, and actin primers (Fig. 1B). Differential expression of RON and HIF-1α message was detected in the breast cancer cells. Actin mRNA was amplified simultaneously for an endogenous control and represented as RON/actin mRNA and HIF-1α/actin mRNA. To determine if the invasive breast cancer cells express RON ligand, MSP, we have carried out Western analysis on the total cell lysates. High MSP expression was detected in the invasive MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells in comparison to MCF-7 and ZR75, which are non-invasive in the presence of RON ligand, MSP (Fig. 1C). We next carried out an in vitro kinase assay to determine the RON kinase activity in the invasive breast cancer cells by immunoprecipitating the total cell lysates with control IgG or RON polyclonal antibody and performed kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate as previously described for RON protein (19Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Miagkov A. Skeel A. Nakaigawa N. Zbar B. Leonard E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5857-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Higher RON kinase activity was detected in the invasive MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells in comparison to MCF-7 and ZR75 cells. A nonspecific band is shown to represent loading control (Fig. 1D).Echinomycin Inhibits RON Expression and MSP-induced Invasion of Breast Cancer Cells—A small molecule inhibitor, echinomycin, has been shown to specifically inhibit HIF-1α DNA-binding activity to the HRE site on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter resulting in the loss of VEGF expression (18Kong D. Park E.J. Stephen A.G. Calvani M. Cardellina J.H. Monks A. Fisher R.J. Shoemaker R.H. Melillo G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9047-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To determine if echinomycin-mediated loss of HIF-1α-binding activity abrogates RON expression in the HIF-1α/RON expression-positive invasive breast cancer cells, we have treated MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells with echinomycin for 16 h and carried out Western analysis on the total cell lysates using RON and actin polyclonal antibodies. RON protein expression was decreased in both the cell lines tested (Fig. 2A). We have carried out RT-PCR analysis to determine if the echinomycin-mediated decrease in the RON protein levels reflected RON message levels. Total RNA from control and echinomycin-treated (16 h) breast cancer cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and PCR using RON and actin primers was performed. Echinomycin treatment reduced RON message levels in both the cell lines (Fig. 2B). To determine if echinomycin-mediated blockade in RON gene expression abrogates RON ligand, MSP-induced invasion of breast cancer cells, we carried out an in vitro Matrigel assay. Matrigel invasion assay is a reliable test to evaluate cancer cell invasiveness. This assay elegantly reflects the actual ability of cancer cells to invade and metastasize in vivo in response to activation of the RON receptor. MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells were treated for 16 h with echinomycin, trypsinized, and plated along with untreated control cells for the Matrigel assay either in the presence or absence of 2.5 ng MSP for 24 h. We have stained the migrant cells with crystal violet and photographed the cells (Fig. 2C). Quantification was done by eluting crystal violet in 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance was taken using a Fluostar Optima plate reader at 585 nm. MSP induced the invasion through Matrigel of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 control cells but not echinomycin-treated cells where RON expression was blocked.FIGURE 2A, effect of echinomycin on RON protein expression: equal amounts of total cell lysates from control or echinomycin-treated cells were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis using rabbit anti-human RON and actin polyclonal antibodies was performed. B, effect of echinomycin on RON message: total RNA from control or echinomycin-treated cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and PCR analysis was performed using primers for RON and actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, echinomycin blocks MSP-mediated invasion: control or echinomycin-treated breast cancer cells were plated in Matrigel invasion chamber (upper). The cells were treated with 2.5 ng MSP for 24 h. The migrant cells on the undersurface of the membrane were fixed in 70% methanol and stained with crystal violet. Images of migrant cells were captured by a photomicroscope (Nikon Eclipse-TE 2000-U, 10×). Quantification data represents the mean ± S.D. of three separate invasion assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HIF-1α Directly Regulates RON Gene Expression—To determine if the decreased RON expression levels in the echinomycin-treated cells was due to decreased RON transcription, we analyzed RON promoter activities using a –400-bp RON promoter deletion construct (Fig. 3C) in control and echinomycin-treated breast cancer cells. The –1.2-kb full-length and –400-bp RON promoter deletion constructs were described previously (17Thangasamy A. Rogge J. Ammanamanchi S. J. Biol.

We have identified two novel HIF-1α binding sites (HRE) at –285 bp and –1176 bp relative to the transcription start site. Our previous work indicated both –1.2-kb full-length and –400-bp RON promoter deletion constructs exhibited similar activities in the MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells suggesting all the regulatory elements are present in the –400-bp region of the RON promoter. Consequently, we have analyzed the activity of the –400-bp RON promoter in the control and echinomycin-treated breast cancer cells. A dose-dependent decrease in the RON promoter activity was observed in echinomycin-treated MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells (Fig. 3A). To demonstrate that HIF-1α binds to RON promoter in vivo we carried out ChIP analysis with control IgG or HIF-1α antibodies on the chromatin fragments from MCF-7, MDA MB 231, and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells (Fig. 3B). DNA from the immunoprecipitates was isolated and PCR using primers covering the HIF-1α binding site on the RON promoter was performed on the isolated DNA and non-immunoprecipitated starting chromatin material (input). RON was detected in the input chromatin fragments from all the three cell lines. However, accumulation of RON was detected in the HIF-1α immunoprecipitates from MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells but not MCF-7 where HIF-1α expression was not observed by Western analysis (Fig. 1A). RON was not detected in the control IgG immunoprecipitates demonstrating the specificity of HIF-1α binding to RON promoter. To confirm if HIF-1α binding to the HRE site on the RON promoter was contributing factor to the RON gene expression we have used site-directed mutagenesis to generate site-specific HRE mutant RON promoter construct. Wild-type and mutant primer sequences to generate the promoter reporter plasmids were described under “Experimental Procedures.” We have analyzed the activities of the –400-bp wild-type and HRE mutant RON promoter constructs in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells (Fig. 3D). HRE mutant RON promoter plasmid exhibited a 50–60% decrease in the activity in comparison to the wild-type promoter. This promoter construct contains 6 Sp1 binding sites in addition to the HIF-1α binding site (HRE). Our previous work indicated the overlapping Sp1 sites at –94 bp and Sp1 site at –113 bp relative to the transcription start site are required for the basal RON promoter activity, which were retained in the HRE mutant construct. We have further confirmed the contribution of HIF-1α binding to RON promoter activity by analyzing the wild-type RON promoter activity in the scramble shRNA control and shRNA HIF-1α-mediated HIF-1α expression knockdown MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells. The HIF-1α knockdown clones showed a significant reduction in the wild-type RON promoter activity, thus validating the role of HIF-1α in the regulation of RON gene expression. These experiments were repeated several times and the results are very consistent.FIGURE 3A, effect of echinomycin on RON promoter activity: cells were transfected with pGL3 control vector or –400-bp wild-type RON promoter. 24 h following transfection, cells were treated with varying concentrations of echinomycin for 16 h, and luciferase activity was measured following normalization to protein levels.

Mutations in the VHL gene also occur in a large majority of sporadic cases of clear-cell RCC, which have high intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Here we show that VHL-deficient RCC cells express lower levels of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BIMEL and are more resistant to etoposide and UV radiation-induced death compared to the same cells stably expressing the wild-type VHL protein (pVHL). Reintroducing pVHL into VHL-null cells increased the half-life of BIMEL protein without affecting its mRNA expression, and overexpressing pVHL inhibited BIMEL polyubiquitination. Suppressing pVHL expression with RNA interference resulted in a decrease in BIMEL protein and a corresponding decrease in the sensitivity of RCC cells to apoptotic stimuli. Directly inhibiting BIMEL expression in pVHL-expressing RCC cells caused a similar decrease in cell death. These results demonstrate that pVHL acts to promote BIMEL protein stability in RCC cells, and that destabilization of BIMEL in the absence of pVHL contributes to the increased resistance of VHL-null RCC cells to certain apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2051573208,"Background Glycerol nucleic acid (GNA) has an acyclic phosphoglycerol backbone repeat-unit, but forms stable duplexes based on Watson-Crick base-pairing. Because of its structural simplicity, GNA is of particular interest with respect to the possibility of evolving functional polymers by in vitro selection. Template-dependent GNA synthesis is essential to any GNA-based selection system. Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the ability of various DNA polymerases to use glycerol-nucleoside triphosphates (gNTPs) as substrates for GNA synthesis on DNA templates. Therminator DNA polymerase catalyzes quantitative primer-extension by the incorporation of two glyceronucleotides, with much less efficient extension up to five glyceronucleotides. Steady-state kinetic experiments suggested that GNA synthesis by Therminator was affected by both decreased catalytic rates and weakened substrate binding, especially for pyrimidines. In an attempt to improve pyrimidine incorporation by providing additional stacking interactions, we synthesized two new gNTP analogs with 5-propynyl substituted pyrimidine nucleobases. This led to more efficient incorporation of gC, but not gT. Conclusions We suggest that directed evolution of Therminator might lead to mutants with improved substrate binding and catalytic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2043150143,"Hydrocephalus with hop gait (hyh) is a recessive inheritable disease that arose spontaneously in a mouse strain. A missense mutation in the Napa gene that results in the substitution of a methionine for isoleucine at position 105 (M105I) of αSNAP has been detected in these animals. αSNAP is a ubiquitous protein that plays a key role in membrane fusion and exocytosis. In this study, we found that male hyh mice with a mild phenotype produced morphologically normal and motile sperm, but had a strongly reduced fertility. When stimulated with progesterone or A23187 (a calcium ionophore), sperm from these animals had a defective acrosome reaction. It has been reported that the M105I mutation affects the expression but not the function of the protein. Consistent with an hypomorphic phenotype, the testes and epididymides of hyh mice had low amounts of the mutated protein. In contrast, sperm had αSNAP levels indistinguishable from those found in wild type cells, suggesting that the mutated protein is not fully functional for acrosomal exocytosis. Corroborating this possibility, addition of recombinant wild type αSNAP rescued exocytosis in streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm, while the mutant protein was ineffective. Moreover, addition of recombinant αSNAP. M105I inhibited acrosomal exocytosis in permeabilized human and wild type mouse sperm. We conclude that the M105I mutation affects the expression and also the function of αSNAP, and that a fully functional αSNAP is necessary for acrosomal exocytosis, a key event in fertilization."

To investigate the contribution of the modifier of end organ damage (MOD) to strain differences, we also derived two congenic strains in which the reciprocal QTLs were introduced onto the consomic backgrounds. These newly developed lines were used to determine the genetic contributions of background strain and QTL to various parameters of blood pressure, renal function, and end organ damage. Using a wide range of techniques, including reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, enzyme assay, and microarray analysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme has been identified as a modifier of end organ damage.DISCUSSIONThe analysis of consomic and congenic lines clearly shows that the degree of hypertension and severity of pathophysiological changes in MH is modified by gene(s) within the chromosome 10 QTL. Given the ambiguity of transcript clusters and the lack of probe sets, it is not technically possible to assay all 64 genes across the QTL by the currently available microarrays. We therefore used literature mining and expression profiles to independently identify possible candidate genes. These independent processes converged on Ace as the modifier gene responsible. We cannot exclude the possibility that an additional gene or genes within the QTL may contribute to the effect. To unequivocally confirm Ace as the sole modifier, it would be necessary to convert Fischer Ace to Lewis Ace by gene targeting, but this is not readily achievable in the rat as yet.Ace is a powerful regulator of vascular function in multiple tissues, and evidence from widely different sources supports our results. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertension is clinically beneficial, yet the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and remodeling is independent of the antihypertensive effect (37.Pool J.L. Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2000; 111: (suppl.) 4-(suppl.) 8Google Scholar). Increased mouse Ace gene copy number does not affect blood pressure per se but exacerbates hypertension caused by additional environmental or genetic factors (38.Krege J.H. Kim H.S. Moyer J.S. Jennette J.C. Peng L. Hiller S.K. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In human population association studies, the genotype of ACE has been shown to predispose individuals to MH (39.Espinel E. Tovar J.L. Borrellas J. Piera L. Jardi R. Frias F.R. Armadans L. Bachs A.G. J. Clin. Hypertens. (Greenwich). 2005; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40.Stefansson B. Ricksten A. Rymo L. Aurell M. Herlitz H. Blood Press. 2000; 9: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Treatment of TGR(mRen27) rats with subhypotensive levels of the Ace inhibitor ramipril specifically reduced tissue Ace and prevented the development of end organ damage (41.Montgomery H.E. Kiernan L.A. Whitworth C.E. Fleming S. Unger T. Gohlke P. Mullins J.J. McEwan J.R. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) despite the increase in blood pressure associated with chronic expression of the transgene. This strongly implicated Ace or Ang II in the pathophysiological development of MH.Previous studies on Ren2.F demonstrate that RPF decreases following I3C induction and that plasma and intrarenal Ang II levels increase (despite reduced levels of endogenous renal renin). All of these effects are prevented by the administration of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (21.Mitchell K.D. Bagatell S.J. Miller C.S. Mouton C.R. Seth D.M. Mullins J.J. J. Renin. Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2006; 7: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade by spironolactone alleviates proteinuria following I3C induction but has little effect on systolic blood pressure, suggesting that the elevated arterial blood pressure (but not necessarily end organ damage) is independent of aldosterone stimulation (23.Ortiz R.M. Graciano M.L. Mullins J.J. Mitchell K.D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1584-F1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The basal (uninduced) differences in RPF and BP between consomic and congenic strains indicate that renal vascular resistance is higher on the Fischer than Lewis background. Intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone levels will contribute to this, but the basal strain difference results from the integration of multiple vasoactive systems (42.Evans R.G. Eppel G.A. Anderson W.P. Denton K.M. J. Hypertens. 2004; 22: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A major determinant of renal hemodynamic function was previously identified on chromosome 1 (43.Iwai N. Kinoshita M. Shimoike H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have now shown that Ace affects RPF following induction of hypertension.The increased Ace protein levels in Ren2.F compared with Ren2.L parallel increased renal mRNA levels in the prehypertensive state, the cause of which remains to be elucidated, but it could reflect differences in regulation of transcription (44.Challah M. Villard E. Philippe M. Ribadeau-Dumas A. Giraudeau B. Janiak P. Vilaine J.P. Soubrier F. Michel J.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or feedback regulation. Comparison of Lewis and F344 cDNA sequence reveals three base changes in the coding region, two of which are conservative. The third causes an amino acid substitution (L341F) in the N-terminal domain, which, by comparison to a three-dimensional model of the human N-terminal domain (with a competitive inhibitor molecule bound) (45.Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S4), lies at the hinge between two helices. Modeling suggests that amino acid substitution in this loop would have only a minor effect on overall three-dimensional structure (supplemental Fig. S4). Studies of mice with specific inactivation of either the N or C-terminal domain suggest that the C-terminal rather than the N-terminal domain plays a major role in normal blood pressure control (33.Fuchs S. Xiao H.D. Cole J.M. Adams J.W. Frenzel K. Michaud A. Zhao H. Keshelava G. Capecchi M.R. Corvol P. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

This may be the reason why measurement of in vivo ACE activities (with endogenous Ang I substrate) and Km analyses (using the synthetic tripeptide substrate) yielded comparable results between Lewis and Fischer samples.The N-terminal domain of human Ace has been shown to specifically cleave the naturally occurring peptide, Ac-SDKP, whereas specific inactivation of the mouse Ace N-terminal domain causes an accumulation of Ac-SDKP in plasma and urine (33.Fuchs S. Xiao H.D. Cole J.M. Adams J.W. Frenzel K. Michaud A. Zhao H. Keshelava G. Capecchi M.R. Corvol P. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15946-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The tetrapeptide has recently been shown to act directly on bone marrow stem cells and macrophages, inhibiting their differentiation, activation, and cytokine release (47.Sharma U. Rhaleb N.E. Pokharel S. Harding P. Rasoul S. Peng H. Carretero O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: H1226-H1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the levels of Ac-SDKP were found to be raised in the kidney (an end organ damage-susceptible tissue) in Lewis compared with Fischer animals but not in the relatively damage-resistant lung. The reciprocal nature of tissue Ace and Ac-SDKP levels in susceptible tissues of Fischer and Lewis strains may explain the moderation of end organ damage in the latter strain. Using the N-terminally specific tetrapeptide substrate, both Ace activity and catalytic properties have been reported to be identical in both Lewis and Fischer strains (48.Jafarian-Tehrani M. Listwak S. Barrientos R.M. Michaud A. Corvol P. Sternberg E.M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 319-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We hypothesize that reduced efficiency of Ac-SDKP cleavage caused by reduced levels of Ace per se may ameliorate end organ damage through the anti-inflammatory effects of increased levels of tissue-specific tetrapeptide. The identification of Ace as a modifier of ΔMABP, ΔRPF, and hypertensive end organ damage suggests that ACE levels should be a consideration in discerning susceptibility to essential hypertensive tissue damage and MH in humans.

However, the spontaneous and rapid (24–48 h) development of MH between 50 and 90 days of age and heterogeneity of the outbred Sprague-Dawley genetic background made the model unsuitable for molecular dissection. Using informative crosses with Fischer (F344) and Lewis (Lew) rat strains, the penetrance of and survival from MH was found to be genetically determined (14.Whitworth C.E. Fleming S. Cumming A.D.

To determine whether the strain specific response to highly elevated blood pressure is due to the timing or extent of vascular damage, a consomic rat strain was derived in which the inducible transgene was maintained on the Lewis background. To investigate the contribution of the modifier of end organ damage (MOD) to strain differences, we also derived two congenic strains in which the reciprocal QTLs were introduced onto the consomic backgrounds. These newly developed lines were used to determine the genetic contributions of background strain and QTL to various parameters of blood pressure, renal function, and end organ damage. Using a wide range of techniques, including reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, enzyme assay, and microarray analysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme has been identified as a modifier of end organ damage. DISCUSSIONThe analysis of consomic and congenic lines clearly shows that the degree of hypertension and severity of pathophysiological changes in MH is modified by gene(s) within the chromosome 10 QTL. Given the ambiguity of transcript clusters and the lack of probe sets, it is not technically possible to assay all 64 genes across the QTL by the currently available microarrays. We therefore used literature mining and expression profiles to independently identify possible candidate genes. These independent processes converged on Ace as the modifier gene responsible. We cannot exclude the possibility that an additional gene or genes within the QTL may contribute to the effect. To unequivocally confirm Ace as the sole modifier, it would be necessary to convert Fischer Ace to Lewis Ace by gene targeting, but this is not readily achievable in the rat as yet.Ace is a powerful regulator of vascular function in multiple tissues, and evidence from widely different sources supports our results. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertension is clinically beneficial, yet the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and remodeling is independent of the antihypertensive effect (37.Pool J.L. Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2000; 111: (suppl.) 4-(suppl.) 8Google Scholar). Increased mouse Ace gene copy number does not affect blood pressure per se but exacerbates hypertension caused by additional environmental or genetic factors (38.Krege J.H. Kim H.S. Moyer J.S. Jennette J.C. Peng L. Hiller S.K. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In human population association studies, the genotype of ACE has been shown to predispose individuals to MH (39.Espinel E. Tovar J.L. Borrellas J. Piera L. Jardi R. Frias F.R. Armadans L. Bachs A.G.

Blood Press. 2000; 9: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Treatment of TGR(mRen27) rats with subhypotensive levels of the Ace inhibitor ramipril specifically reduced tissue Ace and prevented the development of end organ damage (41.Montgomery H.E.

Hypertens. 1998; 16: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) despite the increase in blood pressure associated with chronic expression of the transgene. This strongly implicated Ace or Ang II in the pathophysiological development of MH.Previous studies on Ren2.F demonstrate that RPF decreases following I3C induction and that plasma and intrarenal Ang II levels increase (despite reduced levels of endogenous renal renin). All of these effects are prevented by the administration of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (21.Mitchell K.D. Bagatell S.J. Miller C.S. Mouton C.R. Seth D.M. Mullins J.J. J. Renin. Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2006; 7: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade by spironolactone alleviates proteinuria following I3C induction but has little effect on systolic blood pressure, suggesting that the elevated arterial blood pressure (but not necessarily end organ damage) is independent of aldosterone stimulation (23.Ortiz R.M. Graciano M.L. Mullins J.J. Mitchell K.D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1584-F1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The basal (uninduced) differences in RPF and BP between consomic and congenic strains indicate that renal vascular resistance is higher on the Fischer than Lewis background. Intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone levels will contribute to this, but the basal strain difference results from the integration of multiple vasoactive systems (42.Evans R.G. Eppel G.A. Anderson W.P. Denton K.M. J. Hypertens. 2004; 22: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).

Circulation. 1999; 100: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have now shown that Ace affects RPF following induction of hypertension.The increased Ace protein levels in Ren2.F compared with Ren2.L parallel increased renal mRNA levels in the prehypertensive state, the cause of which remains to be elucidated, but it could reflect differences in regulation of transcription (44.Challah M. Villard E. Philippe M. Ribadeau-Dumas A. Giraudeau B. Janiak P. Vilaine J.P. Soubrier F. Michel J.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Comparison of Lewis and F344 cDNA sequence reveals three base changes in the coding region, two of which are conservative. The third causes an amino acid substitution (L341F) in the N-terminal domain, which, by comparison to a three-dimensional model of the human N-terminal domain (with a competitive inhibitor molecule bound) (45.Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S4), lies at the hinge between two helices. Modeling suggests that amino acid substitution in this loop would have only a minor effect on overall three-dimensional structure (supplemental Fig. S4). Studies of mice with specific inactivation of either the N or C-terminal domain suggest that the C-terminal rather than the N-terminal domain plays a major role in normal blood pressure control (33.Fuchs S. Xiao H.D. Cole J.M. Adams J.W. Frenzel K. Michaud A. Zhao H. Keshelava G. Capecchi M.R. Corvol P. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

This may be the reason why measurement of in vivo ACE activities (with endogenous Ang I substrate) and Km analyses (using the synthetic tripeptide substrate) yielded comparable results between Lewis and Fischer samples.The N-terminal domain of human Ace has been shown to specifically cleave the naturally occurring peptide, Ac-SDKP, whereas specific inactivation of the mouse Ace N-terminal domain causes an accumulation of Ac-SDKP in plasma and urine (33.Fuchs S.

The tetrapeptide has recently been shown to act directly on bone marrow stem cells and macrophages, inhibiting their differentiation, activation, and cytokine release (47.Sharma U. Rhaleb N.E. Pokharel S. Harding P. Rasoul S. Peng H. Carretero O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: H1226-H1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the levels of Ac-SDKP were found to be raised in the kidney (an end organ damage-susceptible tissue) in Lewis compared with Fischer animals but not in the relatively damage-resistant lung. The reciprocal nature of tissue Ace and Ac-SDKP levels in susceptible tissues of Fischer and Lewis strains may explain the moderation of end organ damage in the latter strain. Using the N-terminally specific tetrapeptide substrate, both Ace activity and catalytic properties have been reported to be identical in both Lewis and Fischer strains (48.Jafarian-Tehrani M. Listwak S. Barrientos R.M. Michaud A. Corvol P. Sternberg E.M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 319-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We hypothesize that reduced efficiency of Ac-SDKP cleavage caused by reduced levels of Ace per se may ameliorate end organ damage through the anti-inflammatory effects of increased levels of tissue-specific tetrapeptide. The identification of Ace as a modifier of ΔMABP, ΔRPF, and hypertensive end organ damage suggests that ACE levels should be a consideration in discerning susceptibility to essential hypertensive tissue damage and MH in humans.

https://openalex.org/W1999475310,"Integrative analysis between dynamical modeling of metabolic networks and data obtained from high throughput technology represents a worthy effort toward a holistic understanding of the link among phenotype and dynamical response. Even though the theoretical foundation for modeling metabolic network has been extensively treated elsewhere, the lack of kinetic information has limited the analysis in most of the cases. To overcome this constraint, we present and illustrate a new statistical approach that has two purposes: integrate high throughput data and survey the general dynamical mechanisms emerging for a slightly perturbed metabolic network.This paper presents a statistic framework capable to study how and how fast the metabolites participating in a perturbed metabolic network reach a steady-state. Instead of requiring accurate kinetic information, this approach uses high throughput metabolome technology to define a feasible kinetic library, which constitutes the base for identifying, statistical and dynamical properties during the relaxation. For the sake of illustration we have applied this approach to the human Red blood cell metabolism (hRBC) and its capacity to predict temporal phenomena was evaluated. Remarkable, the main dynamical properties obtained from a detailed kinetic model in hRBC were recovered by our statistical approach. Furthermore, robust properties in time scale and metabolite organization were identify and one concluded that they are a consequence of the combined performance of redundancies and variability in metabolite participation.In this work we present an approach that integrates high throughput metabolome data to define the dynamic behavior of a slightly perturbed metabolic network where kinetic information is lacking. Having information of metabolite concentrations at steady-state, this method has significant relevance due its potential scope to analyze others genome scale metabolic reconstructions. Thus, I expect this approach will significantly contribute to explore the relationship between dynamic and physiology in other metabolic reconstructions, particularly those whose kinetic information is practically nulls. For instances, I envisage that this approach can be useful in genomic medicine or pharmacogenomics, where the estimation of time scales and the identification of metabolite organization may be crucial to characterize and identify (dis)functional stages."
https://openalex.org/W2061432271,"In animal cells, Akt (also called protein kinase B) is activated by stimuli that elevate the level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and is a major effector for eliciting responses that support cell growth and survival. We have shown previously that co-expression of Akt1 in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) along with hyperactive p110α, the catalytic subunit of mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, results in Akt1 relocalization to cellular membranes and activation. In the present study, we show that activation of all three mammalian Akt isoforms by wild-type p110α causes deleterious effects on yeast cell growth. Toxicity of Akt in S. cerevisiae required its catalytic activity, its pleckstrin homology domain, and phosphorylation of its activation loop, but not phosphorylation of its hydrophobic motif. We demonstrate that expression in yeast of the only purported oncogenic allele, Akt1(E17K), leads to enhanced phenotypes. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the VL1 region within the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-interacting pocket of the Akt1 pleckstrin homology domain revealed that most residues in this region are essential for Akt1 activity. We found that active Akt leads to enhanced signaling through the yeast cell wall integrity pathway. This effect requires the upstream Rho1 activator Rom2 and involves both phosphorylation of the MAPK Slt2 and expression of its transcriptional targets, thus providing a quantitative reporter system for heterologous Akt activity in vivo. Collectively, our results disclose a heterologous yeast system that allows the functional assessment in vivo of both loss-of-function and tumorigenic Akt alleles.

The Akt subfamily comprises three mammalian isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (PKBα, PKBβ, and PKBγ, respectively), whereas invertebrates, like flies and worms, have a single PKB/Akt protein. The relative expression of the three mammalian isoforms of Akt differs in different tissues: Akt1 is the predominant isoform in the majority of tissues, Akt2 is mainly present in insulin-responsive tissues, and Akt3 prevails in brain and testes. The three mammalian Akt members are products of different genes and share a common structure that consists of three conserved domains: an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a kinase catalytic domain at the center, and a C-terminal regulatory domain containing the hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation site (FXXF(S/T)Y) (3Hanada M.

In the lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an AGC protein kinase, Sch9, has been proposed as a functional ortholog of mammalian Akt, and is involved in nutrient sensing, ribosome biogenesis, lifespan, adaptation to osmotic stress, and cell-size control (5Fabrizio P.

In higher cells, Akt members transduce signals downstream the class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which are also proto-oncogenic proteins. Class I PI3K are heterodimeric enzymes containing a catalytic subunit (p110α, -β, -δ, or -γ) and a regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, p55γ, or p101). Activation of p110 catalytic subunits takes place by growth factor- and hormone-binding to tyrosine kinase- and G protein-coupled receptors, and involves the recruitment of the PI3K regulatory subunits to Tyr-phosphorylated receptors and scaffolding signaling proteins, as well as binding to Ras. The activated PI3K converts membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). The structure of the PH domain of Akt conforms a pocket that accommodates the polar head group of PIP3 (11Thomas C.C. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This interaction results in the translocation of the Akt kinase from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, where it undergoes activation. Mutational analyses have suggested that membrane localization is a primary requirement for Akt oncogenicity and mediation of PI3K-dependent signaling (12Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 13Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Akt activity is negatively regulated by phosphatidylinositol phosphatases that dephosphorylate PIP3. The major PI3K down-regulator is the PTEN phosphatase, which is considered a tumor suppressor because loss-of-function mutations are found in overt tumors (14Sansal I. Sellers W.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 2954-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) as well as in the germ line in hereditary diseases that predispose to cancer (15Eng C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). PTEN dephosphorylates the 3′-phosphate of PIP3 and thereby negates the activity of PI3K (16Sulis M.L. Parsons R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 478-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). PIP3 is also metabolized to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate by 5-phosphoinositide phosphatases, like SHIP1 and SHIP2 (SH2-containing inositol phosphatase-1 and -2); but PIP3 and phosphatidyl inositol 3,4 bisphosphate mostly engage the same effectors. Once recruited to the plasma membrane, Akt is phosphorylated at two critical residues for its full activation. These residues include a Thr residue in the activation loop within the kinase catalytic domain (Thr-308, Thr-309, and Thr-305 for Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, respectively) and a Ser residue on the hydrophobic motif (HM; Ser-473, Ser-474, and Ser-472 for Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, respectively). The activation loop kinase for Akt is the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). The HM kinase, also termed PDK2, has been identified recently as mTORC2 (17Sarbassov d.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). The full activation of Akt permits a conformational change that results in substrate binding and a significant increase of the rate of catalysis. The relevance of this pathway in clinical oncology has been evidenced by the frequency of mutations in its major down-regulator, the tumor suppressor PTEN (18Altomare D.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7455-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) and, more recently, by the isolation of oncogenic mutations in both PI3K and Akt1 themselves (19Samuels Y. Ericson K. Curr.

In previous reports, we described that heterologous expression of PI3K, PTEN, and Akt1 in S. cerevisiae reproduces several aspects of their function, including PIP3-dependent membrane translocation and phosphorylation of Akt1 at both activation residues by the yeast PDK1 orthologs and an unidentified endogenous kinase (22Rodriguez-Escudero I. Roelants F.M. Thorner J. Nombela C. Molina M. Cid V.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have also reported previously that this heterologous model system could be readily exploited to evaluate oncogenicity of both PI3K and PTEN mutants (23Andres-Pons A. Rodriguez-Escudero I. Gil A. Blanco A. Vega A. Molina M. Pulido R. Cid V.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9731-9739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we show that catalytically active mammalian Akt inhibits yeast cell growth, thus extending the system to perform structure-function relationship studies on Akt in vivo. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in the present study were YPH499 (MATa ade 2–101 trp1–63 leu2–1 ura3–52 his3–200 lys2–801, P. Hieter), BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1; leu2Δ; met15Δ; ura3Δ, EUROSCARF, Germany), slt2Δ (BY4741 isogenic, slt2::KanMX4) bck1Δ (BY4741 isogenic, bck1::KanMX4), and rom2Δ (BY4741 isogenic, rom2::KanMX4). Escherichia coli DH5α F′[K12α (lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR supE44 thi-1 recA1 endA1 hsdR17 gyrA96 relA1 (α 80lacZ α M15)F′] was used for routine molecular biology techniques. YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 2% (w/v) dextrose/glucose) broth or agar was the general non-selective medium used for yeast cell growth. Synthetic minimal medium (SD) contained 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose and lacked appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases to maintain selection for plasmids. In SG (synthetic galactose) and SR (synthetic raffinose) media, glucose was replaced with 2% (w/v) galactose or 2% (w/v) raffinose, respectively. Galactose induction in liquid medium was performed by growing cells in SR to mid-exponential phase and then adding galactose to 2% for 4–6 h. Growth assays on plates were performed, typically, by growing transformants overnight in SD lacking leucine and uracil, or leucine and tryptophan, adjusting the culture to an absorbance A600 0.5, and spotting samples (5 μl) of the cell suspension and three serial 10-fold dilutions on to the surface of SD or SG plates lacking the appropriate nutrients to maintain selection for plasmids, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 2–3 days. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to SG plates lacking the appropriate nutrients at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Plasmid Construction—Transformation of E. coli and yeast and other basic molecular biology methods were carried out using standard procedures. Plasmids pYES2-PTEN, pYES2-GFP-Akt1, pYES-GFP-AktK179M, pYES2-myr-Akt1, YCpLG-myc-p110α-CAAX, YCpLG-myc-p110α-wt, YCpLG-myc-p110α-E545K, YCpLG-myc-p110α-H1047R, and pYES3-GFP-Akt1 have been described (22Rodriguez-Escudero I.

Molina M. Pulido R. Cid V.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9731-9739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). pYES2-SHIP1 was constructed by subcloning human SHIP1 into pYES2 by PCR from pOTB7 SHIP1 (Mammalian Gene Collection, IMAGE ID 6304992, Geneservice, UK). To produce pYES2-GFP-Akt2, rat Akt2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the pEGFP-Akt2 plasmid (24He L. Simmen F.A. Mehendale H.M. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with primers bearing the appropriated restriction sites at their 5′ tails and cloned in-frame into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pYES2-GFP. The latter plasmid had been constructed by amplifying the GFP sequence by PCR and cloning it into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pYES2. For pYES2-GFP-Akt3, the mouse Akt3 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from pSPORT1 Akt3 (Mammalian Gene Collection, IMAGE ID 30089997, Geneservice, UK) as above and cloned EcoRI-XbaI into pYES2-GFP. The primers used for amplification had EcoRI- or XbaI-containing tails in the upper and in the lower oligonucleotides, respectively, to allow directed cloning into the same sites of the pYES2-GFP. YCpLG-myc-p110γ and YCpLG-myc-p110δ were made by PCR from the plasmids pCMVSPORT6 p110γ (human sequence, Mammalian Gene Collection, IMAGE ID 5749986) and pCMVSPORT6 p110δ (mouse sequence, Mammalian Gene Collection, IMAGE ID 4192906), respectively. To produce plasmids pYES3-GFP-Akt1R25A, pYES3-GFP-Akt1E40K, pYES3-GFP-Akt1T308A, and pYES3-GFP-Akt1S473A site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using standard full plasmid amplification by DpnI-based PCR strategy with Turbo PfuI DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using pYES3-GFP-Akt1 as template. To obtain the plasmid pYES3-GFP-Akt1T308A,S473A we performed the same strategy using the pYES3-GFP-Akt1S473A plasmid as template. To obtain the plasmids pYES2-GFP-Akt1E17K, pYES2-GFP-Akt1T308D, pYES2-GFP-Akt1S473D, pYES2-GFP-Akt1F469A,F472A, pYES2-GFP-Akt1Y474A, pYES2-GFP-Akt11–467, and pYES2-GFP-Akt11–454 the same strategy was performed, but using pYES2-GFP-Akt1 as template. To obtain the plasmid pYES2-GFP-Akt1T308D,S473D we performed the same strategy using the pYES2-GFP-Akt1S473D plasmid as template. The Ala scanning collection of mutants (R15A, G16A, E17A, Y18A, I19A, K20A, T21A, W22A, R23A, and P24A), as well as the G16R and P24R mutations, were also obtained by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis on pYES2-GFP-Akt1. The pYES2-GFP-Sch9 plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification from the Sch9 open reading frame from S. cerevisiae BY4741 genomic DNA. The primers used for amplification had BamHI- or EcoRI-containing tails in the upper and in the lower oligonucleotides, respectively, to allow directed cloning. PCR products were cleaved with BamHI-EcoRI to be inserted in the same sites of the pYES2-GFP vector. To generate the chimeras pYES2-Sch9-Akt1 and pYES2-Akt1-Sch9, standard sequential PCR-based method (25Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was performed. The primers used for amplification of the different Sch9 or Akt1 regions had BamHI- or EcoRI-containing tails in the upper and lower oligonucleotides, respectively, to allow directed cloning. PCR products were cleaved with BamHI/EcoRI to be inserted in the same sites of the pYES2-GFP plasmid. The pMLP1-LACZ (URA3) plasmid (26Rodriguez-Pena J.M. Diez-Muniz S. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biotechnol. 2008; 133: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and its HIS3-based version were a gift of A. B. Sanz, R. García, and J. Arroyo. Oligonucleotide sequences used in this work are available upon request. In all cases, fidelity of the amplified DNA was verified by DNA sequencing. Immunodetection by Western Blotting—The standard procedures were used for yeast cell growth, collection, and breakage, collection of proteins, fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Rabbit anti-phospho-Akt1 (P-Thr-308) and rabbit anti-phospho-Akt1 (P-Ser-473) (Cell Signaling Technology) were used to detect the phosphorylation of the corresponding sites in PKB/Akt or the chimerical protein Sch9-Akt1. GFP fusion proteins were detected using a mouse anti-GFP antibody (JL-8, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Yeast actin was detected by cross-reaction with a mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Clone C4, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). After washing, bound primary antibodies were revealed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies, as appropriate, and a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Microscopy Techniques—For fluorescence microscopy on live cells (for the observation of GFP), cells from exponentially growing cultures were harvested by brief centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and viewed directly. To monitor PI3K-dependent membrane localization of GFP-Akt, a time course was made to monitor membrane binding after induction of both p110 and GFP-Akt in galactose. Localization to membranes was significant at t = 4 h (>60%), and reached the maximum at t = 8 h (>90%). To allow detection of both positive and negative changes in GFP-Akt affinity for membranes, all data presented here were analyzed at 4 h after galactose induction. For statistics on cell populations, an average of >200 cells were counted for each experiment. Cells were examined with an Eclipse TE2000U microscope (Nikon) using the appropriate sets of filters. Digital images were acquired with Orca C4742-95-12ER charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu) and Aquacosmos Imaging Systems software. β-Galactosidase Assays—Yeast cell extracts were prepared by harvesting cells by centrifugation from 10 ml of an exponentially growing culture after induction with galactose for 6 h. Then, cells were resuspended in 250 μl of breaking buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), and glass beads (Glasperlen, ∼1 mm, Sartorius AG, Germany) were added to break cells in a Fast-Prep machine. Finally, extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the crude extracts obtained as described previously (27Bermejo C. Rodriguez E. Garcia R. Rodriguez-Pena J.M. Rodriguez de la Concepcion M.L. Rivas C. Arias P. Nombela C. Posas F. Arroyo J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), scaling the protocol to a 96-well microtiter plate format. 10 μl of cell extract was mixed with 90 μl of Z buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol (0.03%) and 20 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer). The absorbance of the enzymatic reaction was measured at 415 nm on a microplate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad) after at least 10 min of incubation at 30 °C and after the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 to stop the reaction. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside converted/min/mg of protein. Experiments were performed at least three times from independent yeast transformants. In Vivo Activated Mammalian Akt1 Impairs Yeast Growth—In previous reports, we have shown that expression of membrane-targeted mammalian class I PI3K catalytic subunit (p110α-CAAX) driven by the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter inhibited yeast growth, mainly by depletion of essential phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) pools (22Rodriguez-Escudero I. Roelants F.M. Thorner J. Nombela C. Molina M. Cid V.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, WT p110α in the same expression system had no negative effects on growth (23Andres-Pons A. Rodriguez-Escudero I. Gil A. Blanco A. Vega A. Molina M. Pulido R. Cid V.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9731-9739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, co-expression of WT p110α with GFP-Akt1 led to poor growth, an effect that was more intense with the oncogenic p110α H1047R mutant protein, described to have an enhanced kinase activity (19Samuels Y. Ericson K. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2006; 18: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 28Liu Z. Roberts T.M. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the oncogenic mutation E545K, which owes its effect to abnormal interaction with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 rather than to enhanced lipid kinase activity (29Carson J.D. Van Aller G. Lehr R. Sinnamon R.H. Kirkpatrick R.B. Auger K.R. Dhanak D. Copeland R.A. Gontarek R.R. Tummino P.J. Luo L. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Miled N. Yan Y. Hon W.C. Perisic O. Zvelebil M. Inbar Y. Schneidman-Duhovny D. Wolfson H.J. Backer J.M. Williams R.L. Science. 2007; 317: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), behaved like WT p110α regarding growth impairment in GFP-Akt1-expressing yeast cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, dose-dependent PIP3-driven Akt activation can be reproduced in yeast, and, furthermore, it could be monitored by analyzing its toxic effect. If it is true that Akt1 toxicity depends on intracellular PIP3 levels, it should be relieved by co-expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which operates as a PIP3 3-phosphatase. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1B, co-expression of PTEN in cells expressing p110α and Akt1 rescued growth, while co-expression of SHIP1, a PIP3 5-phosphatase that generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate instead of PIP2, was unable to revert the p110α-induced Akt1 toxicity. This result is in agreement with in vitro and structural data (11Thomas C.C. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 31Frech M. Andjelkovic M. Ingley E. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) that support the idea that Akt1 is able to respond similarly to both PIP3 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. Toxicity of Akt1 in Yeast Requires Its Kinase Activity and PIP3-dependent Membrane Recruitment—We used a K179M kinase-dead version of Akt1 to understand whether toxicity in yeast was due to its protein kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, co-expression of p110α and Akt1K179M had no effect on yeast growth, bringing forward the conclusion that impairment of growth is a consequence of the phosphorylation of endogenous yeast protein targets by Akt1. Also, we expressed a myristoylatable version of Akt1, which is directed to membranes independently of PI3K-generated PIP3 (22Rodriguez-Escudero I. Roelants F.M. Thorner J. Nombela C. Molina M. Cid V.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Peculiarly, myr-GFP-Akt1, extensively used as a constitutively active kinase in mammalian cells, was neither toxic in the absence nor in the presence of p110α (Fig. 2A), indicating that it cannot be used as a constitutively active Akt version in our model. This is consistent with our previous observation that myr-GFP-Akt1 is less efficiently phosphorylated than GFP-Akt1 in the yeast cell (22Rodriguez-Escudero I. Roelants F.M. Thorner J. Nombela C. Molina M. Cid V.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and suggests that myr-GFP-Akt may be less available as a substrate for its activating endogenous kinases. Thus, the concentration of activated Akt1 at the particular spots where PIP3 is generated from endogenous PIP2 pools, rather than its indiscriminate attachment to membranes, seems a requirement for its toxicity in the yeast cell. In mammalian cells, key effects of PI3K-dependent Akt activation related to control of cellular proliferation and survival rely on their downstream effector, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Yeast Tor1 seems to have a significant degree of functional conservation with respect to its mammalian counterpart (32Powers T. Dilova I. Chen C.Y. Wedaman K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 39-51PubMed Google Scholar). However, inhibition of growth induced by PI3K and Akt1 in yeast was unaffected by the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 2B). Although we cannot discard that heterologous Akt might couple to Tor signaling in yeast, this result indicates that Akt1-induced toxicity is not mediated by the yeast rapamycin-dependent TORC1 complex. All Akt Isoforms Respond to PIP3 Production in Yeast Impairing Cell Growth—Next we tested in the yeast system other isoforms of PKB/Akt besides PKBα/Akt1, namely PKBβ/Akt2 and PKBγ/Akt3, by generating the corresponding fusions to GFP in the same expression vectors. All three Akt isoforms behaved equivalently in terms of p110α-dependent growth inhibition (Fig. 3A) and PIP3-dependent localization to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Upon p110α co-expression, Akt2 and Akt3 displayed enhanced phosphorylation at the activation sites equivalent to Thr-308 and Ser-473 in Akt1 (Fig. 3B). This indicates that toxicity of all Akt isoforms in yeast correlates to their PIP3-dependent activation in vivo. We also tested the four isoforms of WT p110 (α, β, δ, and γ). However, only p110α was capable of inducing toxicity when co-expressed with any Akt isoform (data not shown), suggesting that p110α is a more robust enzyme in vivo than the other isoforms. Phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308, but Not Ser-473, Is Essential for Toxicity in Yeast—To attest the contribution of the phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 to activation of Akt in the yeast model, we mutated both residues to Ala in Akt1 by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutations did not affect PI3K-dependent re-localization of GFP-Akt1 to the yeast plasma membrane (data not shown). As expected, mutation of Thr-308 to Ala greatly eliminated toxicity of GFP-Akt1 (Fig. 4A), indicating that phosphorylation of this residue by yeast PDK1 orthologs is crucial for the activation of the Akt1 kinase in vivo in the yeast model. However, unexpectedly, the S473A mutation did not affect Akt1 toxicity, and a double T308A/S473A mutant behaved like the single T308A mutant (Fig. 4A). This implies that the observed phosphorylation of Akt1 at the HM is not linked to its effects on the yeast cell. Analyses of Akt1 P-Thr-308 and P-Ser-473 content in the T308A and S473A mutants verified that the corresponding epitopes were missing and revealed that phosphorylation of any of these two residues in yeast in the absence of the other was lower than in WT Akt1, but still responsive to p110α (Fig. 4B). We also generated and tested mutants that had each or both Thr-308 and Ser-473 sites in Akt1 mutated to Asp, a putative phospho-mimetic residue. We observed that the behavior of GFP-Akt1T308D and GFP-Akt1S473D was very similar to that of the mutants to Ala (data not shown), that is, the T308D mutation eliminated toxicity, whereas the S473D mutation did not add any effect. This might reflect that recognition by the endogenous PDK1-like kinases in situ"
https://openalex.org/W2104642589,"In previous investigations an impact of cellular copper homeostasis on ageing of the ascomycete Podospora anserina has been demonstrated. Here we provide new data indicating that mitochondria play a major role in this process. Determination of copper in the cytosolic fraction using total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis and eGfp reporter gene studies indicate an age-related increase of cytosolic copper levels. We show that components of the mitochondrial matrix (i.e. eGFP targeted to mitochondria) become released from the organelle during ageing. Decreasing the accessibility of mitochondrial copper in P. anserina via targeting a copper metallothionein to the mitochondrial matrix was found to result in a switch from a copper-dependent cytochrome-c oxidase to a copper-independent alternative oxidase type of respiration and results in lifespan extension. In addition, we demonstrate that increased copper concentrations in the culture medium lead to the appearance of senescence biomarkers in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). Significantly, expression of copper-regulated genes is induced during in vitro ageing in medium devoid of excess copper suggesting that cytosolic copper levels also increase during senescence of HDFs. These data suggest that the identified molecular pathway of age-dependent copper dynamics may not be restricted to P. anserina but may be conserved from lower eukaryotes to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2092934163,"In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) an important contingent of dopaminergic neurons are localized in the substantia nigra and in the ventral tegmental area of the ventral midbrain. They constitute an anatomically and functionally heterogeneous group of cells involved in a variety of regulatory mechanisms, from locomotion to emotional/motivational behavior. Midbrain dopaminergic neuron (mDA) primary cultures represent a useful tool to study molecular mechanisms involved in their development and maintenance. Considerable information has been gathered on the mDA neurons development and maturation in vivo, as well as on the molecular features of mDA primary cultures. Here we investigated in detail the gene expression differences between the tissue of origin and ventral midbrain primary cultures enriched in mDA neurons, using microarray technique. We integrated the results based on different re-annotations of the microarray probes. By using knowledge-based gene network techniques and promoter sequence analysis, we also uncovered mechanisms that might regulate the expression of CNS genes involved in the definition of the identity of specific cell types in the ventral midbrain. We integrate bioinformatics and functional genomics, together with developmental neurobiology. Moreover, we propose guidelines for the computational analysis of microarray gene expression data. Our findings help to clarify some molecular aspects of the development and differentiation of DA neurons within the midbrain."
