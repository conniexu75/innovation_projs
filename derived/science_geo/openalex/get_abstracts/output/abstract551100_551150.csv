When cancer is the outcome, we are afforded a glimpse into these processes by the clonal expansion of the malignant cell. Here, we characterize a less explored layer of the mutational landscape of cancer: mutational asymmetries between the two DNA strands. Analyzing whole-genome sequences of 590 tumors from 14 different cancer types, we reveal widespread asymmetries across mutagenic processes, with transcriptional (“T-class”) asymmetry dominating UV-, smoking-, and liver-cancer-associated mutations and replicative (“R-class”) asymmetry dominating POLE-, APOBEC-, and MSI-associated mutations. We report a striking phenomenon of transcription-coupled damage (TCD) on the non-transcribed DNA strand and provide evidence that APOBEC mutagenesis occurs on the lagging-strand template during DNA replication. As more genomes are sequenced, studying and classifying their asymmetries will illuminate the underlying biological mechanisms of DNA damage and repair.

A thorough understanding of mutational density and patterns in cancer genomes is important for studying the mechanisms of mutagenesis (Pleasance et al., 2010aPleasance E.D. Cheetham R.K.

One challenge inherent in the analysis of genomic mutations is the loss of strand information that occurs between the initial occurrence of a mutagenic lesion and the ultimate readout by DNA sequencing. For instance, consider a mutational process whose initiating event is oxidative attack on the guanine of a C:G base pair. In principle, if we isolated the DNA immediately after such an attack, we could directly observe the lesion; however, in genomic sequencing data, we don’t encounter mutations until many cell divisions later. The result of such a lesion is generally an A:G mismatch after the first cell division, leading to a stable A:T base pair after an additional round of replication. Since approximately half of C:G base pairs are oriented with the cytosine on the reference (Watson) and half on the anti-reference (Crick) strand, roughly equal numbers of “G→T” and “C→A” mutations are seen. A lesion at the cytosine of a C:G base pair could produce exactly the same result, so working backward, we cannot determine the base of the original DNA damage. This is because using the genomic reference strand as the “frame of reference” for base-pair orientation is merely an arbitrary convention. However, we can recover some strand information by considering a more biologically meaningful reference frame. In regions that undergo DNA transcription, the DNA can be oriented with respect to the transcribed strand. Thus, we would consider a C:G→A:T base pair change to be a “C→A” or “G→T” mutation depending on whether the C or the G is in the template strand for transcription. Alternatively, we can use DNA replication to define a frame of reference. In this case, whether the C of a C:G base pair is on the leading or the lagging strand of DNA replication would determine the type of mutation. Because replication and transcription are each associated with opportunities for the asymmetric (strand-specific) introduction and repair of DNA damage, they each have the potential to leave their footprints in a patient’s mutational profile in the form of unequal rates and patterns of mutations on the two strands of DNA (Francioli et al., 2015Francioli L.C.

DNA lesions encountered on the transcribed (“template”) strand can stall progression of the RNA polymerase, leading to the recruitment of a nucleotide excision repair (NER) complex that can correct the damage (Donahue et al., 1994Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II arrested by a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer in the DNA template.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ganesan A.K. The complex choreography of transcription-coupled repair.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2014; 19: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Importantly, higher transcription levels of a gene are associated with more opportunities for transcription-coupled repair (TCR), leading to an inverse correlation between the expression level of a gene and its mutation density (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman M.A. Lawrence M.S.

Bignell G.R. et al.A comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from a human cancer genome.Nature. 2010; 463: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Conversely, damage on the non-template (“sense”) strand may fail to stall the RNA polymerase and therefore could escape repair by TCR. In addition, the non-template strand remains single-stranded during the process of transcription and is therefore more vulnerable to damage (Jinks-Robertson and Bhagwat, 2014Jinks-Robertson S. Bhagwat A.S. Transcription-associated mutagenesis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2014; 48: 341-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In combination, these mechanisms lead to differences in mutation densities and spectra on the transcribed and non-transcribed strands (Pleasance et al., 2010aPleasance E.D. Cheetham R.K. Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Humphray S.J. Greenman C.D. Varela I. Lin M.L. Ordóñez G.R.

Greenman C. et al.A small-cell lung cancer genome with complex signatures of tobacco exposure.Nature. 2010; 463: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Notably, transcriptional strand asymmetry provides information regarding damage and TCR beyond what can be gathered from the correlation of mutational densities with expression, since the latter is convolved with other genomic factors such as chromatin-state- and replication-timing-dependent mismatch repair (MMR; Supek and Lehner, 2015Supek F. Lehner B. Differential DNA mismatch repair underlies mutation rate variation across the human genome.Nature. 2015; 521: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Strand asymmetry can also be viewed in the reference frame of DNA replication. The DNA replication fork is composed of a leading strand, copied in a largely continuous fashion, and a lagging strand, copied as a discontinuous series of Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε work together to replicate the DNA but have distinct roles in synthesis and proofreading. The resulting asymmetry reflects an imbalance in the types of mutations introduced on the leading versus lagging strand, although it is still a matter of debate whether this occurs due to the division of labor of distinct polymerases in DNA synthesis (Miyabe et al., 2011Miyabe I. Kunkel T.A. Carr A.M. The major roles of DNA polymerases epsilon and delta at the eukaryotic replication fork are evolutionarily conserved.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Nick McElhinny et al., 2008Nick McElhinny S.A.

Cell. 2015; 59: 139-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally the lagging strand endures longer exposure as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA; Yu et al., 2014Yu C. Gan H. Han J. Zhou Z.X. Jia S. Chabes A. Farrugia G. Ordog T. Zhang Z. Strand-specific analysis shows protein binding at replication forks and PCNA unloading from lagging strands when forks stall.Mol. Cell. 2014; 56: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and, as such, may be more vulnerable to ssDNA-targeting mutagens. These factors lead to replication-associated mutational asymmetry that flips (i.e., inverts which strand has the higher mutation density) at replication origins. Replication-strand asymmetries were observed as local skews in nucleotide composition in the chromosomes of bacterial (Lobry, 1996Lobry J.R. Asymmetric substitution patterns in the two DNA strands of bacteria.Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, McLean et al., 1998McLean M.J. Wolfe K.H.

USA. 2005; 102: 9836-9841Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) species, are associated with robustly programmed yeast replication origins (Koren et al., 2010Koren A. Tsai H.J. Tirosh I. Burrack L.S. Barkai N. Berman J. Epigenetically-inherited centromere and neocentromere DNA replicates earliest in S-phase.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and have also been experimentally demonstrated in yeast (Lujan et al., 2012Lujan S.A. Williams J.S. Pursell Z.F. Abdulovic-Cui A.A. Clark A.B. Nick McElhinny S.A. Kunkel T.A. Mismatch repair balances leading and lagging strand DNA replication fidelity.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003016Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Pavlov et al., 2002Pavlov Y.I. Newlon C.S. Kunkel T.A. Yeast origins establish a strand bias for replicational mutagenesis.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We partitioned the human genome in two ways: first, by transcription direction, using RefSeq gene definitions (Figure 1A). We annotated genomic regions as tx(+) when they encoded genes on the reference strand and as tx(−) when they encoded genes on the complementary strand. We considered the patterns of mutations in smoking-associated lung cancers, combining mutation data from seven lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) that exhibited a strong smoking signature. Mutational densities of C:G→A:T are highest in both tx(+) and tx(−) genes when the guanine is on the non-transcribed strand (Figure 1C). This is consistent with the known mechanism of the smoking signature, driven by carcinogen attack at guanines (Denissenko et al., 1996Denissenko M.F. Pao A. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. Preferential formation of benzo[a]pyrene adducts at lung cancer mutational hotspots in P53.Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). TCR lowers the mutational densities of C:G base pairs in which the guanine serves as the transcription template (denoted Cntx:Gtx), relative to intergenic regions (IGR). In contrast, Gntx:Ctx base pairs do not benefit from this extra opportunity for repair, resulting in undiminished mutation density of Gntx:Ctx→Tntx:Atx, as shown previously (Pleasance et al., 2010bPleasance E.D. Stephens P.J. O’Meara S. McBride D.J. Meynert A. Jones D. Lin M.L. Beare D. Lau K.W. Greenman C. et al.A small-cell lung cancer genome with complex signatures of tobacco exposure.Nature. 2010; 463: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The second form of genome partitioning was by DNA replication direction. Since the entire genome is replicated every time a cell divides (but only a portion is transcribed), replication direction has the potential to exert larger asymmetries in mutational data. However, determining direction is much more challenging for replication than transcription, since the precise locations of replication origins in the human genome are not known. This has precluded a comprehensive analysis of replicative strand asymmetry thus far. To enable an analysis of replication direction and strand asymmetry, we utilized high-resolution genomic replication timing data from deep DNA sequencing of S- and G1-phase cells from lymphoblastoid cell lines of six individuals (Koren et al., 2012Koren A. Polak P. Nemesh J. Michaelson J.J. Sebat J. Sunyaev S.R. McCarroll S.A. Differential relationship of DNA replication timing to different forms of human mutation and variation.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 91: 1033-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These data exhibit valleys and peaks in a timing-versus-location landscape that correspond to the approximate locations of replication origins (or origin clusters) and replication termini (Figure 1B). The regions between valleys and peaks correspond, in principle, to regions that replicate predominantly in a single direction (from origin to termination zone) and for which predominant replication direction can be assigned. This approach has previously been used to reveal compositional skews and asymmetric evolutionary germline mutations in the human genome (Chen et al., 2011Chen C.L. Duquenne L. Audit B. Guilbaud G. Rappailles A. Baker A. Huvet M. d’Aubenton-Carafa Y. Hyrien O. Arneodo A. Thermes C. Replication-associated mutational asymmetry in the human genome.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28: 2327-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, there are inherent limitations in the identification of replication origins based on replication timing valleys, and there is a lack of a gold standard (i.e., a set of replication origins with known locations) with which to benchmark this approach. The valleys and peaks (constant-timing regions) are the source of most tissue-specific variation in the profiles (Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Ryba et al., 2010Ryba T. Hiratani I. Lu J. Itoh M. Kulik M. Zhang J. Schulz T.C. Robins A.J. Dalton S. Gilbert D.M. Evolutionarily conserved replication timing profiles predict long-range chromatin interactions and distinguish closely related cell types.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and, furthermore, present no clear direction of replication. Therefore, we excluded these regions from our analysis and focused on “timing transition regions” (TTRs), which are highly conserved (Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Ryba et al., 2010Ryba T. Hiratani I. Lu J. Itoh M. Kulik M. Zhang J. Schulz T.C.

Evolutionarily conserved replication timing profiles predict long-range chromatin interactions and distinguish closely related cell types.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and have a prominent slope that indicates the general direction of replication, either “left-replicating” or “right-replicating.” (We use the terms “left” and “right” when viewing the DNA in the standard orientation.) While TTRs were first thought to represent regions that are entirely uni-directional in replication (Ryba et al., 2010Ryba T. Hiratani I. Lu J. Itoh M. Kulik M. Zhang J. Schulz T.C. Robins A.J. Dalton S. Gilbert D.M. Evolutionarily conserved replication timing profiles predict long-range chromatin interactions and distinguish closely related cell types.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), it was later suggested that the vast majority of these regions are replicated too quickly for a single replication fork and are more likely replicated by origins that fire in close succession (Guilbaud et al., 2011Guilbaud G. Rappailles A. Baker A. Chen C.L. Arneodo A. Goldar A. d’Aubenton-Carafa Y. Thermes C. Audit B. Hyrien O. Evidence for sequential and increasing activation of replication origins along replication timing gradients in the human genome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1002322Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For any pair of sequentially firing origins, the greater portion of the inter-origin distance is replicated by the fork originating from the earlier of the two origins. The result is that, in aggregate, the larger portion of a TTR is synthesized in the early-to-late direction (Figure S1). Thus, TTRs have a predominant replication direction given by the sign of their slope. Restricting analysis to these regions enabled us to assign the predominant replication direction to 38% of the genome. To validate our ability to measure replicative asymmetry using these left- and right-replicating definitions, we considered the one known case of replicative mutational asymmetry: tumors carrying functional mutations in the proofreading exonuclease domain of POLE, the gene encoding polymerase ε (designated as “POLE tumors”; Shinbrot et al., 2014Shinbrot E. Henninger E.E. Weinhold N. Covington K.R. Göksenin A.Y. Schultz N. Chao H. Doddapaneni H. Muzny D.M.

The exonuclease domain of polymerase ε is responsible for proofreading during synthesis of the leading strand (Nick McElhinny et al., 2008Nick McElhinny S.A. Gordenin D.A. Stith C.M. Burgers P.M.

As a consequence, in these tumors we would expect to see predominantly C→A mutations in left-replicating regions and G→T in right-replicating regions, since we hypothesized these regions to be enriched for leading- and lagging-strand synthesis of the reference strand, respectively. Indeed, when asymmetry is visualized along the chromosome, asymmetric C:G→A:"

Here, we characterize behavioral responses of freely swimming larval zebrafish to looming visual stimuli simulating predators. We report that the visual system alone can recruit lateralized, rapid escape motor programs, similar to those elicited by mechanosensory modalities. Two-photon calcium imaging of retino-recipient midbrain regions isolated the optic tectum as an important center processing looming stimuli, with ensemble activity encoding the critical image size determining escape latency. Furthermore, we describe activity in retinal ganglion cell terminals and superficial inhibitory interneurons in the tectum during looming and propose a model for how temporal dynamics in tectal periventricular neurons might arise from computations between these two fundamental constituents. Finally, laser ablations of hindbrain circuitry confirmed that visual and mechanosensory modalities share the same premotor output network. We establish a circuit for the processing of aversive stimuli in the context of an innate visual behavior."

Understanding how the immune system impacts the process of tumorigenesis has captivated some of the greatest minds in immunology for more than a century. In the 1860s, following the observation that cancer arises at sites of chronic inflammation, Rudolf Virchow proposed a tumor-promoting function for leukocytes. However, at the turn of the last century, Paul Ehrlich reasoned that protective immune responses were likely required to suppress cancer in long-lived organisms (Ehrlich, 1909Ehrlich P. Uber den jetzigen stand der karzinomforschung.Ned. Tijdschr. Geneeskd. 1909; 5: 273-290Google Scholar), and by the 1950s, the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis was formally postulated to ascribe a plausible function of adaptive cellular immunity in eliminating transformed cells (Burnet, 1957Burnet M. Cancer: a biological approach. III. Viruses associated with neoplastic conditions. IV. Practical applications.BMJ. 1957; 1: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Thomas, 1959Thomas L. Delayed hypersensitivity in health and disease.in: Lawrence H.S. Cellular and Humoral Aspects of the Hypersensitive States. Hoeber-Harper, 1959: 529-532Google Scholar). Indeed, studies in the past two decades have revealed both tumor-promoting inflammation and protective tumor immunity in mouse models of cancer (Grivennikov et al., 2010Grivennikov S.I. Greten F.R. Karin M. Immunity, inflammation, and cancer.Cell. 2010; 140: 883-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7426) Google Scholar). Such apparently opposing activities of inflammatory responses can be integrated into the framework of cancer immunoediting which, in its most complete manifestation, is composed of three sequential phases of tumor “elimination,” “equilibrium,” and “escape” (Schreiber et al., 2011Schreiber R.D. Old L.J. Smyth M.J. Cancer immunoediting: integrating immunity’s roles in cancer suppression and promotion.Science. 2011; 331: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar). The original cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis attributed the role of protective tumor immunity to antigen-specific lymphocytes (Burnet, 1957Burnet M. Cancer: a biological approach. III. Viruses associated with neoplastic conditions. IV. Practical applications.BMJ. 1957; 1: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Thomas, 1959Thomas L. Delayed hypersensitivity in health and disease.in: Lawrence H.S. Cellular and Humoral Aspects of the Hypersensitive States. Hoeber-Harper, 1959: 529-532Google Scholar). Studies utilizing recombination-activating gene (Rag)-deficient mice or T lymphocyte depletion antibodies have revealed increased tumor incidence or tumor outgrowth in a carcinogen-induced sarcoma model (Koebel et al., 2007Koebel C.M. Vermi W. Swann J.B. Zerafa N. Rodig S.J. Old L.J. Smyth M.J. Schreiber R.D.

IFNgamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity.Nature. 2001; 410: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). In addition, sarcomas that develop under conditions of immunodeficiency are more immunogenic than tumors from wild-type mice (Koebel et al., 2007Koebel C.M. Vermi W. Swann J.B. Zerafa N. Rodig S.J. Old L.J. Smyth M.J. Schreiber R.D.

IFNgamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity.Nature. 2001; 410: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar), and the dominant rejection antigen in one such tumor encodes a mutated neoepitope for CD8+ T cells (Matsushita et al., 2012Matsushita H. Vesely M.D. Koboldt D.C. Rickert C.G. Uppaluri R. Magrini V.J. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Chen Y.S. Shea L.K. et al.Cancer exome analysis reveals a T-cell-dependent mechanism of cancer immunoediting.Nature. 2012; 482: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In a genetic mouse model of sarcoma, introduction of immunogenic peptides by lentivirus infection suppresses tumor development, and the loss of antigen expression or presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I results in tumor escape from T cell attack (DuPage et al., 2012DuPage M. Mazumdar C. Schmidt L.M. Cheung A.F. Jacks T. Expression of tumour-specific antigens underlies cancer immunoediting.Nature. 2012; 482: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that cytotoxic T cells play a critical role in restraining tumor development in response to tumor-associated foreign antigens accompanied with viral infections or mutated antigens induced by carcinogens. Yet, tumor development does not always generate neoantigens that mediate rejection nor induce host-protective antigen-specific T cell responses. In a transgenic model of sporadic cancer, the oncogenic simian virus 40 T antigen (SV40 Tag) is somatically induced and functions as a tumor-associated neoantigen (Willimsky and Blankenstein, 2005Willimsky G. Blankenstein T. Sporadic immunogenic tumours avoid destruction by inducing T-cell tolerance.Nature. 2005; 437: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, SV40 Tag triggers CD8+ T cell tolerance and fails to reject nascent transformed cells (Willimsky and Blankenstein, 2005Willimsky G. Blankenstein T. Sporadic immunogenic tumours avoid destruction by inducing T-cell tolerance.Nature. 2005; 437: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In a transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (Tramp) model, CD8+ T cells reactive to the unmutated histone H4 peptide as a tumor-associated antigen arise spontaneously in tumor-bearing mice (Savage et al., 2008Savage P.A. Vosseller K. Kang C. Larimore K. Riedel E. Wojnoonski K. Jungbluth A.A. Allison J.P. Recognition of a ubiquitous self antigen by prostate cancer-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes.Science. 2008; 319: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Adoptive transfer of H4 antigen-reactive T cells into Tramp mice does not result in effector T cell differentiation (Savage et al., 2008Savage P.A. Vosseller K. Kang C. Larimore K. Riedel E. Wojnoonski K. Jungbluth A.A. Allison J.P. Recognition of a ubiquitous self antigen by prostate cancer-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes.Science. 2008; 319: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is in part due to immune repression by the regulatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β; Donkor et al., 2011Donkor M.K. Sarkar A. Savage P.A. Franklin R.A. Johnson L.K. Jungbluth A.A. Allison J.P. Li M.O. T cell surveillance of oncogene-induced prostate cancer is impeded by T cell-derived TGF-β1 cytokine.Immunity. 2011; 35: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These findings reveal that, although tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses are induced in oncogene-induced cancers, their activities are restrained from inducing effective cancer immunosurveillance. The lack of host-protective, antigen-specific T cell responses implies that oncogene-induced tumors bypass the “elimination” and “equilibrium” phases of cancer immunoediting and thus may, by default, display an “escaped” phenotype. Since tumors are derived from normal cells, it has been postulated that tumors may not be “foreign” or “dangerous” enough to induce a protective immune response (Matzinger, 2002Matzinger P. The danger model: a renewed sense of self.Science. 2002; 296: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3336) Google Scholar, Pardoll, 2003Pardoll D. Does the immune system see tumors as foreign or self?.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 807-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, studies involving mice deficient in several immune-effector molecules have revealed signs of immunosurveillance in genetic mouse models of cancer. For instance, deficiency of the activating receptor NKG2D results in earlier tumor onset in Tramp mice (Guerra et al., 2008Guerra N. Tan Y.X. Joncker N.T. Choy A. Gallardo F. Xiong N. Knoblaugh S. Cado D. Greenberg N.M. Raulet D.H. NKG2D-deficient mice are defective in tumor surveillance in models of spontaneous malignancy.Immunity. 2008; 28: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In addition, mice devoid of the cytotoxic molecule perforin (Smyth et al., 2000Smyth M.J. Thia K.Y. Street S.E. MacGregor D. Godfrey D.I. Trapani J.A. Perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is critical for surveillance of spontaneous lymphoma.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, Street et al., 2007Street S.E.

These observations suggest that cytotoxic immune responses are involved in repressing oncogene-induced cell transformation, although they may not engage tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, immunodeficiency could impair host elimination of infections (Enzler et al., 2003Enzler T. Gillessen S. Manis J.P. Ferguson D. Fleming J. Alt F.W. Mihm M. Dranoff G. Deficiencies of GM-CSF and interferon gamma link inflammation and cancer.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which may result in chronic inflammation and secondarily affect tumor development (Coussens and Werb, 2002Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Inflammation and cancer.Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11186) Google Scholar, Grivennikov et al., 2010Grivennikov S.I. Greten F.R. Karin M.

Cancer-related inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (7861) Google Scholar). Whether cell transformation elicits a specific protective immune response in oncogene-induced tumors and the nature of the potential response have not been defined. In this report, we set forth by characterizing lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential in transgenic models of murine cancer. We found that cell transformation expands a distinct group of non-circulating innate, T cell receptor (TCR)αβ, and TCRγδ lymphocytes that express high levels of the cytolytic molecule granzyme B and display potent cytotoxic activities against tumor cells. Generation of these lymphocytes is dependent on the cytokine IL-15, and IL-15 deficiency or overexpression results in accelerated or delayed tumor growth, respectively. These findings demonstrate that cell transformation triggers a distinct class of protective immune response by engaging unconventional tissue-resident type 1-like innate lymphoid cells and type 1 innate-like T cells. To investigate whether immunosurveillance is induced in spontaneous cancers, we utilized the murine MMTV-PyMT (PyMT) mammary tumor model on the C57BL/6 background (Franklin et al., 2014Franklin R.A. Liao W. Sarkar A. Kim M.V. Bivona M.R. Liu K. Pamer E.G. Li M.O. The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages.Science. 2014; 344: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Mammary glands from 8-week-old PyMT mice had early stage tumors, while palpable carcinomas were detected at older ages (Figures S1A and S1B). To determine whether lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential were induced in precancerous lesions, we examined expression of the cytolytic molecule granzyme B (GzmB) in leukocyte populations from the mammary glands of 8-week-old wild-type (WT) or PyMT mice. A higher percentage and number of GzmB-expressing cells were observed in PyMT mice (Figures 1A–1C ). GzmB-producing cells in mammary tissues further expanded as tumors grew (Figure S1C) but were barely detectable in the spleen or mammary-tissue-draining lymph nodes of PyMT mice (Figure S1D), revealing that the lasting GzmB response is restricted to the transformed tissue.Figure 1Precancerous Lesions Elicit an Immune Response Characterized by GzmB ExpressionShow full caption(A–C) Flow cytometric analysis of GzmB expression in CD45+ leukocytes from pooled mammary glands of WT and 8-week-old PyMT mice with percentage (A–B) and absolute number (C) of CD45+GzmB+ cells.

To determine whether the tumor-elicited GzmB response represents a general mechanism of tumor surveillance, we utilized the Tramp model of murine prostate cancer (Greenberg et al., 1995Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F. Finegold M.J. Medina D. Tilley W.D. Aspinall J.O. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Matusik R.J. Rosen J.M. Prostate cancer in a transgenic mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 3439-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Compared to WT mice, a higher percentage and number of GzmB-expressing cells were present in the prostates of Tramp mice, and the cell number increased as tumors progressed to later stages (Figures S1E and S1F). GzmB-expressing cells in mammary and prostate tumors were made of heterogeneous populations of lymphocytes that could be differentiated by their surface expression of TCRβ and TCRδ (Figure 1D; data not shown). Unlike GzmB-producing TCRαβ+ or TCRγδ+ T cells, TCR−GzmB+ cells were negative for intracellular CD3 (Figure S1G) and were classified as innate lymphocytes. Notably, GzmB-expressing cells from all three lineages were present in WT mice at low numbers (Figures 1D–1F). Cell transformation expanded all populations, with TCRαβ and TCRγδ lineage cells proportionally more represented in PyMT mice (Figures 1D–1F). TCR−GzmB+ cells from WT and PyMT mice expressed NK1.1 (Figure 2A), a cell surface marker typically used to define conventional natural killer (cNK) cells. Notably, GzmB-producing TCRαβ and TCRγδ lineage cells also expressed high levels of NK1.1 (Figure 2A). To determine whether TCRαβ+NK1.1+GzmB+ cells belonged to the CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (NKT) cell lineage known to express NK1.1, we co-stained tumor-associated TCRαβ+ T cells with NK1.1 and a CD1d tetramer loaded with the NKT cell ligand PBS-57 (CD1d/PBS-57). CD1d/PBS-57+ NKT cells expressed low levels of NK1.1, but not GzmB (Figure 2B). In contrast, CD1d/PBS-57−NK1.1+ T cells expressed high levels of GzmB (Figure 2B). Moreover, unlike some CD1d/PBS-57+ NKT cells that expressed the co-receptor CD4, but not CD8α, nearly half of CD1d/PBS-57−NK1.1+ T cells expressed CD8α, but not CD4 (Figures 2C and S2A). Importantly, tumor-associated TCRαβ+NK1.1+GzmB+ cells were unperturbed in the absence of CD1d (Figures S2B and S2C), demonstrating that they are distinct from CD1d-restricted NKT cells.Figure S2TCRαβ+NK1.1+GzmB+ Cells Are CD1d-Independent and Have a Gene Expression Program Distinct from that of Conventional T Cells, Related to Figure 2 and Table S1Show full caption(A) Flow cytometric analysis of CD4 and CD8α expression on TCRβ+CD1d/PBS-57+ lymphocytes from pooled mammary glands of 8-week-old PyMT mice.(B–C) Flow cytometric analysis of NK1.1 and GzmB expression of TCRβ+ T cells from pooled tumors of 20-week-old Cd1d−/− PyMT and wild-type PyMT mice (B).

Activated conventional CD8+ T cells express cytolytic molecules, including GzmB, and terminally differentiated cytotoxic T lymphocytes upregulate NK-cell-associated markers such as KLRG1 (Zhang and Bevan, 2011Zhang N. Bevan M.J. CD8(+) T cells: foot soldiers of the immune system.Immunity. 2011; 35: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In PyMT mice, tumor growth induces exhaustion of CD8+ T cells characterized by high expression of the inhibitory co-receptor PD-1 (Franklin et al., 2014Franklin R.A. Liao W. Sarkar A. Kim M.V. Bivona M.R. Liu K. Pamer E.G. Li M.O. The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages.Science. 2014; 344: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). To determine whether CD8α+NK1.1+ T cells might represent an activated conventional T cell population, we assessed the expression of NK1.1 and PD-1 in tumor-associated CD8α+ T cells. CD8α+NK1.1+ T cells were substantially expanded in 8-week-old PyMT mice compared to WT mice, while CD8α+PD-1+ T cells were undetectable at this stage (Figure 2D). At 20 weeks of age, PD-1 and NK1.1 remained mutually exclusive, although CD8α+PD-1+ T cells outpaced CD8α+NK1.1+ T cells to dominate the tumors (Figure 2D). Notably, compared to CD8α+NK1.1−PD-1− and CD8α+PD-1+ T cells, CD8α+NK1.1+ T cells maintained high GzmB expression (Figure S2D). Moreover, TCR profiling analyses showed that, unlike conventional CD8α+PD-1+ T cells that had substantially skewed TCR usage, CD8α+NK1.1+ T cells maintained a diverse TCR repertoire (Figure S2E). These observations suggest that CD8α+NK1.1+ T cells do not undergo clonal expansion or functional exhaustion and, thus, are distinct from conventional cytotoxic T lymphocytes. To further explore the lineage relationship between TCRαβ+NK1.1+GzmB+ T cells and conventional CD8+ T cells, we performed transcriptome analysis and included tumor-associated TCR−NK1.1+ cells as controls. Principal component analyses revealed that TCRαβ+CD8α+NK1.1+ and TCRαβ+CD8α−NK1.1+ cells formed a tight cluster, whereas CD8α+PD-1+ and CD8α+PD-1−NK1.1− T cells were closely associated (Figure S2F). Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that TCRαβ+NK1.1+ cells were more closely related to TCR−NK1.1+ cells than they were to conventional CD8+ T cells (Figure S2G; Table S1). Notably, several conventional T cell-lineage markers, including the co-stimulatory molecules CD28 and ICOS, as well as the signal-tuning receptor CD5, were undetectable or expressed at very low levels in TCRαβ+NK1.1+ cells (Figure 2E; Table S1, cluster 4). Furthermore, inhibitory receptors such as CTLA4 and BTLA, as well as TCR signaling molecules such as LAT, were also downregulated in TCRαβ+NK1.1+ cells (Table S1, cluster 4). Together, these findings imply that TCRαβ+NK1.1+GzmB+ cells are unconventional T cells. Among the transcripts enriched in TCRαβ+NK1.1+ T cells was Itga1, encoding the collagen-binding integrin CD49a (Table S1, cluster 1). Indeed, CD49a protein was expressed at higher levels in TCRαβ+CD8α+NK1.1+ or TCRαβ+CD8α−NK1.1+ cells than in CD8α+PD-1+ or CD8α+PD-1−NK1.1− T cells (Figure 3A). Surprisingly, TCR−NK1.1+ cells had mixed CD49ahi and CD49a− populations (Figure 3A). Notably, in addition to TCRαβ+ T cells, high CD49a expression marked GzmB-producing TCR−NK1.1+ innate lymphocytes as well as GzmB-producing TCRγδ+ T cells (Figure 3B). Compared to WT mice, PyMT mice had increased numbers of CD49ahi GzmB-expressing TCR−NK1.1+, TCRαβ+, and TCRγδ+ cells in precancerous mammary tissue (Figure 3B), further supporting that the early GzmB response engages all three lineages of lymphocytes. In addition to cNK cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) function as early effectors during immune challenge (Artis and Spits, 2015Artis D. Spits H. The biology of innate lymphoid cells.Nature. 2015; 517: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, Eberl et al., 2015Eberl G. Colonna M. Di Santo J.P. McKenzie A.N. Innate lymphoid cells.

Both cNK cells and type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) participate in type 1 immune responses, but their classification has been controversial because of overlapping phenotypes (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A.

A recent study has identified gene expression signatures for cNK cells and ILC1s by cross-referencing differentially expressed transcripts between cNK cells and ILC1s from spleen and liver (Robinette et al., 2015Robinette M.L.

We sought to determine the identity of tumor-associated GzmB-expressing innate lymphocytes and performed transcriptome analysis of sorted TCR−NK1.1+CD49ahi and TCR−NK1.1+CD49a− cells. To ensure that TCR−NK1.1+ cells were innate lymphocytes, we validated our gating strategy by confirming that these cells expressed the Nkp46 receptor (Figure S3A), which was considered a reliable marker for cNK cells and ILC1s (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A. Colonna M. Koyasu S. Development, differentiation, and diversity of innate lymphoid cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 354-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Transcriptome analyses showed that the signature genes of cNK cells were expressed at high levels in TCR−NK1.1+CD49a− cells, whereas most transcripts used to define the ILC1 gene signature were enriched in TCR−NK1.1+CD49ahi cells (Figure 3C; Table S2). In line with these observations, TCR−NK1.1+CD49a− expressed high levels of Itga2 encoding the cNK cell marker CD49b compared to TCR−NK1.1+CD49ahi cells (Figure 3D; Table S2). Furthermore, while both cell populations expressed comparable amounts of the transcription factor T-bet, Eomes was expressed at substantially higher levels in TCR−NK1.1+CD49a− cells (Figure 3D; Table S2). These findings demonstrate that the GzmB-expressing innate lymphocytes are distinct from cNK cells. One of the characteristics of conventional ILC1s is their lack of Eomes expression (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A. Colonna M. Koyasu S.

Here, we present the multiplexed editing regulatory assay (MERA), a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9-based approach that analyzes the functional impact of the regulatory genome in its native context. MERA tiles thousands of mutations across ∼40 kb of cis-regulatory genomic space and uses knock-in green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters to read out gene activity. Using this approach, we obtain quantitative information on the contribution of cis-regulatory regions to gene expression. We identify proximal and distal regulatory elements necessary for expression of four embryonic stem cell-specific genes. We show a consistent contribution of neighboring gene promoters to gene expression and identify unmarked regulatory elements (UREs) that control gene expression but do not have typical enhancer epigenetic or chromatin features. We compare thousands of functional and nonfunctional genotypes at a genomic location and identify the base pair-resolution functional motifs of regulatory elements."

We isolated a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against BDBV glycoprotein (GP) using peripheral blood B cells from survivors of the 2007 BDBV outbreak in Uganda. We determined that a large proportion of mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against BDBV bind to the glycan cap and recognize diverse epitopes within this major antigenic site. We identified several glycan cap-specific mAbs that neutralized multiple ebolaviruses, including SUDV, and a cross-reactive mAb that completely protected guinea pigs from the lethal challenge with heterologous EBOV. Our results provide a roadmap to develop a single antibody-based treatment effective against multiple Ebolavirus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2339626422,"As a cementitious material, geopolymers show a high quasi-brittle behavior and a relatively low fracture energy. To overcome such a weakness, incorporation of fibers to a brittle matrix is a well-known technique to enhance the flexural properties. This study comprehensively evaluates the short and long term impacts of different volume percentages of polypropylene fiber (PPF) reinforcement on fly ash based geopolymer composites. Different characteristics of the composite were compared at fresh state by flow measurement and hardened state by variation of shrinkage over time to assess the response of composites under flexural and compressive load conditions. The fiber-matrix interface, fiber surface and toughening mechanisms were assessed using field emission scan electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results show that incorporation of PPF up to 3 wt % into the geopolymer paste reduces the shrinkage and enhances the energy absorption of the composites. While, it might reduce the ultimate flexural and compressive strength of the material depending on fiber content."
https://openalex.org/W2261796379,"Necroptosis as a molecular program, rather than simply incidental cell death, was established by elucidating the roles of receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinases 1 and 3, along with their downstream partner, mixed lineage kinase-like domain protein (MLKL). Previous studies suggested that phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5), a mitochondrial protein that associates with RIP1/RIP3/MLKL complex, promotes necroptosis. We have generated mice deficient in the pgam5 gene and surprisingly found PGAM5-deficiency exacerbated rather than reduced necroptosis in response to multiple in vitro and in vivo necroptotic stimuli, including ischemic reperfusion injury (I/R) in the heart and brain. Electron microscopy, biochemical, and confocal analysis revealed that PGAM5 is indispensable for the process of PINK1 dependent mitophagy which antagonizes necroptosis. The loss of PGAM5/PINK1 mediated mitophagy causes the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria, leading to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that worsen necroptosis. Our results revise the former proposal that PGAM5 acts downstream of RIP1/RIP3 to mediate necroptosis. Instead, PGAM5 protects cells from necroptosis by independently promoting mitophagy. PGAM5 promotion of mitophagy may represent a therapeutic target for stroke, myocardial infarction and other diseases caused by oxidative damage and necroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2267852670,"Suv39h1 is a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K9 residues in heterochromatic regions of the genome. An approach using semisynthetic chromatin reveals a mechanism for heterochromatin spreading in which H3K9 trimethylation anchors and activates Suv39h1 for modification of proximal lysines. Specialized chromatin domains contribute to nuclear organization and regulation of gene expression. Gene-poor regions are di- and trimethylated at lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) by the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. This enzyme harnesses a positive feedback loop to spread H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 over extended heterochromatic regions. However, little is known about how feedback loops operate on complex biopolymers such as chromatin, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining suitable substrates. Here we describe the synthesis of multidomain 'designer chromatin' templates and their application to dissecting the regulation of human Suv39h1. We uncovered a two-step activation switch where H3K9me3 recognition and subsequent anchoring of the enzyme to chromatin allosterically promotes methylation activity and confirmed that this mechanism contributes to chromatin recognition in cells. We propose that this mechanism serves as a paradigm in chromatin biochemistry, as it enables highly dynamic sampling of chromatin state combined with targeted modification of desired genomic regions."

However, folding constraints changed along the trajectory: initially, conflicts between monomer folding and oligomer assembly dominated, whereas subsequently, upon tandem duplication, tradeoffs between monomer stability and foldability took precedence. The birth of new proteins is essential to the diversity of life, particularly in cellular signaling and immunity (Chen et al., 2013Chen S. Krinsky B.H. Long M. New genes as drivers of phenotypic evolution.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although global networks of relatedness among different protein superfamilies and folds have been derived (for a recent example, see Nepomnyachiy et al., 2014Nepomnyachiy S. Ben-Tal N. Kolodny R. Global view of the protein universe.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an empirical description of the de novo emergence of a protein is lacking. A fuller understanding requires addressing the evolutionary intermediates leading to mature, fit proteins along with the molecular properties under selection. Duplication and fusion of a short ancestral motif underlie the structural symmetry so commonly observed in modern proteins (Balaji, 2015Balaji S. Internal symmetry in protein structures: prevalence, functional relevance and evolution.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 32: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we define a “motif” as the smallest repetitive sequence unit that a symmetric, globular protein can be broken into. Symmetry is particularly dominant in all β proteins, and distinctly in β propellers (Balaji, 2015Balaji S. Internal symmetry in protein structures: prevalence, functional relevance and evolution.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 32: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). β Propellers are associated with diverse functions in immunorecognition, viral infection, signal transduction, and vesicle formation. Propellers comprise four to eight blades arranged in radial symmetry, with each blade comprising a four-strand β sheet (Figure 1A). The repeated β-sheet motif shares homology with other fold groups, thus suggesting multiple, parallel emergence events from short peptide motifs (Kopec and Lupas, 2014Kopec K.O. Lupas A.N. β-propeller blades as ancestral peptides in protein evolution.PLoS ONE. 2014; 8: e77074Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Tandem sequence repetitions are also frequently observed in genomes (Verstrepen et al., 2005Verstrepen K.J. Jansen A. Lewitter F. Fink G.R. Intragenic tandem repeats generate functional variability.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, emergence by co-option of a short sequence motif, followed by duplication and fusion of the DNA segment encoding this motif, is genetically feasible. Topological permutations are also a commonly observed genetic rearrangement, involving duplication, fusion, and truncation (new start and stop codons) that effectively transpose residues between protein termini (“circular permutation”; Figures 1B and 1C). These permutations shift the boundaries between sequence motifs and structural domains (Longo et al., 2013Longo L.M. Lee J. Tenorio C.A. Blaber M. Alternative folding nuclei definitions facilitate the evolution of a symmetric protein fold from a smaller peptide motif.Structure. 2013; 21: 2042-2050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Peisajovich et al., 2006Peisajovich S.G.

Genet. 2006; 38: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as seen in the “Velcro closure” topology of propellers (Figures 1A–1C). However, for these mechanisms to be evolutionary feasible, the genetic processes generating new DNA sequences must be coupled with protein intermediates that are foldable, stable, and biochemically active. Experimental reconstruction of symmetric proteins has gained attention as an evolutionary model and a design paradigm (Höcker, 2014Höcker B. Design of proteins from smaller fragments-learning from evolution.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 27: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Longo and Blaber, 2014Longo L.M. Blaber M.

Biol. 2015; 22: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, a designed single 42-amino-acid β-trefoil motif assembled as homotrimer, albeit with no function (Lee and Blaber, 2011Lee J. Blaber M. Experimental support for the evolution of symmetric protein architecture from a simple peptide motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Functional six-bladed propellers were assembled from designed two or three-motif fusions (Voet et al., 2014Voet A.R. Noguchi H. Addy C. Simoncini D. Terada D. Unzai S. Park S.Y. Zhang K.Y. Tame J.R.

Conversely, function was observed in fused monomers that are identical or nearly identical, yet with no self-assembly from single motifs (Broom et al., 2012Broom A. Doxey A.C. Lobsanov Y.D.

Des. Sel. 2011; 24: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, one crucially missing link is a single-motif ancestor inferred from an extant symmetric protein that is capable of self-assembly into a biochemically active protein. Such single motifs have not yet been reconstructed in the laboratory or observed in nature, and we lack a description of a viable evolutionary trajectory leading from an ancestral single motif to an extant symmetrical protein through a series of functional intermediates (Figure 2). Here, we address a basic evolutionary trajectory leading to an existing, natural lectin β propeller. First, we show that single ancestral motifs inferred from the sequence repeats of the extant propeller yield a functional lectin via oligomerization. We subsequently examined how these motifs further evolve by tandem duplications, diversification, and topological permutation to yield highly functional monomeric lectins (Figure 2). An obstacle related to the evolution of repeating domains in tandem arrays (“beads on a string”) is that high internal sequence identity promotes aggregation via domain-swapped misfolding, suggesting that sequence diversification is crucial for efficient folding (Borgia et al., 2011Borgia M.B. Borgia A. Best R.B. Steward A. Nettels D. Wunderlich B. Schuler B. Clarke J. Single-molecule fluorescence reveals sequence-specific misfolding in multidomain proteins.Nature. 2011; 474: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, Wright et al., 2005Wright C.F. Teichmann S.A. Clarke J. Dobson C.M. The importance of sequence diversity in the aggregation and evolution of proteins.Nature. 2005; 438: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Whether folding restricts the functionality of globular repeat proteins such as propellers and how stability and foldability evolve need to be explored (Balaji, 2015Balaji S. Internal symmetry in protein structures: prevalence, functional relevance and evolution.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 32: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Zheng et al., 2013Zheng W. Schafer N.P. Wolynes P.G. Frustration in the energy landscapes of multidomain protein misfolding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We thus examined the biophysical features that underlie the evolutionary optimization of the newly emerging lectin propellers starting from a single motif. Our results validate the hypothesized mechanism for the de novo emergence of a functional lectin β propeller from short motifs (<50 amino acids). A selectable function was demonstrated for the proposed intermediates along the basic trajectory, with gradual functional improvement along a genetically feasible pathway of tandem duplication and repeat diversification, both via point mutations and frame permutations, leading to the extant lectin β propeller. The biophysical properties of various constructs were analyzed, thus offering a glimpse of the features shaping the evolution in terms of binding affinity, configurational stability, and folding efficiency. Emergence from an ancestral single motif that duplicates, fuses, and diverges was also supported by identifying natural genes containing single propeller motifs that were related to mature propellers in the same genome. Although propellers were hypothesized to have emerged by duplication and fusion of short sequence motifs (Vellieux et al., 1989Vellieux F.M. Huitema F. Groendijk H. Kalk K.H. Jzn J.F. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Petratos K. Drenth J. Hol W.G. Structure of quinoprotein methylamine dehydrogenase at 2.25 A resolution.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), high internal identity is rarely preserved (Wright et al., 2005Wright C.F. Teichmann S.A. Clarke J. Dobson C.M. The importance of sequence diversity in the aggregation and evolution of proteins.Nature. 2005; 438: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, because of the ubiquity of the propeller fold, of 95,306 non-redundant propeller sequences identified in the Pfam database, nearly 1,000 sequences exhibited ≥50% average internal identity. Among these, tachylectin-2 from the horseshoe crab T. tridentatus provides an excellent model for the study of propeller evolution. First, the approximation of an ancestral motif is facilitated by relatively little divergence among its five tandemly repeating motifs (54% average internal identity). Second, tachylectin-2 is an immunoprotein that agglutinates foreign cells by multivalent binding of surface GlcNAc- and GalNAc-decorated glycoproteins. Its physiological role is utterly dependent on multivalent binding, suggesting that internal symmetry and the comparatively high internal sequence identity are directly linked to function (Balaji, 2015Balaji S. Internal symmetry in protein structures: prevalence, functional relevance and evolution.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 32: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The repeating motifs encode both the globular propeller fold and the rigid binding of saccharides between propeller blades (Figure 1A). Many potential trajectories that lead to tachylectin-2 can be envisioned in sequence, structure, and function. As a starting point, however, we focused our investigation on the most basic trajectory depicted in Figure 2, with a single motif that forms a functional pentamer being the key, founding step. However, the smallest fragments of extant tachylectin-2 that gave a functional propeller consisted of two repeats (∼100 amino acids) (Yadid and Tawfik, 2007Yadid I. Tawfik D.S. Reconstruction of functional β-propeller lectins via homo-oligomeric assembly of shorter fragments.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further, the fourth motif of WT tachylectin-2 that best represents the consensus sequence (Yadid and Tawfik, 2011Yadid I. Tawfik D.S. Functional β-propeller lectins by tandem duplications of repetitive units.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2011; 24: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) did not show a detectable lectin function as a single motif, in either the Velcro (WT41V) or the intact-blade permutation frame (WT41B), and its tandem fusion showed very low binding capability (Figures 3A and 3D ). Ancestral properties, in this case the presumed ability of a single motif to self-assemble into a functional lectin, are often lost in extant sequences through mutational drift that blocks reversion to the ancestral features (Afriat-Jurnou et al., 2012Afriat-Jurnou L. Jackson C.J. Tawfik D.S. Reconstructing a missing link in the evolution of a recently diverged phosphotriesterase by active-site loop remodeling.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6047-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Bridgham et al., 2009Bridgham J.T. Ortlund E.A. Thornton J.W. An epistatic ratchet constrains the direction of glucocorticoid receptor evolution.Nature. 2009; 461: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We therefore aimed to capture the potential for emergence from a functional single motif by ancestral inference. The computational inference of ancestral sequences aims to identify the most probable sequences from which a given set of extant sequences, relating to one another via a given phylogenetic tree, diverged. Being based on generic probabilities of amino acids exchanges (substitution matrixes), inference is statistical, not deterministic (Merkl and Sterner, 2015Merkl R. Sterner R. Ancestral protein reconstruction: techniques and applications.Biol. Chem. 2015; 396: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, per each position, sets of amino acids are predicted, each with a given probability. The probabilities depend on the substitution matrix, the number of available extant sequences, their identity level, and the consistency of their phylogenetic relationships. The most probable inferred ancestor (MPA) relates to a sequence in which all positions comprise the amino acid predicted with the highest probability. However, the MPA is just one sequence from an entire “cloud” of sequences that are in effect as probable. To infer the ancestral motif from which tachylectin-2 may have diverged, we separated and aligned the five-sequence motifs of tachylectin-2 from T. tridentatus. Tachylectin-2 is a near-orphan protein, but we identified a sea anemone homolog which is 44% identical in sequence and essentially identical in structure and function (Figure 1D). The aligned individual motifs were assembled in a phylogenetic tree (Figure S1A) and the common ancestral motif was inferred (Figures 1E). The caveats associated with this inference are a limited number of sequences and unknown phylogeny (the species where the two lectins are found are not closely related). However, because of the high sequence identity and unambiguous alignment, the prediction seems comparatively robust (34 of 47 positions predicted with ≥90% probability). Further, the ancestral sequence inferred from only T. tridentatus tachylectin-2 motifs was essentially identical (Figure 1E), thus indicating that inference is independent of the two lectins sharing a common ancestor. Given the statistical nature of ancestral inference, the reconstructed ancestor is best represented by a library of sequences with combinatorial sampling of alternative predictions (Bar-Rogovsky et al., 2015Bar-Rogovsky H. Stern A. Penn O. Kobl I. Pupko T. Tawfik D.S. Assessing the prediction fidelity of ancestral reconstruction by a library approach.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2015; 28: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such libraries were constructed here, thus testing all combinations of the alternative states (>25% probability) in the MPA’s background. The library was also extended to include different permutation frames beyond the Velcro topology of extant tachylectin-2. The alternative frames relate to the β strands topology in tachylectin-2, such that intact structural blades could be obtained with “end polishing” of ±2 residues (Figures 1C, 1E, and S1B). Overall, the first single motif library included 23 natural amino acid substitutions at ten positions within six different permutation frames (∼6 × 103 variants). To estimate the “fitness” of the ancestral motifs and all subsequent intermediates along the trajectory, the lectin binding capacity was measured in crude lysates of E. coli cells in which these constructs were overexpressed. The total binding capacity of cell lysate, expressed in arbitrary, relative units (see Experimental Procedures), reflects both the level of properly folded and functional protein and the specific activity, i.e., the affinity for glycoprotein. Specifically, we measured binding to a glycoprotein, mucin, using an ELISA format whereby lectin binding to immobilized mucin was determined with polyclonal anti-tachylectin-2 antibodies. This assay exhibited high sensitivity and a wide dynamic range (Figure S2A). The more physiologically relevant binding of saccharide-decorated cell surfaces was also measured by hemagglutination and was found to corroborate the ELISA data (Table S1). Single motifs isolated from the ancestral library that corresponded to an intact blade frame encoded functional lectins (Anc1B library; Figure 3A) while no function was observed with the extant Velcro frame (Anc1V library; the nomenclature of constructs is described in the legend to Figure 2). Thus, it appears that topological permutation(s) occurred only at later stages of the trajectory leading to tachylectin-2 (Figure 2). Additionally, while the exact MPA blade gave no binding (Anc1B MPA; Figure 3A), several library variants with the blade frame were functional. Thus, the uncertainties associated with ancestral inference are best tackled via a library approach. The functional signal associated with these ancestral motifs was low (2% relative to WT). Nonetheless, hemagglutination could be observed at concentrations of ≥10 nM (Table S1), suggesting that given high enough expression levels these short motifs would be functional in vivo. A second-generation library was constructed based on the first generation’s most active variants. Amino acids that were enriched to convergence in the first generation were fixed, and new ancestral inference alternatives were introduced at additional positions (>10% probability). Screening of the second library gave hundreds of functional motifs (Figure S2B). The best performing single motif in this library, AncA1B, showed 2-fold higher total binding capacity compared with the first generation (Figure 3A). As observed with the first generation (Anc1B library), topological permutation of AncA1B to a Velcro frame (AncA1V) resulted in an inactive protein, again highlighting the critical dependency of the single motif on an intact blade topology at this early evolutionary stage. We also tested the viability of single motif sequences that further deviate from the MPA. The best performing sequence from the first round of selection (Anc1B library) was subjected to error-prone PCR at a rate of 1.6 mutations per motif. Selection identified a single mutation, F23L (AncB1B), which was incidentally an ancestral state predicted with low probability; this mutant exhibited similar total binding capacity to AncA1B. Accordingly, introducing F23L into AncA1B (AncC1B) did not alter the total binding capacity, suggesting a certain level of sequence redundancy (Figure 3A). Overall, the library selections indicate the high probability of emergence of functional ancestral single motif(s) that, jointly, form an entire “cloud” of functional sequences that relate with high probability to the MPA, even if the MPA itself is non-functional. AncA1B and AncB1B were purified with a sugar ligand (GlcNAc) resin and eluted indistinguishably from WT tachylectin-2 in gel filtration, indicating the formation of stable pentamers; additional peaks corresponding to alternate states were not observed (Figure S3A). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra also had similar curve shapes to the WT spectrum (Figure S3B). The crystal structure of AncB1B was essentially identical to the WT structure despite its alternate permutation frame, with each of the pentameric subunits cradling GlcNAc in the same binding orientation as the five-bladed WT monomer (Figure 3B). The repetitively observed mutations of selected single motifs localized along the subunit interfaces and near the GlcNAc binding sites (Figure 3C). The next step in the basic trajectory is duplication and fusion in tandem. To reconstruct this step, each of the single motifs AncA1B and AncB1B were identically duplicated 5-fold and fused in tandem to give AncA5B and AncB5B, respectively (Figure 2). The duplication-fusion step gave a 4-fold increase in total binding capacity in both cases (Figure 3A). Like-wise, tandem fusion of Anc1B gave the functional Anc5B. This result further validates the ancestral inference, also in light of the tandem fusion of WT fourth motif, WT45V, being barely functional. Thus, while the pentameric single motif proteins are functional, there is a clear selective advantage associated with duplication and fusion into a multi-motif, monomeric protein. The single motifs were only functional with a blade topology (Figure 3A; Anc1B library versus Anc1V library and AncA1B versus AncA1V), indicating that the Velcro topology seen in tachylectin-2 and most other propellers emerged at a later stage. Indeed, while the intact blade frame of the single motifs seems obligatory, following duplication and fusion, permutation had a surprisingly modest effect on total binding capacity. Motif expansion of Anc5B gave a functional 6-motif protein, namely Anc6B, as did truncation of Anc6B to give the five-motif protein in the new Velcro topology, namely Anc5V (Figure 3D). Similar observations were made with the other duplicated-fused intermediates in the alternate frames (AncA5B to AncA5V and AncB5B to AncB5V). Accordingly, permutation of WT tachylectin-2 from the extant Velcro frame (WTV) to the ancestral blade frame (WTB) resulted in a less than 2-fold decrease in total binding capacity (Figure 3D). As mentioned above, the extant tachylectin-2 sequence lost the ancestral capability to function as a single motif and was also severely impaired as a tandem fusion (WT45V; Figure 3E). Diversification of WT45V via the introduction of alternative WT motifs previously led to functional lectins, but these constructs diverged from WT45V at >20 positions (Yadid and Tawfik, 2011Yadid I. Tawfik D.S. Functional β-propeller lectins by tandem duplications of repetitive units.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2011; 24: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A more feasible route to diversifying selection was therefore explored by random mutagenesis of WT45V using error-prone PCR at a rate of approximately three mutations per gene. Indeed, improvements in total binding capacity were observed in response to few mutations: WT45VA in the first round and WT45VB in the second (Figure 3E). The F23L mutation in the single motif AncB1B also featured in the evolving WT45V with F-to-L mutations at equivalent positions (WT45VA and WT45VB were each substituted with F23L of their second and fourth repeats, among other mutations). While diversification plays a role in selection, interestingly, constructs with identical repeats had total binding capacities covering a range of a 100-fold (compare AncA5V, AncB5V, Anc5V, and WT45V in Figures 3D and 3E). Thus, the magnitude of selection toward repeat diversification (lower internal sequence identity) was highly dependent on the repeat sequence. The identical fusion WT45V sequence became more functional upon mutation and selection. However, even when its internal identity decreased to 93%, it was still inferior relative to the fully identical ancestral fusions. This gave another indication that the ancestral reconstruction was relevant and that the ancestral trait of a single, oligomerizing motif that subsequently duplicated and fused was lost in extant tachylectin-2. Having reconstructed a possible scenario for the de novo emergence of a lectin β propeller (Figure 2), we next sought to disentangle the different biophysical properties that underlie the total binding capacity of the various evolutionary intermediates (Figure 3). The earliest evolutionary stage of single motifs was sampled using AncA1B and AncB1B; identical fusions were sampled using AncA5B and Anc5V, and WTV represented the extant diversified fusion. First, we measured the levels of soluble protein following expression and cell lysis and of aggregated protein in the insoluble pellet. These describe the amounts of natively folded versus aggregated protein. They relate to the efficiency of folding of individual variants, but also to cellular factors such as chaperones and proteases (Bershtein et al., 2013Bershtein S. Mu W. Serohijos A.W. Zhou J. Shakhnovich E.I. Protein quality control acts on folding intermediates to shape the effects of mutations on organismal fitness.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Hingorani and Gierasch, 2014Hingorani K.S. Gierasch L.M. Comparing protein folding in vitro and in vivo: foldability meets the fitness challenge.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 24: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Next, three biophysical properties of the purified, folded proteins were investigated. Specific activity usually dominates the divergence of new proteins, and therefore, GlcNAc binding affinity was measured. Folding efficiency was also measured in vitro, in the absence of cellular factors, by following the residual binding function (ELISA signal) after chemical denaturation and renaturation by dilution into buffer. Finally, stability of the native, folded state may also dictate the levels of functional protein, as in the cellular milieu, unstable folded states may result in misfolding, proteolysis, and/or aggregation. The stability of the native state was measured by the global unfolding midpoint in CD thermal melts. The relationships between these five measured parameters and between these parameters and the total binding capacity were examined by an unbiased regression analysis. A 6 × 6 correlation matrix was constructed (Table S2) and sorted by its principal components. The first principal component explained 85% of the variance among all intercorrelations and indicated two groups of correlated parameters (Figure 4A). Group 1 included total binding capacity and folding efficiency, as reflected by the levels of soluble protein in E. coli and/or by the yield of folding in vitro (Figure 4B). In contrast, affinity toward GlcNAc was weakly correlated to total functional capacity, and stability of the native state and the levels of insoluble aggregates were not correlated (Figure 4C). Notably, the latter three factors were intercorrelated (Figure 4D; group 2). Indeed, the separation of group 1 and group 2 was primarily due to the identical fusion constructs (AncA5B and Anc5V), which despite their total binding capacity being at mid range, showed the highest stability, binding affinity, and insoluble expression. This trend seems generalizable because AncA5B is an exact 5-fold copy of the single motif AncA1B. Fu"
https://openalex.org/W2268453392,"Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) is critical for survival and genome stability of individual cells and organisms, but also contributes to the genetic diversity of species. A vital step in HR is MRN-CtIP-dependent end resection, which generates the 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs required for the subsequent strand exchange reaction. Here, we identify EXD2 (also known as EXDL2) as an exonuclease essential for DSB resection and efficient HR. EXD2 is recruited to chromatin in a damage-dependent manner and confers resistance to DSB-inducing agents. EXD2 functionally interacts with the MRN complex to accelerate resection through its 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which efficiently processes double-stranded DNA substrates containing nicks. Finally, we establish that EXD2 stimulates both short- and long-range DSB resection, and thus, together with MRE11, is required for efficient HR. This establishes a key role for EXD2 in controlling the initial steps of chromosomal break repair."

We investigated the potential of empagliflozin to recover insulin pathways in type 1 diabetes by improving pancreatic β-cell mass. Blood glucose homeostasis was assessed by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Serum insulin levels and insulin mRNA expression were determined using commercial insulin ELISA kits and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate β-cell areas, β-cell proliferation, apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells, and reactive oxygen species production in the pancreatic β-cells. Results showed that glucose tolerance was significantly improved in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice treated with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin-treated mice also showed an increase in insulin mRNA expression. Higher serum insulin levels were detected in mice treated with empagliflozin compared with the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry indicated that β-cell area/total pancreatic area and the expression of cell proliferation marker Ki-67 (co-stained with insulin) were significantly enhanced by empagliflozin treatment. These effects were due, probably, to a reduction in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species in the pancreatic β-cells. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that empagliflozin may have a beneficial effect on preserving β-cell regeneration, thus improving blood glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetes mellitus, probably via the protection of pancreatic β-cell from glucotoxicity-induced oxidative stress."

While TM bypass results are promising, inconsistent success is seen. One hypothesis for this variability rests upon segmental (non-360 degrees uniform) AHO. We describe aqueous angiography as a real-time and physiologic AHO imaging technique in model eyes as a way to simulate live AHO imaging. Methods Pig (n = 46) and human (n = 6) enucleated eyes were obtained, orientated based upon inferior oblique insertion, and pre-perfused with balanced salt solution via a Lewicky AC maintainer through a 1mm side-port. Fluorescein (2.5%) was introduced intracamerally at 10 or 30 mm Hg. With an angiographer, infrared and fluorescent (486 nm) images were acquired. Image processing allowed for collection of pixel information based on intensity or location for statistical analyses. Concurrent OCT was performed, and fixable fluorescent dextrans were introduced into the eye for histological analysis of angiographically active areas. Results Aqueous angiography yielded high quality images with segmental patterns (p<0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis test). No single quadrant was consistently identified as the primary quadrant of angiographic signal (p = 0.06–0.86; Kruskal-Wallis test). Regions of high proximal signal did not necessarily correlate with regions of high distal signal. Angiographically positive but not negative areas demonstrated intrascleral lumens on OCT images. Aqueous angiography with fluorescent dextrans led to their trapping in AHO pathways. Conclusions Aqueous angiography is a real-time and physiologic AHO imaging technique in model eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2258605772,"Background/Aims Normal or high serum vitamin B-12 levels can sometimes be seen in a B-12 deficient state, and can therefore be misleading. High levels of Methymalonic Acid (MMA) and Homocysteine (HC) have been identified as better indicators of B-12 deficiency than the actual serum B-12 level itself. We evaluated the prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency using appropriate cut-off levels of vitamin B-12, MMA and HC, and determined the relationship between serum levels of vitamin B-12, MMA and HC in cancer. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using a consecutive case series of 316 cancer patients first seen at Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA) at Midwestern Regional Medical Center between April 2014 and June 2014. All patients were evaluated at baseline for vitamin B-12 (pg/mL), MMA (nmol/L) and HC (μmol/L) levels. In accordance with previously published research, the following cut-offs were used to define vitamin B-12 deficiency: <300 pg/mL for vitamin B-12, >260 nmol/L for MMA and >12 μmol/L for HC. The relationship between B-12, MMA and HC was evaluated using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient and cross-tabulation analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were estimated using the non-parametric method to further evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of vitamin B-12 using Fedosov quotient as the ""gold standard"". Results Mean age at presentation was 52.5 years. 134 (42.4%) patients were males while 182 (57.6%) were females. Median vitamin B-12, MMA and HC levels were 582.5 pg/mL, 146.5 nmol/L and 8.4 μmol/L respectively. Of 316 patients, 28 (8.9%) were vitamin B-12 deficient based on vitamin B-12 (<300pg/mL), 34 (10.8%) were deficient based on MMA (>260 nmol/L) while 55 (17.4%) were deficient based on HC (>12 μmol/L). Correlation analysis revealed a significant weak negative correlation between vitamin B-12 and MMA (rho = -0.22) as well as B-12 and HC (rho = -0.35). ROC curves suggested MMA to have the best discriminatory power in predicting B-12 deficiency. Conclusion Vitamin B-12 is poorly correlated with MMA and HC in cancer. Using serum vitamin B-12 alone to evaluate B-12 status in cancer may fail to identify those with functional deficiency. A thorough clinical assessment is important to identify patients that may have risk factors and/or symptoms suggestive of deficiency. These patients should have additional testing of MMA and HC regardless of their B-12 levels."

We herein evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy for the primary tumor in prostate cancer with metastasis. Materials/Methods The study cohort included 140 men with metastatic prostate cancer at initial diagnosis. Metastatic sites were divided into 4 groups as follows: solitary bone, 2–4 bones, ≥5 bones, and visceral organs. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients treated with (prostate radiotherapy [PRT] group) or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor. Results Patients in PRT group presented with a statistically significantly younger age (p = .02), whereas other characteristics showed no significant difference. Overall survival (OS) and biochemical failure-free survival (BCFFS) were improved in PRT patients (3-year OS: 69% vs. 43%, p = 0.004; 3-year BCFFS: 52% vs. 16%, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis identified PRT as a significant predictor of both OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, p = 0.015). None of the 38 PRT patients experienced severe (grade ≥3) genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity. Conclusions Our data suggest that radiotherapy to the primary tumor was associated with improved OS and BCFFS in metastatic prostate cancer. The results of this study warrant prospective controlled clinical trials of this approach in stage IV prostate cancer patients with limited extent of bone metastasis and good performance status."
https://openalex.org/W2272141144,"Objectives To explore the association between postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) and postpartum depression (PPD), taking into account the role of postpartum anaemia, delivery experience and psychiatric history. Methods A nested cohort study (n = 446), based on two population-based cohorts in Uppsala, Sweden. Exposed individuals were defined as having a bleeding of ≥1000ml (n = 196) at delivery, and non-exposed individuals as having bleeding of <650ml (n = 250). Logistic regression models with PPD symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) score ≥ 12) as the outcome variable and PPH, anaemia, experience of delivery, mood during pregnancy and other confounders as exposure variables were undertaken. Path analysis using Structural Equation Modeling was also conducted. Results There was no association between PPH and PPD symptoms. A positive association was shown between anaemia at discharge from the maternity ward and the development of PPD symptoms, even after controlling for plausible confounders (OR = 2.29, 95%CI = 1.15–4.58). Path analysis revealed significant roles for anaemia at discharge, negative self-reported delivery experience, depressed mood during pregnancy and postpartum stressors in increasing the risk for PPD. Conclusion This study proposes important roles for postpartum anaemia, negative experience of delivery and mood during pregnancy in explaining the development of depressive symptoms after PPH."

The aim of this study was to investigate testing and its associated factors among HIV negative FSWs.Using facility based sampling, 1005 FSWs were recruited in 14 cities of Iran in 2010. Biological and survey data were collected through dried blood spot testing and standardized risk assessment questionnaire, respectively. In this paper, the prevalence of HIV testing and its correlates were explored among 714 HIV-negative FSWs using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models.Overall 65.4% had not tested in the past year. Only 27.5% had tested in the past year and received their results. FSWs who perceived themselves at risk of HIV (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 8.35, 95% CI: 1.46, 47.6), had received free condom during past year (AOR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.67, 9.14), started sex work at an older age (AOR18-24 = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.14, 7.0; AOR >24 = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.11, 6.84), and knew an HIV testing site (AOR = 5.67, 95% CI: 2.60, 12.4) had a significantly higher chance of having a recent HIV test result.Less than one third of FSWs in Iran knew their recent HIV status. Interventions to help FSWs evaluate their potential risk for HIV and integrate HIV testing services in condom distribution programs, could be viable strategies in increasing HIV testing uptake among FSWs. Health policy makers should also try to de-stigmatize HIV testing, identify the barriers to HIV testing, and make HIV testing sites more visible to FSWs."
https://openalex.org/W2265896724,"Paleoarchean rocks from the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia provide a variety of clues to the existence of early life on Earth, such as stromatolites, putative microfossils and geochemical signatures of microbial activity. However, some of these features have also been explained by non-biological processes. Further lines of evidence are therefore required to convincingly argue for the presence of microbial life. Here we describe a new type of microbial mat facies from the 3.4 Ga Strelley Pool Formation, which directly overlies well known stromatolitic carbonates from the same formation. This microbial mat facies consists of laminated, very fine-grained black cherts with discontinuous white quartz layers and lenses, and contains small domical stromatolites and wind-blown crescentic ripples. Light- and cathodoluminescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and time of flight—secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) reveal a spatial association of carbonates, organic material, and highly abundant framboidal pyrite within the black cherts. Nano secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) confirmed the presence of distinct spheroidal carbonate bodies up to several tens of μm that are surrounded by organic material and pyrite. These aggregates are interpreted as biogenic. Comparison with Phanerozoic analogues indicates that the facies represents microbial mats formed in a shallow marine environment. Carbonate precipitation and silicification by hydrothermal fluids occurred during sedimentation and earliest diagenesis. The deciphered environment, as well as the δ13C signature of bulk organic matter (-35.3‰), are in accord with the presence of photoautotrophs. At the same time, highly abundant framboidal pyrite exhibits a sulfur isotopic signature (δ34S = +3.05‰; Δ33S = 0.268‰; and Δ36S = -0.282‰) that is consistent with microbial sulfate reduction. Taken together, our results strongly support a microbial mat origin of the black chert facies, thus providing another line of evidence for life in the 3.4 Ga Strelley Pool Formation."
https://openalex.org/W2255135034,"Knowledge of the airborne nature of respiratory disease transmission owes much to the pioneering experiments of Wells and Riley over half a century ago. However, the mechanical, physiological, and immunopathological processes which drive the production of infectious aerosols by a diseased host remain poorly understood. Similarly, very little is known about the specific physiological, metabolic and morphological adaptations which enable pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to exit the infected host, survive exposure to the external environment during airborne carriage, and adopt a form that is able to enter the respiratory tract of a new host, avoiding innate immune and physical defenses to establish a nascent infection. As a first step towards addressing these fundamental knowledge gaps which are central to any efforts to interrupt disease transmission, we developed and characterized a small personal clean room comprising an array of sampling devices which enable isolation and representative sampling of airborne particles and organic matter from tuberculosis (TB) patients. The complete unit, termed the Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC), is instrumented to provide real-time information about the particulate output of a single patient, and to capture samples via a suite of particulate impingers, impactors and filters. Applying the RASC in a clinical setting, we demonstrate that a combination of molecular and microbiological assays, as well as imaging by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, can be applied to investigate the identity, viability, and morphology of isolated aerosolized particles. Importantly, from a preliminary panel of active TB patients, we observed the real-time production of large numbers of airborne particles including Mtb, as confirmed by microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. Moreover, direct imaging of captured samples revealed the presence of multiple rod-like Mtb organisms whose physical dimensions suggested the capacity for travel deep into the alveolar spaces of the human lung."

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D and examine the correlations between these mutations and the clinical and biochemical characteristics in Korean patients with APA.We performed targeted gene sequencing in 66 patients with APA to detect somatic mutations in these genes.Somatic KCNJ5 mutations were found in 47 (71.2%) of the 66 patients with APA (31 cases of p.G151R and 16 cases of p.L168R); these two mutations were mutually exclusive. Somatic mutations in the ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D genes were not observed. Somatic KCNJ5 mutations were more prevalent in female patients (66% versus 36.8%, respectively; P = 0.030). Moreover, patients with KCNJ5 mutations comprised a significantly higher proportion of patients younger than 35 years of age (19.1% versus 0%, respectively; P = 0.040). There were no significant differences in pre-operative blood pressure, plasma aldosterone, serum potassium, lateralization index, and adenoma size according to mutational status. Patients with KCNJ5 mutations were less likely to need antihypertensive medications after adrenalectomy compared with those without mutation (36.2% versus 63.2%; P = 0.045).The present study demonstrated the high prevalence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations in Korean patients with APA. Carriers of somatic KCNJ5 mutations were more likely to be female. Early diagnosis and better therapeutic outcomes were associated with somatic KCNJ5 mutations in APA."

The present study examined the anti-inflammation and anti-fibrosis effect of Tangshen Formula (TSF), a traditional Chinese medicine, on DN.Protective role of TSF in DN was examined in a rat model of type 2 DN that was established by high-fat diet-fed and low-dose-streptozotocin injection. TSF was suspended in 0.5% CMC-Na solution and delivered by oral gavage at a dosage of 1.67g/Kg body weight/day. The therapeutic effects and mechanisms of TSF on diabetic kidney injury were examined.We found that TSF treatment for 20 weeks attenuated DN by significantly inhibiting urinary excretion of albumin and renal histological injuries. These beneficial effects were associated with an inactivation of NF-κB signaling, thereby blocking the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα), chemokine (MCP-1), and macrophage infiltration in the TSF-treated rats with type 2 DN. In addition, TSF treatment also inactivated TGF-β/Smad3 signaling and therefore suppressed renal fibrosis including expressions of fibronectin, collagen I, and collagen IV. Further studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of TSF on TGF-β/Smad3 and NF-κB signaling in DN was associated with inhibition of Smurf2-dependent ubiquitin degradation of Smad7.The present study reveals that TSF has therapeutic potential for type 2 DN in rats. Blockade of NF-κB-driven renal inflammation and TGF-β/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis by preventing the Smurf2-mediated Smad7 degradation pathway may be mechanisms through which TSF inhibits type 2 DN."
https://openalex.org/W2272509640,"Background Accurate local prevalence of microbial diseases and microbial resistance data are vital for optimal treatment of patients. However, there are few reports of these data from developing countries, especially from sub-Saharan Africa. The status of Aga Khan University Hospital Nairobi as an internationally accredited hospital and a laboratory with an electronic medical record system has made it possible to analyze local prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility data and compare it with other published data. Methods We have analyzed the spectrum of microbial agents and resistance patterns seen at a 300 bed tertiary private teaching hospital in Kenya using microbial identity and susceptibility data captured in hospital and laboratory electronic records between 2010 and 2014. Results For blood isolates, we used culture collection within the first three days of hospitalization as a surrogate for community onset, and within that group, Escherichia coli was the most common, followed by Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, Candida spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common hospital onset causes of bloodstream infection. Antimicrobial resistance rates for the most commonly isolated Gram negative organisms was higher than many recent reports from Europe and North America. In contrast, Gram positive resistance rates were quite low, with 94% of S. aureus being susceptible to oxacillin and only rare isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Conclusions The current report demonstrates high rates of antimicrobial resistance in Gram negative organisms, even in outpatients with urinary tract infections. On the other hand, rates of resistance in Gram positive organisms, notably S. aureus, are remarkably low. A better understanding of the reasons for these trends may contribute to ongoing efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance globally."
https://openalex.org/W2258291112,"The aim of the study was to determine the potential of community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) methodology as an assay for characterization of the metabolic diversity of wastewater samples and to link the metabolic diversity patterns to efficiency of select onsite biological wastewater facilities. Metabolic fingerprints obtained from the selected samples were used to understand functional diversity implied by the carbon substrate shifts. Three different biological facilities of onsite wastewater treatment were evaluated: fixed bed reactor (technology A), trickling filter/biofilter system (technology B), and aerated filter system (the fluidized bed reactor, technology C). High similarities of the microbial community functional structures were found among the samples from the three onsite wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as shown by the diversity indices. Principal components analysis (PCA) showed that the diversity and CLPPs of microbial communities depended on the working efficiency of the wastewater treatment technologies. This study provided an overall picture of microbial community functional structures of investigated samples in WWTPs and discerned the linkages between microbial communities and technologies of onsite WWTPs used. The results obtained confirmed that metabolic profiles could be used to monitor treatment processes as valuable biological indicators of onsite wastewater treatment technologies efficiency. This is the first step toward understanding relations of technology types with microbial community patterns in raw and treated wastewaters."
https://openalex.org/W2270836383,"West Nile virus is an arthropod-borne zoonosis transmitted by a large number of mosquito species, and birds play a key role as reservoir of the virus. Its distribution is largely widespread over Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe. Since 1978, it has frequently been reported in Madagascar. Studies described a high seroprevalence level of the virus in humans in different areas of the island and a human fatal case of WNV infection was reported in 2011. Despite these reports, the epidemiology of WNV in Madagascar, in particular, viral circulation remains unclear. To explore the transmission of WNV in two rural human populations of Madagascar, we investigated local mosquitoes and poultry for evidence of current infections, and determined seroprevalence of candidate sentinel species among the local poultry. These 2 areas are close to lakes where domestic birds, migratory wild birds and humans coexist. Serological analysis revealed WNV antibodies in domestic birds (duck, chicken, goose, turkey and guinea fowl) sampled in both districts (Antsalova 29.4% and Mitsinjo 16.7%). West Nile virus nucleic acid was detected in one chicken and in 8 pools of mosquitoes including 2 mosquito species (Aedeomyia madagascarica and Anopheles pauliani) that have not been previously described as candidate vectors for WNV. Molecular analysis of WNV isolates showed that all viruses detected were part of the lineage 2 that is mainly distributed in Africa, and were most closely matched by the previous Malagasy strains isolated in 1988. Our study showed that WNV circulates in Madagascar amongst domestic birds and mosquitoes, and highlights the utility of poultry as a surveillance tool to detect WNV transmission in a peri-domestic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2265549847,"Microbial life in soil is perceived as one of the most interesting ecological systems, with microbial communities exhibiting remarkable adaptability to vast dynamic environmental conditions. At the same time, it is a notoriously challenging system to understand due to its complexity including physical, chemical, and biological factors in synchrony. This study presents a spatially-resolved model of microbial dynamics on idealised rough soil surfaces represented as patches with different (roughness) properties that preserve the salient hydration physics of real surfaces. Cell level microbial interactions are considered within an individual-based formulation including dispersion and various forms of trophic dependencies (competition, mutualism). The model provides new insights into mechanisms affecting microbial community dynamics and gives rise to spontaneous formation of microbial community spatial patterns. The framework is capable of representing many interacting species and provides diversity metrics reflecting surface conditions and their evolution over time. A key feature of the model is its spatial scalability that permits representation of microbial processes from cell-level (micro-metric scales) to soil representative volumes at sub-metre scales. Several illustrative examples of microbial trophic interactions and population dynamics highlight the potential of the proposed modelling framework to quantitatively study soil microbial processes. The model is highly applicable in a wide range spanning from quantifying spatial organisation of multiple species under various hydration conditions to predicting microbial diversity residing in different soils."
https://openalex.org/W2418793062,"Background In Thailand, the combined generic anti-retroviral drug stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (d4T/3TC/NVP) has been used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals since 2001. Due to relatively frequent adverse effects, d4T gradually has been replaced with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although the frequency of adverse drug effects with TDF is lower than that with d4T, TDF is known to induce kidney dysfunction, especially in the proximal tubules. It has been reported that renal tubular transporters, including members of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) protein family, are implicated in tenofovir extrusion and may, therefore, confer susceptibility to TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD). We have explored the association between KTD and polymorphisms in genes that encode adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC)-type MDRs. Methods HIV-infected patients receiving TDF-containing antiretroviral regimens for at least one year were enrolled in the study. The levels of beta2-microglobulin in urine and creatinine (Cr) were measured. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms, ABCC2 C-24T (rs717620), ABCC2 G1429A (rs2273697), and ABCC4 T4976C (rs1059751), were analyzed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Results A total of 273 HIV-infected patients were recruited. The median number of years of TDF treatment was 5.04 with interquartile range (IQR) of 3.9–6.7. Despite the length of treatment with TDF, 98.5% patients maintained an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >60 mL/min as calculated by the CKD-EPI formula. Fifty-four patients (19.8%) showed beta2-microglobulinuria (median 2636 μg/g Cr with IQR of 1519–13197 μg/g Cr). The allele frequency of ABCC4 T4976C among those 54 patients was 0.602, compared to 0.475 among the 219 remaining patients (p = 0.018). Conclusions Approximately 20% of HIV-infected patients receiving TDF showed beta2-microglobulinuria. The C allele at position 4976 of the ABCC4 gene was associated with beta2-microglobulinuria in this population. This polymorphism may help to identify patients at greater risk for developing TDF-associated KTD."
https://openalex.org/W2254323678,"While Huntington's disease (HD) is classified as a neurological disorder, HD patients exhibit a high incidence of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure and death. In this study, we sought to better understand the cardiovascular phenotype of HD using the BACHD mouse model. The age-related decline in cardiovascular function was assessed by echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, histological and microarray analysis. We found that structural and functional differences between WT and BACHD hearts start at 3 months of age and continue throughout life. The aged BACHD mice develop cardiac fibrosis and ultimately apoptosis. The BACHD mice exhibited adaptive physiological changes to chronic isoproterenol treatment; however, the medication exacerbated fibrotic lesions in the heart. Gene expression analysis indicated a strong tilt toward apoptosis in the young mutant heart as well as changes in genes involved in cellular metabolism and proliferation. With age, the number of genes with altered expression increased with the large changes occurring in the cardiovascular disease, cellular metabolism, and cellular transport clusters. The BACHD model of HD exhibits a number of changes in cardiovascular function that start early in the disease progress and may provide an explanation for the higher cardiovascular risk in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2268141331,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neuron function for which there is no effective treatment. One of the main difficulties in developing new therapies lies on the multiple events that contribute to motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Several pathological mechanisms have been identified as underlying events of the disease process, including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, altered axonal transport, proteasome dysfunction, synaptic deficits, glial cell contribution, and disrupted clearance of misfolded proteins. Our approach in this study was based on a holistic vision of these mechanisms and the use of computational tools to identify polypharmacology for targeting multiple etiopathogenic pathways. By using a repositioning analysis based on systems biology approach (TPMS technology), we identified and validated the neuroprotective potential of two new drug combinations: Aliretinoin and Pranlukast, and Aliretinoin and Mefloquine. In addition, we estimated their molecular mechanisms of action in silico and validated some of these results in a well-established in vitro model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on cultured spinal cord slices. The results verified that Aliretinoin and Pranlukast, and Aliretinoin and Mefloquine promote neuroprotection of motor neurons and reduce microgliosis."
https://openalex.org/W2269050662,"Human Bocavirus subtype 1 (HBoV1) is associated with respiratory diseases and may contribute to chronic lung diseases by persisting in the infected host. Here the question was addressed if HBoV infections could contribute to fibrogenesis processes as suggested by previously published clinical observations. Cytokine profiles induced by HBoV infection in CuFi-8 air-liquid interphase cell cultures and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 20 HBoV-positive and 12 HBoV-negative patients were analysed by semi-quantitative Western spot blot analyses. Although lots of cytokines were regulated independently of HBoV status, several cytokines associated with lung fibrosis and tumour development, e.g., EGF, VEGF, TARC (CCL17), TNF-α, TNF-β, TIMP-1, were clearly upregulated in the HBoV-positive cohort. These findings suggest that the development of lung fibrosis might be triggered by HBoV induced cytokine expression."
https://openalex.org/W2254049571,"Evidence suggests that the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in both voluntary, goal-directed movements and in postural control. Trunk muscles are involved in both tasks, however, the extent to which M1 controls these muscles in trunk flexion/extension (voluntary movement) and in rapid shoulder flexion (postural control) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate this question by examining excitability of corticospinal inputs to trunk muscles during voluntary and postural tasks. Twenty healthy adults participated. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered to the M1 to examine motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the trunk muscles (erector spinae (ES) and rectus abdominis (RA)) during dynamic shoulder flexion (DSF), static shoulder flexion (SSF), and static trunk extension (STE). The level of background muscle activity in the ES muscles was matched across tasks. MEP amplitudes in ES were significantly larger in DSF than in SSF or in STE; however, this was not observed for RA. Further, there were no differences in levels of muscle activity in RA between tasks. Our findings reveal that corticospinal excitability of the ES muscles appears greater during dynamic anticipatory posture-related adjustments than during static tasks requiring postural (SSF) and goal-directed voluntary (STE) activity. These results suggest that task-oriented rehabilitation of trunk muscles should be considered for optimal transfer of therapeutic effect to function."
https://openalex.org/W2306836351,"A naturally occurring bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), is known to alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress at the cellular level. However, the detailed action mechanisms of UDCA in atherosclerosis are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated whether UDCA exerts anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting ER stress and “receptor for advanced glycation endproduct” (RAGE) signaling. UDCA markedly reduced ER stress, RAGE expression, and pro-inflammatory responses [including NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production] induced in endothelial cells (ECs) by high glucose (HG). In particular, UDCA inhibited HG-induced ROS production by increasing the Nrf2 level. In macrophages, UDCA also blocked HG-induced RAGE and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibited foam cell formation via upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. In the diabetic mouse model, UDCA inhibited atheromatous plaque formation by decreasing ER stress, and the levels of RAGE and adhesion molecules. In conclusion, UDCA exerts an anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting both ER stress and RAGE signaling. Our work implicates UDCA as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of diabetic atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4245538551,"After an extensive vaccination policy, Japanese encephalitis (JE) was nearly eliminated since the mid-1980s in South Korea. Vaccination in children shifted the affected age of JE patients from children to adults. However, an abrupt increase in JE cases occurred in 2010, and this trend has continued. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to the JE virus (JEV) among high-risk age groups (≥40 years) in South Korea. A plaque reduction neutralization test was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to JEV in 945 subjects within four age groups (30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years) in 10 provinces. Of the 945 enrolled subjects, 927 (98.1%) exhibited antibodies against JEV. No significant differences were found in the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies according to sex, age, or occupation. However, there were significant differences in the plaque reduction rate according to age and occupation; oldest age group had a higher reduction rate, and subjects who were employed in agriculture or forestry also had a higher value than the other occupations. We also found that three provinces (Gangwon, Jeonnam, and Gyeongnam) had a relatively lower plaque reduction rate than the other locations. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were conducted to determine recent viral infections and 12 (1.3%) subjects were found to have been recently infected by the virus [corrected]. In conclusion, the present study clearly indicated that the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies has been maintained at very high levels among adult age groups owing to vaccination or natural infections, or both. In the future, serosurveillance should be conducted periodically using more representative samples to better understand the population-level immunity to JE in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2260822484,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the MAPK kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, is activated by various stimuli, which include oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calcium influx, DNA damage-inducing agents and receptor-mediated signaling through tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). Inspiration of a high concentration of oxygen is a palliative therapy which counteracts hypoxemia caused by acute lung injury (ALI)-induced pulmonary edema. However, animal experiments so far have shown that hyperoxia itself could exacerbate ALI through reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our previous data indicates that ASK1 plays a pivotal role in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI). However, it is unclear whether or not deletion of ASK1 in vivo protects against HALI. In this study, we investigated whether ASK1 deletion would lead to attenuation of HALI. Our results show that ASK1 deletion in vivo significantly suppresses hyperoxia-induced elevation of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1β and TNF-α), cell apoptosis in the lung, and recruitment of immune cells. In summary, the results from the study suggest that deletion of ASK1 in mice significantly inhibits hyperoxic lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2258285825,"Collection of mosquitoes and testing for vector-borne viruses is a key surveillance activity that directly influences the vector control efforts of public health agencies, including determining when and where to apply insecticides. Vector control districts in California routinely monitor for three human pathogenic viruses including West Nile virus (WNV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) offers highly sensitive and specific detection of these three viruses in a single multiplex reaction, but this technique requires costly, specialized equipment that is generally only available in centralized public health laboratories. We report the use of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect WNV, WEEV, and SLEV RNA extracted from pooled mosquito samples collected in California, including novel primer sets for specific detection of WEEV and SLEV, targeting the nonstructural protein 4 (nsP4) gene of WEEV and the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SLEV. Our WEEV and SLEV RT-LAMP primers allowed detection of <0.1 PFU/reaction of their respective targets in <30 minutes, and exhibited high specificity without cross reactivity when tested against a panel of alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Furthermore, the SLEV primers do not cross-react with WNV, despite both viruses being closely related members of the Japanese encephalitis virus complex. The SLEV and WEEV primers can also be combined in a single RT-LAMP reaction, with discrimination between amplicons by melt curve analysis. Although RT-qPCR is approximately one order of magnitude more sensitive than RT-LAMP for all three targets, the RT-LAMP technique is less instrumentally intensive than RT-qPCR and provides a more cost-effective method of vector-borne virus surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2270240592,"The cardiotoxic effects of adjuvant cancer treatments (i.e., chemotherapy and radiation treatment) have been well documented, but the effects on peripheral cardiovascular function are still unclear. We hypothesized that cancer survivors i) would have decreased resting endothelial function; and ii) altered muscle deoxygenation response during moderate intensity cycling exercise compared to cancer-free controls. A total of 8 cancer survivors (~70 months post-treatment) and 9 healthy controls completed a brachial artery FMD test, an index of endothelial-dependent dilation, followed by an incremental exercise test up to the ventilatory threshold (VT) on a cycle ergometer during which pulmonary and changes in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived microvascular tissue oxygenation (TOI), total hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]total), and muscle deoxygenation ([HHb] ≈ fractional O2 extraction) were measured. There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, and resting blood pressure between cancer survivors and control participants. Brachial artery FMD was similar between groups (P = 0.98). During exercise at the VT, TOI was similar between groups, but [Hb]total and [HHb] were significantly decreased in cancer survivors compared to controls (P < 0.01) The rate of change for TOI and [HHb] relative to were decreased in cancer survivors compared to controls (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03 respectively). In cancer survivors, a decreased skeletal muscle microvascular function was observed during moderate intensity cycling exercise. These data suggest that adjuvant cancer therapies have an effect on the integrated relationship between O2 extraction, and O2 delivery during exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2259026264,"Clostridium perfringens delta-toxin is a β-pore-forming toxin and a putative pathogenic agent of C. perfringens types B and C. However, the mechanism of cytotoxicity of delta-toxin remains unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of cell death induced by delta-toxin in five cell lines (A549, A431, MDCK, Vero, and Caco-2). All cell lines were susceptible to delta-toxin. The toxin caused rapid ATP depletion and swelling of the cells. Delta-toxin bound and formed oligomers predominantly in plasma membrane lipid rafts. Destruction of the lipid rafts with methyl β-cyclodextrin inhibited delta-toxin-induced cytotoxicity and ATP depletion. Delta-toxin caused the release of carboxyfluorescein from sphingomyelin-cholesterol liposomes and formed oligomers; toxin binding to the liposomes declined with decreasing cholesterol content in the liposomes. Flow cytometric assays with annexin V and propidium iodide revealed that delta-toxin treatment induced an elevation in the population of annexin V-negative and propidium iodide-positive cells. Delta-toxin did not cause the fragmentation of DNA or caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, delta-toxin caused damage to mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c release. In the present study, we demonstrate that delta-toxin produces cytotoxic activity through necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2266305977,"Recent research has found that even preschoolers give more resources to others who have previously given resources to them, but the psychological bases of this reciprocity are unknown. In our study, a puppet distributed resources between herself and a child by taking some from a pile in front of the child or else by giving some from a pile in front of herself. Although the resulting distributions were identical, three- and five-year-olds reciprocated less generously when the puppet had taken rather than given resources. This suggests that children’s judgments about resource distribution are more about the social intentions of the distributor and the social framing of the distributional act than about the amount of resources obtained. In order to rule out that the differences in the children’s reciprocal behavior were merely due to experiencing gains and losses, we conducted a follow-up study. Here, three- and-five year olds won or lost resources in a lottery draw and could then freely give or take resources to/from a puppet, respectively. In this study, they did not respond differently after winning vs. losing resources."
https://openalex.org/W2267118147,"Soil respiration inherently shows strong spatial variability. It is difficult to obtain an accurate characterization of soil respiration with an insufficient number of monitoring points. However, it is expensive and cumbersome to deploy many sensors. To solve this problem, we proposed employing the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) algorithm, using soil temperature as auxiliary information, to study the spatial distribution of soil respiration. The BME algorithm used the soft data (auxiliary information) effectively to improve the estimation accuracy of the spatiotemporal distribution of soil respiration. Based on the functional relationship between soil temperature and soil respiration, the BME algorithm satisfactorily integrated soil temperature data into said spatial distribution. As a means of comparison, we also applied the Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Co-Kriging (Co-OK) methods. The results indicated that the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) and absolute values of bias for both Day 1 and Day 2 were the lowest for the BME method, thus demonstrating its higher estimation accuracy. Further, we compared the performance of the BME algorithm coupled with auxiliary information, namely soil temperature data, and the OK method without auxiliary information in the same study area for 9, 21, and 37 sampled points. The results showed that the RMSEs for the BME algorithm (0.972 and 1.193) were less than those for the OK method (1.146 and 1.539) when the number of sampled points was 9 and 37, respectively. This indicates that the former method using auxiliary information could reduce the required number of sampling points for studying spatial distribution of soil respiration. Thus, the BME algorithm, coupled with soil temperature data, can not only improve the accuracy of soil respiration spatial interpolation but can also reduce the number of sampling points."
https://openalex.org/W2261686091,"Aim The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms of the eNOS gene on the clinical status of patients with normal and high tension glaucoma. Methods 266 Polish Caucasian patients with primary open angle glaucoma were studied. Of the 266, 156 had normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and 110 high tension glaucoma (HTG). DNA material was isolated from peripheral venous blood using commercial kits. Real-time PCR reaction was used to amplify the promoter site of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site T-786C and part of the 7th exon of eNOS, including G894T SNP. Genotypes were determined with TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Results There were no significant differences in frequencies of the allelic variants of both polymorphisms. In G894T SNP, however, the wild GG form was more common in the HTG group. The SNP of the eNOS gene did not significantly influence the progression rate in either of the groups studied. There were no differences in variants of the eNOS gene regarding the necessity for and success of surgery and the progression of the disease. In the NTG group, no statistical correlation was observed between G894T, T786C polymorphism variants, and risk factors such as optic disc haemorrhages, optic disc notches, and peripapillary atrophy. Mean diastolic and systolic pressure during the day and night were lowest in NTG patients with the CC variant of the T786C polymorphism. No statistical correlation was observed between the G894T and T786C polymorphisms and capillaroscopic examination results. Conclusions Genotype frequencies are similar for both the eNOS G894T and T-786C polymorphisms in NTG and HTG patients. These polymorphisms do not correlate with risk factors and do not influence the state of the capillary system in NTG patients. Systolic blood pressure is lower in NTG patients with mutated alleles of both polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W2417769356,"A potent angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, azilsartan, has been reported to reduce blood pressure more effectively than candesartan. Interestingly, azilsartan can also restore the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. We hypothesized that azilsartan could also improve salt sensitivity; thus, we examined the effect of azilsartan on sodium handling in renal tubules. Subtotal nephrectomized C57BL/6 mice received azilsartan (1.0 mg/kg/day), candesartan (0.3 mg/kg/day), or vehicle via the oral route in conjunction with a normal- (0.3%) or high-salt (8.0%) diet. Two weeks later, the azilsartan group showed significantly lower blood pressure during the light period than the candesartan and vehicle groups (azilsartan: 103.1 ± 1.0; candesartan: 111.7 ± 2.7; vehicle: 125.5 ± 2.5 mmHg; P < 0.05; azilsartan or candesartan vs. vehicle). The azilsartan group also showed higher urinary fractional excretion of sodium during the dark period than the candesartan and vehicle groups (azilsartan: 21.37 ± 3.69%; candesartan: 14.17 ± 1.42%; vehicle: 13.85 ± 5.30%; P < 0.05 azilsartan vs. candesartan or vehicle). A pressure-natriuresis curve demonstrated that azilsartan treatment restored salt sensitivity. Immunofluorescence and western blotting showed lower levels of Na+-H+ exchanger-3 (NHE3) protein (the major sodium transporter in renal proximal tubules) in the azilsartan group, but not in the candesartan or vehicle groups. However, azilsartan did not affect NHE3 transcription levels. Interestingly, we did not observe increased expression of downstream sodium transporters, which would have compensated for the increased flow of sodium and water due to non-absorption by NHE3. We also confirmed the mechanism stated above using cultured opossum kidney proximal tubular cells. Results revealed that a proteasomal inhibitor (but not a lysosomal inhibitor) blocked the azilsartan-induced decrease in NHE3 protein expression, suggesting that azilsartan increases NHE3 ubiquitination. In conclusion, azilsartan (but not candesartan) improved salt sensitivity possibly by decreasing NHE3 expression via ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2262344380,"Ethanolamine kinase (EK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of ethanolamine, the first step in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Human EK exists as EK1, EK2α and EK2β isoforms, encoded by two separate genes, named ek1 and ek2. EK activity is stimulated by carcinogens and oncogenes, suggesting the involvement of EK in carcinogenesis. Currently, little is known about EK transcriptional regulation by endogenous or exogenous signals, and the ek gene promoter has never been studied.In this report, we mapped the important regulatory regions in the human ek1 promoter. 5' deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified a Sp site at position (-40/-31) that was essential for the basal transcription of this gene. Treatment of HCT116 cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, significantly upregulated the ek1 promoter activity through the Sp(-40/-31) site and increased the endogenous expression of ek1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that TSA increased the binding of Sp1, Sp3 and RNA polymerase II to the ek1 promoter in HCT116 cells. The effect of TSA on ek1 promoter activity was cell-line specific as TSA treatment did not affect ek1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells.In conclusion, we showed that Sp1 and Sp3 are not only essential for the basal transcription of the ek1 gene, their accessibility to the target site on the ek1 promoter is regulated by histone protein modification in a cell line dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2264932187,"Thermal pollution from industrial processes can have negative impacts on the spawning and development of cold-water fish. Point sources of thermal effluent may need to be managed to avoid affecting discrete populations. Correspondingly, we examined fine-scale ecological and genetic population structure of two whitefish species (Coregonus clupeaformis and Prosopium cylindraceum) on Lake Huron, Canada, in the immediate vicinity of thermal effluent from nuclear power generation. Niche metrics using δ13C and δ15N stable isotopes showed high levels of overlap (48.6 to 94.5%) in resource use by adult fish captured in areas affected by thermal effluent compared to nearby reference locations. Isotopic niche size, a metric of resource use diversity, was 1.3- to 2.8-fold higher than reference values in some thermally affected areas, indicative of fish mixing. Microsatellite analyses of genetic population structure (Fst, STRUCTURE and DAPC) indicated that fish captured at all locations in the vicinity of the power plant were part of a larger population extending beyond the study area. In concert, ecological and genetic markers do not support the presence of an evolutionarily significant unit in the vicinity of the power plant. Thus, future research should focus on the potential impacts of thermal emissions on development and recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2269409135,"The CKD-associated decline in soluble α-Klotho levels is considered detrimental. Some in vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that anti-oxidant therapy can upregulate the expression of α-Klotho in the kidney. We examined the effect of anti-oxidant therapy on α-Klotho concentrations in a clinical cohort with mild tot moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD). We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective randomized trial involving 62 patients with mild to moderate CKD (the ATIC study), all using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for 12 months. On top of that, the intervention group received anti-oxidative therapy consisting of the combination of pravastatin (40 mg/d) and vitamin E (α-tocopherol acetate, 300 mg/d) while the placebo was not treated with anti-oxidants. α-Klotho concentrations were measured at baseline and after 12 months of anti-oxidant therapy. Data were analysed using T-tests and Generalized Estimating Equations, adjusting for potential confounders such as vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast-growth-factor 23 (FGF23) and eGFR. The cohort existed of 62 patients with an eGFR (MDRD) of 35 ± 14 ml/min/1.72 m2, 34 were male and mean age was 53.0 ± 12.5 years old. Anti-oxidative therapy did successfully reduce oxLDL and LDL concentrations (P <0.001). α-Klotho concentrations did not change in patients receiving either anti-oxidative therapy (476.9 ± 124.3 to 492.7 ± 126.3 pg/mL, P = 0.23) nor in those receiving placebo 483.2 ± 142.5 to 489.6 ± 120.3 pg/mL, P = 0.62). Changes in α-Klotho concentrations were not different between both groups (p = 0.62). No evidence was found that anti-oxidative therapy affected α-Klotho concentrations in patients with mild-moderate CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2269959463,"Cross-sectional studies show a strong association between chronic kidney disease and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension, but the longitudinal association of the rate of kidney function decline with the risk of resistant hypertension is unknown.The population-based Three-City included 8,695 participants older than 65 years, 4265 of them treated for hypertension. We estimated the odds ratios (OR) of new-onset apparent treatment-resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite use of 3 antihypertensive drug classes or ≥ 4 classes regardless of blood pressure, associated with the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level and its rate of decline over 4 years, compared with both controlled hypertension and uncontrolled nonresistant hypertension with ≤ 2 drugs. GFR was estimated with three different equations.Baseline prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension and of controlled and uncontrolled nonresistant hypertension, were 6.5%, 62.3% and 31.2%, respectively. During follow-up, 162 participants developed apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. Mean eGFR decline with the MDRD equation was 1.5±2.9 mL/min/1.73 m² per year: 27.7% of the participants had an eGFR ≥3 and 10.1% ≥ 5 mL/min/1.73 m² per year. After adjusting for age, sex, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular history, the ORs for new-onset apparent treatment-resistant hypertension associated with a mean eGFR level, per 15 mL/min/1.73 m² drop, were 1.23 [95% confidence interval 0.91-1.64] compared to controlled hypertension and 1.10 [0.83-1.45] compared to uncontrolled nonresistant hypertension; ORs associated with a decline rate ≥ 3 mL/min/1.73 m² per year were 1.89 [1.09-3.29] and 1.99 [1.19-3.35], respectively. Similar results were obtained when we estimated GFR with the CKDEPI and the BIS1 equations. ORs tended to be higher for an eGFR decline rate ≥ 5 mL/min/1.73 m² per year.The speed of kidney function decline is associated more strongly than kidney function itself with the risk of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension in the elderly."

https://openalex.org/W2270706965,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has the ability to enter many different hosts and cell types by several strategies. This highly prevalent alphaherpesvirus can enter target cells using different receptors and different pathways: fusion at a neutral pH, low-pH-dependent and low-pH-independent endocytosis. Several cell receptors for viral entry have been described, but several observations suggest that more receptors for HSV-1 might exist. In this work, we propose a novel role for the proteolipid protein (PLP) in HSV-1 entry into the human oligodendrocytic cell line HOG. Cells transfected with PLP-EGFP showed an increase in susceptibility to HSV-1. Furthermore, the infection of HOG and HOG-PLP transfected cells with the R120vGF virus–unable to replicate in ICP4-defficient cells- showed an increase in viral signal in HOG-PLP, suggesting a PLP involvement in viral entry. In addition, a mouse monoclonal antibody against PLP drastically inhibited HSV-1 entry into HOG cells. PLP and virions colocalized in confocal immunofluorescence images, and in electron microscopy images, which suggest that PLP acts at the site of entry into HOG cells. Taken together these results suggest that PLP may be involved in HSV-1 entry in human oligodendrocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2267442544,"Muscle activities during the sit-to-stand motion (STS) are characterized by coordinated movements between hip extensors and knee extensors. However, previous reports regarding the STS and lower extremity muscle activities have focused on some quantitative assessment, but little qualitative research. This study aimed to examine the muscle activities of the lower extremity both quantitatively and qualitatively.Study participants included 13 patients with knee osteoarthritis (knee OA) and 11 age-matched asymptomatic controls. The task was STS from a chair with a height-adjustable seat. EMG activities were acquired using surface electromyogram. The root mean square signals normalized as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction values (RMS%MVC) and the mean power frequency (MPF) were calculated.During STS, knee OA patients had increased RMS%MVC of the vastus medialis and raised MPF of the rectus femoris before buttocks-off.These findings suggest that STS of knee OA patients not only increased relative muscle activity of the vastus medialis, but also enlisted the rectus femoris in knee extension to improve muscle contraction force by activating more type II fibers to accomplish buttocks-off."
https://openalex.org/W2268151388,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to identify spinal pathoanatomy in people with persistent low back pain. However, the clinical relevance of spinal degenerative MRI findings remains uncertain. Although multiple MRI findings are almost always present at the same time, research into the association with clinical outcomes (such as pain) has predominantly focused on individual MRI findings. This study aimed to: (i) investigate how multiple MRI lumbar spine findings cluster together within two different samples of patients with low back pain, (ii) classify these clusters into hypothetical pathways of degeneration based on scientific knowledge of disco-vertebral degeneration, and (iii) compare these clusters and degenerative pathways between samples.We performed a secondary cross-sectional analysis on two dissimilar MRI samples collected in a hospital department: (1) data from the spinal MRI reports of 4,162 low back pain patients and (2) data from an MRI research protocol of 631 low back pain patients. Latent Class Analysis was used in both samples to cluster MRI findings from lumbar motion segments. Using content analysis, each cluster was then categorised into hypothetical pathways of degeneration.Six clusters of MRI findings were identified in each of the two samples. The content of the clusters in the two samples displayed some differences but had the same overall pattern of MRI findings. Although the hypothetical degenerative pathways identified in the two samples were not identical, the overall pattern of increasing degeneration within the pathways was the same.It was expected that different clusters could emerge from different samples, however, when organised into hypothetical pathways of degeneration, the overall pattern of increasing degeneration was similar and biologically plausible. This evidence of reproducibility suggests that Latent Class Analysis may provide a new approach to investigating the relationship between MRI findings and clinically important characteristics such as pain and activity limitation."
