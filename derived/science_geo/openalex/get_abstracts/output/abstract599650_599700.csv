https://openalex.org/W2770331207,"Fibrosis is a common pathology in cardiovascular disease. In the heart, fibrosis causes mechanical and electrical dysfunction and in the kidney, it predicts the onset of renal failure. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles. We hypothesized that downstream effectors of TGFβ1 in fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity. Here we show, using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, that upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFβ1 exposure and required for its pro-fibrotic effect. IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il-11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 protects against disease. Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These results reveal a central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2770422854,"None of the approximately 750,000 known asteroids and comets in the Solar System is thought to have originated outside it, despite models of the formation of planetary systems suggesting that orbital migration of giant planets ejects a large fraction of the original planetesimals into interstellar space. The high predicted number density of icy interstellar objects (2.4 × 10-4 per cubic astronomical unit) suggests that some should have been detected, yet hitherto none has been seen. Many decades of asteroid and comet characterization have yielded formation models that explain the mass distribution, chemical abundances and planetary configuration of the Solar System today, but there has been no way of telling whether the Solar System is typical of planetary systems. Here we report observations and analysis of the object 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua) that demonstrate its extrasolar trajectory, and that thus enable comparisons to be made between material from another planetary system and from our own. Our observations during the brief visit by the object to the inner Solar System reveal it to be asteroidal, with no hint of cometary activity despite an approach within 0.25 astronomical units of the Sun. Spectroscopic measurements show that the surface of the object is spectrally red, consistent with comets or organic-rich asteroids that reside within the Solar System. Light-curve observations indicate that the object has an extremely oblong shape, with a length about ten times its width, and a mean radius of about 102 metres assuming an albedo of 0.04. No known objects in the Solar System have such extreme dimensions. The presence of 'Oumuamua in the Solar System suggests that previous estimates of the number density of interstellar objects, based on the assumption that all such objects were cometary, were pessimistically low. Planned upgrades to contemporary asteroid survey instruments and improved data processing techniques are likely to result in the detection of more interstellar objects in the coming years."
https://openalex.org/W2767121551,"Cosmic-ray muon radiography has been used to non-invasively visualize the voids in the Great Pyramid (Khufu’s Pyramid), revealing a large void situated above the Grand Gallery. The Great Pyramid of Giza holds many secrets. There is no consensus on how it was built and most of its internal structure, besides three chambers, is not known. Kunihiro Morishima and colleagues used cosmic-ray muons, which are weakly deflected and absorbed by stone, as a natural imaging probe to investigate the possibility of hidden chambers. They installed a muon detector—a nuclear emulsion film—in one of the chambers and collected data over several months. They observed a clear increase in the flux of muons for specific positions above the known chambers, which indicates the presence of a previously unknown void. The findings are supported by data from two other detection techniques. This is the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century. The Great Pyramid, or Khufu’s Pyramid, was built on the Giza plateau in Egypt during the fourth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops)1, who reigned from 2509 bc to 2483 bc. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there is no consensus about how it was built2,3. To understand its internal structure better, we imaged the pyramid using muons, which are by-products of cosmic rays that are only partially absorbed by stone4,5,6. The resulting cosmic-ray muon radiography allows us to visualize the known and any unknown voids in the pyramid in a non-invasive way. Here we report the discovery of a large void (with a cross-section similar to that of the Grand Gallery and a minimum length of 30 metres) situated above the Grand Gallery. This constitutes the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the nineteenth century1. The void, named ScanPyramids’ Big Void, was first observed with nuclear emulsion films7,8,9 installed in the Queen’s chamber, then confirmed with scintillator hodoscopes10,11 set up in the same chamber and finally re-confirmed with gas detectors12 outside the pyramid. This large void has therefore been detected with high confidence by three different muon detection technologies and three independent analyses. These results constitute a breakthrough for the understanding of the internal structure of Khufu’s Pyramid. Although there is currently no information about the intended purpose of this void, these findings show how modern particle physics can shed new light on the world’s archaeological heritage."
https://openalex.org/W2770671163,"The vascular barrier that separates blood from tissues is actively regulated by the endothelium and is essential for transport, inflammation, and haemostasis. Haemodynamic shear stress plays a critical role in maintaining endothelial barrier function, but how this occurs remains unknown. Here we use an engineered organotypic model of perfused microvessels to show that activation of the transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 directly regulates vascular barrier function through a non-canonical, transcription-independent signalling mechanism that drives assembly of adherens junctions, and confirm these findings in mouse models. Shear stress triggers DLL4-dependent proteolytic activation of NOTCH1 to expose the transmembrane domain of NOTCH1. This domain mediates establishment of the endothelial barrier; expression of the transmembrane domain of NOTCH1 is sufficient to rescue defects in barrier function induced by knockout of NOTCH1. The transmembrane domain restores barrier function by catalysing the formation of a receptor complex in the plasma membrane consisting of vascular endothelial cadherin, the transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase LAR, and the RAC1 guanidine-exchange factor TRIO. This complex activates RAC1 to drive assembly of adherens junctions and establish barrier function. Canonical transcriptional signalling via Notch is highly conserved in metazoans and is required for many processes in vascular development, including arterial-venous differentiation, angiogenesis and remodelling. We establish the existence of a non-canonical cortical NOTCH1 signalling pathway that regulates vascular barrier function, and thus provide a mechanism by which a single receptor might link transcriptional programs with adhesive and cytoskeletal remodelling."

https://openalex.org/W2765666584,"Autosomal-recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) is caused by mutations in a number of PARK genes, in particular the genes encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin (PARK2, also known as PRKN) and its upstream protein kinase PINK1 (also known as PARK6). PINK1 phosphorylates both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like domain of Parkin on structurally protected Ser65 residues, triggering mitophagy. Here we report a crystal structure of a nanobody-stabilized complex containing Pediculus humanus corporis (Ph)PINK1 bound to ubiquitin in the 'C-terminally retracted' (Ub-CR) conformation. The structure reveals many peculiarities of PINK1, including the architecture of the C-terminal region, and reveals how the N lobe of PINK1 binds ubiquitin via a unique insertion. The flexible Ser65 loop in the Ub-CR conformation contacts the activation segment, facilitating placement of Ser65 in a phosphate-accepting position. The structure also explains how autophosphorylation in the N lobe stabilizes structurally and functionally important insertions, and reveals the molecular basis of AR-JP-causing mutations, some of which disrupt ubiquitin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2770839628,"Bladder cancer is one of the most malignant tumors closely associated with macrophages. Polyporus polysaccharide (PPS) has shown excellent efficacy in treating bladder cancer with minimal side effects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PPS in inhibiting bladder cancer remain unclear. In this study, we used macrophages cultured alone or with T24 human bladder cancer cell culture supernatant as study models. We found that PPS enhanced the activities of IFN-γ-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, as shown by the release of inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS), secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, phagocytosis activity, as well as expression of M1 phenotype indicators, such as CD40, CD284 and CD86. PPS acted upstream in activation cascade of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways by interfering with IκB phosphorylation. In addition, PPS regulated NF-κB (P65) signaling by interfering with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, INOS and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Our results indicate that PPS activates macrophages through TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2768606448,"Background Inappropriate use of multiple medicines (inappropriate polypharmacy) is a major challenge in older people with consequences of increased prevalence and severity of adverse drug reactions and interactions, and reduced medicines adherence. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of consensus amongst key stakeholders in the European Union (EU) in relation to aspects of the management of polypharmacy in older people. Methods Forty-six statements were developed on aspects of healthcare structures, processes and desired outcomes, with consensus defined at ≥ 80% agreement. Panel members were strategists (e.g. directors, leading clinicians and commissioners) from each of the 28 EU member states, with a target recruitment of five per member state. Three Delphi rounds were conducted via email, with panel members being provided with summative results and collated, anonymised comments at the commencement of Rounds 2 and 3. Results Ninety panel members were recruited (64.3% of target), with high participation levels throughout the three Delphi rounds (91.1%, 83.3%, 72.2%). During Round 1, consensus was obtained for 27/46 statements (58.7%), with an additional two statements in Round 2 and none in Round 3. Consensus was obtained for statements relating to: potential gain arising from polypharmacy management (3/4 statements); strategic development (7/7); change management (5/7) indicator measures (4/6); legislation (0/3); awareness raising (5/5); polypharmacy reviews (5/7); and EU vision (0/7). Analysis of free text comments indicated that the vision statements were too ambitious and not achievable by the specified timeframe of 2025. Conclusion Consensus was obtained amongst key EU strategists around many aspects of polypharmacy management in older people. Notably, no consensus was achieved in relation to statements relating to the need to alter legislation in areas of healthcare delivery, remuneration and practitioner scope of practice. While the vision for the EU by 2025 was considered rather ambitious, there is great potential and clear opportunity to advance polypharmacy management throughout the EU and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2769345760,"Pneumonia may be caused by a wide range of pathogens and is considered the most common infectious cause of death in humans. Murine acute lung infection models mirror human pathologies in many aspects and contribute to our understanding of the disease and the development of novel treatment strategies. Despite progress in other fields of tissue imaging, histopathology remains the most conclusive and practical read out tool for the descriptive and semiquantitative evaluation of mouse pneumonia and therapeutic interventions. Here, we systematically describe and compare the distinctive histopathological features of established models of acute pneumonia in mice induced by Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, influenza A virus (IAV) and superinfection of IAV-incuced pneumonia with S. pneumoniae. Systematic comparisons of the models revealed striking differences in the distribution of lesions, the characteristics of pneumonia induced, principal inflammatory cell types, lesions in adjacent tissues, and the detectability of the pathogens in histological sections. We therefore identified core criteria for each model suitable for practical semiquantitative scoring systems that take into account the pathogen- and model-specific patterns of pneumonia. Other critical factors that affect experimental pathologies are discussed, including infectious dose, time kinetics, and the genetic background of the mouse strain. The substantial differences between the model-specific pathologies underscore the necessity of pathogen- and model-adapted criteria for the comparative quantification of experimental outcomes. These criteria also allow for the standardized validation and comparison of treatment strategies in preclinical models."
https://openalex.org/W2769323189,"Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) cause significant losses among livestock and impact the livelihoods of resource-poor farming communities worldwide. In Ethiopia, detailed studies on the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) in cattle using sensitive molecular detection methods are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and species composition of bovine TBPs of veterinary significance in local cattle populations. A comprehensive cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in cattle populations of Illubabor zone in Southwestern Ethiopia from June to August 2013. For this purpose, blood samples were collected from 392 cattle. A combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a Reverse Line Blot (RLB) hybridization assay was employed for the detection of TBPs in these samples. The PCR/RLB results of the 392 blood samples indicated a high overall prevalence of 96.9% for TBPs, including Theileria mutans (66.1%), Theileria orientalis (51.8%), Anaplasma sp. Omatjenne (25.5%), Anaplasma marginale (14.5%), Babesia bigemina (14.0%) and Theileria velifera (13.0%) and minor occurrences of Ehrlichia ruminantium (0.5%) and Ehrlichia minasensis (0.26%). Moreover, three novel Anaplasma genotypes were detected in bovine blood samples. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that they most likely represent three, but at least two, new species. The prevalence of the three novel Anaplasma species, preliminary designated as Anaplasma sp. Hadesa, Anaplasma sp. Saso and Anaplasma sp. Dedessa, was 12.5%, 14.3% and 5.6%, respectively. Overall, a total of 227 cattle (57.9%) were found to be co-infected with two or more TBPs simultaneously and 86 different species combinations were observed. The findings show a very high burden of infection of cattle with TBPs in Ethiopia. The high frequency of co-infections suggests that clinical manifestations might be complex. Further research is required to determine the pathogenicity, host cell types and vector of the three novel Anaplasma species identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2770996148,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus, have limited treatment options, often resulting in amputations. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as statins are cholesterol-reducing agents that may provide a new therapeutic option. Statins target the cholesterol pathway and block the synthesis of the wound-healing inhibitors farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and cortisol, ligands for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Here we demonstrate that the naturally occurring statin mevastatin reverses FPP's effects and promotes healing by using in vitro wound healing assays, human ex vivo and porcine in vivo wound models, and DFU tissue. Moreover, we measured cortisol levels by ELISA and found that mevastatin inhibited cortisol synthesis in keratinocytes and biopsies from patients with DFU. Of note, topical mevastatin stimulated epithelialization and angiogenesis in vivo. Mevastatin also reversed FPP-mediated induction of the GR target, the transcription factor c-Myc (a biomarker of non-healing wounds), in porcine and human wound models. Importantly, mevastatin reversed c-Myc overexpression in DFUs. It induced expression of the long noncoding RNA Gas5 that blocks c-Myc expression, which was confirmed by overexpression studies. We conclude that topical mevastatin accelerates wound closure by promoting epithelialization via multiple mechanisms: modulation of GR ligands and induction of the long noncoding RNA Gas5, leading to c-Myc inhibition. In light of these findings, we propose that repurposing statin drugs for topical treatment of DFUs may offer another option for managing this serious condition.

https://openalex.org/W2770362455,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises ∼20% of all breast cancers and is the most aggressive mammary cancer subtype. Devoid of the estrogen and progesterone receptors, along with the receptor tyrosine kinase ERB2 (HER2), that define most mammary cancers, there are no targeted therapies for patients with TNBC. This, combined with a high metastatic rate and a lower 5-year survival rate than for other breast cancer phenotypes, means there is significant unmet need for new therapeutic strategies. Herein, the anti-neoplastic effects of the electrophilic fatty acid nitroalkene derivative, 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid (nitro-oleic acid, NO2-OA), were investigated in multiple preclinical models of TNBC. NO2-OA reduced TNBC cell growth and viability in vitro, attenuated TNFα-induced TNBC cell migration and invasion, and inhibited the tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell xenografts in the mammary fat pads of female nude mice. The up-regulation of these aggressive tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion phenotypes is mediated in part by the constitutive activation of pro-inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in TNBC. NO2-OA inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in human TNBC cells and suppressed downstream NF-κB target gene expression, including the metastasis-related proteins intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The mechanisms accounting for NF-κB signaling inhibition by NO2-OA in TNBC cells were multifaceted, as NO2-OA (a) inhibited the inhibitor of NF-κB subunit kinase β phosphorylation and downstream inhibitor of NF-κB degradation, (b) alkylated the NF-κB RelA protein to prevent DNA binding, and (c) promoted RelA polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Comparisons with non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial MCF-10A and MCF7 cells revealed that NO2-OA more selectively inhibited TNBC function. This was attributed to more facile mechanisms for maintaining redox homeostasis in normal breast epithelium, including a more favorable thiol/disulfide balance, greater extents of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1) expression, and greater MRP1-mediated efflux of NO2-OA–glutathione conjugates. These observations reveal that electrophilic fatty acid nitroalkenes react with more alkylation-sensitive targets in TNBC cells to inhibit growth and viability.

Zhao C. Dahlman-Wright K. AP-1 is a key regulator of proinflammatory cytokine TNFα-mediated triple-negative breast cancer progression.J. Biol.

Notably, a meta-analysis revealed that TNBC patients with elevated TNFα expression have an increased risk of tumor metastasis to distant organs (15Li H.-H. Zhu H. Liu L.-S. Huang Y. Guo J. Li J. Sun X.-P. Chang C.-X. Wang Z.-H. Zhai K. Tumour necrosis factor-α gene polymorphism is associated with metastasis in patients with triple negative breast cancer.Sci.

Thus, NF-κB activation and the downstream signaling actions of its pro-inflammatory mediators play a critical role in TNBC malignancy. This motivates the development of novel NF-κB inhibition strategies as a chemotherapeutic approach for countering metastatic TNBC. Electrophilic fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives (NO2-FA) are endogenously formed by the acidic conditions of digestion and the complex redox milieu that is up-regulated during inflammation. These environments facilitate the reaction of the nitric oxide (•NO) and nitrite (NO2−)-derived nitrating species nitrogen dioxide (•NO2) (16Bonacci G. Baker P.R.S. Salvatore S.R. Shores D.

Moreover, the pleiotropic signaling actions of NO2-FA include the activation of angiogenesis via up-regulation of HIF-1α signaling during hypoxia (32Rudnicki M. Faine L.A. Dehne N. Namgaladze D. Ferderbar S. Weinlich R. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Yan C.Y. Krieger J.E. Brüne B. Abdalla D.S. Hypoxia inducible factor-dependent regulation of angiogenesis by nitro-fatty acids.Arterioscler. Thromb.

Because these effects may potentially modulate cancer cell and tumor properties, it was important to test the impact of an electrophilic NO2-FA in both in vitro and in vivo models of an aggressive cancer phenotype, TNBC. This study reports the inhibition of TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB468) cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by a synthetic homolog of an endogenous electrophilic NO2-FA found in species ranging from plants to humans (10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid, termed nitro-oleic acid and NO2-OA). NO2-OA displayed lower cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects on non-tumorigenic breast ductal epithelium (MCF-10A and MCF7) versus triple-negative human breast ductal epithelial cells, due to the more stable mechanisms for maintaining redox homeostasis in MCF-10A and MCF7 cells. NO2-OA also attenuated TNFα-induced TNBC cell migration and invasion via inhibition of NF-κB signaling. Two newly discovered mechanisms also accounted for NO2-OA inhibition of TNBC NF-κB transcriptional activity. First, NO2-OA alkylated the inhibitor of NF-κB subunit kinase β (IKKβ), leading to inhibition of its kinase activity and downstream IκBα phosphorylation. Second, NO2-OA alkylated NF-κB RelA protein, a reaction that not only inhibited DNA binding, but also promoted proteasomal RelA degradation. As a consequence, NO2-OA inhibited the expression of two NF-κB–regulated, TNFα-induced genes that are central to tumor metastasis, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Finally, in a nude mouse xenograft model, NO2-OA reduced the growth of established MDA-MB-231 tumors. In aggregate, these findings reveal that electrophilic NO2-FA can mediate chemotherapeutic actions in treating TNBC and possibly other inflammation-related cancers. The endogenously occurring lipid electrophile NO2-OA and its non-electrophilic control fatty acids (NO2-SA and OA) were evaluated for their impact on normal and cancerous breast ductal epithelial cell growth and signaling responses (Fig. 1A). To examine whether NO2-OA preferentially inhibited TNBC cell growth, Hoechst 33258 was used for counting non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), an ER+ breast cancer cell line (MCF7), and two TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468). Each cell line was treated with a range of NO2-OA concentrations (0–15 μm) for 48 h. NO2-OA significantly inhibited the growth of both TNBC cell lines but not ER+ or MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1, B, C, and D). The IC50 for NO2-OA was significantly greater for non-cancerous MCF-10A cells (7.7 ± 1.93 μm) and MCF7 (11.61 ± 3.59 μm), as opposed to TNBC MDA-MB-231 (2.7 ± 0.11 μm) and MDA-MB-468 (1.6 ± 0.11 μm) cells (Fig. 1E). In addition to preferential TNBC cell growth inhibition, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) detection of intact cell electron transfer mechanisms revealed that NO2-OA also significantly reduced the viability of both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not MCF7 or MCF-10A cells (Fig. S1, A–C). No cytotoxicity was detectable in any cell line for up to 24 h at the 5 μm NO2-OA concentrations typically used for subsequent cell signaling and functional studies that had durations ranging from 1 to 8 h. Non-electrophilic NO2-SA, structurally related to NO2-OA (Fig. 1A), did not affect TNBC cell growth (Fig. S2), affirming that NO2-OA–mediated TNBC cell growth inhibition is attributable to the electrophilic nitroalkene moiety. Given that TNBC cell growth and viability are inhibited by NO2-OA, the efficacy of NO2-OA on tumor growth was examined in a murine xenograft model of TNBC. MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the fourth inguinal mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female athymic nude mice. Oral gavage with NO2-OA (7.5 mg/kg/day), NO2-SA (7.5 mg/kg/day), or sesame oil (vehicle control) was initiated and continued for 4 weeks after the average tumor sizes reached between 50 and 100 mm3. There was significantly reduced tumor growth in the mice treated with NO2-OA versus vehicle controls and NO2-SA–treated mice at 27 days post-treatment (Fig. 1F). During the course of treatment, there was no weight loss in NO2-OA-treated or control mice (Fig. S3). These results indicate that NO2-OA mediates in vivo growth suppression of MDA-MB-231 cells with no overt toxic effects. To determine whether the decreased cell numbers were due to NO2-OA–induced cell cycle alterations, FACS analysis was performed. NO2-OA significantly increased the percentage of cells at G2/M phase and decreased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 upon 24-h treatment in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, all cell cycle phase populations (G0/G1, S, and G2/M) of MCF-10A cells were not affected by NO2-OA (Fig. 2C). The cell cycle inhibition by NO2-OA was accompanied by an increase in p21 and a decrease in cyclin D1 protein expression in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the lack of an effect on cell growth and viability (Fig. S2), NO2-SA did not affect cell cycle populations or the expression of cell cycle–regulatory proteins in MCF-10A, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2D). The gene expression of cyclin D1 and p21 was also determined by quantitative RT-PCR. NO2-OA down-regulated cyclin D1 and up-regulated p21 gene expression after 24 h treatment of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not MCF-10A cells (Fig. S4). These results indicate that NO2-OA selectively induced cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells. Increased sub-G1 cell populations were apparent in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells 24 h after NO2-OA treatment (Fig. S5). To determine whether the effect of NO2-OA on sub-G1 cells in TNBC cells was apoptosis-mediated, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was examined by Western blotting. Treatment with NO2-OA for 24 h promoted caspase-3–mediated cleavage of PARP-1 (Fig. 2E) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not in MCF-10A cells, indicating that NO2-OA preferentially induced TNBC apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. Also, it is possible that the increase in p21 blocks cell cycle entry into the S phase, resulting in the increase in sub-G1 cells. To further investigate apoptotic signaling responses to NO2-OA in TNBC cells, the activation of initiator caspases (caspase-8 for the extrinsic pathway and caspase-9 for the intrinsic pathway) was analyzed using antibodies that detect both the pro-caspase and activated (cleaved) forms of these initiator caspases. NO2-OA treatment increased cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, suggesting that NO2-OA induced apoptosis through both intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) and extrinsic (death receptor-dependent) apoptotic signaling mechanisms in TNBC cells (Fig. 2F). In aggregate, these results confirm that NO2-OA selectively modulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in TNBC cells ver"

Anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) titers are inversely associated with bone mineral density (BMD). However, the differential effect of ACPA on bone turnover marker (BTM) and BMD changes after IL-6 inhibition remains unclear. This prospective study recruited patients with active RA with inadequate response to methotrexate or biologics. BMD was measured before and after 2-year tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment. Serum osteocalcin, N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP), and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) levels were assessed at the baseline and after treatment. We enrolled 76 patients with RA (89.5% women, age: 57.2 ± 13.3 years) receiving TCZ. The 28-joint disease activity score was negatively correlated with BMD and T-scores of the lumbar spine and bilateral femoral neck. ACPA-positive patients had lower lumbar spine and femoral neck T-scores. After 2-year TCZ treatment, CTX levels significantly decreased (0.32 ± 0.21 vs. 0.26 ± 0.17, p = 0.038). Femoral neck BMD increased significantly (0.71 ± 0.22 vs. 0.69 ± 0.55, p = 0.008). Decreased CTX levels and improved BMD were observed only in ACPA-positive patients. After treatment, femoral neck BMD significantly increased only in patients receiving a glucocorticoid dose of ≥5 mg/day. Two-year TCZ treatment reduced bone resorption and increased femoral BMD in ACPA-positive patients. The net effects of glucocorticoids and IL-6 inhibition on BMD imply that strict inflammation control might affect bone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2770913629,"Retinoic acid receptor-related-orphan-receptor-C (RORγt) is the key transcription factor that is driving the differentiation of IL-17 producing T-helper 17 (Th17) cells that are implicated in the pathology of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Based on the importance of RORγt in promoting Th17-driven pathology, there is considerable interest to develop low-molecular-weight compounds with the aim of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of this nuclear hormone receptor. In this article, we describe the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of a potent and selective small-molecular-weight RORγt inverse agonist. The compound binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RORγt leading to displacement of a co-activator peptide. We show for the first time that a RORγt inverse agonist down-regulates permissive histone H3 acetylation and methylation at the IL17A and IL23R promoter regions, thereby providing insight into the transcriptional inhibition of RORγt-dependent genes. Consistent with this, the compound effectively reduced IL-17A production by polarized human T-cells and γδT-cells and attenuated transcription of RORγt target genes. The inhibitor showed good in vivo efficacy in an antigen-induced arthritis model in rats and reduced the frequencies of IL-17A producing cells in ex vivo recall assays. In summary, we demonstrate that inhibiting RORγt by a low-molecular-weight inhibitor results in efficient and selective blockade of the pro-inflammatory Th17/IL-17A pathway making it an attractive target for Th17-mediated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2769972872,"Projecting the long-term trends in energy demand is an increasingly complex endeavor due to the uncertain emerging changes in factors such as climate and policy. The existing energy-economy paradigms used to characterize the long-term trends in the energy sector do not adequately account for climate variability and change. In this paper, we propose a multi-paradigm framework for estimating the climate sensitivity of end-use energy demand that can easily be integrated with the existing energy-economy models. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed framework, we used the energy demand and climate data in the state of Indiana to train a Bayesian predictive model. We then leveraged the end-use demand trends as well as downscaled future climate scenarios to generate probabilistic estimates of the future end-use demand for space cooling, space heating and water heating, at the individual household and building level, in the residential and commercial sectors. Our results indicated that the residential load is much more sensitive to climate variability and change than the commercial load. Moreover, since the largest fraction of the residential energy demand in Indiana is attributed to heating, future warming scenarios could lead to reduced end-use demand due to lower space heating and water heating needs. In the commercial sector, the overall energy demand is expected to increase under the future warming scenarios. This is because the increased cooling load during hotter summer months will likely outpace the reduced heating load during the more temperate winter months."

Pathological changes in vascular permeability are driven by growth factors such as VEGF and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. Identifying the pro-barrier mechanisms that block vascular permeability and restore the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) may lead to new therapies. The cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (EPAC) exchange-protein directly activated by cAMP promotes exchange of GTP in the small GTPase Rap1. Rap1 enhances barrier properties in human umbilical endothelial cells by promoting adherens junction assembly. We hypothesized that the EPAC–Rap1 signaling pathway may regulate the tight junction complex of the BRB and may restore barrier properties after cytokine-induced permeability. Here, we show that stimulating EPAC or Rap1 activation can prevent or reverse VEGF- or TNF-α–induced permeability in cell culture and in vivo. Moreover, EPAC activation inhibited VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling through the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. We also found that Rap1B knockdown or an EPAC antagonist increases endothelial permeability and that VEGF has no additive effect, suggesting a common pathway. Furthermore, GTP-bound Rap1 promoted tight junction assembly, and loss of Rap1B led to loss of junctional border organization. Collectively, our results indicate that the EPAC–Rap1 pathway helps maintain basal barrier properties in the retinal vascular endothelium and activation of the EPAC–Rap1 pathway may therefore represent a potential therapeutic strategy to restore the BRB.

https://openalex.org/W2768483119,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters help export various substrates across the cell membrane and significantly contribute to drug resistance. However, a recent study reported an unusual case in which the loss of an ABC transporter in Candida albicans, orf19.4531 (previously named ROA1), increases resistance against antifungal azoles, which was attributed to an altered membrane potential in the mutant strain. To obtain further mechanistic insights into this phenomenon, here we confirmed that the plasma membrane–localized transporter (renamed CDR6/ROA1 for consistency with C. albicans nomenclature) could efflux xenobiotics such as berberine, rhodamine 123, and paraquat. Moreover, a CDR6/ROA1 null mutant, NKKY101, displayed increased susceptibility to these xenobiotics. Interestingly, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results indicated that NKKY101 mutant cells exhibited increased plasma membrane rigidity, resulting in reduced azole accumulation and contributing to azole resistance. Transcriptional profiling revealed that ribosome biogenesis genes were significantly up-regulated in the NKKY101 mutant. As ribosome biogenesis is a well-known downstream phenomenon of target of rapamycin (TOR1) signaling, we suspected a link between ribosome biogenesis and TOR1 signaling in NKKY101. Therefore, we grew NKKY101 cells on rapamycin and observed TOR1 hyperactivation, which leads to Hsp90-dependent calcineurin stabilization and thereby increased azole resistance. This in vitro finding was supported by in vivo data from a mouse model of systemic infection in which NKKY101 cells led to higher fungal load after fluconazole challenge than wild-type cells. Taken together, our study uncovers a mechanism of azole resistance in C. albicans, involving increased membrane rigidity and TOR signaling. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters help export various substrates across the cell membrane and significantly contribute to drug resistance.

To obtain further mechanistic insights into this phenomenon, here we confirmed that the plasma membrane–localized transporter (renamed CDR6/ROA1 for consistency with C. albicans nomenclature) could efflux xenobiotics such as berberine, rhodamine 123, and paraquat. Moreover, a CDR6/ROA1 null mutant, NKKY101, displayed increased susceptibility to these xenobiotics. Interestingly, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results indicated that NKKY101 mutant cells exhibited increased plasma membrane rigidity, resulting in reduced azole accumulation and contributing to azole resistance. Transcriptional profiling revealed that ribosome biogenesis genes were significantly up-regulated in the NKKY101 mutant. As ribosome biogenesis is a well-known downstream phenomenon of target of rapamycin (TOR1) signaling, we suspected a link between ribosome biogenesis and TOR1 signaling in NKKY101. Therefore, we grew NKKY101 cells on rapamycin and observed TOR1 hyperactivation, which leads to Hsp90-dependent calcineurin stabilization and thereby increased azole resistance. This in vitro finding was supported by in vivo data from a mouse model of systemic infection in which NKKY101 cells led to higher fungal load after fluconazole challenge than wild-type cells. Taken together, our study uncovers a mechanism of azole resistance in C. albicans, involving increased membrane rigidity and TOR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2769410191,"Congestive heart failure typically arises from cardiac myocyte necrosis/apoptosis, associated with the pathological opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). mPTP opening decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to the activation of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ) and the production of downstream toxic metabolites. However, the array of enzymatic mediators and the exact chemical mechanisms responsible for modulating myocardial mPTP opening remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that human heart failure activates specific myocardial mitochondrial phospholipases that increase Ca2+-dependent production of toxic hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and attenuate the activity of phospholipases that promote the synthesis of protective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Mechanistically, HETEs activated the Ca2+-induced opening of the mPTP in failing human myocardium, and the highly selective pharmacological blockade of either iPLA2γ or lipoxygenases attenuated mPTP opening in failing hearts. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases opened the myocardial mPTP in human heart mitochondria. Remarkably, the major mitochondrial phospholipase responsible for Ca2+-activated release of arachidonic acid (AA) in mitochondria from non-failing hearts was calcium-dependent phospholipase A2ζ (cPLA2ζ) identified by sequential column chromatographies and activity-based protein profiling. In contrast, iPLA2γ predominated in failing human myocardium. Stable isotope kinetics revealed that in non-failing human hearts, cPLA2ζ metabolically channels arachidonic acid into EETs, whereas in failing hearts, increased iPLA2γ activity channels AA into toxic HETEs. These results mechanistically identify the sequelae of pathological remodeling of human mitochondrial phospholipases in failing myocardium. This remodeling metabolically channels AA into toxic HETEs promoting mPTP opening, which induces necrosis/apoptosis leading to further progression of heart failure.

Recently, we demonstrated that genetic knock-out of the active site of iPLA2γ (PNPLA8) results in the attenuation of mPTP opening and that iPLA2γ is largely responsible for the calcium-dependent production of oxidized fatty acid metabolites (e.g. eicosanoids, docosanoids, and oxidized linoleic acid metabolites) emanating from the mitochondrial compartment in murine hepatic and myocardial tissues (12Moon S.H.

Collectively, this sequence of events results in a feed-forward loop promoting the autoamplification of mitochondrial lipid second messenger generation. Mitochondria contain, or are associated with, multiple different types of phospholipases in humans. However, their molecular identity, their contributions to production of signaling lipids, and the effects of the resultant downstream metabolites in non-failing versus failing human myocardium are unknown. During heart failure in animal models, increases in mitochondrial calcium concentration and changes in calcium dynamics are present resulting from alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-mitochondrial subcellular architecture, pathological SR calcium coupling, and reduced Ca2+ sequestration (15Lopez-Crisosto C.

Because phospholipase-catalyzed arachidonic acid (AA) release is the rate-limiting step in the generation of eicosanoid-derived signaling moieties, knowledge of the types of mitochondrial phospholipases, Ca2+-mediated changes in their activities, and metabolic fates of their downstream metabolites are essential in the mechanistic understanding of the pathology resulting from the diverse array of toxic oxidized lipids produced during human heart failure.

Accordingly, we hypothesized that abrupt activation of mitochondrial phospholipases by calcium uptake into the mitochondria in conjunction with the loss of membrane potential would result in the pathological activation of iPLA2γ leading to the generation of a complex array of eicosanoid metabolites and fatty acids that contribute to the opening of the mPTP and progression of human heart failure. Here, we demonstrate the dramatic increase in calcium-activated HETE production at the expense of cardioprotective EETs in failing human hearts in comparison with non-failing human myocardium. These changes collectively result in the increased sensitivity of mitochondria to calcium-induced mPTP opening and further depolarization leading to cardiac myocyte damage. Furthermore, we present primary evidence of metabolic channeling of AA into discrete eicosanoid products through the remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipase activities from cPLA2ζ in non-failing human myocardium to iPLA2γ during heart failure. Collectively, this study mechanistically identifies the pathological remodeling of cardiac phospholipases and their downstream products resulting from altered metabolic channeling as a principal mechanism increasing lipid-mediated mPTP opening leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the progression of human heart failure. To assess whether alterations in eicosanoid molecular species are present in failing versus non-failing human heart mitochondria, we incubated mitochondria from non-failing or failing human myocardium in the absence or presence of calcium ion as described under “Experimental procedures.” Reaction products were identified and quantified using charge-switch derivatization with LC-MS/MS (14Liu X.

Intriguingly, mitochondria (and their tethered/associated membranes) prepared from non-failing human myocardium exhibited a substantial increase in the initial rate of production of a wide range of eicosanoid molecular species after calcium challenge, including cytoprotective EETs (Fig. 1, A–D). In sharp contrast, similar calcium challenge of mitochondria from failing human myocardium produced robust increases in multiple lipoxygenase metabolites, including 5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETEs. Critically, in failing myocardium, calcium stimulation did not result in significant increases in salutary 14,15-EET production (Fig. 1, A and B), although the enzymes to catalyze the oxidation of released AA to 14,15-EET were clearly present in failing myocardium (see below). Moreover, large Ca2+-dependent increases in proinflammatory PGE2 were manifest in conjunction with decreases in cardioprotective prostacyclins (29Egan K.M. Lawson J.A. Fries S. Koller B. Rader D.J.

Despite the importance of the mPTP channel in mediating cardiac myocyte cell death programs, to the best of our knowledge, no previous investigations have explored alterations in mPTP opening in non-failing versus failing human hearts. Accordingly, we incubated isolated human heart mitochondria with calcium ion and measured mitochondrial swelling indicative of mPTP opening. Although high-resolution respirometry revealed that oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria isolated from non-failing and failing hearts was not significantly different (Fig. S1), calcium challenge of mitochondria dramatically increased swelling of mitochondria from failing hearts in comparison with non-failing hearts (Fig. 2A). Inclusion of inorganic phosphate (Pi), a potent inducer of mPTP opening in animal models, only moderately increased swelling of human myocardial mitochondria without affecting the relative sensitivity of non-failing versus failing heart mitochondria to calcium-induced mPTP opening (Fig. 2B).

Thus, the observed susceptibility of failing heart mitochondria to calcium-induced swelling was not due to alterations in the content of pore-regulating proteins, but rather to their maladaptive regulation by different modulators in non-failing versus failing human hearts. To determine whether the dramatic increase in HETE production was mechanistically responsible for the increase in sensitivity to mitochondrial swelling, mitochondria from failing human myocardium were treated with specific inhibitors of either cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LOX), or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450). Remarkably, inhibition of LOX activity with baicalein (Baic) completely abolished calcium-activated mPTP opening of failing heart mitochondria, whereas CYP450 inhibition with MSPPOH dramatically exacerbated swelling (Fig. 3A). Because MSPPOH-enhanced mitochondrial swelling appears inhibitable with cyclosporine A, inhibition of CYP450 likely facilitate cyclophilin D-dependent mPTP opening (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of COX enzymes with ibuprofen (Ibu) did not affect human failing heart mitochondrial swelling. Similarly, mPTP opening of non-failing heart mitochondria was dramatically promoted by preincubation with MSPPOH, although the induction time for mitochondrial swelling was significantly longer than that of failing heart (Fig. 3C). These distinct effects resulting from selective inhibition of discrete oxygenases demonstrate the prominent role of signaling eicosanoids in the enhancement or attenuation of mPTP opening in failing human myocardium. Mitochondrial swelling data with oxygenase-specific inhibitors are consistent with the HRAM mass spectrometric analyses of mitochondria demonstrating higher HETE levels in mitochondria from failing hearts accompanied by decreased calcium-stimulated EET production in comparison with non-failing hearts (Fig. 1). Importantly, exogenous provision of selected HETEs reversed the protection from mPTP opening conveyed by baicalein treatment (Fig. 3D). Although multiple HETEs were promoters of mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 3D), the lipoxygenase products 12-HETE and 15-HETE are likely of greater pathophysiological significance because they are prominent in human myocardium, and Ca2+ stimulation generated substantially greater amounts of these eicosanoids in failing human heart mitochondria (Fig. 1). This notion is further supported by the observation of the inability of CYP450 hydroxylase(s) to generate effective amounts of 20-HETE after calcium stimulation in either non-failing or failing human myocardial mitochondria (Fig. 1). To determine whether alterations in the enzymic activities of AA oxidases in non-failing versus failing heart mitochondria were responsible for the differences in the profiles of eicosanoid products, we compared their rate of production using deuterated isotopes of arachidonic acid examined under initial rate conditions. Mitochondrial sonicates from non-failing or failing human hearts were incubated with exogenous deuterated arachidonic acid (d8-AA) in the absence or presence of Ca2+. The results demonstrated minimal differences in deuterated oxylipin production using d8-AA in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ treatments in either non-failing and failing myocardial mitochondria (Fig. 4). Moreover, these results demonstrate that AA availability to the downstream oxidative enzymes was rate-determining in the synthesis of the measured eicosanoids because if exogenously added d8-AA was present, no substantive differences in deuterated eicosanoid p"

MR images of 100 patients with BM from primary breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided according to the biological subtype of the primary tumor, (triple-negative: 24, HER2 positive: 48, luminal: 28). All images marked with BMs were standardized to the human brain MRI atlas provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 database. Distribution pattern of BM was evaluated with intra-group and intergroup analysis. In intra-group analysis, hot spots of metastases from triple-negative are evenly distributed in the brain, meanwhile BMs from HER2 positive and luminal type occur dominantly in occipital lobe and cerebellum. In intergroup analysis, BMs from triple-negative type occurred more often in frontal lobe, limbic region, and parietal lobe, compared with other types (P < .05). Breast cancer subtypes tend to demonstrate different spatial distributions of their BMs. These findings may have direct implications for dose modulation in prophylactic irradiation as well as for differential diagnoses. Thus, this result should be validated in future study with a larger population."

Sarcomere assembly mediated by formin homology 2 domain-containing 3 (Fhod3), a member of formins that directs formation of straight actin filaments, is essential for embryonic cardiogenesis. However, the role of Fhod3 in the neonatal and adult stages has remained unknown. Here, we generated floxed Fhod3 mice to bypass the embryonic lethality of an Fhod3 knockout (KO). Perinatal KO of Fhod3 in the heart caused juvenile lethality at around day 10 after birth with enlarged hearts composed of severely impaired myofibrils, indicating that Fhod3 is crucial for postnatal heart development. Tamoxifen-induced conditional KO of Fhod3 in the adult heart neither led to lethal effects nor did it affect sarcomere structure and localization of sarcomere components. However, adult Fhod3-deleted mice exhibited a slight cardiomegaly and mild impairment of cardiac function, conditions that were sustained over 1 year without compensation during aging. In addition to these age-related changes, systemic stimulation with the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine, which induces sustained hypertension and hypertrophy development, induced expression of fetal cardiac genes that was more pronounced in adult Fhod3-deleted mice than in the control mice, suggesting that Fhod3 modulates hypertrophic changes in the adult heart.

We conclude that Fhod3 plays a crucial role in both postnatal cardiac development and functional maintenance of the adult heart. Normal cardiac function requires the accurately regulated actin–myosin interaction, which can be achieved by the precisely assembled and maintained sarcomere, the highly organized arrays of thin actin filaments and thick myosin filaments (1Moss R.L.

The structural maintenance of mature sarcomeres is also required for normal cardiac function. Although it was thought that actin filaments in mature muscle cells are relatively stable and do not easily turn over, recent studies have revealed dynamic exchange of cardiac actin thin filaments, i.e. a free actin is incorporated into actin filaments in mature sarcomeres (8Littlefield R.S.

It remains uncertain, however, how actin is exchanged in and out of thin actin filaments in the heart under continuously beating conditions. Because actin filaments in the sarcomere are repetitively pulled into the array of myosin filaments by the periodic actin–myosin interaction, unregulated actin turnover would be directly linked to cardiac dysfunction. Under beating conditions, cardiomyocytes can increase their cell volume by expanding the contractile unit sarcomere in response to physiological demands and pathological changes such as hypertension (10Hill J.A.

In Fhod3-null embryos, premyofibrils are formed once but fail to mature, suggesting that Fhod3 is essential for myofibrillogenesis, particularly for myofibril maturation. Indeed, Fhod3 accumulates at the central region of the sarcomere before myofibrillogenesis is completed, and its actin-assembling activity is required for myofibril maturation (25Fujimoto N. Kan-O M.

However, the involvement of Fhod3 in postnatal cardiac development is unknown. Similarly, the role of Fhod3 in sarcomere maintenance in the fully-developed heart remains to be elucidated, although its significance can be expected from recent reports showing that some genetic variants of the Fhod3 gene are associated with human adult-onset cardiomyopathy (26Wooten E.C.

By crossing Fhod3flox mice with muscle creatine kinase (MCK)-Cre mice and α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC)-MerCreMer mice, we examined the effect of Fhod3 depletion at perinatal and adult stages, respectively. In addition, by continuous infusion of phenylephrine, an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, we evaluated the role of Fhod3 in modulation of hypertrophic response. We have previously reported that Fhod3 is indispensable for cardiogenesis, especially for myofibrillogenesis (6Kan-O M Takeya R. Abe T. Kitajima N. Nishida M. Tominaga R. Kurose H. Sumimoto H.

To address the question, we first tested the protein level of Fhod3 in various developmental stages of mice. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the Fhod3 protein was expressed in the heart at comparable levels throughout the lifetime from the embryo to the senior adult (Fig. 1B). The expression of Fhod3 is mostly restricted to the heart (Fig. 1, C and D). To investigate how Fhod3 functions in the developed heart, we generated the Fhod3flox allele by introduction of loxP sites into the introns surrounding the exon 18 (Fig. 2), which encodes the entire FH1 and the first part of FH2 domains (the core domains for actin polymerization). Cre-mediated recombination leads to deletion of the exon 18 and introduces a frameshift mutation, thereby resulting in a premature stop codon 7 amino acids downstream from the deletion.Figure 2Generation of Fhod3 floxed mice.

Perinatal Fhod3 cKO mice (Fhod3flox/−;MCK-Cre+), in which the Cre-mediated recombination occurred around birth (Fig. 3A), were born in the expected Mendelian ratio (25%) and were indistinguishable in appearance from control littermates at birth. However these mice died by around postnatal day (P) 15 (Fig. 3B). As demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of heart extracts (Fig. 3C), the Fhod3 protein in Fhod3 cKO mice (Fhod3flox/−;MCK-Cre+) began to decrease from around birth and became nearly undetectable at P8. Macroscopically, Fhod3 cKO neonates began to exhibit growth retardation at around P6, and the difference in the body size between Fhod3 cKO and control neonates became apparent with time (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, the heart of Fhod3 cKO neonates was markedly enlarged in comparison with that of control ones (Fig. 3D), suggesting that lethality is associated with cardiac defects. When myocardial sections prepared from Fhod3 cKO mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 4A), they showed signs of myofibrillar degeneration such as wavy appearance of myofibrils and myocyte swelling with an increase in vacuoles. To further investigate myocardial changes associated with depletion of Fhod3, we performed immunofluorescence staining for Fhod3 and sarcomeric α-actinin, a marker for myofibril assembly, and we found that Fhod3 was not detected at the protein level (Fig. 4B). Regularly-striated alignment of sarcomeric α-actinin was largely maintained in Fhod3-deleted myofibrils, although some myofibrils had abnormal α-actinin signals, which are aggregated or continuous along the sarcolemma. F-actin staining exhibited more pronounced myofibrillar changes with continuous aggregates of F-actin with α-actinin, a protein necessary for F-actin attachment to the Z-lines in cardiac sarcomeres (Fig. 4C). Transmission electron microscopic analysis also showed breakdown of sarcomere structure in the neonatal heart of Fhod3 cKO mice (Fig. 4, D and E). In contrast, cardiac sarcomeres in Fhod3 cKO mice were normally developed before birth (Fig. 4F). Thus, neonatal depletion of Fhod3 likely disrupts the sarcomere which has been once properly formed before birth, indicating that Fhod3 participates in postnatal development and maintenance of the cardiac sarcomere. However, the sarcomeric structure of the skeletal muscle showed no obvious differences between Fhod3 cKO and control neonates (Fig. 4G), supporting the idea that lethality is primarily associated with defects in the cardiac sarcomere. We further investigated the phosphorylation status of Fhod3 in the neonatal heart, because it has been reported that the activity of Fhod3 is regulated by phosphorylation (30Iskratsch T. Reijntjes S. Dwyer J. Toselli P. Dégano I.R. Dominguez I. Ehler E. Two distinct phosphorylation events govern the function of muscle FHOD3.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70 (23052206): 893-90810.1007/s00018-012-1154-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4H, only weak bands of phosphorylated Fhod3 were detected both in the neonatal and adult heart under conditions where cMyBP-C, a sarcomeric phosphoprotein (31Gautel M. Zuffardi O. Freiburg A. Labeit S. Phosphorylation switches specific for the cardiac isoform of myosin binding protein-C: a modulator of cardiac contraction?.EMBO J. 1995; 14 (7744002): 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), was substantially phosphorylated. Fhod3 plays a crucial role in not only the embryonic heart (6Kan-O M Takeya R. Abe T. Kitajima N. Nishida M. Tominaga R. Kurose H. Sumimoto H. Mammalian formin Fhod3 plays an essential role in cardiogenesis by organizing myofibrillogenesis.Biol. Open. 2012; 1 (23213483): 889-89610.1242/bio.20121370Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but also the neonatal heart (Figure 3, Figure 4). However, it was difficult to assess whether Fhod3 functions in the fully-developed adult heart by using MCK-Cre-mediated cKO mice, because Fhod3 cKO mice did not fully survive until adulthood (Fig. 3). To delineate the role of Fhod3 in the adult heart, we crossed mice carrying the Fhod3flox allele with transgenic mice expressing MerCreMer under the control of the αMHC promoter (32Sohal D.S. Nghiem M. Crackower M.A. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Tymitz K.M. Penninger J.M. Molkentin J.D. Temporally regulated and tissue-specific gene manipulations in the adult and embryonic heart using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre protein.Circ. Res. 2001; 89 (11440973): 20-2510.1161/hh1301.092687Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), thereby generating mice with the Fhod3 alleles that can be deleted specifically in the adult heart by administration of TAM. Fhod3flox/−;αMHC-MerCreMer+ mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and were indistinguishable in appearance from control littermates. To delete Fhod3 specifically in the adult heart, 4–6-week-old mice were orally administered TAM for 2 weeks. The occurrence of Cre-mediated, heart-specific recombination was confirmed by PCR analysis using genomic DNAs extracted from the heart and kidney in adult mice treated with TAM; the recombinant allele was detected only in the heart of Cre-positive mice but not in the kidney of Cre-positive mice or the heart of Cre-negative mice (Fig. 5A). The protein expression level of Fhod3 in Fhod3 iKO mice was reduced to ∼5% or less of that of wild-type mice, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of lysates of isolated left ventricular tissue (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, TAM administration effectively induces Cre-mediated, cardiac-specific recombination of the Fhod3 allele to significantly reduce the protein expression level of Fhod3 in the adult heart. Despite the reduction of Fhod3 in the heart from TAM-treated iKO mice, no significant difference in the long-term survival up to 60 weeks was observed among all the genotype groups (Fig. 5C). Some mice died during the 2 weeks of TAM administration, probably due to acute cardiotoxicity (33Davis J. Maillet M. Miano J.M. Molkentin J.D. Lost in transgenesis: a user's guide for genetically manipulating the mouse in cardiac research.Circ. Res. 2012; 111 (22935533): 761-77710.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.262717Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Adult Fhod3-deleted mice showed a slightly higher mortality rate than other genotype mice but with no statistical significance. We next evaluated the effect of Fhod3 depletion in the adult heart at 8–10 weeks after TAM administration; the period was selected because the transient impairment of cardiac function is known to be fully recovered until 4 weeks after the cessation of TAM administration (34Koitabashi N. Bedja D. Zaiman A.L. Pinto Y.M. Zhang M. Gabrielson K.L. Takimoto E. Kass D.A. Avoidance of transient cardiomyopathy in cardiomyocyte-targeted tamoxifen-induced MerCreMer gene deletion models.Circ. Res. 2009; 105 (19520971): 12-1510.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.198416Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The size of the adult heart in TAM-treated Fhod3 iKO mice was slightly larger than that in control mice (Fig. 5E), which was supported by histological analysis (Fig. 5F). Left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio of adult Fhod3-deleted mice was slightly but significantly higher than that of control mice, whereas there was no difference in kidney weight-to-body weight ratio between adult Fhod3-deleted and control mice (Fig. 5G). On the other hand, we were not able to detect any compensatory increase in the expression of Fhod1, the only other member of the Fhod subfamily (Fig. 5H). Thus deletion of Fhod3 in the adult heart confers a slight cardiomegaly. We next investigated the effect of Fhod3 depletion in the adult heart on the sarcomeric structure. In contrast to the finding that the neonatal heart of Fhod3 cKO mice shows disrupted structures of sarcomeres (Fig. 4, B–E), the adult heart of TAM-treated Fhod3 iKO mice showed apparently normal sarcomeric structures (Fig. 6). There were no significant differences in sarcomeric structures, including the Z-line marked with the antibody to α-actinin (Fig. 6, A and B), thin actin filaments stained with phalloidin (Fig. 6, B and C), and thick myosin filaments visualized with the antibody to myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) (Fig. 6D), albeit specific signals for Fhod3 were absent in the Fhod3-deleted adult heart (Fig. 6, A, C, and D). Immunohistochemical staining of tropomodulin, a protein that caps actin filament at the pointed end, showed no detectable differences between adult Fhod3-deleted and control hearts (Fig. 6E), suggesting that the length of thin actin filaments and the capping state of pointed ends are unaffected. Intact sarcomeres in the Fhod3-deleted adult heart were also observed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 6F). Furthermore, intercalated disc structure, which is disrupted in several mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy (35Perriard J.-C. Hirschy A. Ehler E.

We observed that one of these prenyltransferases, AhR4DT-1, catalyzes a key reaction in the biosynthesis of prenylated stilbenoids, in which resveratrol is prenylated at its C-4 position to form arachidin-2, whereas another, AhR3′DT-1, added the prenyl group to C-3′ of resveratrol. Each of these prenyltransferases was highly specific for stilbenoid substrates, and we confirmed their subcellular location in the plastid by fluorescence microscopy. Structural analysis of the prenylated stilbenoids suggested that these two prenyltransferase activities represent the first committed steps in the biosynthesis of a large number of prenylated stilbenoids and their derivatives in peanut. In summary, we have identified five candidate prenyltransferases in peanut and confirmed that two of them are stilbenoid-specific, advancing our understanding of this specialized enzyme family and shedding critical light onto the biosynthesis of bioactive stilbenoids.

Although HIV-positive/active METH users have been shown to have higher HIV viral loads and experience more severe neurological complications than non-users, the direct impact of METH on HIV infection and its link to the development of neurocognitive alternations are still poorly understood. In the present study, we hypothesized that METH impacts HIV infection of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by a mechanism encompassing NFκB/SP1-mediated HIV LTR activation. Mouse and human NPCs were infected with EcoHIV (modified HIV virus infectious to mice) and HIV, respectively, in the presence or absence of METH (50 or 100 μm). Pretreatment with METH, but not simultaneous exposure, significantly increased HIV production in both mouse and human NPCs. To determine the mechanisms underlying these effects, cells were transfected with different variants of HIV LTR promoters and then exposed to METH. METH treatment induced transcriptional activity of the HIV LTR promotor, an effect that required both NFκB and SP1 signaling. Pretreatment with METH also decreased neuronal differentiation of HIV-infected NPCs in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Importantly, NPC-derived daughter cells appeared to be latently infected with HIV. This study indicates that METH increases HIV infectivity of NPCs, through the NFκB/SP1-dependent activation of the HIV LTR and with the subsequent alterations of NPC neurogenesis. Such events may underlie METH- exacerbated neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected patients.

It is estimated that there are around 35 million people abusing METH, with over 10 million users in the United States. The prevalence of METH abuse is rising mostly due to its relatively easy production, low costs, and, consequently, high availability. METH exerts a strong and long lasting effect on the CNS, which makes it highly addictive. METH abuse not only creates social problems and has devastating effects on health, generating costs of approximately $24 million/year in the United States (75Nicosia N. Liccardo Pacula R. Kilmer B.

METH abuse and HIV infection are independently associated with neuropathological changes in the brain resulting in neuropsychiatric disturbances and cognitive disorders. Despite widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV persists within the CNS, causing cell damage that results in ∼69% of HIV-infected individuals diagnosed with neurocognitive disorders (6Matinella A.

Similarly to HIV, the study demonstrates that daily METH exposure affects proliferation and survival of NPC and decreases formation of new neurons and/or glial cells (29Mandyam C.D. Wee S. Eisch A.J.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms and outcomes of co-exposure to HIV and METH with regard to NPC infection are not fully understood. The goal of this work is to examine the impact of METH on HIV infection in NPC. Our findings indicate that HIV replication in NPC could be activated by METH through a mechanism encompassing the NFκB- and SP1-mediated HIV LTR activation. We further demonstrate that these events contribute to aberrant NPC differentiation and neurogenesis and the formation of latently infected NPC-derived neurons and glial cells. These observations may explain, at least in part, aggravated cognitive deficits that are observed in HIV-infected METH users. Mouse or human NPCs (mNPCs or hNPCs, respectively) were treated with METH simultaneously or 24 h before HIV infection. mNPCs were infected with EcoHIV (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas hNPCs were infected with HIV (Fig. 1, C and D). HIV production was measured by the assessment of p24 antigen (HIV capsid protein), a sensitive and useful test for the detection of active HIV generation as p24 is produced during viral replication. All groups were treated with the same amount of virus, and the initial levels of p24 were not significantly different between groups (Fig. 1, A–D). All infections of NPCs were performed by adding virus for 12 h to cell culture medium. Then the virus was washed out, fresh medium was added, and aliquots of culture medium were collected over time to measure the p24 level. Both mNPCs and hNPCs were susceptible to infection; however, the levels of p24 were higher in hNPCs compared with mNPCs, indicating more productive infection. Exposure to METH at the time of HIV infection resulted in a transient increase in p24 levels in mNPCs, which was observed 24 and 48 h postinfection, as compared with the HIV only group (Fig. 1A). However, a simultaneous treatment with METH at the time of HIV infection had no impact on p24 levels in hNPCs (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a 24-h pretreatment with METH significantly increased HIV production in both mouse and human NPCs as compared with HIV alone (Fig. 1, B and D, respectively). In mNPCs, pretreatment with METH elevated p24 levels in cell culture medium by ∼33% 72 h postinfection. In hNPCs, pretreatment with METH enhanced p24 levels by ∼15% at 24 h and ∼30% at 48 and 72 h postinfection. Pretreatment with METH at 50 and 100 μm was equally effective in stimulation of HIV production. We next analyzed HIV DNA integration with the host genome. mNPCs and hNPCs were pretreated 24 h with 100 μm METH and infected with EcoHIV and HIV, respectively. Cells were collected at three different time points post-infection (0, 48, and 72 h) and analyzed by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). METH induced a ∼24% increase in the integrated HIV DNA at 72 h in mNPCs as compared with EcoHIV alone (Fig. 2A). METH-induced impact on HIV DNA integration in hNPCs was much higher, reaching a ∼3-fold increase at 48 h postinfection (Fig. 2B). Cells used for HIV DNA integration experiments were undifferentiated and were maintained in proliferating condition. Typically, only a small ratio of cultured NPCs is infected with HIV; however, the entire NPC population proliferates. Therefore, a decrease in detected HIV DNA at 72 h postinfection as compared with 48 h may stem from the fast proliferation of the entire NPC culture and “diluting” HIV DNA within the total genomic DNA. To address the mechanisms of increased p24 production in METH-pretreated HIV-infected cells, we focused on transcriptional regulation of HIV replication. NFκB and SP1 are considered the main regulatory elements of the HIV LTR, and binding sites for both transcription factors are present in the core of the HIV enhancer. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of METH on activation of NFκB and SP1 in mNPCs. It has been reported previously that cellular effects of METH involve impaired regulation of these transcription factors (32Lee J. Kosaras B. Aleyasin H. Han J.A. Park D.S. Ratan R.R. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Lee S.W. Ryu H. Role of cyclooxygenase-2 induction by transcription factor Sp1 and Sp3 in neuronal oxidative and DNA damage response.FASEB J. 2006; 20 (17012241): 2375-237710.1096/fj.06-5957fjeCrossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Hagiwara H. Iyo M. Hashimoto K. Mithramycin protects against dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the mouse brain after administration of methamphetamine.Brain Res. 2009; 1301 (19748494): 189-19610.1016/j.brainres.2009.09.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, not much is known about activation of these factors in NPCs. Because acetylation at Lys-310 is required for full transcriptional activity of NFκB, acetylated NFκB/p65 was analyzed as a marker for NFκB activation. Regarding SP1, phosphorylation was shown to play a critical role in transcriptional activity and stability of this transcription factor (34Tan N.Y. Khachigian L.M. Sp1 phosphorylation and its regulation of gene transcription.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29 (19273606): 2483-248810.1128/MCB.01828-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed phosphorylated SP1 as the indicator of its activation. METH exposure (100 μm) induced translocation of acetylated NFκB and phosphorylated SP1 into the nuclei. Whereas acetylated NFκB was equally distributed throughout the nuclei, phosphorylated SP1 was forming foci. Representative images illustrating these changes are presented in the top panels, and the quantitative data in the form of bar graphs are shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 3 (A and B). NFκB was activated by a 1-h exposure to METH and EcoHIV by 38 and 33%, respectively. When added together, METH plus EcoHIV increased the intensity of acetylated NFκB fluorescence in the nuclei by 52% (Fig. 3A). A similar pattern of changes was observed with activation of SP1. METH and EcoHIV treatment for 30 min increased the number of foci corresponding to phosphorylated SP1 in the nuclei by 48 and 41%, respectively. METH and EcoHIV added together increased the number of foci by 58% (Fig. 3B). We also analyzed NFκB and SP1 activation in hNPCs to confirm that similar mechanistic events take place in human and mouse NPCs. Fig. S1 demonstrates that both NFκB and SP1 were activated by METH and/or HIV treatment in hNPC. Whereas the changes in METH- and/or EcoHIV-induced activation of NFκB and SP1 were not robust (although significant), the significance of these results was next addressed in functional studies by transfection of mNPCs with the plasmid pXP1 LTR WT, containing the complete HIV LTR sequence upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (nucleotides −644 to +77; Fig. 4A), along with the control plasmid pR-SV40. The transfected cells were treated with vehicle and/or with METH in the presence or absence of EcoHIV. Then luciferase activity was measured as a marker of HIV replication. As indicated in Fig. 4B, exposure to METH significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of the HIV LTR. To analyze the functional role of the SP1 and/or κB enhancer in METH-induced activation of the HIV LTR, variants of pXP1 LTR containing mutations in the SP1-binding site and/or deletion of the κB enhancer were employed (Fig. 4A). Cells were co-transfected with one of these reporter constructs, along with a control plasmid, followed by a luciferase activity assay. The removal of functional SP1- or NFκB-binding sites decreased the basal expression of HIV LTR transcriptional activity and completely prevented METH-induced effects. These results indicate that both NFκB and SP1 sites are necessary for stimulation of HIV replication by METH. We next assessed whether METH-induced HIV infectivity affects differentiation of NPCs. Primary mNPCs were treated with 100 μm METH in the presence or absence of EcoHIV under cell culture conditions that induce differentiation (i.e. without growth factors and in restricted availability of serum). Neurogenesis was monitored by counting doublecortin (DCX)- and neuronal-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)-positive cells at different time points throughout the differentiation process for up to 10 days. DCX is a marker of immature neurons, and NeuN is a marker for mature neurons. At day 10 after initiation of differentiation, the numbers of both DCX- and NeuN-positive cells were significantly decreased in the METH plus EcoHIV group, when compared with control (Fig. 5). Representative images illustrating these changes are presented in the top panels, and the quantitative data from these experiments are shown in the form of bar graphs (bottom panels). Further, we analyzed and compared the morphology of newly differentiated neurons from different experimental groups. The ratio of multipolar neurons was decreased, whereas the pool of anaxonic neurons was increased in the HIV, METH, and METH + HIV groups when compared with control (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, a decrease in complexity of multipolar neurons in all of the above groups was observed (Fig. 6B). In addition, we identified neuronal and glia cell population derived from differentiated mNPCs at day 14 by FACS based on the cell surface signatures specific to distinct cell types (35Yuan S.H. Martin J. Elia J. Flippin J. Paramban R.I. Hefferan M.P. Vidal J.G. Mu Y. Killian R.L. Israel M.A. Emre N. Marsala S. Marsala M. Gage F.H. Goldstein L.S. Carson C.T.

CD184 and CD44 are two major markers on which the distinction between differentiated glia and neurons was based. In detached cells that form a single cell suspension, CD184 content is lost from the vast majority of the neurons (35Yuan S.H. Martin J. Elia J. Flippin J. Paramban R.I. Hefferan M.P. Vidal J.G.

In addition, CD24 was used to confirm the differentiation processes. Cells were first examined for live/dead aqua staining. Then the CD24+ population was identified, which appeared to be almost 100% of the total cell population. CD24+ cells were next separated based on distinct patterns of CD184 and CD44 immunoreactivity: CD184+/CD44+ cells were predicted to be glial cells, whereas CD184−/CD44− cells were predicted to be neurons. The sorting procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7 (A and B), and the quantitative results are reflected in Fig. 7 (C and D). METH treatment in both noninfected and HIV-infected cells caused a significant ∼3-fold decrease in glial (i.e. CD24+/CD184+/CD44+) cells as compared with controls (Fig. 6C). In contrast, neurons (i.e. CD24+/CD184−/CD44− cells) decreased only in the METH plus HIV group (Fig. 6D). It is noteworthy that the decreased number of neurons and glial cells was not associated with a loss in cell viability (Fig. S3). Therefore, most likely it was an outcome of impaired/delayed neurogenesis and differentiation processes. To assess the purity of isolated cells, CD24+/CD184+/CD44+ and CD24+/CD184−/CD44− cells were plated after sorting, cultured for 5 days, and then co-stained for neuronal (Tuj-1) and astrocytic (GFAP) markers. As shown in Fig. 7E, the obtained cell populations were pure, and no cross-contamination was observed. Sorted populations of differentiated neurons and glial cells derived from infected mNPCs were next analyzed for integrated HIV DNA. Interestingly, a high number of copies of integrated HIV DNA was detected in both cell populations. As many as 37,775 ± 8,019 copies/100,000 cells were detected in neurons, and 46,981 ± 4,269 copies/100,000 cells were identified in glial cells (Fig. 8A). Despite the fact that NPC-derived daughter cells carry a substantial number of integrated HIV DNA copies, only trace levels of extracellular HIV p24 were detected in these cultures (∼100 pg/ml). To determine whether differentiated mNPCs were latently infected, we performed HIV reactivation studies. mNPCs were differentiated for 2 weeks as in Fig. 8A; then we attempted to reactivate the virus by using different treatment conditions. Treatment with vorinostat (suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) at both 5 and 10 μm) added together with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 3 days increased HIV production by ∼2-fold (Fig. 8B) and expression by ∼7-fold (Fig. 8C), when compared with the HIV group. Because NPCs are located in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, we analyzed effects of METH with or without EcoHIV on neurogenesis in this particular brain region. BrdU was used to detect proliferating cells. BrdU incorpora"

One possible approach to reducing the detrimental health effects of cystic fibrosis could be the identification of proteins whose suppression rescues F508del-CFTR function in bronchial epithelial cells. However, searches for these potential targets have not yet been conducted, particularly in a relevant airway background using a functional readout. To identify proteins associated with F508del-CFTR processing, we used a high-throughput functional assay to screen an siRNA library targeting 6,650 different cellular proteins. We identified 37 proteins whose silencing significantly rescued F508del-CFTR activity, as indicated by enhanced anion transport through the plasma membrane. These proteins included FAU, UBE2I, UBA52, MLLT6, UBA2, CHD4, PLXNA1, and TRIM24, among others. We focused our attention on FAU, a poorly characterized protein with unknown function. FAU knockdown increased the plasma membrane targeting and function of F508del-CFTR, but not of wild-type CFTR. Investigation into the mechanism of action revealed a preferential physical interaction of FAU with mutant CFTR, leading to its degradation. FAU and other proteins identified in our screening may offer a therapeutically relevant panel of drug targets to correct basic defects in F508del-CFTR processing."

We performed admixture mapping of the blood pressure traits systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP), in a dataset of 12,116 participants from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Hispanics/Latinos have three predominant ancestral populations (European, African, and Amerindian), for each of which we separately tested local ancestry intervals across the genome. We identified four regions that were significantly associated with a blood pressure trait at the genome-wide admixture mapping level. A 6p21.31 Amerindian ancestry association region has multiple known associations, but none explained the admixture mapping signal. We identified variants that completely explained this signal. One of these variants had p-values of 0.02 (MAP) and 0.04 (SBP) in replication testing in Pima Indians. A 11q13.4 Amerindian ancestry association region spans a variant that was previously reported (p-value = 0.001) in a targeted association study of Blood Pressure (BP) traits and variants in the vitamin D pathway. There was no replication evidence supporting an association in the identified 17q25.3 Amerindian ancestry association region. For a region on 6p12.3, associated with African ancestry, we did not identify any candidate variants driving the association. It may be driven by rare variants. Whole genome sequence data may be necessary to fine map these association signals, which may contribute to disparities in BP traits between diverse populations."

The morphology of the newly formed bone in the cervical spine is different compared to the thoracic spine, possibly due to dissimilarities in local vascular anatomy. In this study the spatial relationship of the new bone with the arterial system, trachea and esophagus was analyzed and compared between subjects with and without DISH.Cervical computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained from five patients with dysphagia and DISH and ten control subjects. The location of the vertebral and carotid arteries, surface area of the hyperostosis and distance between the vertebral body and the trachea and esophagus was assessed in the axial view.The surface area of the newly formed bone was located symmetrically anterior to the vertebral body. The ossifications were non-flowing in the sagittal view and no segmental vessels were observed. Substantial displacement of the trachea/esophagus was present in the group with DISH compared to the controls.The hyperostosis at the cervical level was symmetrically distributed anterior to the vertebral bodies without a flowing pattern, in contrast to the asymmetrical flowing pattern typically found in the thoracic spine. The hypothesis that the vascular system acts as a natural barrier against new bone formation in DISH could be further supported with these findings. The significant ventral displacement of the trachea and esophagus may explain the mechanism of dysphagia and airway obstruction in DISH."

Using a negative priming paradigm, we investigated whether the ability to compare the magnitude of decimal numbers in the context in which the smallest number has the greatest number of digits after the decimal point (1.45 vs. 1.5) is rooted in part on the ability to inhibit the “greater the number of digits the greater its magnitude” misconception derived from a property of whole numbers. In Experiment 1, we found a typical negative priming effect with 7th graders requiring more time to compare decimal numbers in which the largest number has the greatest number of digits after the decimal point (1.65 vs. 1.5) after comparing decimal numbers in which the smallest number has the greatest number of digits after the decimal point (1.45 vs. 1.5) than after comparing decimal numbers with the same number of digits after the decimal point (1.5 vs. 1.6). In Experiment 2, we found a negative priming effect when decimal numbers preceded items in which 7th graders had to compare the length of two lines. Taken together our results suggest that the ability to compare decimal numbers in which the smallest number has the greatest number of digits is rooted in part on the ability to inhibit the “greater the number of digits the greater its magnitude” misconception and in part on the ability to inhibit the length of the decimal number per se."

However, the long-term effects of HCS deficiency are poorly understood. Here, we report our investigations of bpl-1, which encodes the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of HCS. We found that mutations in the biotin-binding region of bpl-1 are maternal-effect lethal and cause defects in embryonic polarity establishment, meiosis, and the integrity of the eggshell permeability barrier. We confirmed that BPL-1 biotinylates four carboxylase enzymes, and we demonstrate that BPL-1 is required for efficient de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. We also show that the lack of larval growth defects as well as nearly normal fatty acid composition in young adult worms is due to sufficient fatty acid precursors provided by dietary bacteria. However, BPL-1 disruption strongly decreased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in embryos produced by bpl-1 mutant hermaphrodites, revealing a critical role for BPL-1 in lipid biosynthesis during embryogenesis and demonstrating that dietary fatty acids and lipid precursors are not adequate to support early embryogenesis in the absence of BPL-1.

The present study was conducted to examine the protective effect of Malva sylvestris L. extract on ischemia-reperfusion-induced kidney injury and remote organ injuries in the liver. Before ischemia-reperfusion, rats in the different groups received intraperitoneal normal saline or mallow extract at the doses of 200, 400 or 600 mg/kg of body weight. After 30-minutes of bilateral renal ischemia followed by 24-hours of reperfusion, tissue damage in the kidney and liver samples were determined through studying H&E-stained slides under a light microscope. The degree of leukocyte infiltration and tissue mRNA expressions of TNF- and ICAM-1 were then measured to examine the degree of renal inflammation. The renal tissue MDA and FRAP levels were measured for determining the amount of oxidative stress. Plasma concentrations of creatinine, urea, ALT and ALP were also measured. Ischemia-reperfusion led to a significant increase in plasma concentrations of creatinine, urea, ALT and ALP, and renal tissue MDA, and a significant decrease in renal tissue FRAP. The expression of pro-inflammatory factors in the kidney tissue, the level of leukocyte infiltration and the amount of tissue damage in the kidney and liver also increased. Pretreatment by mallow extract led to a significant improvement in all the variables measured. The 200- and 400-mg doses yielded better results in most parameters compared to the 600-mg dose. The findings showed that mallow extract protects the kidney against ischemia-reperfusion and reduces remote organ injury in the liver."

In contrast, the wild type contained 5–7 starch granules per chloroplast. Mature and old leaves of the double mutant were essentially starch free and showed plastidial disintegration. Several analyses revealed that the number of starch granules per chloroplast was affected by the dark phase. So far, it was unclear if it was the dark phase per se or starch degradation in the dark that was connected to the observed decrease in the number of starch granules per chloroplast. Therefore, in the background of the double mutant dpe2/phs1, a triple mutant was generated lacking the initial starch degrading enzyme glucan, water dikinase (GWD). The triple mutant showed improved plant growth, a starch-excess phenotype, and a homogeneous starch distribution. Furthermore, the number of starch granules per chloroplast was increased and was similar to wild type. However, starch granule morphology was only slightly affected by the lack of GWD as in the triple mutant and, like in dpe2/phs1, more spherical starch granules were observed.

Studying how proteins are correctly folded and assembled into such complexes in a living cell is important for understanding the physiological roles and the qualitative and quantitative regulation of the complex. However, few methods are suitable for analyzing these rapidly occurring processes. Site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking is an elegant technique that enables analysis of protein–protein interactions in living cells with high spatial resolution. However, the conventional site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking method is unsuitable for analyzing dynamic processes. Here, by combining an improved site-directed in vivo photo-cross-linking technique with a pulse–chase approach, we developed a new method that can analyze the folding and assembly of a newly synthesized protein with high spatiotemporal resolution. We demonstrate that this method, named the pulse–chase and in vivo photo-cross-linking experiment (PiXie), enables the kinetic analysis of the formation of an Escherichia coli periplasmic (soluble) protein complex (PhoA). We also used our new technique to investigate assembly/folding processes of two membrane complexes (SecD–SecF in the inner membrane and LptD–LptE in the outer membrane), which provided new insights into the biogenesis of these complexes. Our PiXie method permits analysis of the dynamic behavior of various proteins and enables examination of protein–protein interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. We anticipate that our new technique will have valuable utility for studies of protein dynamics in many organisms."

Vaccination of cattle and other species might in some cases provide the only suitable control strategy for BTB, while in others it may supplement existing test-and-slaughter schemes. However, the use of live BCG has several limitations and the global rise of HIV/AIDS infections has furthermore warranted the exploration of inactivated vaccine preparations. The aim of this study was to compare the immune response profiles in response to parenteral vaccination with live BCG and two inactivated vaccine candidates in cattle. Twenty-four mixed breed calves (Bos taurus) aged 4-6 months, were allocated to one of four groups and vaccinated sub-cutaneously with live M. bovis BCG (Danish 1331), formalin-inactivated M. bovis BCG, heat-killed M. bovis or PBS/Montanide™ (control). Interferon-γ responsiveness and antibody production were measured prior to vaccination and at weekly intervals thereafter for twelve weeks. At nine weeks post-priming, animals were skin tested using tuberculins and MTBC specific protein cocktails and subsequently challenged through intranodular injection of live M. bovis BCG. The animals in the heat-killed M. bovis group demonstrated strong and sustained cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, significantly higher than the control group in response to vaccination, which may indicate a protective immune profile. Animals in this group showed reactivity to the skin test reagents, confirming good vaccine take. Lastly, although not statistically significant, recovery of BCG after challenge was lowest in the heat-killed M. bovis group. In conclusion, the parenteral heat-killed M. bovis vaccine proved to be clearly immunogenic in cattle in the present study, urging further evaluation of the vaccine in challenge studies using virulent M. bovis and assessment of vaccine efficacy in field conditions."

Our group found a variant with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IL13 gene at position +2044G>A (rs20541) that was expected to result in the non-conservative replacement of a positively charged arginine (R) with a neutral glutamine (Q) at position 144. IL-13Q144 was associated with augmented allergic airway inflammation and bronchial asthma remodeling. There is some indication that anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies can demonstrate a positive effect on the clinical course of refractory asthmatic patients. To date, the binding stability of these agents for IL-13Q144 is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the prediction efficacy of the anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies tralokinumab and lebrikizumab in asthmatic patients with IL-13R144 and IL-13Q144. The three-dimensional (3-D) structure of tralokinumab was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5L6Y), and the complete 3-D structure of lebrikizumab was built through homology modeling. For the binding stability analysis, we performed and analyzed docking simulations of IL-13 with tralokinumab or lebrikizumab. The tralokinumab and lebrikizumab structures changed after binding to IL-13 to facilitate binding with IL-13Q144. The stability analysis with tralokinumab and lebrikizumab demonstrated that IL-13Q144 was more stable than IL-13R144 for both the Rosetta energy score and for the free energy of binding. IL-13Q144 might be a promising predictor of responsiveness to tralokinumab and lebrikizumab treatment for bronchial asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2770669907,"Alcohol use and alcohol-related problems, including accidents, vandalism and violence, at sporting events are of increased concern in Sweden and other countries. The relationship between alcohol use and violence has been established and can be explained by the level of intoxication. Given the occurrence of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems at sporting events, research has assessed intoxication levels measured through biological sampling among spectators. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the level of alcohol intoxication among spectators at football matches in the Swedish Premier Football League. Spectators were randomly selected and invited to participate in the study. Alcohol intoxication was measured with a breath analyser for Blood Alcohol Concentration levels, and data on gender, age, and recent alcohol use were gathered through a face-to-face interview. Blood Alcohol Concentration samples from 4420 spectators were collected. Almost half (46.8%) had a positive Blood Alcohol Concentration level, with a mean value of 0.063%, while 8.9% had a Blood Alcohol Concentration level ≥ 0.1%, with a mean value of 0.135%. Factors that predicted a higher Blood Alcohol Concentration level included male gender (p = 0.005), lower age (p < 0.001), attending a local derby (p < 0.001), alcohol use prior to having entered the arena (p < 0.001), attending a weekend match (p < 0.001), and being a spectator at supporter sections (p < 0.001). About half of all spectators at football matches in the Swedish Premier Football League drink alcohol in conjunction with the match. Approximately one tenth have a high level of alcohol intoxication."
https://openalex.org/W2768638443,"Functional cross-talk between the promoter and terminator of a gene has long been noted. Promoters and terminators are juxtaposed to form gene loops in several organisms, and gene looping is thought to be involved in transcriptional regulation. The general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and the C-terminal domain phosphatase Ssu72, essential factors of the transcription preinitiation complex and the mRNA processing and polyadenylation complex, respectively, are important for gene loop formation. TFIIB and Ssu72 interact both genetically and physically, but the molecular basis of this interaction is not known. Here we present a crystal structure of the core domain of TFIIB in two new conformations that differ in the relative distance and orientation of the two cyclin-like domains. The observed extraordinary conformational plasticity may underlie the binding of TFIIB to multiple transcription factors and promoter DNAs that occurs in distinct stages of transcription, including initiation, reinitiation, and gene looping. We mapped the binding interface of the TFIIB-Ssu72 complex using a series of systematic, structure-guided in vitro binding and site-specific photocross-linking assays. Our results indicate that Ssu72 competes with acidic activators for TFIIB binding and that Ssu72 disrupts an intramolecular TFIIB complex known to impede transcription initiation. We also show that the TFIIB-binding site on Ssu72 overlaps with the binding site of symplekin, a component of the mRNA processing and polyadenylation complex. We propose a hand-off model in which Ssu72 mediates a conformational transition in TFIIB, accounting for the role of Ssu72 in transcription reinitiation, gene looping, and promoter-terminator cross-talk."
https://openalex.org/W2769939072,"The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and the cell cortex plays important roles in cell division, polarity, and migration. A critical adaptor that links the plus ends of microtubules with the cell cortex is the KANK N-terminal motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (KANK1)/kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) complex. Genetic defects in these two proteins are associated with various cancers and developmental diseases, such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and the role of the conserved ankyrin (ANK) repeats in this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, revealed that a five-helix-bundle–capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 forms a structural and functional supramodule with its ANK repeats in binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide located in the middle of KIF21A. We also show that several missense mutations present in cancer patients are located at the interface of the KANK1·KIF21A complex and destabilize its formation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying the KANK1/KIF21A interaction and also provides possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A.

Therefore, the KANK1·KIF21A complex mediates diverse signaling pathways linking MTs with cell adhesions. Given the critical roles of the KANK1·KIF21A complex both in assembly of the MT–cell cortex macromolecular complexes and etiologies of developmental diseases and cancers, it is important to elucidate the mechanistic basis governing the interaction between KANK1 and KIF21A. In this work, we characterize the KANK1/KIF21A interaction in detail. The high-resolution crystal structure of the KANK1·KIF21A complex solved here reveals that the highly conserved fragment immediately preceding the ANK repeats of KANK1 adopts a folded domain structure and directly interacts with its ANK repeats, forming a structural and functional supramodule capable of specifically binding to an evolutionarily conserved peptide fragment located in the middle of KIF21A. We further show that mutations in KANK1 and KIF21A present in cancer patients destabilize or even eliminate the complex formation of the two proteins, thus providing possible mechanistic explanations for the diseases caused by the mutations of the two proteins. KANK1 recruits KIF21A to cell cortex by binding to a 38-amino acid (aa) fragment in the middle of KIF21A (aa 1142–1180; human KIF21A: NP_001166935) through its ANK repeats (20van der Vaart B. van Riel W.E.

We first confirmed the KANK1/KIF21A interaction by showing that a KANK1 fragment (aa 1081–1360, NP_852069; referred to as the KANK1 ANK domain), composed of several ANK repeats and an extended fragment N-terminal to the ANK repeats, binds to a fragment of mouse KIF21A (aa 1127–1169, NP_001102512), which covers the previously discovered 38-residue sequence of human KIF21A with a Kd value of ∼0.22 μm (Fig. 1B). Using a truncation-based approach, a 19-residue fragment of KIF21A (aa 1138–1156; referred to as the KANK1-binding domain (KBD)) was sufficient to bind to the KANK1 ANK domain (Kd ∼0.58 μm) (Fig. 1, B and C). Further deletion of the KIF21A KBD at its C terminus (aa 1138–1148) showed no detectable binding to the KANK1 ANK domain (Fig. 1B). We further demonstrated that the KANK1 ANK domain and the KIF21A KBD form a stable 1:1 stoichiometric complex in solution (Fig. 1D). To understand the mechanistic basis of the KANK1/KIF21A interaction, we solved the crystal structure of the KANK1 ANK domain in complex with a synthetic KIF21A KBD peptide at 2.1 Å resolution using the molecular replacement method (Table 1). Each asymmetric unit contains one complex with 1:1 stoichiometry that is consistent with our biochemical analysis (Figs. 1D and 2A).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collection and processing SourceSSRF-BL19U1 Wavelength (Å)0.97538 Space groupP212121 Unit cell a, b, c (Å)35.513, 51.958, 136.984 α, β, γ (degrees)90, 90, 90 Resolution range (Å)50.00–2.10 (2.14–2.10) No. of unique reflections14,123 (484) Redundancy4.3 (2.5) I/σ (I)11.3 (2.0) Completeness (%)92.2 (65.2) Rmerge (%)aRmerge = ∑|Ii − Im|/∑Ii, where Ii is the intensity of the measured reflection, and Im is the mean intensity of all symmetry-related reflections.10.4 (42.2) Wilson B27.1Structure refinement Resolution (Å)41.39–2.11 (2.19–2.11) RworkbRcryst = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure factors./RfreecRfree = ΣT‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/ΣT|Fo|, where T is a test data set of about 5% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside before refinement.

Open table in a new tab In the complex structure, the KANK1 ANK domain contains five ANK repeats with the typical helix-turn-helix conformation (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, a capping domain immediately preceding the ANK repeats adopts a compact helix bundle structure composed of five α-helices (Fig. 2 (A and B) and Figs. S1 and S2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where a folded domain functions as a capping structural element for ANK repeats. We performed a homologous structure search using the DALI server (35Holm L. Sander C. Protein structure comparison by alignment of distance matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233 (8377180): 123-13810.1006/jmbi.1993.1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). No homologous structure was found during the search. Further amino acid sequence alignment analysis of the capping domain from the KANK family of proteins reveals that both the secondary structure and the residues forming the hydrophobic core of the capping domain are highly conserved (Figs. S1 and S2), implying that all members of the KANK family of proteins contain a similar capping domain before their ANK repeats. The crystal structure of the KANK2 ANK domain has been deposited as part of a Structural Genomics Consortium project (PDB entry 4HBD), with no associated publication. We superposed the ANK domains of KANK1 and KANK2 and found that the ANK domain of KANK2 has an architecture similar to that of KANK1 (Fig. 2C). The KIF21A KBD peptide adopts two short α-helices connected by a short loop and occupies the elongated concave groove formed by the inner αA helices and finger-like hairpin loops (finger loops) connecting two consecutive ANK repeats of KANK1 (Fig. 2, A and B). It should be noted that the first finger loop connects the capping domain and the first ANK repeat of KANK1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The electron densities of the residues of the KIF21A peptide are clearly defined in the complex (Fig. 2D). The interaction interface between KANK1 ANK and KIF21A KBD can be arbitrarily divided into two regions based on the interaction property: 1) the polar interaction site and 2) the hydrophobic interaction site (Fig. 3, A–C). The binding in site I is mainly mediated by the hydrogen-bonding interactions and the electrostatic interactions (Fig. 3A). For example, the side chain of Arg-1143KIF21A forms salt bridges with the side chains of Glu-1284KANK1 and Asp-1306KANK1 and forms a hydrogen bond with Ser-1276KANK1. The side chain of Glu-1284KANK1, in turn, interacts with the side chain of Arg-1144KIF21A, which is further stabilized by the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction between Arg-1144KIF21A and Asn-1140KIF21A (Fig. 3, A and C). In addition, the side chain of Asp-1308KANK1 interacts with the side chain of Lys-1141KIF21A; the side chain of His-1285KANK1 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Thr-1146KIF21A. Consistent with the interactions observed in the complex structure, mutations that disrupt these polar interactions weakened or even abolished the KANK1/KIF21A interaction (Fig. 3, E and F). Several key residues (i.e. Thr-1147, Leu-1152, Leu-1153, and Tyr-1154) at the C-terminal half of the KIF21A KBD peptide contact with the hydrophobic patch formed by Tyr-1176, Met-1209, Leu-1210, Leu-1213, and Leu-1248 from KANK1 (Fig. 3, B and C). Substitution of Tyr-1176KANK1 or Leu-1248KANK1 with Asp totally disrupted the interaction (Fig. 3E). Reciprocally, either the L1152D or the L1153A mutant of the KIF21A KBD peptide eliminated its binding to the KANK1 ANK domain (Fig. 3F). Importantly, all of the residues that contribute to the interaction are absolutely conserved in KANK1 and KIF21A from different species (Fig. 3D and Fig. S1), implicating the indispensable functions of the KANK1/KIF21A interaction throughout the evolution. To confirm that binding of KIF21A is a common feature among all of the KANK family proteins, we performed careful sequence analysis of KANK1–4 ANKs. We noticed that the ANK domain of KANK2 has essentially the same KIF21A KBD–binding residues as that of KANK1 (Fig. S1), indicating that the KANK2 ANK domain may also bind to KIF21A. Satisfyingly, the KIF21A KBD peptide bound to KANK2 ANK with an affinity comparable with that for its binding to KANK1 ANK (Fig. 4A). However, the residues corresponding to those involved in the KIF21A binding of KANK1/2 ANKs include some variations in KANK3/4 ANKs (Fig. S1). In line with this observation, the ANK domains of KANK3 and KANK4 displayed no detectable binding to the KIF21A KBD peptide (Fig. 4, B and C). Collectively, these data confirm the prediction from the structural analysis that only KANK1 and KANK2 are capable of binding to KIF21A. An interesting structural feature revealed by the complex structure is that an α-helical capping domain couples tightly with the ANK repeats of KANK1 (Fig. 5A). The first finger loop connects the α3-α5 of the capping domain and the α1A-α1B of the first ANK repeat (ANK1) of KANK1 (Figs. 2A and 5A). The coupling interface is mainly mediated by the hydrophobic interactions (e.g. Trp-1130, Val-1144, and Ile-1148 from α3-α4 of the capping domain; Ile-1185, Leu-1188, and Leu-1189 from α1B of the ANK1) (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition to the hydrophobic packing interface, several polar interactions also contribute to the capping domain/ANK repeats (CAP/ANK) interaction. For example, the side chain of Asn-1182 forms a hyd"

To assess the effect of long-term different irrigation patterns on soil P fractions and availability, this study examined sequential changes in soil organic P and inorganic P from furrow irrigation (FI), surface drip irrigation (SUR), and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) in the brown soil zone (0-60 cm) during 1998 to 2011. Analyses of soil P behavior showed that the levels of total P are frequently high on top soil layers. The total P (TP) contents of the entire soil profiles under three irrigation treatments were 830.2-3180.1 mg/kg. The contents of available P (AP) were 72.6-319.3 mg P/kg soil through soil profiles. The greatest TP and AP contents were obtained within the upper soil layers in FI. Results of Hedley's P fractionation indicate that HCl-P is a dominant form and the proportion to TP ranges from 29% to 43% in all three methods. The contents of various fractions of P were positively correlated with the levels of total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), and calcium (Ca), whereas the P fractions had negative correlation with pH in all soil samples. Regression models proved that NaHCO3-Po was an important factor in determining the amount of AP in FI. H2O-Po, NaHCO3-Po, and NaOH-Pi were related to available P values in SUR. NaHCO3-Po and NaOH-Po played important roles in SDI. The tomato yield under SUR was higher than SDI and FI. The difference of P availability was also controlled by the physicochemical soil properties under different irrigation schedule. SUR was a reasonable irrigation pattern to improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer."

Of these, mosquitoes could emerge as one of the most important vectors because of their ability to transmit significant numbers of pathogens and parasites throughout the world. Recent studies have implicated Anopheles gambiae as a potential vector of Rickettsia felis. Herein we report that a metagenome sequencing study identified rickettsial sequence reads in culicine mosquitoes from the Republic of Korea. The detected rickettsiae were characterized by a genus-specific quantitative real-time PCR assay and sequencing of rrs, gltA, 17kDa, ompB, and sca4 genes. Three novel rickettsial genotypes were detected (Rickettsia sp. A12.2646, Rickettsia sp. A12.2638 and Rickettsia sp. A12.3271), from Mansonia uniformis, Culex pipiens, and Aedes esoensis, respectively. The results underscore the need to determine the Rickettsia species diversity associated with mosquitoes, their evolution, distribution and pathogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2769322679,"Sulfur dioxide (SO2), a gaseous signaling molecule in animal cells, has recently been found to play a physiological role in plants. Here we studied the role of SO2 in gibberellic acid (GA3)-induced programmed cell death (PCD) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) aleurone layers. The application of the SO2 donor (NaHSO3/Na2SO3, 1:3 M/M) effectively alleviated PCD in barley aleurone layers in a dose-dependent manner with an optimal concentration of 50 μM. Further investigations showed that SO2 reduced the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (⋅O2−) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in aleurone layers. Moreover, the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) were enhanced by SO2 donor treatment. Meanwhile, lipoxygenase (LOX) activity was attenuated by SO2 donor treatment. Furthermore, an induction of endogenous H2S and NO were also observed in SO2-treated aleurone layers, suggesting interactions of SO2 with other well-known signaling molecules. Taken together, we show that SO2 negatively regulated PCD by acting as an antioxidant to scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2770325954,"Introduction The relationship between pituitary TSH and thyroid hormones is central to our understanding of thyroid physiology and thyroid function testing. Here, we generated distribution patterns by using validated tools of thyroid modelling. Methods We simulated patterns of individual set points under various conditions, based on a homeostatic model of thyroid feedback control. These were compared with observed data points derived from clinical trials. Results A random mix of individual set points was reconstructed by simulative modelling with defined structural parameters. The pattern displayed by the cluster of hypothetical points resembled that observed in a natural control group. Moderate variation of the TSH-FT4 gradient over the functional range introduced further flexibility, implementing a scenario of adaptive set points. Such a scenario may be a realistic possibility for instance in treatment where relationships and equilibria between thyroid parameters are altered by various influences such as LT4 dose and conversion efficiency. Conclusions We validated a physiologically based homeostatic model that permits simulative reconstruction of individual set points. This produced a pattern resembling the observed data under various conditions. Applied modelling, although still experimental at this stage, shows a potential to aid our physiological understanding of the interplay between TSH and thyroid hormones. It should eventually benefit personalised clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2770977216,"The protein p27Kip1 (p27), a member of the Cip-Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, is involved in tumorigenesis and a correlation between reduced levels of this protein in human tumours and a worse prognosis has been established. Recent reports revealed that p27 also behaves as a transcriptional regulator. Thus, it has been postulated that the development of tumours with low amounts of p27 could be propitiated by deregulation of transcriptional programs under the control of p27. However, these programs still remain mostly unknown. The aim of this study has been to define the transcriptional programs regulated by p27 by first identifying the p27-binding sites (p27-BSs) on the whole chromatin of quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The chromatin regions associated to p27 have been annotated to the most proximal genes and it has been considered that the expression of these genes could by regulated by p27. The identification of the chromatin p27-BSs has been performed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq). Results revealed that p27 associated with 1839 sites that were annotated to 1417 different genes being 852 of them protein coding genes. Interestingly, most of the p27-BSs were in distal intergenic regions and introns whereas, in contrast, its association with promoter regions was very low. Gene ontology analysis of the protein coding genes revealed a number of relevant transcriptional programs regulated by p27 as cell adhesion, intracellular signalling and neuron differentiation among others. We validated the interaction of p27 with different chromatin regions by ChIP followed by qPCR and demonstrated that the expressions of several genes belonging to these programs are actually regulated by p27. Finally, cell adhesion assays revealed that the adhesion of p27-/- cells to the plates was much higher that controls, revealing a role of p27 in the regulation of a transcriptional program involved in cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2768362012,"Aβ-Immunotherapy has long been studied in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but not how other molecules involved in the disease can affect antibody performance. We previously designed an antibody fragment, scFv-h3D6, and showed that it precludes Aβ-induced cytotoxicity by withdrawing Aβ oligomers from the amyloid pathway towards a non-toxic, worm-like pathway. ScFv-h3D6 was effective at the behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Because scFv-h3D6 treatment restored apolipoprotein E (apoE) and J (apoJ) concentrations to non-pathological values, and Aβ internalization by glial cells was found to be decreased in the presence of these apolipoproteins, we now aimed to test the influence of scFv-h3D6 on Aβ aggregation and cellular uptake by primary human astrocytes in the presence of therapeutic apoE and apoJ mimetic peptides (MPs). Firstly, we demonstrated by CD and FTIR that the molecules used in this work were well folded. Next, interactions between apoE or apoJ-MP, scFv-h3D6 and Aβ were studied by CD. The conformational change induced by the interaction of Aβ with apoE-MP was much bigger than the induced with apoJ-MP, in line with the observed formation of protective worm-like fibrils by the scFv-h3D6/Aβ complex in the presence of apoJ-MP, but not of apoE-MP. ScFv-h3D6, apoJ-MP, and apoE-MP to a different extent reduced Aβ uptake by astrocytes, and apoE-MP partially interfered with the dramatic reduction by scFv-h3D6 while apoJ-MP had no effect on scFv-h3D6 action. As sustained Aβ uptake by astrocytes may impair their normal functions, and ultimately neuronal viability, this work shows another beneficence of scFv-h3D6 treatment, which is not further improved by the use of apoE or apoJ mimetic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2770350060,"It has recently been shown that signal peptide peptidase (SPP) can catalyze the intramembrane cleavage of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) that leads to translocation of HO-1 into the cytosol and nucleus. While there is consensus that translocated HO-1 promotes tumor progression and drug resistance, the physiological signals leading to SPP-mediated intramembrane cleavage of HO-1 and the specificity of the process remain unclear. In this study, we used co-immunoprecipitation and confocal laser scanning microscopy to investigate the translocation mechanism of HO-1 and its regulation by SPP. We show that HO-1 and the closely related HO-2 isoenzyme bind to SPP under normoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions SPP mediates intramembrane cleavage of HO-1, but not HO-2. In experiments with an inactive HO-1 mutant (H25A) we show that translocation is independent of the catalytic activity of HO-1. Studies with HO-1 / HO-2 chimeras indicate that the membrane anchor, the PEST-domain and the nuclear shuttle sequence of HO-1 are necessary for full cleavage and subsequent translocation under hypoxic conditions. In the presence of co-expressed exogenous SPP, the anchor and the PEST-domain are sufficient for translocation. Taken together, we identified the domains involved in HO-1 translocation and showed that SPP-mediated cleavage is isoform-specific and independent of HO-activity. A closer understanding of the translocation mechanism of HO-1 is of particular importance because nuclear HO-1 seems to lead to tumor progression and drug resistance."

Methods We enrolled 16,454 non-diabetic participants from Kailuan cohort. Fasting blood glucose concentrations were measured in 2006, 2008, and 2010 survey. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocities were measured during 2011 to 2016. Multivariate regression model was used to estimate the difference of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity levels and logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of arterial stiffness risk, according to the fasting blood glucose trajectories. Results We identified five distinct fasting blood glucose trajectories and each of the trajectories was labeled according to its range and change over 2006–2010 survey: elevated-stable pattern (5.0% of participants), elevated-decreasing pattern (6.6%), moderate-increasing pattern (10.9%), moderate-stable pattern (59.3%), and low-stable pattern (18.2%). After adjustment for potential confounders, individuals with elevated-stable pattern had a 42.6 cm/s (95%CI: 24.7 to 60.6 cm/s) higher brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity level and a 37% (OR 1.37, 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.66) higher arterial stiffness risk, and individuals with moderate-increasing pattern had a 19.6 cm/s (95%CI: 6.9 to 32.3 cm/s) higher brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity level and a 17% (OR 1.17, 95%CI: 1.03 to 1.33) higher arterial stiffness risk, related to individuals with moderate-stable pattern. We did not find significant associations of the elevated-decreasing or low-stable patterns with arterial stiffness. Consistently, the cumulative average, variability, and increased rate of fasting blood glucose during 2006–2010 survey were significantly associated with the arterial stiffness risk. Conclusion Discrete fasting blood glucose trajectories were associated with the arterial stiffness risk in non-diabetic individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2769851078,"We analysed the flora of 46 forest inventory plots (25 m x 100 m) in old growth forests from the Amazonian region to identify the role of environmental (topographic) and spatial variables (obtained using PCNM, Principal Coordinates of Neighbourhood Matrix analysis) for common and rare species. For the analyses, we used multiple partial regression to partition the specific effects of the topographic and spatial variables on the univariate data (standardised richness, total abundance and total biomass) and partial RDA (Redundancy Analysis) to partition these effects on composition (multivariate data) based on incidence, abundance and biomass. The different attributes (richness, abundance, biomass and composition based on incidence, abundance and biomass) used to study this metacommunity responded differently to environmental and spatial processes. Considering standardised richness, total abundance (univariate) and composition based on biomass, the results for common species differed from those obtained for all species. On the other hand, for total biomass (univariate) and for compositions based on incidence and abundance, there was a correspondence between the data obtained for the total community and for common species. Our data also show that in general, environmental and/or spatial components are important to explain the variability in tree communities for total and common species. However, with the exception of the total abundance, the environmental and spatial variables measured were insufficient to explain the attributes of the communities of rare species. These results indicate that predicting the attributes of rare tree species communities based on environmental and spatial variables is a substantial challenge. As the spatial component was relevant for several community attributes, our results demonstrate the importance of using a metacommunities approach when attempting to understand the main ecological processes underlying the diversity of tropical forest communities."
https://openalex.org/W2770056695,"Background Appetite loss is one complication of chronic heart failure (CHF), and its association with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is not well investigated in CHF. Aim We attempted to detect the association between PEI and CHF-induced appetite. Methods Patients with CHF were enrolled, and body mass index (BMI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function grading, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), serum albumin, pro-albumin and hemoglobin were evaluated. The pancreatic exocrine function was measured by fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) levels in the enrolled patients. Appetite assessment was tested by completing the simplified nutritional appetite questionnaire (SNAQ). The improvement of appetite loss by supplemented pancreatic enzymes was also researched in this study. Results The decrease of FE-1 levels was found in patients with CHF, as well as SNAQ scores. A positive correlation was observed between SNAQ scores and FE-1 levels (r = 0.694, p < 0.001). Pancreatic enzymes supplement could attenuate the decrease of SNAQ scores in CHF patients with FE-1 levels <200 μg/g stool and SNAQ < 14. Conclusions Appetite loss is commonly seen in CHF, and is partially associated with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy attenuates the chronic heart failure-induced appetite loss. These results suggest a possible pancreatic-cardiac relationship in chronic heart failure, and further experiment is needed for clarifying the possible mechanisms."

The aim of this paper was to investigate time trends and associations between age-comparative self-rated health and some known determinants in a general population aged 24-34 years. Population-based cross-sectional surveys were performed in 1990, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 in Northern Sweden. Out of 3500 invited persons, 1811 responded. Comparative SRH was measured on a three-grade ordinal scale by the question: ""How would you assess your general health condition compared to persons of your own age?"" with the alternatives ""better/worse/similar"". Over the period 1990 to 2014, the percentage of women rating comparative SRH as ""worse"" increased steadily, from 8.5% in 1990 reaching 20% in 2014 (p for trend 0.007). Among men, this pattern was almost the opposite, with increasing proportions rating ""better"" (p for trend <0.000). Time trends for physical activity in leisure time; length of education; Body Mass Index; anxiety; depressive emotions and satisfaction with economy showed a similar pattern for men and women.

DNA from human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and (or /and) HPV 18 were detected in all the 111 supraglottic carcinoma specimens using in situ hybridization. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, factors were compared using log-rank test, and prognostic factors were determined using Cox proportional hazards model. The relationship between subregions and clinicopathologic factors was analyzed using Chi-square tests.HPV prevalence differed between patients with aryepiglottic fold carcinoma and ventricle carcinoma (P < .05). The local-regional control rates, overall survival rates or cancer specific survival rates were significantly different between different subregions. Univariate analysis indicated that pTNM classification, pN spread, and subregion were associated with prognosis (P < .05). Multivariate analysis indicated that pTNM classification and subregion were associated with supraglottic carcinoma prognosis. The survival rate was better for patients with carcinoma of the epiglottis or ventricular bands compared to those with carcinoma in the aryepiglottic fold or ventricle (P = .012).Subregion may be a new prognostic factor for supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma. Different supraglottic carcinoma subregions have distinct clinical features such as HPV expression, lymph node metastasis rate, local-regional control and prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to subdivide supraglottic squamous cell carcinomas into several subregion groups to individualize therapy."

The prevalence of self-reported gynecomastia was 6.0% (62/1027) (95%-CI: 4.7-7.7%). Of men with gynecomastia 83.6% reported nipple enlargement and 98.4% enlarged breasts (85.5% bilateral). One-third said they had not reported gynecomastia to a health care worker. Over three-quarters mentioned that gynecomastia was an important or very important problem for them, while more than half were embarrassed by it. On examination gynecomastia was present in 90% (confirmed gynecomastia prevalence 5.5%; 95%-CI: 4.2-7.0%) and 51.8% had severity grade III or IV. History of tuberculosis treatment was independently associated with self-reported gynecomastia, adjusted OR 2.10 (95%-CI: 1.04-4.25).The burden of gynecomastia among men on ART in Malawi was higher than previously reported, and was associated with adverse psychological consequences, calling for increased awareness, a proactive diagnostic approach and diligent clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W2769268606,"Rectangular caverns are increasingly used in underground engineering projects, the failure mechanism of rectangular cavern wall rock is significantly different as a result of the cross-sectional shape and variations in wall stress distributions. However, the conventional computational method always results in a long-winded computational process and multiple displacement solutions of internal rectangular wall rock. This paper uses a Laurent series complex method to obtain a mapping function expression based on complex variable function theory and conformal transformation. This method is combined with the Schwarz-Christoffel method to calculate the mapping function coefficient and to determine the rectangular cavern wall rock deformation. With regard to the inverse mapping concept, the mapping relation between the polar coordinate system within plane ς and a corresponding unique plane coordinate point inside the cavern wall rock is discussed. The disadvantage of multiple solutions when mapping from the plane to the polar coordinate system is addressed. This theoretical formula is used to calculate wall rock boundary deformation and displacement field nephograms inside the wall rock for a given cavern height and width. A comparison with ANSYS numerical software results suggests that the theoretical solution and numerical solution exhibit identical trends, thereby demonstrating the method’s validity. This method greatly improves the computing accuracy and reduces the difficulty in solving for cavern boundary and internal wall rock displacements. The proposed method provides a theoretical guide for controlling cavern wall rock deformation failure."
