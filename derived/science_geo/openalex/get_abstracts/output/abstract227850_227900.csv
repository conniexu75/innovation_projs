https://openalex.org/W2964206847,"All conventional methods to laser-cool atoms rely on repeated cycles of optical pumping and spontaneous emission of a photon by the atom. Spontaneous emission in a random direction provides the dissipative mechanism required to remove entropy from the atom. However, alternative cooling methods have been proposed for a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity; the role of spontaneous emission is replaced by the escape of a photon from the cavity. Application of such cooling schemes would improve the performance of atom-cavity systems for quantum information processing. Furthermore, as cavity cooling does not rely on spontaneous emission, it can be applied to systems that cannot be laser-cooled by conventional methods; these include molecules (which do not have a closed transition) and collective excitations of Bose condensates, which are destroyed by randomly directed recoil kicks. Here we demonstrate cavity cooling of single rubidium atoms stored in an intracavity dipole trap. The cooling mechanism results in extended storage times and improved localization of atoms. We estimate that the observed cooling rate is at least five times larger than that produced by free-space cooling methods, for comparable excitation of the atom."
https://openalex.org/W2079382784,"Martensitic transformations are diffusionless, solid-to-solid phase transitions, and have been observed in metals, alloys, ceramics and proteins. They are characterized by a rapid change of crystal structure, accompanied by the development of a rich microstructure. Martensitic transformations can be irreversible, as seen in steels upon quenching, or they can be reversible, such as those observed in shape-memory alloys. In the latter case, the microstructures formed on cooling are easily manipulated by loads and disappear upon reheating. Here, using mathematical theory and numerical simulation, we explain these sharp differences in behaviour on the basis of the change in crystal symmetry during the transition. We find that a necessary condition for reversibility is that the symmetry groups of the parent and product phases be included in a common finite symmetry group. In these cases, the energy barrier to lattice-invariant shear is generically higher than that pertaining to the phase change and, consequently, transformations of this type can occur with virtually no plasticity. Irreversibility is inevitable in all other martensitic transformations, where the energy barrier to plastic deformation (via lattice-invariant shears, as in twinning or slip) is no higher than the barrier to the phase change itself. Various experimental observations confirm the importance of the symmetry of the stable states in determining the macroscopic reversibility of martensitic transformations."

https://openalex.org/W2066377545,"Efficient transportation, a hot topic in nonlinear science1, is essential for modern societies and the survival of biological species. Biological evolution has generated a rich variety of successful solutions2, which have inspired engineers to design optimized artificial systems3,4. Foraging ants, for example, form attractive trails that support the exploitation of initially unknown food sources in almost the minimum possible time5,6. However, can this strategy cope with bottleneck situations, when interactions cause delays that reduce the overall flow? Here, we present an experimental study of ants confronted with two alternative routes. We find that pheromone-based attraction generates one trail at low densities, whereas at a high level of crowding, another trail is established before traffic volume is affected, which guarantees that an optimal rate of food return is maintained. This bifurcation phenomenon is explained by a nonlinear modelling approach. Surprisingly, the underlying mechanism is based on inhibitory interactions. It points to capacity reserves, a limitation of the density-induced speed reduction, and a sufficient pheromone concentration for reliable trail perception. The balancing mechanism between cohesive and dispersive forces appears to be generic in natural, urban and transportation systems."

https://openalex.org/W1986456445,"The causes of spontaneous chromosomal translocations in somatic cells of biological organisms are largely unknown, although double-strand DNA breaks are required in all proposed mechanisms. The most common chromosomal abnormality in human cancer is the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18 (t(14;18)), which occurs in follicular lymphomas. The break at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14 is an interruption of the normal V(D)J recombination process. But the breakage on chromosome 18, at the Bcl-2 gene, occurs within a confined 150-base-pair region (the major breakpoint region or Mbr) for reasons that have remained enigmatic. We have reproduced key features of the translocation process on an episome that propagates in human cells. The RAG complex--which is the normal enzyme for DNA cleavage at V, D or J segments--nicks the Bcl-2 Mbr in vitro and in vivo in a manner that reflects the pattern of the chromosomal translocations; however, the Mbr is not a V(D)J recombination signal. Rather the Bcl-2 Mbr assumes a non-B-form DNA structure within the chromosomes of human cells at 20-30% of alleles. Purified DNA assuming this structure contains stable regions of single-strandedness, which correspond well to the translocation regions in patients. Hence, a stable non-B-DNA structure in the human genome appears to be the basis for the fragility of the Bcl-2 Mbr, and the RAG complex is able to cleave this structure."
https://openalex.org/W1973627047,"The low-latitude ocean is strongly stratified by the warmth of its surface water. As a result, the great volume of the deep ocean has easiest access to the atmosphere through the polar surface ocean. In the modern polar ocean during the winter, the vertical distribution of temperature promotes overturning, with colder water over warmer, while the salinity distribution typically promotes stratification, with fresher water over saltier. However, the sensitivity of seawater density to temperature is reduced as temperature approaches the freezing point, with potential consequences for global ocean circulation under cold climates. Here we present deep-sea records of biogenic opal accumulation and sedimentary nitrogen isotopic composition from the Subarctic North Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean. These records indicate that vertical stratification increased in both northern and southern high latitudes 2.7 million years ago, when Northern Hemisphere glaciation intensified in association with global cooling during the late Pliocene epoch. We propose that the cooling caused this increased stratification by weakening the role of temperature in polar ocean density structure so as to reduce its opposition to the stratifying effect of the vertical salinity distribution. The shift towards stratification in the polar ocean 2.7 million years ago may have increased the quantity of carbon dioxide trapped in the abyss, amplifying the global cooling."
https://openalex.org/W2017251757,"DNA methylation patterns of mammalian genomes are generated in gametogenesis and early embryonic development. Two <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, are responsible for the process. Both enzymes contain a long N-terminal regulatory region linked to a conserved C-terminal domain responsible for the catalytic activity. Although a PWWP domain in the N-terminal region has been shown to bind DNA <i>in vitro</i>, it is unclear how the DNA methyltransferases access their substrate in chromatin <i>in vivo</i>. We show here that the two proteins are associated with chromatin including mitotic chromosomes in mammalian cells, and the PWWP domain is essential for the chromatin targeting of the enzymes. The functional significance of PWWP-mediated chromatin targeting is suggested by the fact that a missense mutation in this domain of human <i>DNMT3B</i> causes immunodeficiency, centromeric heterochromatin instability, facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, which is characterized by loss of methylation in satellite DNA, pericentromeric instability, and immunodeficiency. We demonstrate that the mutant protein completely loses its chromatin targeting capacity. Our data establish the PWWP domain as a novel chromatin/chromosome-targeting module and suggest that the PWWP-mediated chromatin association is essential for the function of the <i>de novo</i> methyltransferases during development."
https://openalex.org/W2031014666,"The spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry into host cells. It is a type 1 viral fusion protein that characteristically contains two heptad repeat regions, denoted HR-N and HR-C, that form coiled-coil structures within the ectodomain of the protein. Previous studies have shown that the two heptad repeat regions can undergo a conformational change from their native state to a 6-helix bundle (trimer of dimers), which mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes. Here we describe the biophysical analysis of the two predicted heptad repeat regions within the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S protein. Our results show that in isolation the HR-N region forms a stable α-helical coiled coil that associates in a tetrameric state. The HR-C region in isolation formed a weakly stable trimeric coiled coil. When mixed together, the two peptide regions (HR-N and HR-C) associated to form a very stable α-helical 6-stranded structure (trimer of heterodimers). Systematic peptide mapping showed that the site of interaction between the HR-N and HR-C regions is between residues 916–950 of HR-N and residues 1151–1185 of HR-C. Additionally, interchain disulfide bridge experiments showed that the relative orientation of the HR-N and HR-C helices in the complex was antiparallel. Overall, the structure of the hetero-stranded complex is consistent with the structures observed for other type 1 viral fusion proteins in their fusion-competent state.

The coronaviruses are a diverse group of large enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and other animals. For example, previously known human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, cause up to 30% of common colds and rarely cause pneumonia in older adults or immunocompromised patients (5El-Sahly H.M.

Coronaviruses of animals (e.g. porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus) cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, or hepatic disease in their respective hosts (8McIntosh K.

In the case of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the nucleotide sequence shows closest identity to novel coronavirus strains isolated from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog in the Guandong province of China (9Martina B.E.

Coronavirus infection is achieved through fusion of the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope with host cell membranes. Membrane fusion is mediated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein on the viral envelope (11Bos E.C. Heijnen L. Luytjes W. Spaan W.J. Virology. 1995; 214: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12De Groot R.J. Van Leen R.W. Dalderup M.J. Vennema H. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J.

Horzinek M.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The S glycoprotein is synthesized as an ∼180-kDa precursor that oligomerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and is incorporated into budding virions in a pre-Golgi compartment. In some strains, S is cleaved by trypsin or related enzymes to yield two non-covalently associated subunits, S1 and S2 (15Frana M.F. Behnke J.N. Sturman L.S. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 912-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sturman L.S. Ricard C.S. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 904-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S1 contains the receptor-binding site and thus defines the host range of the virus (17Cavanagh D. Davis P.J. Darbyshire J.H. Peters R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Taguchi F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7260-7263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S2 is the transmembrane subunit that mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. S2 contains two 4,3-hydrophobic repeat domains (HR) that are predicted to form coiled-coil structures (14Spaan W. Cavanagh D. Horzinek M.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Bosch B.J. van der Zee R. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8801-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). These regions are denoted HR-N and HR-C and are separated by an intervening stretch of ∼140 amino acid residues called the interhelical domain. These coiled-coil regions are thought to play an important role in defining the oligomeric structure of the spike protein in its native state and its fusogenic ability (20Luo Z. Matthews A.M. Weiss S.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8152-8159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of the HR regions in conjunction with recent studies by Bosch et al. (19Bosch B.J. van der Zee R. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8801-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) indicate that coronavirus spike proteins can be classified as type 1 viral fusion proteins. Binding of S protein of murine coronavirus MHV to a specific soluble or cell surface glycoprotein receptor induces global changes in the conformation of S protein that converts S protein from a native pre-fusogenic state to a fusion active state (Fig. 1). In the case of the MHV-JHM strain, interaction with the host cell receptor CEACAM1 causes the S1 domain to readily dissociate from the S1/S2 complex, resulting in display of a new hydrophobic surface area that allows the virions to bind to liposomes and exposes previously hidden trypsin cleavage sites in S2 (21Matsuyama S. Taguchi F. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Taguchi F. Matsuyama S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Zelus B.D. Schickli J.H. Blau D.M. Weiss S.R. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This receptor-induced conformational change is believed to facilitate the release of a hydrophobic fusion peptide from the interior of S2 and position it to interact with the host cell membrane. Next, the fusion active state of type 1 viral fusion proteins resolves itself to a fusogenic or post-fusion state (24Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This latter change is thought to arise from an association between the two coiled-coil regions within the S2 subunit, in which the N-terminal HR region from three S proteins forms a parallel triple-stranded coiled coil and the interhelical polypeptide chain loops around to reverse the polypeptide chain direction, positioning the HR-C region antiparallel to HR-N. The residues at the a and d positions (of the heptad repeat positions denoted (abcdefg)n) of HR-C then pack into grooves formed by the residues at the a, d, e, and g positions of the HR-N core coiled coil to complete the 6-stranded α-helical bundle structure also termed “trimer of hairpins” or “trimer of dimers.” This structure ultimately draws the viral and cellular membranes close together, destabilizing the lipid bilayers that surround the virus and target cell, causing fusion and release of the viral nucleocapsid into the host cell. The high resolution structures of the ectodomains of type 1 viral fusion proteins from many enveloped viruses show very similar structures in the fusogenic state, suggesting a general membrane fusion mechanism (25Baker K.A.

Virology. 1997; 238: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and there is a pressing need for effective anti-viral therapies to treat SARS, we have carried out a detailed study of the biophysical properties of the HR regions within the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. We demonstrate that the HR-N and HR-C regions of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein can independently form α-helical coiled-coil structures. Furthermore, we show that a mixture of HR-N and HR-C can form a very stable trimer of dimers structure similar to other type 1 viral fusion proteins with the two helical HR-N and HR-C regions running anti-parallel to each other. Systematic peptide mapping has localized the site of interaction to residues 916–950 within the HR-N domain and 1151–1185 in the HR-C domain. Peptide Synthesis—The HR-N and HR-C peptides of SARS CoV S glycoprotein were prepared by solid-phase synthesis methodology using 4-benzylhydrylamine hydrochloride resin with conventional N-t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry as described by Tripet et al. (47Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Peptides were N-terminally acetylated, cleaved from the resin, and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to homogeneity and characterized by amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. Plasmid Construction—Production of the peptide corresponding to SARS S protein amino acids 882–973 (HR-N1) was done using directional sub-cloning and bacterial expression techniques. PCR fragments were prepared from the plasmid SARS S number 18 (containing the entire S protein from SARS, Urbani strain (GenBank™ AY278741)). Primers were designed to incorporate an NdeI restriction site upstream (GTACGTACGCATATGATGCAAATGGCATATAGGTTC) and an EcoRI site downstream (GCGAATTCCCTTTGTCGTCGTCGTCGCAGCCGCCTACCTCCGCCTCGACTTTATCAAG) of the amplified fragment. The NdeI site contains an ATG start codon just upstream of the SARS sequence. The reverse primer was engineered to incorporate the amino acid sequence Gly-Gly-Cys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys to insert an enterokinase site (DDDDK) just downstream of the synthesized sequence and just upstream of the EcoRI site. The nucleotide fragment corresponding to residues 882–973 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI/NdeI site of the pT7SH6 plasmid, in-frame with the His6 tag directly downstream of the EcoRI site to create the plasmid pT7SH6 SARS-(882–973). pT7SH6 contains an oligonucleotide-encoded His6 tag followed by two stop codons cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pT7.7 so that cloning into the EcoRI site creates a C-terminal protein fusion encoding NSHHHHHHXX. Plasmid pT7.7 (based on the plasmids of Tabor and Richardson (48Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar)) enables genes to be expressed by T7 RNA polymerase using the highly efficient translation signals of T7 gene 10 by cloning into an NdeI (CATATG) site where the ATG is the initiation codon. Plasmid SARS S number 18 was created by cloning the full-length SARS S protein into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The SARS S sequence was amplified using reverse transcription from SARS genomic RNA (kindly provided by W. Bellini under a material transfer agreement with the Centers of Disease Control, Atlanta, GA), followed by PCR using primers F21488 (CACCATGTTTATTTTCTTATTATTT) and R25259STOP (TTATGTGTAATGTAATTTGACACC). The reverse primer contains a stop codon to halt transcription before the V5-His6 tag in the cloning vector. Bacterial Protein Expression and Purification—BL21 AI Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pT7SH6 SARS-(882–973). These cells were grown overnight in Luria Broth (LB) containing ampicillin (Sigma). The overnight culture was used to inoculate a flask of LB, containing ampicillin, and the cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7. The cells were induced by adding 10% l-arabinose (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.2%. Three hours later the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1/10th volume of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The sample was frozen at –80 °C and thawed at 50 °C three times. 1 mg of DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to the sample and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble supernatant medium was purified with HiTrap nickel affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (49Zelus B.D. Wessner D.R. Williams R.K. Pensiero M.N. Phibbs F.T. deSouza M. Dveksler G.S. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and bound proteins were eluted with a 0–500 mm gradient of imidazole (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the SARS-(882–973) (HR-N1) peptide were identified using immunoblot analysis with an anti-His6 polyclonal antibody (AbCam, Cambridge, MA). These fractions were pooled and placed over a reversed phase chromatography column for purification. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recoded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). The CD wave scans were measured from 190 to 255 nm in benign buffer (0.1 m KCl, 0.05 m PO4, pH 7). For samples containing trifluoroethanol (TFE), the above buffer was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with TFE. Temperature denaturation midpoints (T½) for the peptides were determined by following the change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm from 4 to 95 °C in a 1-mm path length cell and a temperature increase rate of 1 °C/min. Ellipticity readings were normalized to the fraction of peptide folded (ff) or unfolded (fu) using the standard equations ff = ([θ] – [θ]u)/([θ]n – [θ]u) and fu = (1 – ff); where [θ]n and [θ]u represent the ellipticity values for the fully folded and fully unfolded species, respectively. [θ] is the observed ellipticity at 222 nm at any temperature. Sedimentation Analysis—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on the analytical ultracentrifuge (XLA from Beckman-Coulter) as described by Tripet et al. (47Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In general HR-N and HR-C peptides were dialyzed exhaustively against 50 mm K2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, pH 7 buffer at 4 °C. For full-length HR-N1 peptide, HR-N1 was dialyzed against the low salt containing buffer 50 mm K2HPO4, pH6, for enhanced solubility. Three 100-μl aliquots of the sample were loaded into a 12-mm 6-sector, charcoal-filled Epon cell and centrifugation proceeded for 48 h with rotor speeds of 20,000, 26,000, and 30,000 rpm. The HR-N and HR-C peptides were each loaded at initial total peptide concentrations of 50, 100, and 250 μm, and the full-length HR-N1 peptide was loaded at 10, 20, and 50 μm. The partial specific volume of each peptide was calculated using the program SednTerp version 1.08 (50Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. Sedimentation Interpretation Program, Version 1.08. University of New Hampshire, 2003Google Scholar). The density of the solvent was calculated to be 1.009 g/ml. The data were evaluated using a non-linear least squares curve-fitting algorithm contained in the WinNonLin analysis program version 1.06 (51Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis—HR-N and HR-C region peptides singly or as an equimolar mixture (200 μm of each peptide) were dissolved in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm PO4, pH 7 buffer and incubated at room temperature. Samples were then diluted with 1 volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 15% Tris/glycine gel. Size-exclusion and Reversed-phase Chromatography—HR-N and HR-C region peptides singly or as an equimolar mixture (200 μm of each peptide) were dissolved in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm PO4, pH 7, and equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min. A 10-μl aliquot of the mixture was loaded onto a high performance size-exclusion column, Superdex 75™ (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in a buffer consisting of 50 mm PO4, 100 mm KCl, pH 7, at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and ambient temperature. For peptides that formed stable hetero-stranded complexes, the complex peak was collected and analyzed by reversed phase chromatography on an analytical C8 column (Zorbax 300SB-C8, 15 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 6.5 μm particle size, 300-Å pore size; Agilent Technologies). The peptides were eluted from the column by employing a linear AB gradient of 2% B/min, where eluent A is 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. To calculate the peptide ratio in the complex, the peak areas of each component were compared with peak areas of known standard solutions of each peptide. Formation of Parallel and Anti-parallel Disulfide-bridged Hetero Two-stranded Molecules—Preferential disulfide bridge formation between the HR-N9 and HR-C1 regions was performed similar to that described by Semchuck et al. (52Semchuk P.D. Monera O.D. Kondejewski L.H. Gannon C. Daniels L. Wilson I. Hodges R.S. Kaumaya P.T.P. Hodges R.S. Peptides: Chemistry, Structure and Biology. Mayflower Scientific Ltd., UK1996: 73-74Google Scholar). In brief, 10 mg of 2,2′-dithiopyridine was dissolved in 100 μl of dimethylformamide with sonication. A 10-μl (3.4 μmol) aliquot of this solution was added to a solution of the HR-N9 peptide (2 mg, 0.8 μmol) dissolved in a 3:1 (v/v) acetic acid/H2O buffer and stirred for 6 h. The solution was then extracted three times with 500 μl of ether, and the aqueous layer was applied to a Sephadex G-25 desalting column conditioned with 50 mm NH4 acetate, pH 5.5 running buffer. Fractions (1 ml) eluted from the column were collected, and those with 220 nm absorbance were pooled. To one-half of the pooled solution was added HR-C1 peptide with either an N-terminal CGG or a C-terminal GGC linker (1 mg of dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm NH4Ac, pH 5.5 buffer) in 100-μl aliquots over 30 min. The reactions were then stirred for 1 h, and the final complex was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and freeze-dried. Sequence Analysis—To identify the heptad repeat (HR) regions within the SARS-CoV S protein, we utilized the coiled-coil prediction algorithm STABLECOIL (53Tripet B. Hodges R.S. Lebl M. Houghten R.A. Peptides: The Wave of the Future. American Peptide Society, San Diego, CA2001: 365-366Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the graphical output of the analysis using a 35-residue window width. The program predicts two coiled-coil regions: the HR-N coiled coil (residues 882–1011) and the HR-C coiled coil (residues 1147–1185) with an interhelical domain of ∼140 amino acid residues between HR-N and HR-C. The location of these regions appears to be consistent with other type 1 viral fusion proteins, in that the HR-C region is located adjacent to the predicted transmembrane region (residues 1194–1226), and the HR-N region is located C-terminal to a region of high sequence similarity to the fusion peptide (residues 851–882) (Fig. 2B). The coiled-coil prediction analysis also indicates that the HR-N region can be further sub-divided into three regions (regions 1–3) based on the assignment of the heptad a and d positions (data not shown). The region where the heptad registers change is denoted as a frameshift/hinge region (Fig. 2B). The program also predicts a second (lower scoring) heptad repeat register within HR-N region 2 that can run continuous with the heptad register observed in HR-N region 3 (shown below the sequence in Fig. 3, top). The presence of this alternate heptad register indicates that hydrophobic residues also occur in the interfacial e and g positions in this location. In contrast, the HR-C coiled-coil region shows only a single continuous heptad register (Fig. 3, bottom).Fig. 3Top, sequence of the predicted HR-N region from residues 882–1011 of the SARS-CoV S protein. The a and d positions of the strongest predicted coiled-coil heptad repeats (abcdefg)n are shown above the sequence. The a and d positions of the alternate weaker scoring heptad repeat is shown below the sequence. Middle, the names and sequence regions (denoted in parentheses) of the HR-N peptides used in this study. The rectangle denotes the HR-N sequence from residues 882 to 1011. The hatched areas denote regions 1–3 (Fig. 2). The bars below the HR-N domain indicate the locations of the peptides within the HR-N region used in this study. Bottom, the sequence of the predicted HR-C domain from residues 1147–1185. The a and d positions are shown above the sequence. The names, sequences, and locations (bars) of the HR-C peptides used in this study are shown below the HR-C domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Circular Dichroism Analysis of the HR-N and HR-C Regions—To examine the structural characteristics of the HR-N and HR-C regions of the SARS CoV S protein, peptides (see Fig. 3) corresponding to various regions between residues 882 and 1185 were synthesized and analyzed by CD spectroscopy. Fig. 4 (A and B) shows representative far-UV CD spectra and thermal denaturation profiles of the HR-N1, HR-N3, HR-N4, HR-N5, and HR-C1 peptides. Analysis of the HR-N1 peptide, which represents almost the entire length of the predicted HR-N region, showed limited solubility in 0.1 m KCl, 0.05 m K2HPO4, pH 7 buffer; thus the CD study could only be carried out at 15 μm. The CD profile of HR-N1 showed the characteristic α-helical spectrum with double minima at 208 and 222 nm. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm (–15,100°) corresponds to 40 helical residues out of the maximum 62 helical residues induced in 50% TFE for the molecule under the conditions analyzed. Temperature denaturation of HR-N1 showed the α-helical structure had high stability with 50% of its structure unfolded at 77 °C (Table I).Table IEllipticity and stability of the synthetic peptides studiedPeptide nameaName of each peptide studied. The sequence position of each peptide is shown in Fig. 3.No. residues[θ]222bThe mean residue molar ellipticities at 222 nm were measured at 22°C in benign buffer (0.1 m KCl, 0.05 m K2PO4, pH 7). For samples containing TFE, the above buffer was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with TFE.Helical residuescThe number of α-helical residues was calculated based on the predicted molar ellipticity. The predicted molar ellipticity for a completely α-helical peptide was calculated using [θ]theoretical = ×40,000 (1-4.6/N), where N is the number of residues in the polypeptide chain.

https://openalex.org/W2086996769,"The enzyme β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) catalyzes the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc residue to glycoproteins, resulting in a modulation in biological function. Our previous studies showed that the transfection of the GnT-III gene into B16 melanoma cells results in a suppression of invasive ability and lung colonization. The suppression has been postulated to be due to an increased level of E-cadherin expression on the cell surface, which in turn leads to the up-regulation of cell-cell adhesion. In this study, we report on the effects of overexpression of GnT-III on cell-matrix adhesion. The overexpression of GnT-III, but not that of an enzymatic inactive GnT-III (D323A), inhibits cell spreading and migration on fibronectin, a specific ligand for integrin α5β1, and the focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. E4-PHA lectin blot analyses showed that the levels of bisecting GlcNAc structures on the integrin α5 subunit as well as α2 and α3 subunits immunoprecipitated from GnT-III transfectants were substantially increased. In addition, the affinity of the binding of integrin α5β1 to fibronectin was significantly reduced by the introduction of the bisecting GlcNAc, to the α5 subunit. These findings suggest that the modification of N-glycan of integrin by GnT-III inhibits its ligand binding ability, subsequently leading to the down-regulation of integrin-mediated signaling.

Nearly all secreted and cell surface proteins are glycosylated. The attached sugar chains have many biological functions, for example, cell-cell communication, signal transduction, protein folding, and stability (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides are synthesized through the action of glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes the formation of glycosidic bonds. β1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III) 1The abbreviations used are: GnT-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; FN, fibronectin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; E4-PHA, erythroagglutinating isolectin; GnT-V, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V; COL, collagen I; LN, laminin; BSA, bovine serum albumin. catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc residues in a β1,4-linkage to the β1,4-mannose residue in the core region of N-glycans, producing a bisecting GlcNAc (Fig. 1). We previously purified GnT-III from rat kidney and cloned the cDNA from both the rat and human (2Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Tohma T. Soejima H. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In a quest for the biological significance of GnT-III, we found that GnT-III suppresses the dimerization of TrkA, the receptor for nerve growth factor, and EGF receptor phosphorylation (4Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Mihara M. Shimizu K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9629-9634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Rebbaa A. Yamamoto H. Saito T. Meuillet E. Kim P.

It is interesting to note that the metastatic capabilities of B16 mouse melanoma cell are down-regulated by the introduction of the GnT-III gene (6Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This anti-metastatic effect has been partly ascribed to the effect of GnT-III on an increase in E-cadherin-mediated homotypic adhesion and a suppression of the phosphorylation of the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex on the cell-cell adhesion (7Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13811-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Kitada T. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Higashiyama S. Ihara H.

Cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions play essential roles during the acquisition of migration and invasive behavior of the cells. The integrin family consists of α and β heterodimeric transmembrane receptors for ECM and connects many biological functions, such as development, control of cell proliferation, protection against apoptosis, and malignant transformation (9Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6892) Google Scholar). The fibronectin (FN) receptor integrin α5β1 is one of representative ECM receptors and has particularly important roles in tumor growth invasion and malignant behavior (10Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Although α5β1 integrin-mediated adhesion is based on the binding of α5 and β1 subunits to a defined peptide sequence of FN, the strength of this binding is modulated by various factors including the glycosylation status of integrin. Integrin α5β1 contains 14 and 12 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites on the α5 and β1 subunits, respectively. When human fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of α-mannosidase II that prevents N-linked oligosaccharide processing, immature α5β1 integrin receptors appeared at the cell surface, and FN-dependent adhesion was greatly reduced (11Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment of purified integrin α5β1 with N-glycosidase F resulted in blocking of α5β1 binding to FN and the inherent association of both subunits (12Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies suggest that the interaction of cell-surface integrin α5β1 with FN is dependent on the glycosylation and processing status of integrin. To elucidate the effects of the bisecting GlcNAc structure on the biological functions of integrin, α5β1 integrin-mediated cell spreading, cell migration, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation were investigated in GnT-III-overexpressed cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in these biological events were addressed by characterizing the integrin α5β1 purified from GnT-III transfectants. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the human integrin α5 (8F1) and integrin β1 subunits (4G2) were established and have been characterized previously (13Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol.

A polyclonal antibody against FAK and mAb against the integrin α2, α3, or α5 subunit for a Western blot were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A mAb against the human integrin β1 subunit (TS2/16) was purchased from Pierce. A mAb against the human integrin α3 subunit (P1B5) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal antibody against the integrin α2 subunit for immunoprecipitation was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and peroxidase-conjugate goat antibody against rabbit IgG were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A peroxidase-conjugate goat antibody against mouse IgG was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). A mouse control IgG and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin were obtained from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). A mouse mAb against the FN N-terminal domain (FN9-1) was obtained from Takara Bio, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Nonfunctional blocking mAb against the integrin α5 subunit (5G10) was kindly provided by Dr. Toshinaga Maeda (Department of Medical Biochemistry, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan). Cell Culture—A HeLa S3 cell line that stably expresses human GnT-III and mock transfectants was previously established by limited dilution using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in our laboratory (15Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R. Miyagawa J. Yaginuma Y. Honke K. Ishikawa M. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11956-11962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell spreading assays were performed as descried previously with minor modifications (13Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with or without human plasma FN, collagen I (COL) (Sigma) or α5 chain-containing laminin (LN) (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) at different concentrations in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were detached with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA with or without trypsin, washed with serum-containing DMEM, and then resuspended in serum-free DMEM with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 4 × 104 cells/ml. The cells were preincubated with functional blocking mAbs against α5 (8F1), β1 (4G2), or mouse control IgG at a final concentration at 10 μg/ml at room temperature for 10 min before plating. After an additional 20 min of incubation, the nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS, the attached cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde, and three random fields were then scored using phase contrast microscopy. Only cells that contained a fully formed lamellipodia were counted as spread cells. The percentage of spreading cells was determined from the ratio of the number of spreading cells and the number of total cells in each field. Migration Assay—Transwells (BD Biosciences) were coated with 15 nm of FN, COL, or LN in PBS by an overnight treatment at 4 °C followed by an incubation with 1% BSA for 1h at 37 °C. The cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed once with DMEM containing 10% FBS, and resuspended in DMEM containing 1% FBS at 1 × 106 cells/ml. 100-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were preincubated with the functional blocking mAb against integrin α5 (8F1) or mouse control IgG at a final concentration at 10 μg/ml for 10 min and then added to the upper side of each chamber. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the remaining cells on the upper side of the chamber were carefully scraped off with a cotton swab. The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 3% formaldehyde and stained with 0.3% Crystal Violet for 30 min. The cells on the lower surface of the membrane were observed under a phase contrast microscope. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Flow cytometry analysis was performed as described previously with minor modifications (16Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Ihara S. Miyoshi E. Ko J.H. Murata K. Nakahara S. Honke K. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Taniguchi N. J.

Briefly, the cells in semi-confluent conditions were detached from 10-cm culture dishes using trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS. The suspended cells (5–10 × 106 cells) were incubated with and without a primary antibody (8F1 for the α5 subunit or TS2/16 for the β1 subunit) at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml for 1 h on ice. The cells were washed three times with PBS, then resuspended in 50 μl of PBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin, and further incubated for 1 h on ice. After washing three times with PBS, flow cytometry analyses were performed using a FAC-Scan instrument (BD Biosciences) operated with CELLQuest software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm NaF) on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay CBB kit (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with a BSA standard. The samples were incubated with 2 μg of each antibody for 1 h and then with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with lysis buffer. For a Western blot, equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h each, and detection was performed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously with minor modifications (15Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R. Miyagawa J. Yaginuma Y. Honke K. Ishikawa M. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11956-11962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, semiconfluent HeLa S3 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resulting cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-integrin α2, α3 (P1B5), or α5 (8F1) antibodies as described above. The immunocomplex was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the membranes with 3% (w/v) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST, pH 7.5), the biotinylated proteins were visualized using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and an ECL kit. Purification of Integrin α5β1—The purification of integrin α5β1 was preformed as described previously, with minor modifications (13Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J.

Briefly, HeLa S3 cells were cultured with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) in a roller bottle (Corning Costar, Osaka, Japan). Confluent HeLa S3 cells were detached with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl) containing 2 mm EDTA and washed with TBS(+) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). The cell pellets (∼40 ml) were extracted with 160 ml of TBS(+) containing 100 mm 1-O-n-octyl-β-d-glucoside and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The cell extract was applied to an affinity column prepared by coupling 20 mg of the 155/145-kDa thermolysin fragments of human plasma FN to 2 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The bound integrin α5β1 was eluted with TBS(+) containing 0.5 mg/ml synthetic GRGDS peptide (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan). The elutes containing integrin α5β1 were further purified on 1 ml of wheat germ agglutininagarose column (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with TBS(+) containing 0.2 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. The purity of the integrin was verified by SDS-PAGE by means of a silver staining kit (Daichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Lectin Blot Analysis—The purified or immunoprecipitated integrins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA (w/v) in TBST and then incubated with 2 μg/ml solution of biotinylated E4-PHA (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in TBST for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with TBST three times, lectin-reactive proteins were detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and an ECL kit. Integrin Liposome Binding Assay—The purified integrins (5 μg/ml) were reconstituted into liposomes as described previously (13Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The radioactive labeled integrin liposomes were added to a 96-well microtiter plate coated with 50 μl of 0–100 nm FN or 20 nm mAb against the integrin α5 subunit (8F1) or the integrin β1 subunit (TS 2/16) and then incubated at room temperature for 6 h. The plates were washed twice with TBS(+), and the bound liposomes were recovered in 1% SDS (100 μl/well). The radioactivities of the bound liposomes were quantified using a Packard TRI-CARB 1500 liquid scintillation counter (Research Parkway Meriden, CT). Binding Assay for Integrin α5β1 and Soluble FN—The purified integrins were immobilized on 96-well microtiter plates via nonfunctional blocking anti-integrin α5 antibody (5G10) precoating the plates. Amounts of the purified integrins captured on plates were verified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with biotinylated anti β1 (TS2/16) as described (19Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Those wells were incubated with TBS(+) containing various concentrations of FN (0–100 nm) for 2 h at room temperature, washed twice with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2, and then fixed by incubation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. The bound FN was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with biotinylated anti-FN antibody (FN9-1). Overexpression of GnT-III Inhibited Integrin-mediated Cell Adhesion—To date, several lines of evidence have shown that the overexpression of GnT-III inhibits growth factor receptor functions. For example, in U373 MG cells overexpressing GnT-III, the binding of EGF to its receptor and receptor autophosphorylation are inhibited (5Rebbaa A. Yamamoto H. Saito T. Meuillet E. Kim P. Kersey D.S. Bremer E.G. Taniguchi N. Moskal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9275-9279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in PC12 cells, the N-glycan of TrkA, when modified by a bisecting GlcNAc causes functional changes by disrupting the dimerization of TrkA (4Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Mihara M. Shimizu K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9629-9634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In present study, the effects of GnT-III overexpression on cell adhesion were examined. After 20 min of incubation on FN, cell spreading was observed in HeLa S3 cells that had been transfected with mock or a GnT-III mutant, D323A, which serves as a negative molecule involved in competition with the corresponding endogenous one as described previously (20Ihara H. Ikeda Y. Koyota S. Endo T. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the α5β1 integrin-mediated cell spreading was completely blocked in cells overexpressing wild-type GnT-III (Fig. 2). Because HeLa cell predominantly expresses integrin α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 (21Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we also preformed a spreading assay on COL and LN, which are ligands of integrin α2β1 and α3β1, respectively, and found that integrin α2β1- or integrin α3β1-mediated cell spreading was also inhibited in GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 2). The inhibition of cell spreading that was modulated by overexpression of GnT-III is not an artifact of proteolysis of those integrins, because a similar result was also observed in those cells detached by EDTA without trypsin (data not shown). In addition, the inhibition of cell spreading on FN by the overexpression of GnT-III was confirmed in other two HeLa S3 cell clones as well as in human mammary carcinoma MCF7 cells (data not shown). Expression Levels of Integrin α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 on the Cell Surface Are Not Influenced by Overexpression of GnT-III—One possible explanation for the effects of GnT-III on integrin-mediated cell adhesion could be changes in the expression levels of integrin α2β1, α3β1, or α5β1 on the cell surface. To test this possibility, expression levels of integrins α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 on cell surface were biochemically investigated by the means of the biotinylation of cell surface proteins and subsequent immunoprecipitation using anti-integrin antibodies. The levels of expression of integrin α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 on the cell surface were not influenced by the overexpression of GnT-III (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, expression levels of integrin α5 and β1 on cell surface were also quantified by flow cytometric analysis. Consistent with the assay by biotinylation, the level of expression of integrin α5β1 on the cell surface was unchanged in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 3B). Comparison of Glycosylation of α2β1, α3β1, or α5β1 Integrin Immunoprecipitated from Mock and GnT-III Transfectants—To analyze alterations in the carbohydrate structure of integrin α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1, those integrins were immunoprecipitated from GnT-III and mock transfectants. The blot was probed with E4-PHA lectin, which preferentially binds to bisecting GlcNAc residues in N-glycans. Each α subunit from GnT-III transfectants showed a substantially increased reactivity to E4-PHA, compared with that from the mock transfectants (Fig. 4, upper panels). Equivalent amounts of loaded proteins were verified by reprobing the corresponding membranes with anti integrin α2, α3, and α5 antibodies (Fig. 4, lower panels). Overexpression of GnT-III Inhibited Integrin α5β1-mediated Cell Migration—Experiments were then designed to determine whether the overexpression of GnT-III could affect cell migration, which was assayed by the extent of haptotaxis toward FN, COL, or LN. In the case of GnT-III transfectants on FN, Transwell cells migrating to the lower surface of the membrane were considerably decreased, compared with the mock transfectants (Fig. 5A) and the D323A GnT-III mutant (data not shown). However, cell migrations of both mock and GnT-III transfectants on COL or LN were barely detected (Fig. 5B), suggesting that HeLa S3 may favor FN as an ECM for cell migration. Cell spreading and migration of mock transfectants on FN were completely blocked by the presence of function-blocking antibodies against α5 or β1 but not by mouse control IgG (Figs. 2 and 5), suggesting that the cell spreading and migration on FN were mainly mediated by α5β1 integrin. The Level of FAK Phosphorylation Was Decreased in GnT-III Transfectants—Cell adhesion to ECM leads to intracellular phosphorylation. The activation of integrin α5β1 on cell adhesion to FN preferentially enhances tyrosine kinase FAK (16Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Gu J. Fujibayashi A. Yamada K.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19922-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To address the effects of GnT-III overexpression on integrin-mediated signaling, FAK phosphorylation was compared between mock transfectants and GnT-III transfectants. The results show that the level of FAK phosphorylation was decreased in GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 6), suggesting that GnT-III was able to negatively regulate the integrin α5β1-mediated signaling pathway. A similar attenuation in FN-transduced FAK phosphorylation was also observed in the two other GnT-III-overexpressed HeLa S3 clones (data not shown). Ligand Binding of Integrin α5β1 Purified from GnT-III Transfectants—To elucidate the mechanism by which GnT-III transfection suppresses α5β1 integrin-mediated cell spreading, migration, and FAK phosphorylation, we purified integrin α5β1 from GnT-III and mock transfectants by a FN affinity column combined with a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column, and an integrin-liposome binding assay was carried out. The purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Two major bands, migrating at ∼150 and 110 kDa on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 7A, inset, left panel), corresponding to the immunoreactivity with the anti-α5 and anti-β1 antibodies, respectively, were detected (data not shown). In addition, we also analyzed glycosylation of the purified integrin α5β1 by a FN affinity column. Surprisingly, the reactivity of E4-PHA lectin was barely detected in the integrin β1 subunit, suggesting that GnT-III selectively modifies some N-glycans but not entire sugar chains (Fig 7A, inset, right panel). The same amounts of receptors were reconstituted in 3H-labeled liposomes. The liposomes were incubated with various concentrations of FN precoated on 96-well plates. The binding of liposomes containing α5β1 purified from GnT-III transfectants was significantly inhibited, compared with that of mock transfectants (Fig. 7A). Those amounts of integrins on the liposome surface were similar was verified by adhesion to the anti-integrin β1 subunit antibody, TS 2/16 (anti-β1). The specificities of the binding of α5β1 integrin-FN were confirmed by treatment with 10 mm EDTA, which completely blocked integrin-FN interactions (FN+EDTA). On the other hand, we also performed a binding assay using solution phase FN and integrin α5β1 captured by antibody (5G10) precoating plates, and found the binding of soluble FN to the integrin α5β1-purified form GnT-III transfectants was also inhibited, compared with that purified from mock transfectants (Fig. 7B). Together, these results clearly indicate that the introduction of bisecting GlcNAc structures into integrin α5β1 results in the inhibition of ligand binding. Integrins are associated with many biological functions, such as development, control of cell proliferation, protection against apoptosis, and malignant transformation via cell-ECM adhesion processes (9Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6892) Google Scholar, 23Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). It is well known that synthetic peptides and specific antibodies are capable of inhibiting integrin-ECM interactions, thereby modulating cell biological functions (25Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 26Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biology. 1996; : 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2569) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used an approach involving the modulation of the N-glycan structure by the overexpression of GnT-III and found that GnT-III substantially blocked α5β1 integrin-mediated cell spreading, cell migration, and FAK phosphorylation. The reduction in affinity for FN, as evidenced by an integrin-liposome binding assay and FN-soluble binding assay, provides an explanation of the molecular mechanism underlying the down-regulation of these biological functions. In addition, integrin α2β1 and α3β1-mediated cell spreading was also down-regulated, suggesting that GnT-III may have a wide spectrum of effects on cell-ECM interactions. Several lines of evidence suggest that N-glycans are required for integrin activation. The blocking of N-linked oligosaccharide processing of α5β1 integrin results in an increase in immature integrins on the cell surface and a reduction in FN-dependent adhesion (11Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Luo et al. (27Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reported that the introduction of an N-glycosylation site into β3 stabilizes the active conformation of αIIbβ3 integrin. In the present study, we show that the binding activity of α5β1 integrin could also be modulated by introducing a single GlcNAc residue (bisecting GlcNAc). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that oligosaccharides attached to integrins play a crucial role in the conformational changes of integrins. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion cooperates with growth factor receptors in the control of cell biological functions. Interestingly, the overexpression of GnT-III modulates not only integrin functions as described above but growth factor receptors as well. In fact, our previous studies showed that the overexpression of GnT-III suppressed the biological functions of growth factor receptors, including the EGF receptor (5Rebbaa A. Yamamoto H. Saito T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9629-9634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). U373 MG cells overexpressing GnT-III exhibit an inhibition of EGF binding to the cell surface and EGF receptor autophosphorylation. In contrast to the EGF receptor, although there is no significant difference in the capacity of nerve growth factor to bind to TrkA in PC12 cells overexpressing GnT-III, the N-glycans of TrkA that are modified by a bisecting GlcNAc causes functional changes by disrupting the dimerization process. Although the precise reason for why the bisecting GlcNAc negatively regulates these molecular functions remains to be elucidated, GnT-III may play an important role in biological functions such as growth factor- and integrin-mediated signalings. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which catalyzes the synthesis of β1,6-GlcNAc branched N-linked oligosaccharides, has been proposed as one of the most important glycosyltransferase associated with tumor metastasis (29Fernandes B.

Conversely, tumor cell mutants that are selected for leucoagglutinating isolectin resistance and found to be deficient in GnT-V activity are also deficient for metastasis (33Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S. Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 34Lu Y. Pelling J.C. Chaney W.G. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GnT-III could be considered to be an antagonist to GnT-V, because bisecting GlcNAc rendered the biantennary substrate inaccessible to GnT-V, raising the possibility that β1,6-GlcNAc branch formation could be suppressed by the induction of the GnT-III gene (35Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 36Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Eguchi H. Tsuda T. Honke K. Taniguchi N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we demonstrated that GnT-III suppresses lung metastasis in an animal model using highly metastatic B16 melanoma cells (6Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In that case, GnT-III transfectants displayed both an increase in E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and a suppression of phosphorylation of β-catenin. Here, we clearly demonstrate that the overexpression of GnT-III significantly blocks cell adhesion on FN, thereby down-regulating cell migration. Accordingly, the overexpression of GnT-III inhibits tumor metastasis by at least two mechanisms: enhancement of cell-cell adhesion and the down-regulation of cell-ECM adhesion. Interestingly, Pierce and co-workers (37Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that the overexpression of GnT-V led to stimulation of α5β1 integrin-mediated cell migration on FN. The current study is not inconsistent with their observation, considering the fact that GnT-III is an antagonist of GnT-V. The issue of whether cell adhesion on FN was decreased not only by the introduction of GnT-V into HT1080 cells but also by the overexpression of GnT-III in HeLa S3 cells (in this study) is unclear. Cell migration can be viewed as a process that is regulated by counterbalanced signals that control the rates of motility by multiple mechanisms. The strength of cell adhesion represents one such mechanism. In fact, extensive formation of focal adhesions has been linked to the slowing of cell migration (38Dunlevy J.R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 489-500PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). However, cytoskeletal systems are also likely to play important roles in modulating the rates of cell migration (40Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 41Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the cell adhesion of HeLa S3 cells transfected with mock was obviously not sufficiently high to retard cell migration on FN, whereas it might be the case for HT1080 cells. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that the modulation of N-glycans of α5β1 integrin by a bisecting GlcNAc significantly blocks FN binding, thereby inhibiting integrin-mediated cell spreading, migration, and signaling transduction. This study also provides a new insight into the molecular basis for the inhibition of tumor metastasis, because it is regulated by GnT-III. Further studies on identifying that site(s) of N-glycans bearing bisecting GlcNAc could shed light on the function of GnT-III and the structure of integrins.

Overexpression of MUC1 confers transformation; however, the signaling pathways activated by this oncoprotein are largely unknown.

PI3K, which consists of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit, phosphorylates phosphatidylinositols (PIs) at their 3-position and thereby converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar).

In turn, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the Forkhead-related transcription factor 1 by retaining it in the cytosol in a complex with 14-3-3 proteins.

These findings, and the demonstration that PI3K/Akt signaling is dysregulated in human malignancies, have provided support for the significance of this pathway in conferring tumor cell survival (11Vivanco I.

Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The MUC1 protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide that is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum into N-terminal and C-terminal subunits, which then reside as heterodimers at the apical cell surface (13Ligtenberg M.

The large (>250 kDa) N-terminal ectodomain (N-ter) contains variable numbers of 20-amino acid tandem repeats that are heavily glycosylated (15Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Rothbard J.

The smaller (∼25 kDa) C-terminal subunit (C-ter) consists of an extracellular domain of 58 amino acids, a 28-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 72-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (17Merlo G. Siddiqui J. Cropp C. Liscia D.S. Lidereau R. Callahan R. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6966-6971PubMed Google Scholar). The MUC1 C-ter forms a complex with β-catenin that localizes to the nucleus (18Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol.

These findings indicate that MUC1 functions by integrating signals from growth factor receptors, which also activate PI3K/Akt (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar) and the Wnt pathway.Overexpression of MUC1 is sufficient to induce the transformation of rat 3Y1 fibroblasts (20Li Y. Liu D. Chen D. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6107-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrated that expression of MUC1 in 3Y1 cells is associated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We also showed that MUC1 up-regulates Bcl-xL expression and attenuates the apoptotic response of 3Y1 cells to the anti-cancer agents, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and gemcitabine.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Rat 3Y1 fibroblasts stably expressing the empty vector or full-length MUC1 (20Li Y.

Two independently selected clones (A and B) were used for both 3Y1/vector and 3Y1/MUC1 cells (20Li Y. Liu D. Chen D. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6107-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 25 μm LY294002 (Sigma), 10 μm araC (Sigma), or 50 μm gemcitabine (Eli Lilly).Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from subconfluent cells as described in Refs. 24Li Y.

For analysis of sub-G1 DNA, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 70% ethanol, incubated with 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase, and then monitored by FACScan using a Modfit program.RESULTSMUC1 Activates the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway—To determine whether MUC1 affects the PI3K/Akt pathway, lysates from 3Y1 cells stably expressing the empty vector or MUC1 were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt. The levels of phospho-Akt were substantially increased in 3Y1/ MUC1 cells compared with that in 3Y1/vector cells (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained in separately isolated 3Y1/vector and 3Y1/MUC1 clones (Fig. 1A). The demonstration that MUC1 has little if any effect on Akt protein levels indicated that Akt is activated in the 3Y1/MUC1 cells (Fig. 1A). Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the pro-apoptotic function of Bad (5Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the lysates with an anti-phospho-Bad antibody demonstrated that MUC1 markedly increases levels of phosphorylated Bad (Fig. 1B). As a control, MUC1 had little effect on Bad protein levels (Fig. 1B). Akt is regulated in part by the PI3K-mediated formation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and degradation of this PI by the PTEN phosphatase (33Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar). To determine whether MUC1 affects the expression of PI3K, the lysates were probed with an anti-PI3K p85 antibody. MUC1 had no detectable effect on PI3K p85 expression (Fig. 1C). Moreover, PTEN levels were similar in the 3Y1/vector and 3Y1/MUC1 cells (Fig. 1C). Significantly, however, treatment of the 3Y1/MUC1 cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was associated with down-regulation of both phospho-Akt and phospho-Bad levels (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that MUC1 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway.MUC1 Up-regulates Bcl-xL Expression—Bad promotes apoptosis by forming a heterodimer with Bcl-xL (5Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). To determine whether MUC1 also affects Bcl-xL expression, the lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL. The levels of Bcl-xL were increased in 3Y1/MUC1 cells as contrasted to 3Y1/vector cells (Fig. 2A). The demonstration that MUC1 has little effect on Bcl-2 levels indicated that MUC1 selectively up-regulates Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 2A). The findings that Bcl-xL levels are down-regulated by LY294002 in Baf-3 hematopoietic cells (34Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Mathieu A.L. Low W. Blanquier B. Marvel J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and not in PC-3 prostate cancer cells (35Yang A.S. Lattime E.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2150-2157PubMed Google Scholar), have indicated that Bcl-xL expression is controlled by PI3K-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Treatment of 3Y1/MUC1-A cells with LY294002 had little if any effect on Bcl-xL levels (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with LY294002-treated 3Y1/MUC1-B cells (Fig. 2B). Other studies have shown that LY294002 down-regulates MUC1 in gastric carcinoma cells (36Kobayashi M. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara-Kanda A. Ihara S. Fukui Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, LY294002 had no apparent effect on MUC1 expression in 3Y1/MUC1 cells, indicating that MUC1 is regulated by PI3K-independent pathways (Fig. 2B). Bcl-xL localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with Bad (37Boise L.H. Gonzaiz-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B.

In this context, Bcl-xL levels were increased in the mitochondria of 3Y1/MUC1 as contrasted to 3Y1/vector cells (Fig. 2C). As a control, there was no detectable MUC1 N-ter in the 3Y1 mitochondrial lysates (Fig. 2C). Immunoblot analysis of the mitochondrial HSP60 protein was also included as a control for equal loading of the lanes (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that MUC1 increases mitochondrial Bcl-xL levels by a PI3K-independent mechanism.Fig. 2MUC1 up-regulates Bcl-xL expression. A, lysates from the indicated 3Y1 cells were subjected to immunoblot (IB) analysis with anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bcl-2, and anti-β-actin. B, 3Y1/MUC1-A and -B cells were left untreated (–) or treated (+) with 25 μm LY294002 for 12 h. The cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL and anti-MUC1 N-ter. C, mitochondrial lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL, anti-MUC1 N-ter, and anti-HSP60. Whole cell lysate (WCL) was included as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MUC1 Blocks Activation of the Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway—Increases in phospho-Bad and Bcl-xL protect against apoptosis induced by activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (38Vander Heiden M.G.

Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effects of MUC1 on chemosensitivity, we treated 3Y1 cells with araC, an antimetabolite that induces the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and thereby apoptosis (40Major P.P. Egan E.M. Beardsley G. Minden M. Kufe D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 41Kojima H. Endo K. Moriyama H. Tanaka T. Alnemri E.S. Slapak C. Teicher B. Kufe D. Datta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16647-16650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Exposure of 3Y1/vector-A and -B cells to araC was associated with a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) (Fig. 3A). By contrast, there was no decrease in Δψm when 3Y1/MUC1 cells were exposed to araC (Fig. 3A). Indeed, as shown previously (38Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), overexpression of Bcl-xL confers an increase in Δψm in response to araC-induced genotoxic stress (Fig. 3A). araC treatment is also associated with the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol of 3Y1/vector (and not 3Y1/MUC1) cells (Fig. 3B). In concert with these results, activation of caspase-9 was attenuated in 3Y1/MUC1 (as contrasted to 3Y1/vector) cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PKCδ (42Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) was attenuated in the MUC1 expressing cells (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained in the separately isolated 3Y1/vector-B and 3Y1/MUC1-B cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that MUC1 attenuates araC-induced activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.Fig. 3MUC1 blocks activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. A, the indicated cells were left untreated (Control) or treated with araC for 24 h, stained with Rhodamine 123, and analyzed by flow cytometry. B, 3Y1/vector and 3Y1/MUC1 cells were treated with araC for the indicated times. Cytosolic lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-cytochrome c, anti-caspase-9, and anti-β-actin. C, lysates from 3Y1/vector and 3Y1/MUC1 cells treated with araC for the indicated times were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ and anti-β-actin. FL, full-length; CF, catalytic fragment.

Treatment with araC was associated with a substantial induction of TUNEL staining in 3Y1/vector (but not 3Y1/MUC1) cells (Fig. 4A). Moreover, araC treatment of 3Y1/vector cells was associated with over 40% apoptosis as determined by sub-G1 DNA analysis (Fig. 4B). By contrast, araC-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated in the 3Y1/MUC1 cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in multiple experiments with the 3Y1/MUC1-A cells (Fig. 4C) and in the other separately isolated 3Y1/MUC1-B clone (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4MUC1 attenuates araC-induced apoptosis. A and B, 3Y1/vector-A and 3Y1/MUC1-A cells were treated with araC for 24 h and analyzed for TUNEL staining (A, left panels) by bright field (A, right panels), and for sub-G1 DNA (B). C, the results from sub-G1 DNA analysis of 3Y1/vector-A (solid bars) and 3Y1/MUC1-A (open bars) cells treated with araC for the indicated times are expressed as the percentage apoptosis (mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments). D, 3Y1/vector-B (solid bars) and 3Y1/MUC1-B (open bars) cells were treated with araC for the indicated times and analyzed for sub-G1 DNA. The results are presented as the percentage apoptosis (mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To extend these observations to other anti-cancer agents, we treated the 3Y1/vector and 3Y1/MUC1 cells with gemcitabine. As determined by the analysis of sub-G1 DNA and as found with araC, gemcitabine-induced apoptosis was attenuated in 3Y1/MUC1 (as contrasted to 3Y1/vector) cells (data not shown). These findings demonstrated that MUC1 attenuates the induction of 3Y1 cells apoptosis by araC and gemcitabine.DISCUSSIONMUC1 Activates the PI3K/Akt Pathway—PI3K is aberrantly activated in diverse human carcinomas (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 11Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar, 36Kobayashi M. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara-Kanda A. Ihara S. Fukui Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interaction of the PI3K p85 subunit with phosphotyrosine residues of activated growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins results in stimulation of the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit. Growth factor-induced binding of Ras to p110 also stimulates PI3K activity and the formation of PI(3,4,5)P3. Direct binding of PI3K p110 to mutant forms of activated Ras can thus contribute to dysregulation of PI3K activity. Loss of the PTEN phosphatase, which dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3, represents another mechanism for aberrant activation of PI3K and, similar to mutant Ras, has been widely found in human cancers (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 11Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar). Akt and other pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins accumulate at sites of PI3K activation by binding to PI(3,4,5)P3. Importantly, Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of a number of downstream effectors, such as Bad, can contribute to the malignant phenotype (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 11Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar).The present results demonstrated that overexpression of the MUC1 oncoprotein in 3Y1 fibroblasts is associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. MUC1 is overexpressed by most human carcinomas of the breast and other epithelia (12Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of MUC1 confers anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity (19Li Y. Chen W. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Yoshida K. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Huang L. Ren J. Chen D. Li Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). MUC1 functions as a substrate for c-Src, Lyn, and PKCδ (19Li Y. Chen W. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Yoshida K. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17616-17622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) but has not been shown previously to be responsible for the activation of specific kinases. Indeed, although the precise mechanisms responsible for the transforming effects of MUC1 remain unknown, the demonstration that MUC1 activates PI3K/Akt signaling provides new insights into how MUC1 may contribute to the malignant phenotype. The available evidence indicates that MUC1 functions as a coreceptor for the ErbB family of growth factor receptors (21Li Y. Yu W.-H. Ren J. Huang L. Kharbanda S. Loda M. Kufe D. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 765-775PubMed Google Scholar, 25Li Y. Ren J. Yu W.-H. Li G. Kuwahara H. Yin L. Carraway K.L. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13057-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MUC1 could therefore aberrantly stimulate ErbB receptor-mediated activation of PI3K and Akt. Moreover, the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail contains a YHPM motif, which after tyrosine phosphorylation represents a potential binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of the PI3K p85 subunit. As such, MUC1 might also function as a cell membrane docking site for PI3K activation.MUC1 Activates the Anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL Pathway—The present work also demonstrated that MUC1 activates the Bcl-xL pathway in 3Y1 cells. Bcl-xL was identified as a Bcl-2-related protein that functions as a regulator of cell death (37Boise L.H. Gonzaiz-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). Like Bcl-2, Bcl-xL prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by maintaining the integrity of the outer membrane (38Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T.

https://openalex.org/W1987999118,"We investigated the mechanisms of anticoagulant activity mediated by sulfated galactans. The anticoagulant activity of sulfated polysaccharides is achieved mainly through potentiation of plasma cofactors, which are the natural inhibitors of coagulation proteases. Our results indicated the following. 1) Structural requirements for the interaction of sulfated galactans with coagulation inhibitors and their target proteases are not merely a consequence of their charge density. 2) The structural basis of this interaction is complex because it involves naturally heterogeneous polysaccharides but depends on the distribution of sulfate groups and on monosaccharide composition. 3) Sulfated galactans require significantly longer chains than heparin to achieve anticoagulant activity. 4) Possibly, it is the bulk structure of the sulfated galactan, and not a specific minor component as in heparin, that determines its interaction with antithrombin. 5) Sulfated galactans of ∼15 to ∼45 kDa bind to antithrombin but are unable to link the plasma inhibitor and thrombin. This last effect requires a molecular size above 45 kDa. 6) Sulfated galactan and heparin bind to different sites on antithrombin. 7) Sulfated galactans are less effective than heparin at promoting antithrombin conformational activation. Overall, these observations indicate that a different mechanism predominates over the conformational activation of antithrombin in ensuring the antithrombin-mediated anticoagulant activity of the sulfated galactans. Possibly, sulfated galactan connects antithrombin and thrombin, holding the protease in an inactive form. The conformational activation of antithrombin and the consequent formation of a covalent complex with thrombin appear to be less important for the anticoagulant activity of sulfated galactan than for heparin. Our results demonstrate that the paradigm of heparin-antithrombin interaction cannot be extended to other sulfated polysaccharides. Each type of polysaccharide may form a particular complex with the plasma inhibitor and the target protease. We investigated the mechanisms of anticoagulant activity mediated by sulfated galactans.

Each type of polysaccharide may form a particular complex with the plasma inhibitor and the target protease. The leading causes of death are now diseases that involve heart and blood vessels and as a consequence thrombosis (1Fareed J. Hoppensteadt D.A. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 87-88PubMed Google Scholar). This explains the current efforts to develop specific and potent antithrombotic agents. Most thromboembolic conditions require anticoagulant therapy; heparin has been used for more than 50 years. The potent anticoagulant action of heparin is achieved mainly through potentiation of antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, the major inhibitors of coagulation enzymes, in particular thrombin and factor Xa (2Béguin Y. Lindhout T. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In heparin, a specific local structure consisting of a pentasaccharide sequence with a specific sugar composition and sulfation pattern, is required to induce an activating conformational change in antithrombin (3Thumberg L. Backström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 4Lindahl U. Backström G. Thunberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9826-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin has an additional anticoagulant mechanism resulting from bridging the proteinase and the antithrombin molecules (5Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This last mechanism appears more significant for heparin acceleration when thrombin is the target proteinase. The conformational change is primarily responsible for heparin acceleration when factor Xa is the target proteinase because the synthesized pentasaccharide region is nearly as active as a full-length heparin containing this sequence. Heparin has several side effects, such as development of thrombocytopenia (6Warkentin T.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Visentin G.P. Thromb.

In addition, heparin is mostly extracted from pig intestine or bovine lung, where it occurs in low concentrations. Furthermore, the incidence of prion-related diseases in mammals and the increasing need for antithrombotic therapy indicate that we should look for alternative sources of anticoagulant and antithrombotic compounds. One abundant source of new anticoagulant polysaccharides is marine algae. They contain a variety of sulfated galactans (11Potin P. Patier P. Floch J.Y. Yvin J.C. Rochas C. Kloareg B. J. Appl.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These polysaccharides are potent thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors mediated by antithrombin or heparin cofactor II. Obviously, the specific pentasaccharide sequence required for heparin to induce the activating conformational change in antithrombin is absent in the algal and invertebrate polysaccharides. This raises the following interesting questions. How can these polysaccharides activate antithrombin? Do their structures mimic the specific pentasaccharide sequence found in heparin or is another mechanism involved in their ability to activate antithrombin? In order to clarify these aspects, we undertook a systematic analysis of the anticoagulant activity of sulfated galactans obtained from marine organisms. The specific pattern of sulfation and the position of the glycosidic linkage vary among different species. The sea urchin Echinometra lucunter contains a linear polysaccharide composed of 2-sulfated, 1,3-linked α-l-galactose (Fig. 1B) (23Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), whereas in the tunicate Herdmania monus a similar polysaccharide is composed of 3-sulfated, 1,4-linked α-l-galactose (Fig. 1C) (24Santos J.A. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sea urchin Strongy-locentrotus franciscanus contains a related polysaccharide composed of 2-sulfated, 1,3-linked α-l-fucose (Fig. 1D) (25Vilela-Silva A.C.E.S. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourão P.A.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Finally, the following repeating structure (-4-α-d-Gal-1→3-β-d-Gal-1→) was found in the red alga Botryocladia occidentalis. One-third of the total α-units are 2,3-di-sulfated, and another one-third are 2-sulfated (Fig. 1A). The potent anticoagulant activity of this algal galactan (potency similar to that of unfractionated heparin) was attributed mostly to the 2,3-di-sulfated units (13Farias W.R.L. Valente A.P. Pereira M.S. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29299-29307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We now report that the structural requirements for interaction of the sulfated galactans with coagulation inhibitors and their target proteinases are stereo-specific and not merely a consequence of their charge density or sulfate content. Sulfated galactans have a decreased antithrombin affinity and an inability to induce a full activation conformational change in the plasma inhibitor but can achieve an anticoagulant activity similar to that of heparin. Finally, heparin and sulfated galactans have different binding sites on antithrombin. Therefore, the paradigm of heparin-antithrombin interaction cannot always be extended to other sulfated polysaccharides. Sulfated Polysaccharides—Sulfated galactans and sulfated fucan were extracted from the red alga B. occidentalis and from the invertebrates E. lucunter, H. monus, and S. franciscanus by protease digestion and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The purity of each fraction was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and NMR spectroscopy, as described (13Farias W.R.L. Valente A.P. Pereira M.S. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29299-29307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol.

Heparin was the fourth International Standard (85/502) and low molecular weight heparin (66 IU/mg) was the first International Standard (85/600), both from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK). Anticoagulant Action Measured by Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time—Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 1The abbreviations used are: APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; bis-ANS, bis-(8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate); NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. clotting assays were carried out by the method of Anderson et al. (27Anderson L.O. Barrowcliffe T.W. Holmer E. Johnson E.A. Sims G.E.C. Thromb. Res. 1976; 9: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) using normal human plasma or antithrombin + heparin cofactor II-depleted plasma obtained from Affinity Biologicals (Ontario, Canada). In these assays, plasma samples (90 μl) were mixed with different amounts of sulfated polysaccharide in 0.9% NaCl (10 μl) and warmed for 60 s at 37 °C, and then 100 μl of prewarmed APTT reagent (Celite-Biolab) was added and allowed to incubate for 2 min at 37 °C. Prewarmed 0.25 m calcium chloride (100 μl) was then added, and the APTT was recorded as the time for clot formation in a coagulometer (Amelung KC4A). The activity was expressed as international units/mg using a parallel standard curve based on the 4th International Heparin Standard (193 IU/mg). Inhibition of Thrombin or Factor Xa by Antithrombin and Heparin Cofactor II in the Presence of Sulfated Polysaccharides—Incubations were performed in disposable semi-microcuvettes. The final concentrations of reactants included 50 nm antithrombin or 68 nm heparin cofactor II, 15 nm thrombin, or factor Xa and 0–1000 μg/ml sulfated polysaccharide in 100 μl of TS/PEG buffer (0.02 m Tris/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1.0 mg/ml polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4). Thrombin or factor Xa was added last to initiate the reaction. After 60 s of incubation at room temperature, 500 μl of TS/PEG buffer containing 100 μm chromogenic substrate S-2238 for thrombin or S-2222 for factor Xa (Chromogenix AB, Mondal, Sweden) was added, and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded for 120 s. The rate of change of absorbance was proportional to the thrombin or factor Xa activity remaining in the incubation. No inhibition occurred in control experiments in which thrombin or factor Xa was incubated with antithrombin or heparin cofactor II in the absence of sulfated polysaccharide. In addition, no inhibition was observed when thrombin or factor Xa was incubated with sulfated polysaccharide alone over the range of concentrations tested. Preparation and Analysis of Low Molecular Weight Fragments from the Sulfated Galactan of B. occidentalis—Sulfated galactan from B. occidentalis (40 mg) was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 0.1 m HCl, and the solution was incubated at 60 °C for 60 min. Thereafter, the mixture was neutralized with 1.0 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. The partially hydrolyzed sulfated galactan was applied to a Sephacryl S-400/HR column (220 × 0.75 cm), equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, pH 7.0. The column was eluted with the same solution at a flow rate of 28 ml/h; fractions of 4 ml were collected and assayed by metachromasia using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (28Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar) and by the phenol-H2SO4 reaction (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 250-354Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar). The various fractions were pooled as four different subfractions, designated as F-I, F-II, F-III, and F-IV, and lyophilized. PAGE—The molecular masses of the sulfated polysaccharides were estimated by PAGE (17Pereira M.S. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol.

In these experiments, the sulfated polysaccharides (∼10 μg of each) were applied to a 6% 1-mm-thick polyacrylamide gel slab in 0.02 m sodium barbital, pH 8.6, and run for 30 min at 100 V. After electrophoresis the sulfated polysaccharides were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid and then washed for about 4 h in 1% acetic acid. The molecular masses of the low molecular weight fragments from the sulfated galactan were determined by comparison with the electrophoretic mobility of standard compounds (17Pereira M.S. Mulloy B.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra—1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer with a triple resonance probe. About 3 mg of polysaccharide were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 99.9% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). The spectra were recorded at 60 °C with HOD suppression by presaturation. Chemical shifts are reported relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm. Antithrombin-Affinity Chromatography—An antithrombin affinity column was prepared as described by Höök et al. (30Höök M. Björk I. Hopwood J. Lindahl U. FEBS Lett. 1976; 66: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 mg of antithrombin in 5 ml of coupling buffer (50 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.2) were mixed with 240 mg of N-acetylated heparin (120 mg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.2) to block free amino groups in the glycosaminoglycan-binding sites of the antithrombin molecules. HiTrap NHS-activated HP (2 ml) from Amersham Bioscience was combined with the antithrombin/heparin solution, and coupling was carried out as described by the manufacturer. The immobilized antithrombin maintains full heparin binding activity, because it produces two distinct heparin fractions that differ markedly in their anticoagulant activities, estimated as 432 and ∼20 IU/mg, respectively, based on the APTT assay. Intact sulfated galactans, their low molecular weight fragments, heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, or chondroitin 6-sulfate from shark cartilage, both from Sigma (200 μg of each), were applied to 1 ml of antithrombin affinity column, pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and connected to an FPLC system from Amersham Biosciences. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same Tris solution and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by using a linear NaCl gradient of 0.15 3 3.0 m NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for metachromatic property using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (28Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar). The NaCl concentration was estimated by conductivity, and the range of salt concentrations used in our experiments did not interfere with the metachromasy assay. Modifications of Intrinsic Fluorescence of Antithrombin Induced by Sulfated Polysaccharide—Successive 2-μl aliquots of 0.5 mg/ml stock solutions of heparin or sulfated galactans were added to 600 μl of a 1 μm solution of antithrombin in 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. After 1 min, changes in the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of antithrombin were monitored from 300 to 400 nm with excitation set at 280 nm, using an ISS/PC (Champaign, IL) spectrofluorimeter with a 1 × 1 cm2 quartz cuvette. The spectral areas were calculated according to the program provided by the equipment manufacturer. All experiments were performed at room temperature and under continuous stirring. Bandwidths were set at 0.5 nm for excitation and 2 nm for emission. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding of heparin to antithrombin was calculated from the enhancing of tryptophan fluorescence emission. These data were analyzed by nonlinear regression binding Equation 1 (31Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), ΔFF0=ΔFmaxF0×[AT]0+n[H]0+Kd−{([AT]0+n[H]0+Kd)2−4[AT]0n[H]0}1/22[AT]0(Eq. 1) where [AT]0 and [H]0 represent total concentrations of antithrombin and heparin, respectively; n is the apparent stoichiometry for the interaction; and ΔFmax/F0 is the maximum relative fluorescence change. The average molecular mass of heparin was estimated as 14,300 daltons. Binding of Bis-ANS to Antithrombin—The binding of bis-ANS to antithrombin was monitored by the addition of increasing amounts of bis-ANS to a 1 μm solution of antithrombin in 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. After 1 min under continuous stirring, the fluorescence emission from bis-ANS was recorded between 400 and 600 nm by using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. The extent of bis-ANS binding to antithrombin was evaluated using the spectral area. Solutions of bis-ANS bound to antithrombin were titrated with sulfated galactan or heparin. For these experiments, 1 μm antithrombin was incubated with 5 or 11 μm bis-ANS for 3 h in 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. This solution was then titrated with successive additions of 2 μl of heparin or sulfated galactans (0.5–1.0 mg/ml). After 1 min under continuous stirring, intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence was recorded, as described above. Analysis of the Antithrombin-Thrombin Covalent Complex—The ability of sulfated polysaccharides to catalyze the formation of a covalent complex between antithrombin and thrombin was determined by incubation of 0.5 μm human antithrombin and 1.4 μm thrombin (both from Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) in the absence or presence of heparin (0.01–1 μg/ml) or sulfated galactans (1–100 μg/ml) for 30 s at room temperature in TS/PEG buffer (final volume, 30 μl). The reaction was stopped by addition of 15 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (40 mg/ml SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.125 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8), followed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. An aliquot of the mixture (20 μl) was subjected to electrophoresis (100 V for 1 h) on an SDS-10% PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Anticoagulant Activity of Sulfated Galactans; Are There Specific Structural Motifs for the Anticoagulant Activity of Sulfated Galactans?—The anticoagulant activity of sulfated fucan and galactans from different sources was evaluated by APTT assay (Table I) and compared with that of heparin, a classical anticoagulant. The sulfated galactan from the red alga B. occidentalis (Fig. 1A) is the most potent among the galactans tested. This activity is greater than that of a linear sulfated α-l-galactan from E. lucunter (20 IU/mg), composed solely of 2-sulfated, 1,3-linked units (Fig. 1B). The galactan from H. monus (Fig. 1C), which has its sulfation (3-sulfated) as well as its glycosidic linkage (1,4-linked) in different positions, presents no anticoagulant activity (∼2 IU/mg). The replacement of 2-sulfated α-l-galactose by 2-sulfated α-l-fucose in a polymer with the same glycosidic linkage (S. franciscanus, Fig. 1D) does not restore the activity (∼2 IU/mg). These results indicate that the nature of the sugar residue and the sulfation position modify markedly the anticoagulant activity of these polysaccharides. The presence of 2,3-di-sulfated units in galactan molecules has an amplifying effect on the anticoagulant activity, so that the activity of B. occidentalis galactan is comparable with that of heparin (Table I). This is not merely a consequence of an increased charge density because the anticoagulant activity increases ∼6.5-fold between the sulfated galactan from E. lucunter and the sulfated galactan from B. occidentalis (based on APTT assays, Table I), whereas the sulfate content increases only ∼1.5-fold. Furthermore, the sulfated galactans from E. lucunter and H. monus have the same charge density (Fig. 1, B and C) but differ by a factor of 10 in their anticoagulant activities (Table I).Table IAnticoagulant properties of sulfated galactans and a sulfated fucanPolysaccharideSourceSulfate/monosaccharideAPTTaThe activity is expressed as international units/mg using a parallel standard curve based on the International Heparin Standard (193 units/mg).

Open table in a new tab The sulfated galactans from B. occidentalis and E. lucunter lose their anticoagulant effects when they are tested in a clotting assay by using antithrombin- and heparin cofactor II-depleted plasma (Table II). This observation shows that their activities are dependent on the presence of these two cofactors. Furthermore, the sulfated galactans from B. occidentalis and E. lucunter enhance thrombin or factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin or heparin cofactor II with sigmoid curves similar to those observed for heparin or dermatan sulfate (Fig. 2). The IC50 for thrombin or factor Xa inhibition can be determined easily from these curves and is reported in Table I. Among all the galactans investigated, the IC50 of that from B. occidentalis is closest to that of heparin and is significantly lower than that of dermatan sulfate, as expected based on the APTT assays. 2The second-order rate constants (m–1 s–1) for thrombin inhibition in the presence of antithrombin as a function of sulfated galactan concentration were determined as described by Olson et al. (31Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The value for this constant in the absence of sulfated polysaccharide is 1.5 × 104 m–1 s–1. It increases to 1.2 × 105, 4.0 × 106, 9.0 × 106, and 9.1 × 106 m–1 s–1 in the presence of 1, 10, 100, and 500 μg/ml of B. occidentalis galactan, respectively. In three different experiments no decrease in the rate is observed up to the highest concentration of sulfated galactan tested (500 μg/ml). The absence of a bell-shaped curve does not favor a bridging mechanism for thrombin inhibition, and thus differs from heparin (5Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For the sulfated galactan from E. lucunter, higher concentrations are required to obtain the same effect as with heparin or B. occidentalis galactan. With the other invertebrate polysaccharides, the thrombin activity based on antithrombin and heparin cofactor II inhibition is only marginally inhibited (Fig. 2, A and C), even at much higher concentration"

This decrease in cargo affinity for importin α correlates with a decrease in nuclear accumulation in vivo. Through these analyses, we show that the cell cycle-dependent nuclear import of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Swi6p correlates with a phosphorylation-dependent change in affinity for importin α.

The nuclear envelope establishes an essential regulatory barrier, which eukaryotic cells can use to control cellular processes such as gene expression and cell cycle progression. Thus, the dynamic compartmentalization of proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm can be utilized to spatially and temporally regulate protein function. Use of this nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization as a method for regulating cellular processes requires rapid, selective, and highly regulated nuclear transport. All macromolecules that move into and out of the nucleus are transported through nuclear pore complexes, large proteinaceous channels that are embedded in the nuclear envelope (1Wente S.R.

Delivery into the nucleus is dependent on the small GTPase Ran, which governs the interactions between the nuclear transport receptors and macromolecular cargoes and thus confers directionality to nucleocytoplasmic transport (3Görlich D.

Classic NLSs are typified by a single cluster of basic amino acids (monopartite) or two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10- to 12-amino acid linker (bipartite) (11Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar, 12Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The prototypical monopartite NLS is that of the SV40 large-T antigen (PKKKRKV) and the prototypical bipartite NLS is that of nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK). Recent studies that have examined the structural and energetic contributions made by individual amino acid residues within the sequence have refined our definition of a functional NLS and have thereby allowed easier identification of potential NLS signals within a protein sequence (13Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Conti E. Kuriyan J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The dynamic compartmentalization of NLS-containing proteins requires regulated changes in the relative import and/or export rates of a protein. In numerous cases, transport of an NLS cargo into the nucleus is regulated by phosphorylation (16Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). There are at least three ways in which phosphorylation could regulate protein import into the nucleus: 1) phosphorylation could cause a conformational change in the protein, which reveals or masks an NLS sequence; 2) phosphorylation could cause the release or binding of an NLS masking protein; or 3) phosphorylation could directly modulate the affinity of an NLS for the import receptor importin α. Examples of each of these mechanisms include the growth regulatory protein STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) where phosphorylation causes the protein to dimerize creating an NLS (18Bromberg J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the p65 subunit of NF-κB where phosphorylation of NF-κB-bound I-κB leads to degradation of I-κB and unmasking of the NF-κB NLS (19Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and the v-Jun oncoprotein where phosphorylation may directly modulate interactions with the NLS receptor (20Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Direct regulation of the interaction between an NLS cargo and importin α (regulation method 3 above) requires that the phosphorylation site is within or adjacent to the NLS. In contrast, the other two forms of regulation, methods 1 and 2 above, could be due to phosphorylation at any site within the protein. Each of these modes of regulation is non-exclusive, and thus a combination could regulate the nuclear transport of a particular cargo. Here we will focus on the direct modulation of importin α binding by phosphorylation. A number of important regulatory proteins contain phosphorylation sites located within or adjacent to classic NLS sequences. Recent studies have shown that transport into and out of the nucleus correlates with regulated phosphorylation at these sites. For example, p53 (21Wenzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3181) Google Scholar), the adenomatous polyposis protein (APC) (22Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Swi6 protein (23Sidorova J.M. Mikesell G.E. Breeden L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1641-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) all have documented phosphorylation sites within or proximal to their NLS sequences. Phosphorylation of these sites is associated with cytoplasmic protein localization and, conversely, hypophosphorylation correlates with nuclear protein localization. Thus, phosphorylation appears to represent an important mechanism to regulate the nuclear transport and consequently the function of an NLS cargo protein. Furthermore, the proximal position of the phosphorylation site to the NLS sequence suggests that the nuclear import of these cargoes may be modulated by directly regulating the binding affinity of the NLS for the NLS receptor. Importin α structural studies revealed the determinants for specific recognition of classic NLS sequences by the NLS-binding pocket of importin α (13Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Conti E. Kuriyan J.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Structures of the NLS binding domain of S. cerevisiae importin α (amino acid residues 89–530) bound to various NLS peptides showed that this domain of importin α consists of ten helical repeats known as armadillo motifs (13Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These armadillo motifs form a concave NLS binding groove, which is lined by conserved tryptophan and asparagine residues and surrounded by acidic amino acids. This structure creates specific binding pockets for NLS cargoes that combine both hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions with the positively charged residues of the NLS (13Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the addition of a negatively charged phosphate group proximal to an NLS could decrease binding of the NLS to importin α by disrupting the electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, a similarly positioned negative group within any classic NLS sequence may change its binding affinity for importin α and thus modulate the intracellular localization of a cargo protein. Recent studies that correlate differences in the rate of import with changes in the phosphorylation state of NLS-containing proteins (17Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 25Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have not examined the change in binding affinity between the NLS and its receptor using a quantitative assay. Furthermore, although one of these studies solved the co-crystal structure of a phosphorylated peptide containing an NLS sequence and non-autoinhibited importin α, the phosphorylation site was 14 amino acids upstream of the NLS sequence. In contrast, in our analyses the phosphorylation sites examined are located one amino acid upstream of the NLS (26Fontes M.R. Teh T. Toth G. John A. Pavo I. Jans D.A. Kobe B. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not known to what extent phosphorylation proximal to or within an NLS changes the binding affinity for importin α. Furthermore, it is important to determine if this change in affinity is sufficient to account for the observed changes in protein localization. A complete understanding of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of nuclear import by modulation of the interaction between an NLS and importin α requires a quantitative model for the import of a cargo that correlates the in vitro interaction energies with the in vivo localization of a protein. Here, we examine the effect of mimicking phosphorylation on the affinity of various NLS sequences for importin α. We have utilized site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro binding assays, and in vivo analyses to investigate this mechanism of regulating nuclear transport. Through these analyses we show that mimicking phosphorylation of residues adjacent to an NLS decreases the affinity of that NLS for importin α. This decrease in affinity correlates with a decrease in nuclear accumulation of an NLS cargo reporter protein. We use a model cargo, the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Swi6p, to demonstrate that this mechanism of regulation occurs in vivo. We propose that this mode of regulation could be exploited to artificially manipulate the steady state localization of proteins.

Briefly, the NLS-GFP was diluted in PBS to the desired concentration (∼20 nm) in a total volume of 2 ml in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. Changes in the anisotropy of the GFP fluorophore were monitored as increasing amounts of ΔIBB-importin α (ΔIBB-α) protein were added to the assay volume. Changes in anisotropy were used to calculate the fraction of the GFP fluorophore bound, yielding a binding isotherm for the reaction. The binding isotherm was then fit through non-linear regression to a simple binding equation to obtain dissociation constants. All Kd values are calculated as detailed at www.biochem.emory.edu/Hodel/Research/BindingCurves/fitting_curves.htm. The dissociation constant for full-length Swi6p binding to ΔIBB-α was measured using a competition assay (30Wang Z.X.

The assay was carried out as described above with changes in the anisotropy of Swi6 NLS-GFP monitored in the presence of increasing amounts of ΔIBB-α. This yielded a dissociation constant for Swi6 NLS-GFP binding to ΔIBB-α. To measure the binding of different full-length Swi6p variants to ΔIBB-α, a competition assay was carried out with each full-length protein. The binding of Swi6 NLS-GFP was examined in the presence of four different concentrations of recombinant full-length wild-type or mutant Swi6p. The Kd values for wild-type and mutant Swi6 proteins binding to ΔIBB-α were determined by fitting the resulting binding curves to an equation for the fraction of Swi6 NLS-GFP bound as a function of the Kd for Swi6 NLS-GFP, the Ki for the full-length Swi6 protein, the total Swi6 NLS-GFP concentration, the total ΔIBB-α concentration, and the total concentration of the full-length Swi6 protein. Binding energies were calculated using ΔG = RT ln Kd, where RT = –0.59 kcal/mol. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed by standard methods (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown to log phase in appropriate media at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in water and once in PBSMT (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 75 mm KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). Cells were subsequently lysed in PBSMT with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) by glass bead lysis. Equal amounts of total protein (generally 10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (32Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Microscopy—Direct fluorescence microscopy was used to localize GFP fusion proteins in live cells. For all experiments, cells were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the DNA and confirm the location of the nucleus. The localization of the fusion proteins was monitored by directly viewing the GFP signal in living cells through a GFP-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. Two-photon microscopy was employed to image the yeast cells for quantitative analysis of the distribution of the GFP fluorescence for each NLS fusion protein. The images were generated using a custom built two-photon microscope (33Berland K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1487-1488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quantification and nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (Rn/c) calculation was carried out by sectoring the images into nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments through a semi-automated procedure using the programs Mathematica (Wolfram Research) and Corel Photopaint (Corel). In each image, the average fluorescence per pixel was calculated for each sectored compartment. The compartments from different images in the Z-scan were grouped into continuous three-dimensional spaces representing multiple slices through a single yeast cell. The cytoplasmic fluorescence for each cell was then determined as the mean of the fluorescence per pixel averages across Z-scans containing that compartment. Because the dimensions of the nuclei of the cells were of the same order of magnitude as the distance between Z-scans (1 μm), the nuclear fluorescence was calculated using just the value determined from the single Z-scan image that sliced through the center of the nucleus of each cell. This analysis yields a ratio, Rn/c, of the amount of nuclear:cytoplasmic fluorescence within a population of cells, which serves as a measure of how much cargo protein is present in the nucleus. Generation of SWI6 Mutants—Amino acid substitutions were introduced in the S. cerevisiae SWI6 coding region using an overlap PCR strategy (35Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The desired DNA mutations were designed into the appropriate oligonucleotides. Yeast genomic DNA was used as a template to amplify SWI6 with the mutations. The PCR products were further amplified by PCR to generate the SWI6 open reading frame expressed from the endogenous SWI6 promoter. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the yeast centromeric (CEN) plasmid pRS315 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar strategy was used to clone the SWI6 mutations into the C-terminal GFP yeast expression vector (pAC242) and the bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen) (pAC762). For all constructs generated, the presence of each desired mutation and the absence of any other mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Phosphorylation of NLS Sequences—Comparison of the amino acid sequences from various regulatory proteins revealed that experimentally defined phosphorylation sites were located within or adjacent to a number of classic basic NLS sequences. The alignment of the NLSs of some of these proteins from yeast and humans with the prototypical classic SV40 NLS is shown in Fig. 1A. The position of the phosphorylated serine within the different NLS sequences suggests that the addition of a negatively charged phosphate group could directly impact binding to importin α. Furthermore, a similarly positioned negatively charged group within any classic NLS sequence might change its binding affinity for importin α. To test these predictions, we designed sequences where the residue proximal to two SV40 NLS derivatives (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) was either a serine (SV40 and SV40A7) or glutamic acid residue (SV40E and SV40A7E) (Fig. 1B). These studies utilized both the SV40 NLS and the weaker binding SV40A7 NLS (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), because it was also hypothesized that to regulate the localization of an NLS-containing protein, the NLS would need to bind importin α with a relatively weak affinity close to that of the threshold for a functional NLS. Within the recombinant proteins, the serine residue of SV40 and SV40A7 represents a hypophosphorylated NLS sequence and the negative glutamic acid residue of SV40E and SV40A7E mimics the negative charge created by phosphorylation and thus represents a constitutively phosphorylated NLS. NLS Binding to Importin α—To compare the binding of the SV40, SV40A7, SV40E, and SV40A7E NLS sequences to importin α, we used a quantitative solution binding assay based on fluorescence anisotropy (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The NLS sequences were cloned as in-frame N-terminal fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The strategy was designed such that each NLS is in the same context within the GFP fusion proteins (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, when comparing the different NLSs, there should be no contribution of conformational change to any of the binding affinities measured (15Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The binding of an NLS to N-terminally truncated importin α (ΔIBB-α) is used as a measure of binding to cytoplasmic importin α. This simplifies the interpretation and collection of data, because the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain, which is normally bound by importin β in the cytoplasm (37Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), is absent. We"
https://openalex.org/W1997780652,"The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades is an important mechanism for stress adaptation through the control of gene expression in mammals, yeast, and plants. MAPK activation has emerged as a common mechanism by which plants trigger pathogen defense responses following innate immune recognition of potential microbial pathogens. We are studying the non-host plant defense response of parsley to attempted infection by Phytophthora species using an experimental system of cultured parsley cells and the Phytophthora-derived Pep-13 peptide elicitor. Following receptor-mediated recognition of this peptide, parsley cells trigger a multifaceted innate immune response, involving the activation of three MAPKs that have been shown to function in the oxidative burst-independent activation of defense gene expression. Using this same experimental model we now report the identification of a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) that functions upstream in this pathway. This kinase, referred to as PcMKK5 based on sequence similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana AtMKK5, is activated in parsley cells following Pep-13 treatment and functions as an in vivo activator of all three MAPKs previously shown to be involved in this response. Gain- and loss-of-function mutant versions of PcMKK5, when used in protoplast co-transfection assays, demonstrated that kinase activity of PcMKK5 is required for PR gene promoter activation following Pep-13 treatment. Furthermore, using specific antibodies and immunofluorescent labeling, we demonstrate that activation of MAPKs in parsley cells correlates with an increase in their nuclear localization, which is not detectable for activated PcMKK5. These results suggest that activation of gene expression through MAPK cascades during innate immune responses in plants involves dynamic changes in the localization of the proteins involved, which may reflect the distribution of key protein substrates for the activated MAPKs.

Innate immunity describes common systems by which eukaryotes sense and respond to the majority of potential pathogens to prevent infection (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar, 2Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). These well studied systems of mammals and Drosophila employ receptor-mediated perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns to trigger common signal transduction pathways leading to the transcriptional activation of genes that act against the potential pathogens. It has become increasingly clear that non-host disease resistance in plants exhibits strong similarities to the innate immune protection systems of mammals and Drosophila (3Nürnberger T. Brunner F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Our previous work studying the non-host resistance response of parsley during interactions with Phytophthora species has supported this analogy. Cultured parsley cells respond to a diversity of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-like structures, referred to as elicitors, with the transcriptional activation of pathogen defense genes and the synthesis of antimicrobial phytoalexins (4Nürnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Foremost in our studies has been the characterization of responses induced by the Pep-13 elicitor, which represents a surface-exposed peptide part of, and essential for the function of, a secreted transglutaminase present in all tested species of Phytophthora (5Nürnberger T.

The temporal activation of elicitor-responsive defense genes has been the focus of considerable study in parsley, and a range of activated genes have been classified, according to their sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors, as either “immediate early,” “early,” or “late” transcriptional events (8Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Logemann E. Nürnberger T. Parniske M. Reinold S. Sacks W.R. Schmelzer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4150-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Members of the “immediate early” and “early” transcripts include WRKY transcription factors and pathogenesis-related (PR) 1The abbreviations used are: PR, pathogenesis-related; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; LUC, luciferase; GUS, β-glucuronidase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MBP, myelin basic protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. genes, respectively (9Somssich I.E.

Acta. 2002; 1576: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways leading to these transcriptional changes are multifaceted. Pep-13 treatment of parsley cells has been shown to stimulate rapid influx of Ca2+ leading to a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ ion concentration [Ca2+]I (13Blume B. Nürnberger T. Nass N. Scheel D. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1425-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). An oxidative burst response involving the activity of a diphenylene iodonium-sensitive NADPH oxidase activity is located downstream of this. The generation of O2˙− via this response has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to trigger gene expression changes resulting in the production of furanocoumarin phytoalexins after Pep-13 treatment (14Jabs T. Tschöpe M. Colling C. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4800-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Other Pep-13-induced changes in gene expression that are triggered independently of the oxidative burst require protein phosphorylation and protein kinase activities (15Ligterink W.

Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAPK signaling has been implicated in a whole diversity of plant stress situations involving both abiotic and biotic challenges (18Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y.

Pep-13 treatment of parsley cells stimulates the rapid activation of at least three MAPKs referred to as PcMPK6, PcMPK3a, and PcMPK3b (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These MAPKs were seen to be activated most strongly, specifically by stimuli that induce phytoalexin synthesis in parsley cells, namely elicitors. Subsequent loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that post-translational activation of these MAPKs plays an essential role in an oxidative burst-independent signaling pathway leading to the expression of “early” PR genes (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In all studied organisms, MAPKs form one component of a “three-kinase” module involving an upstream activator, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) (17Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Trends. Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 21Zwerger K. Hirt H. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MAPKK activities that function upstream of MAPK activation have been described for osmotic stress signaling in alfalfa (22Cardinale F. Meskiene I. Ouaked F. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), during tobacco N-gene mediated race/cultivar-specific recognition of tobacco mosaic virus (23Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc.

Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-450PubMed Google Scholar), as a consequence of a range of abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis (25Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Yoshida R. Shinozaki K. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 27: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Mizoguchi T. Irie K. Hirayama T. Hayashida N. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). In the latter case, while identifying a complete MAPK signaling cascade triggered following perception of bacterial flagellin, a direct requirement for the activity of the MAPKK in triggering downstream defense responses was demonstrated (27Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Full sequence analysis of the Arabidopsis genome has resulted in the identification of 10 genes encoding MAPKKs (28The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 977-983Crossref Scopus (7211) Google Scholar). Based upon sequence similarities within the family and with MAPKK-encoding genes from other plant species, a phylogenetic nomenclature has been suggested for the classification of MAPKKs into sub-groupings (29Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S.Q. Hirt H. Wilson C. Heberle-Bors E. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Innes R.W. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Walker J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Whether or not specific members of these sub-groups share similar functions remains to be established. Many stress applications when applied to plants result in the activation of the same subset of MAPKs. A major question is, therefore, how (or even if) response specificity can be maintained. One explanation that has arisen from studies in the alfalfa system is that an individual MAPK may have different activation characteristics (duration etc.) when it is acted upon by differing upstream MAPKKs (22Cardinale F. Meskiene I. Ouaked F. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Another important means by which specificity is maintained during MAPK signaling, as exemplified by studies in yeast, is the use of strict control of the localization of pathway components. Studies in mammals and yeast have shown that stimulus-induced activation of MAPKs correlate with dynamic changes in their localization, whereby the proteins often translocate to, and accumulate in, the nucleus of the cell. This is often required due to the nuclear localization of key MAPK substrates, including transcription factors, involved in the control of gene expression (30Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Pep-13 treatment of parsley cells stimulates a rapid nuclear localization of a MAPK originally referred to as ERMK (15Ligterink W. Kroj T. zur Nieden U. Hirt H. Scheel D. Science. 1997; 276: 2054-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), which was subsequently renamed as PcMPK3a (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We now present a more detailed analysis of the dynamic regulation of MAPK cascade proteins that function in the Pep-13-mediated activation of “early” defense gene expression. The identification of the upstream MAPKK, referred to as PcMKK5 because of its high sequence similarity (84%) to AtMKK5, that is activated in elicited parsley cells and is responsible for the activation of PcMPK6, PcMPK3a, and PcMPK3b is presented, and its role in controlling the transcriptional activation of the parsley PR2 gene is demonstrated. Further detailed immunolocalization studies are also presented that show rapid nuclear translocation and accumulation of PcMPK3a/b and PcMPK6 but a constitutive cytosolic localization of PcMKK5 following Pep-13 treatment of parsley cells. These results provide an insight into the regulation of defense gene expression through the activation and dynamic changes in localization of MAPK cascade components operating during innate immunity in plants. Elicitor Preparations—The Pep-13 elicitor was chemically synthesized as previously described (5Nürnberger T. Nennstiel D. Jabs T. Sacks W.R. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Cell. 1994; 78: 449-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola HrpZ was expressed and purified as a recombinant protein from Escherichia coli (35Lee J. Klüsener B. Tsiamis G. Stevens C. Neyt C. Tampakaki A.P.

Cell Culture Handling, Treatment, and Protoplast Isolation—Cultured parsley cells were maintained in modified Gamborg's B5 medium containing 1 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as previously described (5Nürnberger T.

Protoplasts were isolated 5 days following transfer of the culture to fresh medium according to previously described methods (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were treated by direct addition of the elicitor to cells previously washed and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min in fresh medium. Following appropriate time points, cells were collected by vacuum filtration, quickly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until use. Acquisition and Analysis of PcMKK-encoding cDNA—Degenerate primers, matching highly conserved peptide sequences in plant MAPKK, were designed and used to amplify DNA fragments by reverse transcription-PCR. The primers GTKCARCAYAARTGGAC and RTCYCTRTGDATDATATG amplified a 300-bp fragment of group A MAPKKs (29Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S.Q. Hirt H.

A lambda ZAP-Express™ (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) cDNA library of parsley was separately screened with these two DNA fragments to yield the respective cDNA clones. The clones from each class that contain the complete open reading frames were used for further studies. These were named PcMKK2 and PcMKK5, respectively, according to the genes with highest sequence similarities in Arabidopsis thaliana (29Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S.Q. Hirt H. Wilson C. Heberle-Bors E. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Innes R.W. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Walker J.C.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Clones encoding the desired mutations (see results section) were produced with the aid of the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). All clones were sequenced to verify the mutations. Generation and Bacterial Expression of His-tagged or GST Fusion Recombinant Proteins—MAPK-encoding open reading frames were cloned as BamHI/XhoI PCR fragments into vector pGEX 2T-2 (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) for expression in Escherichia coli (strain BL-21) as fusion proteins containing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) moiety. Recombinant proteins were subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For bacterial expression of the recombinant MKKs, the corresponding DNA fragments were cloned as EcoRI (for PcMKK2) or EcoRI/EcoRV (for PcMKK5) into pJC40 (36Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expres. Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. To express only the N-terminal regions of the MKKs, appropriate double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a stop codon were ligated into the SacI/BamHI (PcMKK2) or HindIII/BamHI (PcMKK5) restriction sites internal to the open reading frame. The resulting clones encode His-tagged 69- or 70-amino acid N-terminal sequences of PcMKK2 or PcMKK5, respectively. Protoplast Transfection and Co-transfection—For kinase activity measurements wild-type or mutagenized (-dd or -kr) PcMKK2 and PcMKK5 open reading frames were cloned into vector pRT100-c-myc containing the 35S-CaMV promoter (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Details of the cloning steps for these clones are available on request. Five micrograms of each PcMKK-effector construct was then used to transfect 2 × 106 protoplasts (∼200 μl) in combination with 5 μg of the same empty vector or plasmid containing either PcMPK6, PcMPK3a, PcMPK3b, or PcMPK4 as previously described (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following 24-h incubation in B5-sucrose solution (0.28 m sucrose, 1 mg/ml 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3.2 mg/ml B5 medium) the protoplasts were collected by centrifugation following the addition of 25 ml of 0.24 m CaCl2 and quickly frozen in liquid N2. Co-transfection experiments were performed as already described with the following modifications: For loss-of-function experiments 20 μg of PcMKK-kr constructs was transfected in combination with 5 μg of PR2 promoter-GUS construct and 5 μg of the normalization plasmid, pRTLUC (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following an 8-h incubation in B5-sucrose medium, the protoplasts were treated either with water or 100 nm Pep-13 and incubated for a further 14 h. For gain-of-function experiments, 5 μg of PcMKK-dd constructs were co-transfected with PR2-GUS and pRTLUC and incubated for 24 h. Following the incubations the protoplasts were collected and stored as described above. Protein Extraction—For assays of kinase activity, proteins were extracted by grinding frozen cells in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm glycerophosphate, 15 mm 4-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) followed by centrifugation (23,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Protoplasts were extracted in the same buffer by vortexing for 30 s. For studies involving luciferase (LUC) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) measurements, protoplasts were extracted in K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT. GUS and LUC Determinations—For LUC activities, 10 μl of protoplast extracts were mixed with 90 μl of LUC substrate (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm (MgCO3)4/Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 mm DTT, 300 μm Coenzyme A, 500 μm ATP, 500 μm luciferin) and measured for 5 s in a luminometer (Luminoscan Ascent plate reader, Labsystems, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). For GUS activities, 10 μl of protoplast extract was mixed with 40 μl of substrate (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 2 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following addition of 200 μl of 0.4 m Na(CO3)2, fluorescence was measured at 360 nm excitation/440 nm emission using the Cytofluor II apparatus (Biosearch, Bedford, MA). Antibody Production—Recombinant polypeptides corresponding to amino acids 1–69 of PcMKK2 and 1–70 of PcMKK5 were produced as His-tagged versions in E. coli. The purified His-tagged polypeptides were then used to raise antiserum following immunization of rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE gels were semi-dry blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Porablot-NCL, Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Membranes were blocked at 4 °C overnight in either TBS (20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl)/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder or 5% (w/v) BSA. Primary antibody solutions were prepared in blocking solution at the following dilutions: 1:5000 for anti-PcMKK2, 1:6000 for anti-PcMKK5, and 1:500 for monoclonal anti-c-myc (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Secondary antibodies coupled to either horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase were also prepared in blocking solution. All washes were performed in TBST. Blots were developed using either enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) or nitro blue terazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate precipitate formation. Immunoprecipitation Protein Kinase Assays—Cell or protoplast extracts containing 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with either anti-PcMPK6, anti-PcMKK2, anti-PcMKK5, or c-Myc antibodies, coupled to protein-A or protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequent washing and in vitro phosphorylation reactions were as described previously (16Kroj T. Rudd J.J. Nurnberger T. Gabler Y. Lee J. Scheel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2256-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PcMKK activity measurements were determined by the phosphorylation of 2 μg of “kinase dead” recombinant PcMPK6-kr, 3b-kr, or 4-kr as substrates. PcMPK activities were determined using the myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and MAPK or MBP phosphorylation was determined by phosphorimaging. Immunolocalization of PcMPKs and PcMKKs—5-day-old cultured parsley cells were treated with 100 nm Pep-13 or sterile H2O (control), harvested at the indicated time points, and fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were dehydrated and embedded in Paraplast Plus (Sigma-Aldrich), cut into 6-μm sections and kept at 4 °C in slide boxes until usage. Sections were dewaxed by immersing the slides twice in Xylol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min and rehydrated in series of ethanol. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS prior to individual incubation with the rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Pc-MPK3, PcMPK6, PcMPK4, PcMKK2, or PcMKK5 for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies were diluted, respectively, 1:200, 1:150, 1:150, 1:200, or 1:150 in BSA/PBS. Slides were washed four times in PBS and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted 1:350 in BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Following four further washes in PBS, slides were counterstained with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min to visualize nuclei and washed again twice with PBS. Control experiments were performed without primary antibody incubation. Sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a charge-coupled device video camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and computer image analysis software Axio Vision 2.0.5 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cloning of Two MAPKK-encoding cDNAs from Parsley Cells—To identify MAPKK activities that function upstream of the activation of the MAPKs, PcMPK6, 3a, and 3b, in the Pep-13 signal transduction cascade, we initiated a screen to clone MAPKK-encoding sequences from a parsley cDNA library. Studies in other plant systems have implicated specific members of the MAPKK sub-families, in particular the subgroup C (37Yang K.Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), as being involved in triggering plant defense reactions. To clone putative homologues of these MAPKKs from parsley we first performed sequence alignments of representative members of each phylogenetic sub-class. Degenerate primers,"
https://openalex.org/W2042712215,"A remarkable mystery of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (Tc) superconductors is the dependence of Tc on the number of CuO2 layers, n, in the unit cell of a crystal. In a given family of these superconductors, Tc rises with the number of layers, reaching a peak at n=3, and then declines: the result is a bell-shaped curve. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, it is still poorly understood and attention has instead been mainly focused on the properties of a single CuO2 plane. Here we show that the quantum tunnelling of Cooper pairs between the layers simply and naturally explains the experimental results, when combined with the recently quantified charge imbalance of the layers and the latest notion of a competing order nucleated by this charge imbalance that suppresses superconductivity. We calculate the bell-shaped curve and show that, if materials can be engineered so as to minimize the charge imbalance as n increases, Tc can be raised further."
https://openalex.org/W2016291989,"Caveolin-1, a putative mediator of intracellular cholesterol transport, is generally assumed to be integrated into the cytoplasmic leaflets of all cellular membranes. Lipid droplets form by budding at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and caveolin-1 is thought to be transferred to the droplet surface along with the cytoplasmic leaflet of ER membranes and not to enter the droplet core. We explored how caveolin-1 accesses lipid droplets from the ER by localizing caveolin-1 in ER membranes and in lipid droplets in cultured smooth muscle cells using freeze-fracture immunocytochemistry. We detected caveolin-1 in endoplasmic leaflets of ER membranes but never in cytoplasmic leaflets. Caveolin-1 was also present in lipid droplet cores. These findings are incompatible with the current hypothesis of lipid droplet biogenesis. We suggest that the inherent high affinity of caveolin-1 for neutral lipids causes caveolin-1 molecules to be extracted from the endoplasmic leaflets of ER membranes and to be transferred into the droplet core by inundating lipids during droplet formation."

The transport functions of the 16 biochemically identified mitochondrial carriers are concerned with shuttling substrates, biosynthetic intermediates, and cofactors across the inner membrane. Here the identification and functional characterization of the mitochondrial GTP/GDP carrier (Ggc1p) is described. The ggc1 gene was overexpressed in bacteria. The purified protein was reconstituted into liposomes, and its transport properties and kinetic parameters were characterized. It transported GTP and GDP and, to a lesser extent, the corresponding deoxynucleotides and the structurally related ITP and IDP by a counter-exchange mechanism.

The physiological role of Ggc1p in S. cerevisiae is probably to transport GTP into mitochondria, where it is required for important processes such as nucleic acid and protein synthesis, in exchange for intramitochondrially generated GDP. In the mitochondrial matrix, GTP is required as an energy source for protein synthesis; as a substrate for the synthesis of tRNA, mRNA, rRNA, and RNA primers; and as a phosphate group donor for the activity of GTP-AMP phosphotransferase (1Schricker R. Magdolen V. Strobel G. Bogengruber E. Breitenbach M. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31103-31110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and G proteins (2Thomson M.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2292-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In several organisms, GTP is synthesized in the mitochondria by succinyl-CoA ligase, which catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate with the generation of GTP, and by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, which catalyzes the transfer of the γ phosphate from ATP to a nucleoside diphosphate to yield nucleotide triphosphates. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, succinyl-CoA ligase produces ATP instead of GTP (4Przybyla-Zawislak B. Dennis R.A. Zakharkin S.O. McCammon M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate kinase is localized in the intermembrane space and absent in the matrix (5Amutha B. Pain D. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 805-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations imply that in S. cerevisiae GTP has to be imported into the mitochondria probably via a carrier system embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Despite the importance of GTP in mitochondrial metabolism, the transport of guanine nucleotides has not been characterized in yeast mitochondria, nor has any mitochondrial protein responsible for this transport been identified. There are only two indirect observations that suggest that GTP is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane of S. cerevisiae. First, mitochondrial protein synthesis is stimulated by the addition of external GTP (6Ohashi A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and second, on incubating yeast mitochondria with labeled GTP, the amount of radioactivity associated with mitochondria is time-dependent, inhibited by GDP and insensitive to carboxyatractyloside (7Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20941-20950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The inner membranes of mitochondria contain a family of proteins that transport various substrates and products into and out of the matrix (for a review see Ref. 8Palmieri F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by three tandem sequence repeats, each being approximately 100 amino acids in length and folded into two transmembrane α-helices joined by an extensive hydrophilic loop. The nuclear genome of S. cerevisiae encodes 35 members of this family. The functions of many members are unknown because the substrates transported have not yet been discovered. One of these, Ggc1p, i.e. the GTP/GDP carrier (encoded by YDL198c and previously known as Yhm1p) has been shown to be localized to mitochondria and to be a multicopy suppressor (by an unknown mechanism) of the ability of the abf2 null mutant to grow at 37 °C on glycerol (9Kao L.-R. Megraw T.L. Chae C.-B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and functional characterization of Ggc1p. This protein has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, and identified from its transport properties as a carrier for GTP and GDP. Ggc1p operates in yeast mitochondria with transport properties similar to those observed with the recombinant protein. In addition, ggc1Δ cells exhibit lower levels of GTP and increased levels of GDP in their mitochondria, are unable to grow on nonfermentable substrates, and have lost their mtDNA. The physiological role of Ggc1p in S. cerevisiae is probably to catalyze the exchange between external GTP and internal GDP to satisfy the need for GTP in the mitochondrial matrix, where this compound cannot be synthesized. This report presents the first information on the molecular properties of the mitochondrial GTP/GDP carrier and a definitive identification of its gene in S. cerevisiae. Sequence Search and Analysis—Data bases were screened with the sequence of Ggc1p (encoded by YDL198C) with BLASTP and TBLASTN. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.7). Yeast Strains, Media, and Preparation of Mitochondria—BY4741 (wild-type) and ggc1Δ yeast strains were provided by the EUROFAN resource center EUROSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany). In the ggc1Δ mutant the ggc1 (YDL198c) locus of S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0) (10Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar) was replaced by kanMX4. Wild-type cells and the deletion strain were grown in rich medium containing 2% bactopeptone and 1% yeast extract (YP), supplemented with either fermentable (2% glucose or 2% galactose) or nonfermentable (2% ethanol, 3% acetate, 10 mm oxaloacetate, 2% pyruvate, 2% lactate, or 3% glycerol) carbon sources. The final pH was adjusted to 4.5 or, with pyruvate or acetate, to 6.5. The mitochondria were isolated by standard procedures. The amount of Ggc1p in wild-type mitochondria was determined by quantitative immunoblotting (11Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Bacterial Expression and Purification of Ggc1p—The coding sequence of ggc1 (open reading frame YDL198c) was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the coding sequence, with additional BamHI and HindIII sites. The product was cloned into the pMW7 expression vector, and the construct was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Transformants were selected on 2× TY plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and screened by direct colony PCR and restriction digestion of plasmids. The overproduction of Ggc1p as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli was accomplished as described before (12Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem.

The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 17.5% gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue dye or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunodetection with a rabbit antiserum raised against bacterially expressed Ggc1p. The N terminus was sequenced, and the yield of purified Ggc1p was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples (11Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol.

Reconstitution into Liposomes and Transport Assays—The recombinant protein in sarkosyl was reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of substrates, as described before (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns, pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm PIPES-NaOH 1The abbreviations used are: PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis-(2-ethanesulfonic acid); mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide. at pH 7.0 (buffer A) or 1 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 7.0 in the experiments reported in Table II. Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [8-3H]GTP (Amersham Biosciences), [8,5′-3H]GDP, or [α-33P]dGTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to proteoliposomes and terminated by the addition of 15 mm bathophenanthroline and 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (the “inhibitor stop” method (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). In controls, the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the radioactive substrate. All of the transport measurements were carried out in the presence of 10 mm PIPES at pH 7.0 in the internal and external compartments, except in the experiments reported in Table II, where 1 mm PIPES at pH 7.0 was used. The external substrate was removed, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values. The initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes after 20 s (in the initial linear range of substrate uptake). For efflux measurements, proteoliposomes containing 1 mm substrate were labeled with carrier free [8-3H]GTP by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After 40 min, the external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75. Efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer A alone and terminated by adding the inhibitors indicated above.Table IIInfluence of membrane potential and ΔpH on the activity of reconstituted Ggc1pUptake ofInternal substrateKin+/Kout+Transport activityControl+Valinomycin+Nigericinmm/mmμmol/min/g of protein[8,5′-3H]GDPGDP1/1872856885GDP1/50895834862GTP1/1780795746GTP1/50810783497None1/50020[8-3H]GTPGDP1/50708694871GTP1/50685712694None1/50302 Open table in a new tab Other Methods—GTP and GDP were determined in mitochondrial extracts by enzymatic assays (17Kleineke J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6524-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For DNA detection, the BY4741 and the isogenic ggc1Δ strains were fixed with formaldehyde following growth on galactose to an A600 of 2.0. Then the DNA was stained by incubation with 1 μg/ml DAPI at 4 °C overnight. DAPI fluorescence was detected using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA). Bacterial Expression of Ggc1p—Ggc1p was expressed at high levels in E. coli C0214(DE3) (Fig. 1, lane 4). It accumulated as inclusion bodies and was purified by centrifugation and washing (Fig. 1, lane 5). The apparent molecular mass of the recombinant protein was 33.5 kDa (the calculated value with initiator methionine was 33,215 Da). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Approximately 80–90 mg of purified protein were obtained per liter of culture. The protein was not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression (Fig. 1, lane 2) nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the expression vector (Fig. 1, lane 3). Functional Characterization of Recombinant Ggc1p—Ggc1p was reconstituted into liposomes, and its transport activities for a variety of potential substrates were tested in homoexchange experiments (i.e. with the same substrate inside and outside). Using external and internal substrate concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively, the reconstituted protein catalyzed an active [8-3H]GTP/GTP exchange, inhibitable by a mixture of bathophenanthroline and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. It did not catalyze homoexchanges for phosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, pyruvate, malate, oxoglutarate, citrate, glutamate, aspartate, proline, histidine, lysine, arginine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, glutathione, carnitine, and choline. No [8-3H]GTP/GTP exchange activity was observed with Ggc1p that had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes nor by reconstitution of sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for Ggc1p or harvested immediately before the induction of expression. The substrate specificity of Ggc1p was examined in greater detail by measuring the uptake of [α-33P]dGTP into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various potential substrates (Fig. 2A). High rates of [α-33P]dGTP uptake into proteoliposomes were observed with internal GDP, GTP, dGDP, dGTP, IDP, and ITP. Much smaller activities were found with internal guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate and (deoxy)nucleoside di- and triphosphates of U and T. No activity was detected with internal (d)NDP and (d)NTP of A and C, with GMP and all the other (deoxy)nucleoside monophosphates tested, with NaCl and (not shown) with adenosine, adenine, NMN, FMN, thiamine pyrophosphate, NADH, NADPH, FAD, phosphate, pyrophosphate, and malate. External GDP and GTP and, to a lesser extent, dGDP, guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate, IDP, and ITP inhibited the [α-33P]dGTP/dGTP exchange (Fig. 2B). A low inhibition was found with UDP, UTP, dUDP, dUTP, TDP, and TTP, and virtually no effect was detected with (deoxy)nucleoside di- and triphosphates of A and C, GMP, the other nucleoside monophosphates and (not shown) phosphate, malate, succinate, ornithine, carnitine, oxaloacetate, sulfate, 2-oxoaminoadipate, and thiamine mono- and diphosphate. The [8-3H]GTP/GTP exchange reaction catalyzed by reconstituted Ggc1p was inhibited strongly by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline (inhibitors of many mitochondrial carriers), tannic acid, and bromcresol purple (inhibitors of the mitochondrial glutamate carrier) and only partially by the sulfydryl reagents mercuric chloride and mersalyl and by 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (inhibitor of the mitochondrial citrate carrier) (Fig. 3). Carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekate (powerful inhibitors of the ADP/ATP carrier) had little effect at much higher concentrations than those that completely inhibit the ADP/ATP carrier. Very little inhibition was observed with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, p-hydroxymercuribenzene sulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide, butylmalonate, phenylsuccinate, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (inhibitors of other mitochondrial carriers). Kinetic Characteristics of Recombinant Ggc1p—In Fig. 4, the kinetics are compared for the uptake of 0.5 mm [8-3H]GTP into proteoliposomes either in the presence or in the absence of internal 5 mm GTP. The uptake of GTP by exchange followed a first order kinetics (rate constant, 22.6 min–1; initial rate, 1.9 mmol/min/g protein), isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no [8-3H]GTP uptake was observed without internal substrate, suggesting that Ggc1p does not catalyze a unidirectional transport (uniport) of GTP. The uniport mode of transport was further investigated by measuring the efflux of [8-3H]GTP from prelabeled active proteoliposomes because it provides a more convenient assay for unidirectional transport (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the absence of external substrate no efflux was observed even after incubation for 20 min (Fig. 4B). However, upon the addition of external GTP or GDP, an extensive efflux of radioactivity occurred, and this efflux was prevented completely by the presence of the inhibitors pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that, at least under the experimental conditions used, the reconstituted Ggc1p catalyzes an obligatory exchange reaction of substrates. The exchange rate of internal GTP, GDP, or dGTP (5 mm) depended on the external concentration of [8-3H]GTP (0.2–20 μm), [8,5′-3H]GDP (1–100 μm), or [α-33P]dGTP (1–100 μm). With all three external substrates, the linear functions were obtained in double-reciprocal plots. They were independent of the internal substrate and intersected the ordinate close to a common point (not shown). For GTP, GDP, and dGTP, the transport affinities (Km) were 1.2 ± 0.1, 4.5 ± 0.7, and 15.9 ± 1.8 μm (mean values of 20, six and seven experiments, respectively). The average value of Vmax was 2.0 ± 0.4 mmol/min/g of protein. Several external substrates were competitive inhibitors of [8-3H]GTP uptake (Table I) because they increased the apparent Km without changing the Vmax (not shown). These results confirm that GTP is the highest affinity external substrate (Ki, 0.9 μm). The Ki values of all of the NTPs are lower than those of their corresponding NDPs. Furthermore, the affinity of Ggc1p for GTP and GDP is approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than for dGTP and dGDP and approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than for ITP and IDP.Table ICompetitive inhibition by various substrates of [8-3H]GTP uptake in proteoliposomes containing recombinant Ggc1pSubstrateKiμmGTP0.9 ± 0.2GDP5.0 ± 0.6dGDP53 ± 8dGTP24 ± 4G4P235 ± 36IDP208 ± 27ITP145 ± 30TDP1358 ± 182TTP356 ± 47UDP2036 ± 323UTP1243 ± 190dUDP3259 ± 444dUTP1856 ± 295 Open table in a new tab Influence of Membrane Potential and pH Gradient on the Ggc1p-mediated GTP/GDP Exchange—In view of the different charges carried by GTP and GDP at physiological pH levels, we investigated the influence of the membrane potential on the [8,5′-3H]GDP/GTP or [8-3H]GTP/GDP heteroexchanges catalyzed by the recombinant Ggc1p. A K+ diffusion potential was generated across the proteoliposomal membranes with valinomycin/KCl (calculated value was approximately 100 mV, positive inside) (Table II). The rates of the GDPout/GTPin and GTPout/GDPin heteroexchanges as well as of the GDP/GDP and GTP/GTP homoexchanges were unaffected by valinomycin in the presence or absence of the K+ gradient. In contrast, the aspartateout/glutamatein exchange, mediated by the recombinant and reconstituted aspartate/glutamate carrier, which is known to catalyze an electrophoretic exchange between aspartate– and glutamate– + H+ (13Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 19La Noue K.F. Meijer A.J. Brouwe A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was stimulated by valinomycin in the presence of a K+ gradient of 1/50 (mm/mm, in/out) (not shown). These results indicate that the GTP/GDP heteroexchange catalyzed by Ggc1p is not electrophoretic. We therefore became interested in the question as to whether the charge imbalance of the GTP/GDP heteroexchange is compensated by proton movement in the same direction as GTP. A pH difference across the liposomal membranes (basic inside the vesicles) was created by the addition of the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin to proteoliposomes in the presence of a potassium gradient of 1/50 (mm/mm, in/out) (Table II). Under these conditions the uptake of [8,5′-3H]GDP in exchange for internal GTP decreased, and the uptake of [8-3H]GTP in exchange for internal GDP increased, whereas no effect on the GDP/GDP and GTP/GTP homoexchanges was observed. Therefore, the GTP/GDP heteroexchange in either direction is driven by the ΔpH, indicating that the charge imbalance of the exchanged substrates is compensated by the movement of protons. Furthermore, no uptake of [8,5′-3H]GDP or [8-3H]GTP by unloaded liposomes was observed even in the presence of an energy input (either membrane potential or pH gradient). In other experiments it was found that the rate of 1 μm [8-3H]GTP uptake by proteoliposomes containing 2 mm GDP increased approximately three times on decreasing the external pH from 8.0 to 6.5 at a fixed internal pH of 8.0 (see Ref. 20Marobbio C.M.T. Vozza A. Harding M. Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar for the experimental conditions), whereas the rate of GTP/GTP exchange was virtually unaffected (not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the reconstituted Ggc1p catalyzes an electroneutral H+-compensated GTP/GDP heteroexchange. Mitochondria Lacking ggc1 Are Impaired in GTP Uptake and Contain Reduced Levels of GTP—Having established the transport function of Ggc1p by in vitro assays, the effect of deleting its gene on yeast cells was investigated. We first measured the contents of GTP and GDP in the mitochondria of wild-type and mutant cells. The amount of GTP was approximately 7-fold lower in ggc1Δ mitochondria than in the organelles from wild-type cells (Fig. 5A). Vice versa the amount of GDP was approximately 5.5-fold higher in ggc1Δ than in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 5A). These results are consistent with Ggc1p controlling the entry of GTP and the exit of GDP. In the next step, the [8-3H]GTP/GTP exchange was measured in proteoliposomes that were reconstituted with Triton X-100 extracts of wild-type and ggc1Δ mitochondria. No GTP/GTP exchange activity was detected upon reconstitution of the mitochondrial extracts from the knock-out strain (Fig. 5B). In contrast, an active GTP/GTP exchange was observed using parental mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 5B). The reconstituted GTP/GTP exchange was inhibited markedly by 2 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 2 mm bathophenanthroline, or 0.05% tannic acid and by the Ggc1p substrates GDP and dGTP (but not by ADP, ATP, CDP, and CTP) added at a concentration of 20 μm together with 1 μm [8-3H]GTP (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by measuring the [8,5′-3H]GDP/GDP and the [α-33P]dGTP/dGTP exchanges in proteoliposomes reconstituted with mitochondrial extracts from wild-type and ggc1Δ cells. Therefore, the Ggc1p present in the mitochondria exhibits the same specificity and inhibitor sensitivity than the reconstituted protein. As a control, Fig. 5B shows that, compared with the proteoliposomes reconstituted with wild-type extracts, in those reconstituted with ggc1Δ extracts the phosphate/phosphate exchange and (not shown), the ADP/ADP exchange fell by approximately 60% but was not abolished. When analyzing the levels of several mitochondrial proteins, we found that Ggc1p was completely absent in the mutant mitochondria (Fig. 5C). However, the amounts of the phosphate and the ADP/ATP carriers and (not shown) the oxaloacetate-sulfate and the thiamine pyrophosphate carriers and of cytochrome c1 and subunit 9 of complex III but not of porin were 50–60% lower in ggc1Δ mitochondria than in the organelles from wild-type cells (Fig. 5C). Therefore, in the mutant mitochondria, Ggc1p and GTP transport are completely absent, whereas the activities of other transporters are diminished because the transporters are present in smaller amounts in ggc1Δ than in wild-type mitochondria. Because the presence of a membrane potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane is a prerequisite for any protein transport into or across this membrane ((import) (21Sollner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we assessed the membrane potential of ggc1Δ mitochondria by using the fluorescent dye DiSC (3Barrientos A. Korr D.

The difference between the fluorescence after the addition of mitochondria and substrates and that after the subsequent addition of the potassium ionophore valinomycin (in the presence of external K+, leading to a complete dissipation of Δψ) is taken as an assessment of the mitochondrial membrane potential (18Zara V. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Vozza A. Rassow J. Palmieri F. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6524-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The decrease in valinomycin-sensitive fluorescence observed with ggc1Δ mitochondria was only approximately 4% of that observed with wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 5D), demonstrating that in vitro the membrane potential of ggc1Δ mitochondria was very low.

We examined postmortem PD and undiseased (control) substantia nigra for evidence of pathological crosslinking of alpha-synuclein by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) using immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot. Consistent with previous reports, we found that both tTG and its substrate-characteristic N(epsilon)-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine crosslink are increased in PD nigral dopamine neurons. Furthermore, both the tTG protein and its substrate crosslink coprecipitated with alpha-synuclein in extracts of PD substantia nigra. Unexpectedly, the isodipeptide crosslink was detected in the alpha-synuclein monomer as well as in higher molecular mass oligomers of alpha-synuclein. Although the intramolecularly crosslinked alpha-synuclein monomer was present in control tissue, it was highly enriched in PD substantia nigra. Conversely, significantly less uncrosslinked alpha-synuclein remained in the postimmunoprecipitate lysate of PD tissue than in control. Crosslinked alpha-synuclein, formed at the expense of the total alpha-synuclein monomer, correlated with disease progression. These results demonstrate that much of the alpha-synuclein monomer in PD nigra is crosslinked by tTG and thus may be functionally impaired. This modification appears to be an early step in PD pathogenesis, preceding the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2140608524,"Airway submucosal glands have been proposed as a primary site for initiating and sustaining airway disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, it has been difficult to define the role of CFTR in gland fluid secretion because of concerns in interpreting experiments on diseased CF human airways subjected to chronic infection and inflammation. Here, we test the role of CFTR in gland fluid secretion by using a selective CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172) in pig and human airways. Measurements of single-gland fluid secretion rates showed inhibition of both cholinergic and cAMP-stimulated fluid secretion by CFTRinh-172. Secreted fluid [Na+] and [Cl-] measured by fluorescence ratio imaging were 101 and 116 mM, respectively, and not significantly altered by secretory agonists or CFTR inhibition. Gland fluid pH was 7.1 and reduced by 0.4 units after CFTR inhibition. Gland fluid viscosity, determined by photobleaching of FITC-dextran, was threefold increased in pilocarpine-stimulated gland fluid after CFTR inhibition, and protein concentration was increased from 12 to 20 mg/ml. Our data provide strong evidence that gland fluid secretion is CFTR-dependent. The relatively hyper-viscous and acidic fluid secretions produced by acute CFTR inhibition support a role for defective gland function in CF lung disease and provide a rational basis for pharmacological creation of a large animal model of CF."
https://openalex.org/W2049434243,"The newly identified specific V-ATPase inhibitor, salicylihalamide A, is distinct from any previously identified V-ATPase inhibitors in that it inhibits only mammalian V-ATPases, but not those from yeast or other fungi (Boyd, M. R., Farina, C., Belfiore, P., Gagliardi, S., Kim, J. W., Hayakawa, Y., Beutler, J. A., McKee, T. C., Bowman, B. J., and Bowman, E. J. (2001) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 297, 114-120). In addition, salicylihalamide A does not compete with concanamycin or bafilomycin for binding to V-ATPase, indicating that it has a different binding site from those classic V-ATPase inhibitors (Huss, M., Ingenhorst, G., Konig, S., Gassel, M., Drose, S., Zeeck, A., Altendorf, K., and Wieczorek, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 40544-40548). By using purified bovine brain V-pump and its dissociated V(1) and V(0) sectors, we identified the recognition and binding site for salicylihalamide to be within the V(0) domain. Salicylihalamide does not inhibit the ATP hydrolysis activity of the dissociated V(1)-ATPase but inhibits the ATPase activity of the holoenzyme by inhibiting the V(0) domain. Salicylihalamide causes a dramatic redistribution of cytosolic V(1) from soluble to membrane-associated form, a change not observed in cells treated with either bafilomycin or NH(4)Cl. By synthesizing and characterizing a series of salicylihalamide derivatives, we investigated the structural determinants of salicylihalamide inhibition in terms of potency and reversibility, and used this information to suggest a possible binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2118929373,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors are key regulators of angiogenesis and are potential targets in cancer therapy. Here we report the down-regulation of activated VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1/Flt-1 by endocytosis and proteolytic degradation. VEGF stimulation induced a ternary complex of Flt-1, c-Cbl, and CD2AP. Substitution of tyrosine 1333 in Flt-1 with phenylalanine (Y1333F) impaired its binding to c-Cbl. In a transient expression system, VEGF stimulated colocalization of Flt-1, CD2AP, and c-Cbl in endocytic vesicles. This colocalization was significantly impaired by an inhibitor of VEGFR kinase SU5416, the Y1333F mutation in Flt-1, or by a dominant negative form of CD2AP. In Flt-1-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells, expression of the wild-type CD2AP enhanced VEGF-stimulated internalization as well as ubiquitination of Flt-1 whereas that of a mutated form of either CD2AP or c-Cbl failed to do so. These results suggest that the c-Cbl/CD2AP complex binds to activated Flt-1 and plays a crucial role in its endocytosis and subsequent degradation."

This interaction is required for the integration of Atp6p into a partially assembled subcomplex of the ATPase. Pulse labeling and chase of mitochondrial translation products in vivo indicate that Atp6p is less stable and more rapidly degraded in an atp10 null mutant than in wild type.

The bulk of cellular ATP of eukaryote cells is synthesized by the F0F1-ATPase complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The ATPase is composed of two functionally and physically coupled parts, i.e. the membrane-embedded F0 sector to which the hydrophilic F1 sector is attached from the matrix side. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the F0 sector consists of eight subunits (for reviews, see Refs. 1Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg.

An oligomer of Atp9p forms a ring-like structure that rotates in the membrane bilayer and, together with Atp6p, drives proton transfer across the inner membrane. Six other subunits, namely Atp8p, Atp4p, and the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) and its subunits d, f, and h, form the stator arm connecting F0 to F1. The γ, δ and ϵ subunits of F1 are part of a central stalk linking it to the Atp9p ring. ATP synthesis depends on a rotation of this stalk within the static catalytic F1 hexamer made up of three α and three β subunits.

The nuclear gene ATP10 was identified in a genetic screen to be essential for the proper assembly of F0 (19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Atp10p, the mitochondrial encoded ATPase subunits are synthesized but not assembled into F0, because the F1-ATPase is only loosely attached to the membrane. Because Atp10p is not a subunit of the ATPase complex (19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not involved in post-translational processing or modification of Atp6p (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it was proposed to be an Atp6p-specific chaperone (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ability of a mutation near the carboxyl terminus of Atp6p to suppress an atp10 null mutant (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) points at a role of Atp10p in folding, assembly, or maintenance of Atp6p. The matrix chaperone Hsp70p has also been shown to be necessary for biogenesis of the F0 sector (21Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This general chaperone binds to and facilitates the association of Atp6p with a partially assembled intermediate of F0 containing the Atp9p oligomer. To analyze the function of Atp10p in more detail, we studied the assembly of the ATPase complex following radiolabeling of the mitochondrially encoded subunits in isolated wild type and mutant mitochondria. Based on the results reported here and those of earlier studies, Atp10p is proposed to function as a chaperone that interacts physically with newly synthesized Atp6p and maintains it in an assembly-competent state. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—All strains used in this study were isogenic with the wild type strain W303-1A. Construction of the aW303ΔATP10 deletion mutant and isolation of the aW303ΔATP10/R1 and R3 revertants (independent revertants with the identical mutation in ATP6) have been described (16Ackerman S.H.

Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in YP (1% yeast extract and 2% peptone) medium supplemented with 2% galactose or 0.1% KOH-buffered lactate (22Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (22Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar), except that the cultures were adjusted to 2 mg/ml chloramphenicol for 2 h prior to harvesting of the cells. Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—For in vivo labeling of mitochondrial translation products, cells were grown in YPGal medium (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone). Cycloheximide (150 μg/ml) was added to block cytosolic protein synthesis. After the addition of [35S]methionine, cells were incubated with agitation for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 mm puromycin and 25 mm cold methionine and incubation for 10 min. After different time periods, aliquots were removed. Proteins were extracted, precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled in vitro as described previously (22Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar, 23Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (40 μg protein) were incubated in translation buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 15 mm KH2PO4, 13 mm MgSO4, 0.15 mg/ml all amino acids except methionine, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.6 units of pyruvate kinase and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine. Typically, samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and labeling was stopped by the addition of 25 mm cold methionine. The samples were further incubated for 5 min to complete synthesis, and mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation, washed in 1 ml 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes/HCl, pH 7.4, and lysed in 25 μl of LiDS sample buffer (2% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8). Samples were shaken at 4 °C for 10 min prior to loading on the gel. Heating was avoided to minimize dissociation of the ATPase oligomers. Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were carried out essentially as described (24Herrmann J.M. Westermann B. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 217-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial gene products were radiolabeled in isolated mitochondria in a translation buffer with bovine serum albumin omitted and Tris/HCl replaced by Hepes/KOH to prevent quenching of the amino group-specific cross-linking reagents. Stock solutions (24 mm) of the cross-linking reagents dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) 1The abbreviations used are: DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; LiDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate. and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted 1:100 into the labeling reaction. An equal concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to mock-treated samples. Following cross-linking, 25 mm glycine and cold methionine were added to quench unreacted cross-linkers. For immunoprecipitation, mitochondria were lysed in 25 μl of 1% SDS and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and diluted in 40 volumes of 0.1% Triton X-100, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. For co-immunoprecipitation reactions, the SDS buffer was omitted, and the mitochondria were lysed directly in Triton buffer. After a clarifying spin for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, the extract was added to 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 4–6 μl of rabbit antisera. After incubation of 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in LiDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. Atp10p Is in Direct Contact with Newly Synthesized Atp6p— Previous evidence for a genetic interaction of Atp10p and Atp6p (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggested that the two proteins may also interact physically. To detect a complex of the two proteins, mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of the non-cleavable cross-linker DSS. The labeled mitochondria were solubilized, and the extract was treated with antibody against Atp10p in the presence of protein A-Sepharose beads. Autoradiography of the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE indicated background signals of all the translation products, irrespective of the presence or absence of the cross-linker. This unspecific adsorption to Sepharose is due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the polypeptides. A band of an apparent size of 52 kDa was enriched by Atp10p antibodies (Fig. 2, asterisk). This band only occurred in the samples treated with the cross-linker and was absent in the Δatp10 mutant and the Δatp10 revertant (W303ΔATP10/R1) (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This indicated that one of the radiolabeled translation products is in the proximity of Atp10p during or directly following its synthesis in the mitochondria. The apparent size of the novel band (52 kDa) is consistent with it being an adduct of Atp10p (30 kDa) and Atp6p (22 kDa). Atp6p has a mass of ∼28 kDa, but in the SDS-PAGE system used in this study it migrates as a protein of 22 kDa. To confirm that Atp6p interacts with Atp10p, mitochondria were pulsed with [35S]methionine in the presence of DSP. Proteins cross-linked through DSP resist cleavage during lysis of mitochondria and immunoprecipitation but are cleaved under the reducing conditions of the sample buffer used in SDS-PAGE. Following labeling of wild type mitochondria in the presence of DSP, samples treated with the Atp10p-specific antibodies (but not preimmune serum) were enriched for Atp6p (Fig. 3A, asterisk). Despite its low efficiency, cross-linking was specific, as there was no enrichment of Atp6p in mitochondria of the mutant or revertant (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Poor cross-linking is often observed with membrane proteins because of their relatively low content of charged amino acid residues. The results obtained with DSP are consistent with the notion that the 52-kDa cross-linking product consists of an Atp6p/Atp10p complex and indicate that Atp10p is in the proximity of newly synthesized Atp6p. The Atp6p released from the adduct appeared to migrate slightly faster than the Atp6p that had not been cross-linked (Fig. 3A, lanes marked T, loaded with total mitochondrial proteins). This mobility shift is caused by the immunoprecipitation procedure, because it is also seen when Atp6p is immunoprecipitated with Atp6p-specific antibodies from mitochondrial extracts that were not treated with a cross-linker (Fig. 3B). The Interaction of Atp10p with Atp6p Can Occur Post-translationally—Proteins involved in membrane insertion of mitochondrial translation products typically interact with their substrates co-translationally. This was shown to be the case for the Oxa1p translocase, which promotes insertion of the mitochondrially translated subunits of cytochrome oxidase into the inner membrane (25Preuss M. Leonhard K. Hell K. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). On the other hand, factors that coordinate oligomerization of completed and folded subunit polypeptides are more likely to bind to their substrates post-translationally. To assess if the Atp10p/Atp6p complex is formed co- or post-translationally, DSP was added to mitochondria either during or following the labeling reaction. No significant difference was noted in the amount of Atp6p associated with Atp10p under the two conditions (Fig. 4). This indicates a post-translational interaction of Atp10p with Atp6p but does not exclude that it can also occur co-translationally. Assembly of the ATPase Complex in Isolated Wild Type Mitochondria—Assembly of the ATPase complex was reported to occur in a sequential and obligatory order (6Hadikusumo R.G. Meltzer S. Choo W.M. Jean-Francois M.J. Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Paul M.F. Velours J. Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Aigle M. Guerin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as depicted in Fig. 1. To gain better insights into the role of Atp10p in this process, we studied the assembly of the ATPase complex in isolated mitochondria. Assembly in this in vitro system was enhanced in cells allowed to grow in the presence of chloramphenicol for 2 h prior to isolation of the mitochondria. Under these conditions, mitochondrial translation is blocked, leading to increased pools of nuclear gene products available for interaction with the newly synthesized subunits made in organello. In agreement with earlier findings (21Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), all eight mitochondrially encoded polypeptides and two slower migrating bands with apparent masses of 48- and 54-kDa are detected in the autoradiogram of the labeled mitochondria (Fig. 5A, lane 1). The 48-kDa and 54-kDa products represent oligomers of F0 subunits that are incompletely depolymerized by dodecyl sulfate (21Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) but are converted to the monomeric constituents when proteins are treated with trichloroacetic acid prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Both oligomers are associated with the F1-ATPase, as they were co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies against the F1α subunit (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The enrichment of the 54-kDa oligomer suggests that this form is more efficiently or more stably attached to the F1 sector recognized by the F1α-antiserum. An antiserum against the Atp4p subunit also co-immunoprecipitated the three mitochondrially synthesized ATPase subunits. In this instance, however, more Atp6p was co-precipitated because of its direct interaction to Atp4p (2Velours J. Paumard P. Soubannier V. Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Graves P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This indicates that, following synthesis in isolated mitochondria, Atp6p, Atp9p, and most likely also Atp8p assemble, at least in part, into complexes that contain subunits of the stator arm and F1. The composition of the 48- and 54-kDa oligomers was examined by separating labeled wild type mitochondria by SDS-PAGE in one dimension, partially dissociating the oligomers in a strip of the gel with trichloroacetic acid, and separating the proteins in the acid treated strip by SDS-PAGE in a second dimension. The trichloroacetic acid treatment caused the release from the 48-kDa complex of a radioactive protein that migrated like Atp9p, as well as the release from the 54-kDa complex of two proteins, one corresponding to Atp9p and the other to Atp6p (Fig. 5B). Nuclear encoded ATPase subunits that might be present in the two oligomers are not labeled and, therefore, cannot be detected by this method. The presence of Atp6p in the 54-kDa oligomer is supported by Western blot analysis of mitochondrial proteins probed with an Atp6p-specific antiserum, which reacted with the 22-kDa Atp6p monomer and the 54-kDa oligomer (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that isolated mitochondria are capable of assembling two different subcomplexes of the ATPase, i.e. a 48-kDa complex lacking Atp6p and one of 54 kDa that contains Atp6p. Atp10p Is Required to Form the 54-kDa Complex—Impaired biogenesis of the F0 sector in the Δatp10 mutant was shown previously to markedly lower the steady-state levels of Atp6p (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This was confirmed with an antibody against Atp6p, which failed to detect the monomeric or assembled form of Atp6p in the mutant (Fig. 6A). The F0 defect in Δatp10 mitochondria was studied in more detail by examining the oligomerization state of newly synthesized Atp6p. Pulse labeling of mitochondria isolated from the Δatp10 mutant showed that all three of the mitochondrially encoded subunits of the ATPase were synthesized at ∼50% of the rate in wild type (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, whereas the 48-kDa oligomer was also present in the mutant, the 54-kDa oligomer was absent (indicated by the top arrow in Fig. 6B). Thus, although the Atp9p oligomer assembles independently of Atp10p, formation of the larger complex containing Atp6p is blocked in the absence of Atp10p. Earlier evidence indicated that the 48-kDa but not the 54-kDa oligomer interacts with mitochondrial Hsp70p (21Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of mitochondrial translation products (Fig. 6C). Treatment of the isolated 48-kDa oligomer with acid caused it to collapse to monomeric Atp9p (Fig. 6C, see bands labeled TCA +). This confirms the presence of Atp9p, but not of Atp6p or Atp8p, in the 48-kDa oligomer. Atp10p was not required for the interaction of Hsp70p with the Atp9p oligomer, as similar amounts of Atp9p could be precipitated with Hsp70p antibodies in wild type and Δatp10 mitochondria (Fig. 6D). Thus, Atp10p and Hsp70p appear to play distinct roles and interact with different pools of unassembled ATPase subunits, i.e. Atp10p with Atp6p and Hsp70p with a partially assembled complex containing the Atp9p oligomer. Atp10p Partially Protects Newly Synthesized Atp6p against Proteolysis—In organello incorporation of [35S]methionine into Atp6p is reduced in the Δatp10 mutant (Figs. 5A and 6B). This could be due to reduced synthesis or increased degradation of the protein by proteases. To distinguish between these possibilities, mitochondrial translation products were radiolabeled in yeast cells in the presence of cycloheximide for 15 min. Translation was stopped by the addition of puromycin, and the stability of the synthesized proteins was analyzed after various periods of time (Fig. 7A). No significant difference was found in the turnover of newly synthesized Atp8/9p in the wild type and the mutant during the 2 h period of chase. In contrast, turnover of Atp6p was higher in the mutant than in the wild type (Fig. 7, A and B). Atp10p could be protecting Atp6p by directly shielding it from degrading proteases or by promoting the assembly of Atp6p into a protease-resistant complex. Formation of hetero-oligomeric membrane complexes depends on the assistance of specific chaperones that interact with their cognate subunits. This may be necessary in part because of the hydrophobic nature of unassembled subunits, which may have to be stabilized by accessory factors to allow them to progress though the assembly pathway and minimize non-productive side reactions. The results reported here, together with those reported earlier, indicate that Atp10p has such a chaperone function in assembly of Atp6p, as evidenced by the following four observations. 1) Atp10p can be cross-linked to newly synthesized Atp6p. This interaction occurs post-translationally and appears to be transient, as Atp10p is not a subunit of the functional ATPase complex. 2) Atp10p is required for proper assembly of Atp6p into the F0 sector of the ATPase. A role of Atp10p for proteolytic maturation or post-translational modification of Atp6p was excluded (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding of Atp10p to Atp6p is more likely to be necessary to maintain Atp6p in an assembly-competent state. 3) Atp6p is more prone to proteolytic degradation in the Δatp10 mutant, indicating that it is directly or indirectly protected by Atp10p. 4) A point mutation in Atp6p can suppress Δatp10 mutants (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The increased stability of Atp6p in the suppressed strain may reflect a shift of the equilibrium from degradation toward assembly of Atp6p. Based on these observations, we propose that following synthesis on mitochondrial ribosomes, Atp6p is bound to Atp10p. This interaction prevents degradation and/or aggregation of Atp6p and channels it to associate with a preformed subcomplex of the ATPase (Fig. 8). The integration of Atp6p into this intermediate complex may be dependent directly on Atp10p. Alternatively, Atp10p may shift the equilibrium from degradation/aggregation to assembly. The latter seems more likely in view of the observation that Δatp10 mutants are leaky and display slow growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (20Paul M.F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the Δatp10 revertant the equilibrium might be shifted further toward assembly as a result of the increased stability of Atp6p. It is also possible, however, that the suppressor mutation helps to increase the efficiency with which Atp6p is assembled, thereby sparing a larger fraction of the protein from degradation. Assuming that Atp6p is one of the last subunits to be incorporated into the complex as proposed previously (12Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the intermediate complex with which Atp6p assembles would be expected to contain most or all of the other ATPase subunits. Two oligomeric complexes are detected in mitochondria that are allowed to synthesize the three endogenously encoded subunits of the ATPase. The 48-kDa oligomer observed in wild type mitochondria is also detected in mitochondria lacking Atp10p. In the absence of Hsp70p function, the 48-kDa subcomplex loses its competence to interact with Atp6p, and assembly of the final ATPase structure is arrested (21Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The interaction with the Hsp70p chaperone may stabilize this intermediate for further progression in the assembly pathway. Thus, the final step of the pathway appears to rely on two chaperones, namely the classical chaperone Hsp70p, which binds to the 48-kDa oligomeric intermediate, and Atp10p, which interacts with newly synthesized Atp6p and promotes its incorporation into a late assembly intermediate. Members of the Hsp70p and Hsp60p families of chaperones participate in numerous cellular processes by facilitating folding and assembly of a large number of different substrates. In contrast, some reactions employ factors that have a single substrate polypeptide as their target. Although several such specific assembly factors have been reported in recent years, little is known about the mechanisms by which they work. One well studied example, Ump1p, is a specific factor that associates with and helps to complete the assembly of proteasome intermediates (27Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Ump1p tightly regulates proteasome biogenesis and is removed at the final assembly step. The interaction with Ump1p is thought to prevent the harmful effects of proteolytically active but incompletely assembled proteasome intermediates. Despite the differences in the physiological role of the proteasome and the ATPase, subunit-specific chaperones like Atp10p may provide similar protective functions. The partially assembled F0 sector of the ATPase could present potential problems for the cell because of its ability to dissipate the membrane potential. This might explain why the proton-conducting Atp6p subunit is integrated into the complex at a late assembly step (12Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Atp10p might control this critical step by ensuring the maintenance of a pool of assembly-competent Atp6p subunits. Whereas the cellular levels of general chaperones that are not occupied by substrates vary greatly with different temperatures and physiological conditions, the pool of specific chaperones can be precisely controlled and adapted to the needs of a certain biological process. An important focus of future work will be to understand the regulation of substrate-specific chaperones, such as Atp10p, and to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which they bind and release their substrate proteins.

In addition, a loop segment (residues 599-611) in TOP differs in conformation and degree of order from the corresponding neurolysin loop, suggesting it may also play a role in activity differences. Cysteines thought to mediate covalent oligomerization of rat TOP, which can inactivate the enzyme, are found to be surface-accessible in the human enzyme, and additional cysteines (residues 321,350, and 644) may also mediate multimerization in the human homolog. Disorder in the N terminus of TOP indicates it may be involved in subcellular localization, but a potential nuclear import element is found to be part of a helix and, therefore, unlikely to be involved in transport.

Cysteines thought to mediate covalent oligomerization of rat TOP, which can inactivate the enzyme, are found to be surface-accessible in the human enzyme, and additional cysteines (residues 321,350, and 644) may also mediate multimerization in the human homolog. Disorder in the N terminus of TOP indicates it may be involved in subcellular localization, but a potential nuclear import element is found to be part of a helix and, therefore, unlikely to be involved in transport. A large acidic patch on the surface could potentially mediate a protein-protein interaction, possibly through formation of a covalent linkage. Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, 1The abbreviations used are: TOP, thimet oligopeptidase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: TOP, thimet oligopeptidase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 3.4.24.15) is a 77-kDa zinc metalloendopeptidase that bears the His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His (HEXXH) active site sequence motif characteristic of a large superfamily of metallopeptidases (1Barrett A.J.

Consistent with its broad tissue and subcellular compartment distribution, TOP appears to play a variety of physiological roles. It has been implicated in the metabolism of a number of small peptides active in the central nervous system and the periphery including neurotensin, bradykinin, somatostatin, opioids, and angiotensin I (4Dando P.M.

In addition, recent reports demonstrate that TOP is primarily responsible for degrading peptides released from proteasomes, thereby limiting the extent of antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules (27Saric T.

Kinouchi T. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and it promotes increased degradation of the Aβ peptide, a key component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (31Yamin R.

Expression of TOP activity is regulated at the level of transcription (32McCool S. Pierotti A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33McCool S. Pierotti A.R.

J. 2003; 376: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but activity may also be regulated by posttranslational modification. TOP oligomerizes by intermolecular disulfide bond formation in the absence of reductant, resulting in a decrease or loss of activity, and this modulation by multimerization may be a physiological regulatory mechanism (35Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A. Tullai J.W. Margulies E.H. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17395-17399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Shrimpton C.N.

Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The activity of rat TOP can also be modulated by phosphorylation, and phosphorylated forms of the enzymes have been isolated from cultured cells (38Tullai J.W. Cummins P.M. Pabon A. Roberts J.L. Lopingco M.C. Shrimpton C.N. Smith A.I. Martignetti J.A. Ferro E.S. Glucksman M.J. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which has eight other known members that all share some sequence similarity with TOP. The member of this family most closely related to TOP, the peptidase neurolysin, has more than 60% sequence identity and a similar tissue distribution (1Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G.

Both TOP and neurolysin hydrolyze only short peptides, generally less than 20 residues in length, and they recognize cleavage sequences that vary widely, with no consistent preferences at any position relative to the site of hydrolysis (1Barrett A.J.

TOP and neurolysin cleave most bioactive or synthetic peptides at the same peptide bond, as might be expected from their high level of sequence similarity. Interestingly though, the two peptidases hydrolyze some peptides at different sites (1Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A.

For example, although both enzymes play an important role in metabolizing the 13-residue neuropeptide neurotensin, TOP cleaves between Arg-8 and Arg-9, whereas neurolysin cleaves between Pro-10 and Tyr-11. Comparing TOP and neurolysin will, therefore, provide insight into the mechanisms for the complex substrate specificity in these enzymes, which is frequently found in other enzymes that metabolize bioactive peptides, the neuropeptidases.The neurolysin crystal structure (49Brown C.K. Madauss K. Lian W. Beck M.R. Tolbert W.D. Rodgers D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that the enzyme active site is at the bottom of a deep, narrow channel, explaining why the M3 family members are restricted to unstructured peptide substrates. Subsequent modeling indicated that relatively few of the residue changes between TOP and neurolysin mapped to the walls and floor of the channel, allowing identification of a small number of positions that likely mediate differences in specificity (50Ray K. Hines C.S. Rodgers D.W. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here, we present a 2.0-Å crystal structure of human thimet oligopeptidase. This structure validates the specificity model and provides additional insights into the basis for differences between TOP and neurolysin. The structure also allows us to evaluate biochemical data concerning regulatory modification and subcellular localization of TOP, providing a framework for further study of this important enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Overexpression Constructs—The cDNA for human thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) was obtained from an expressed sequence tag clone (clone ID 2507774, Research Genetics) and subcloned into the pET32 (Novagen) expression vector. A construct for expressing TOP missing the first 15 residues, disordered in the related peptidase neurolysin, was produced by PCR amplification of the full-length clone using site-specific primers. The PCR product was subcloned into pET32a vector (TOP-N15). The construct was further modified (vector TOP-N15-C2S) by PCR-based mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) to produce a version of TOP with cysteines 246 and 253 replaced by serines to prevent covalent aggregation of the protein.Expression and Purification of Native Human Thimet Oligopeptidase Constructs—All TOP variants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)RP cells (Stratagene) to overcome poor protein production caused by differences in codon usage. Cells were grown in Terrific Broth media at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, and transcription was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture after lowering the growth temperature to 16 °C to maintain protein solubility. After 6 h, cells were centrifuged and lysed, and TOP was purified by metal affinity chromatography using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The protein was eluted from the beads by incubation with enterokinase (Invitrogen) to cleave it from the polyhistidine-containing N-terminal fusion sequence. Purified TOP constructs were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1% glycerol and then concentrated for crystallization trials. The activities of the purified constructs were determined by monitoring cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate with the sequence of the 13-residue peptide neurotensin.Crystallization of Thimet Oligopeptidase—Modified human thimet oligopeptidase was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion (51McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1999: 188-192Google Scholar) at 4 °C. The best crystals were grown in 13% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 25 mm magnesium acetate beginning with protein at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Crystals typically grew to 0.25 × 0.1 × 0.03 mm. They were prepared for data collection by transfer to a solution containing 25% glycerol, 20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 25 mm magnesium acetate for ∼10 s, mounting in a nylon loop, and plunging into liquid nitrogen (52Rodgers D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 183-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Data Collection and Structure Determination—X-ray data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 22-ID (Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team), Argonne National Laboratory. Data were reduced with HKL2000 (53Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The space group of the crystals is P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 77.17 Å, b = 99.1 Å, c = 105.5 Å. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement with the CNS software package (54Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.N.

Model building and analysis were done using the program O (55Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar), and structure refinements was carried out in CNS.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverview of the Structure and Comparison with Neurolysin—We have determined the crystal structure of recombinant human TOP at 2.0-Å resolution (Table I). To obtain crystals, we used a modified version of thimet oligopeptidase, which begins at residue 16 and has residues 246 and 253 mutated from cysteine to serine. The N terminus was removed because the corresponding residues of the closely related neurolysin were disordered in the crystal structure (49Brown C.K. Madauss K. Lian W. Beck M.R. Tolbert W.D. Rodgers D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the cysteines were mutated to prevent covalent oligomerization of the enzyme (35Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A.

Full-length native thimet oligopeptidase (both human and rat orthologs) did not crystallize despite extensive screening. As expected, the modified recombinant thimet oligopeptidase had activity similar to native full-length enzyme (data not shown).Table ISummary of crystallographic data and refinementCrystallographic dataWavelength (Å)0.949Resolution (Å)30.0-2.0Last shell (Å)2.07-2.0Average redundancy (last shell) (%)4.5 (4.5)Rsym (last shell) (%)0.073 (0.329)I/σI (last shell) (%)20.1 (4.6)Completeness (last shell) (%)99.6 (99.2)RefinementResolution (Å)30.0-2.0Number of reflections included in refinement55,080Rwork/Rfree0.20/0.23r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.005r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.1r.m.s.d. improper angles (°)0.73r.m.s.d. dihedral angles (°)17.5BaIsotropic thermal factor. r.m.s.d. bonded atoms (main/side)1.4/2.4Average B for all protein atoms (Å2)23.6Average B for ordered solvent (Å2)30.8Number of solvent molecules474Number of metal ions1a Isotropic thermal factor. Open table in a new tab TOP is composed of 24 α helices and 9 short β strands (Fig. 1A). A deep narrow channel, open at one end but closed off by helices 3-6 at the other, runs the length of the enzyme, dividing it into two distinct domains (I and II). The active site is located at the bottom of the channel about midway along its length, and the zinc ion cofactor is present at high occupancy (refined at full occupancy with a final thermal factor of 16.98 Å2) in the crystal structure. This overall fold was first seen in neurolysin (49Brown C.K. Madauss K. Lian W. Beck M.R. Tolbert W.D. Rodgers D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3127-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and is likely conserved within the entire M3 metallopeptidase family (2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which has a total of nine members including TOP and neurolysin. Surprisingly, however, this fold has also been found recently in angiotensin-converting enzyme (56Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 57Kim H.M. Shin D.R. Yoo O.J. Lee H. Lee J.O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase (58Arndt J.W. Hao B. Ramakrishnan V. Cheng T. Chan S.I. Chan M.K. Structure (Camb). 2002; 10: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), metallopeptidases that were not thought to be closely related to the M3 family based on sequence comparisons. Residues 16-24 of the TOP construct are disordered in the crystals, with no identifiable electron density, suggesting that even more of the N terminus than in neurolysin is disordered or that removing the first 16 residues caused adjacent residues to lose conformational stability.The active site of TOP contains an HEXXH sequence motif characteristic of a large class of zinc metallopeptidases (2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). As in other metallopeptidases of this type, the two histidines (residues 473 and 477) in the TOP sequence coordinate the zinc ion cofactor (Fig. 1B). The side chain of a downstream glutamate (Glu-502) from helix 16 serves as the third zinc ligand contributed by the protein, a characteristic of enzymes grouped into metallopeptidase clan MA (2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The glutamate residue of the HEXXH motif is believed to play an important role in the reaction mechanism, polarizing and orienting a zinc-coordinating water molecule that is the attacking nucleophile (59Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2506-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In TOP, the water molecule coordinating the zinc is well defined by the density, and the glutamate (Glu-474) makes the expected hydrogen bonds with this water (Fig. 1B). The active site is contained within a region of the enzyme that has strong structural similarity to the active site regions of other clan MA metallopeptidases (see Fig. 1A), including the prototypical group member thermolysin (60Matthews B.W. Weaver L.H. Kester W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 8030-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Neurolysin is the closest homolog of thimet oligopeptidase in the M3 metallopeptidase family (Fig. 2), and as noted, TOP and neurolysin (49Brown C.K.

Superposition of the two enzymes on Cα atoms (Fig. 3) yields an overall root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of only 1.19 Å, indicating a high degree of structural conservation. The backbones superimpose particularly well in the closed end and the floor of the channel. At the open end and near the top of the channel, however, the elements in TOP are displaced outward relative to the corresponding elements in neurolysin (Fig. 3), widening the channel. To some extent, this difference results from a hinge-like motion of the two domains about an axis located in the floor of the channel and running parallel to the long axis of the molecule. We have observed this hinge-like motion when comparing different crystal packings of neurolysin, 2K. Ray, C. S. Hines, J. Coll-Rodriguez, D. W. Rodgers, unpublished observations. and it is likely that here it also reflects the effect of packing environment on the relatively flexible channel walls in the two molecules. Elements near the open end of the channel (from the C terminus of α6 through β strands 1 and 2 to the N terminus of α8 in domain I and the extended loop between β10 and α15 in domain II), however, show differences beyond the hinge-like motion, and the outward movement of these elements in TOP reflects a true conformational difference from neurolysin. These changes would be unlikely to affect substrate specificity or catalytic activity given their location near the top of the channel.Fig. 2Sequence alignment of human TOP and neurolysin. Sequence differences are highlighted in green. Structural elements of TOP are shown schematically above the TOP sequence.

These data complete the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of α/β-hydrolase HNLs, in which the catalytic triad acts as a general base rather than as a nucleophile; proton abstraction from the substrate is performed by the serine, and reprotonation of the product cyanide is performed by the histidine residues.

(EC 4.1.2.39), catalyzes the cleavage of cyanohydrins to hydrocyanic acid plus the corresponding aldehyde or ketone (see Fig. 1A). The release of HCN serves as a defense against herbivores and microbial attack for a variety of plants (1Conn E.E. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise. 7.

In an aqueous solution, cyanohydrin cleavage occurs spontaneously above pH 5, whereas the enzyme reaction also occurs at lower pH values (down to pH ∼3, Ref. 2Hickel A. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 98: 891-898Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is technologically exploited for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyanohydrins (6Griengl H. Hickel A. Johnson D.V.

Moreover, this enzyme is an interesting target for the detoxification of cyanogenic food crops forming a potential health risk to its consumers mainly in the third world (11McMahon J.M. White W.L.B. Sayre R.T. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 731-741Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Biologically, HNLs constitute an interesting example of convergent evolution (3Wajant H. Effenberger F. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 611-617PubMed Google Scholar), as there are at least four completely unrelated classes of proteins with HNL activity belonging to such different fold families as α/β-hydrolases (12Wajant H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4770-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In line with the structural dissimilarity between different HNLs, the active-site architectures are also vastly different, despite similar or identical biological substrates. Moreover, structural similarities with the family of highest sequence homology (e.g. α/β-hydrolases, GMC-oxidoreductases, and carboxypeptidases) are not paralleled by similarities in the type and mechanism of the catalyzed reaction. The HNL from the tropical rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL) belongs to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily (12Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25830-25834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. J. Biol.

Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Its three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1B) is known (18Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), as well as the (very similar, Cα r.m.s. deviation = 0.42 Å) structure of the highly homologous (77% sequence identity) enzyme from Manihot esculenta (MeHNL, Protein Data Bank code 1dwp). From the three-dimensional structure and from mutagenesis data (20Hasslacher M. Kratky C. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kohlwein S.D. Proteins. 1997; 27: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) the active-site residues could be unequivocally identified. They include a catalytic triad consisting of Ser80, His235, and Asp207 (18Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 2Unless stated otherwise, the residue numbers will be given for the enzyme from H. brasiliensis. However, several aspects of the molecular mechanism of the HbHNL- or MeHNL-catalyzed cyanohydrin reaction remained controversial. Prior to the publication of the three-dimensional structure of HbHNL, sequence and mutational analysis led to the proposition of a catalytic mechanism for the M. esculenta enzyme involving general acid/base catalysis (12Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25830-25834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The close structural similarity to the α/β-hydrolases that emerged from the crystal structure of the H. brasiliensis enzyme suggested a mechanism accepted for hydrolases with a covalently bound reaction intermediate (18Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Structure. 1996; 4: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was subsequently dismissed on the basis of the structural data on HbHNL-inhibitor complexes (21Zuegg J. Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In a revised mechanistic proposition (see Fig. 2), residues of the catalytic triad act as a general acid/base, involving (for the cyanohydrin cleavage direction) deprotonation of the OH-Ser80 by His235 and concomitant abstraction of a proton from the substrate hydroxyl by Ser80. Following cyanohydrin cleavage, His235 reprotonates the cleaved cyanide. Modeling studies also suggested a role for the active-site residue Lys236 (22Gruber K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in which the positive charge was proposed to stabilize the complementary negative charge that is built up on the cyano group. The crystal structure of the Manihot enzyme was solved by molecular replacement, using the three-dimensional structure of the HbHNL enzyme as a search model. Structural studies were reported for the complex of acetone and trichloroacetone with the native enzyme (23Lauble H. Forster S. Miehlich B. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as well as for the (inactive) S80A mutant in complex with the substrate acetone cyanohydrin (24Lauble H. Miehlich B. Forster S. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). They have led to similar but not completely identical mechanistic proposals (see Fig. 3). Although the role of the residues of the catalytic triad is the same in the two mechanisms, there is disagreement with respect to the role of the active-site lysine residue (Lys236 in the Hevea enzyme or Lys237 in the Manihot enzyme). A catalytic function for this residue was ruled out for the Manihot enzyme on the basis of the three-dimensional data for the S80A mutant in complex with the substrate acetone cyanohydrin (24Lauble H. Miehlich B. Forster S. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both mechanistic proposals suffer from the shortcoming that the three-dimensional structure of the native enzyme with a substrate cyanohydrin has so far been unknown for both HNLs. In view of the rapid turnover, crystallographic observation of such complex structures was deemed a difficult challenge (24Lauble H. Miehlich B. Forster S. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The HNL mechanisms were therefore based on modeling studies (HbHNL) (22Gruber K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and on the crystallographic observation of complexes between both native enzymes and the biological reaction product acetone (21Zuegg J. Gruber K. Gugganig M. Wagner U.G. Kratky C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Lauble H. Forster S. Miehlich B. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as well as on the complex between acetone cyanohydrin and the inactive S80A mutant of MeHNL (24Lauble H. Miehlich B. Forster S. Wajant H. Effenberger F. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the interaction of the (mutated) Ser80 with the substrate is a central aspect of both mechanisms, conclusions derived from the binding of the substrate to the mutant enzyme have limited significance. The controversial and open points about the mechanism of HNLs with α/β-hydrolase structure form the subject of the present work. We have developed a method to prepare and freeze-quench complexes between native HbHNL crystals and cyanohydrin substrates and report the crystal structure of the complex with the biological substrate acetone cyanohydrin. Secondly, the mutant K236L was produced by site-directed mutagenesis. It shows no detectable catalytic activity. Its three-dimensional structure shows very little structural difference to the wild-type enzyme. Finally, the structure of the complex between the inactive K236L mutant and acetone cyanohydrin shows that Lys236 is also responsible for correctly positioning the substrate. Finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann calculations were carried out to rationalize the pivotal role of Lys236 for the HNL-catalyzed cyanohydrin reaction. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Host strain Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (recA endA gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′-proAB lacIqZDM15 Tn10(TetR)]) and cloning vector pBluescript® SK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for standard cloning procedures. Transformed E. coli strains were grown in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. For heterologous expression of HbHNL Pichia pastoris X33 and vector pGAPZB (Invitrogen) were used. P. pastoris strains were cultivated in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium, and for selection 100 mg/liter zeocin were added when needed. DNA Manipulations and Sequence Analysis—DNA manipulations, plasmid transformation into E. coli, and retrieval of DNA from E. coli were performed following standard procedures (25Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidmann J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1990Google Scholar). Transformation of P. pastoris was done by electroporation (26Invitrogen Corp.Instruction Manual: A Manual of Methods for Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Pichia pastoris. Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA2002Google Scholar). Sequencing of double-stranded DNA was carried out according to the dideoxy chain termination procedure using an ABI 373 DNA sequencer, the Dye Deoxy Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Faster, CA) and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of the K236L Mutant—Specific mutants were prepared using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the supplied instruction manual. The recombinant plasmid pHNL104 (13Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5884-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which contains the cDNA of the H. brasiliensis hnl wild-type gene, was used as the template for the mutagenesis reaction. The following oligonucleotides were used to introduce the desired mutations to generate K236L mutant protein: K236L forward, 5′-GGTCGAAGGTGGAGATCATCTCCTGCAGCTTACAAAGACTAAGG-3′ and K236L reverse, 5′-CCTTAGTCTTTGTAAGCTGCAGGAGATGATCTCCACCTTCGACC-3′. Apart from the amino acid exchange at position 236 of the Hnl protein, a cleavage site for the restriction enzyme PstI was additionally introduced by way of a silent mutation. The temperature profile for plasmid amplification was set as follows: a single denaturation step of 95 °C for 1 min followed by 16 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 68 °C for 8 min. After DpnI digestion, a 1-μl aliquot of the sample was transformed into E. coli. Plasmid DNA of transformants was checked by restriction analysis, and base replacement was confirmed by sequence analysis. The plasmid containing the mutant gene was named pHNL-K236L. Construction of P. pastoris HbHNL-K236L Expression Strain—The EcoRI fragment of pHNL-K236L containing the mutated hnl gene was subcloned into the unique EcoRI site of plasmid pGAPZB. Successful insertion was confirmed by restriction analysis and partial sequencing of the resulting expression plasmid pGAPZ-HNL-K236L. Isolated DNA of pGAPZ-HNL-K236L was then linearized with BglII and electroporated into P. pastoris X33. Transformants were selected for zeocin resistance and tested for their ability to express the Hnl protein, and a suitable expression strain was selected. The integration of the hnl cDNA into the P. pastoris genome and the presence of the specific mutation in the expression strain P. pastoris X33 pGAP-K236L were checked by sequencing a DNA fragment that was amplified by colony PCR using primers specific for the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the hnl gene. Production and Purification of Recombinant HbHNL-K236L Enzyme—50 ml of YPD in a 300-ml baffled shake flask were inoculated with an overnight culture of the strain P. pastoris X33 pGAP-K236L and incubated overnight at 30 °C with shaking. This preculture was then used to inoculate 300 ml of YPD medium in a 2-liter baffled flask to an A600 of 0.5. This culture was incubated at 30 °C with shaking until the A600 reached 40 (∼24 h). P. pastoris cells were harvested by centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), and after the addition of an equal amount of acid-washed glass beads cells were disrupted using a Merckenschlager homogenizer. The cytosolic protein fraction was prepared by ultracentrifugation (90,000 g), and HbHNL-K236L protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the isolated HNL protein was determined by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Protein from the selected fractions was concentrated to 15 mg/ml using Vivaspin filtration units (10-kDa size exclusion, Sartorius, Germany). This enzyme preparation was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and 50 mm phosphate-loading buffer. Protein was concentrated as described above and desalted by dialysis against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 595 nm by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit based on the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Preparation of Other Mutants K236R, T11A, and C81A—The preparation of the other mutants listed in Table II followed the same protocol described for the K236L mutant, i.e. the same Pichia system was used, the same mutagenesis kit, and the same purification protocol. The following oligonucleotides were used to introduce the desired mutations: K236R forward, 5′-CGAAGGTGGAGATCATAGGTTGCAGCTTACAAAGAC-3′; K236R reverse, 5′-GTCTTTGTAAGCTGCAACCTATGATCTCCACCTTCG-3′; T11A forward, 5′-GTTCTTATTCATGCAATATGCCATGGTGCATGGATTTGGC-3′; T11A reverse, 5′-GCCAAATCCATGCACCATGGCATATTGCATGAATAAGAAC-3′; C81A forward, 5′-GCGAGAGCGCTGGAGGACTCAATATAGCAATTGCTG-3′; C81A reverse, 5′-CAGCAATTGCTATATTGAGTCCTCCAGCGCTCTCGC-3′. The C81A mutant protein was only partially purified. The value obtained for the specific activity of this mutant enzyme (see Table II) is therefore only a lower limit.Table IISummary of mutagenesis data for the active-site region of the hydroxynitrile lyases from H. brasiliensis (HbHNL) and M. esculenta (MeHNL)HbHNLMeHNLResidue% Wild-type activityRef.ResidueActivityRef.C81S313C81A≈20aValue is a lower limit as a result of incomplete purification.This workC81A9024E79A120S80A020S80A012H235A020H235A012P207ANo expression20D208A2012T11A2This workT11A424K236L0This workK236R0.15This worka Value is a lower limit as a result of incomplete purification. Open table in a new tab Analysis of HNL Enzyme Activity—Hnl specific activity was determined by following the formation of benzaldehyde from 3.8 mm racemic mandelonitrile in 50 mm Na-citrate buffer, pH 5.0. The increase of absorbance at 280 nm was monitored over 5 min at 25 °C. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol/min benzaldehyde from mandelonitrile under test conditions (30Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Bona R. Rumbold K. Luckl J. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Purified racemic mandelonitrile was a gift from DSM Fine Chemicals and contained less than 0.5% benzaldehyde. Crystallization—Native HbHNL was purified and crystallized as described previously (30Hasslacher M. Schall M. Hayn M. Bona R. Rumbold K. Luckl J. Griengl H. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Wagner U.G. Schall M. Hasslacher M. Hayn M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Large diffraction quality crystals were obtained at room temperature using the vapor diffusion hanging drop method with 2% polyethylene glycol 400, 2.0 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m Na-Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, in the reservoir (700-1000 μl) and with 6-10-μl drops consisting of the reservoir solution and a 10 mg/ml solution of the HbHNL (in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) in a 1:1 mixture. Two different crystal forms (orthorhombic C2221 and tetragonal P41212) were observed, which occasionally occurred even within the same drop. Tetragonal crystals of HbHNL had a much higher solvent content (70 versus 56%) and produced inferior diffraction patterns. Therefore, all structures communicated in this paper were determined from orthorhombic crystals. The K236L mutant enzyme (15 mg/ml in 10 mm Na-Hepes buffer, pH 7.0) crystallized under the same conditions and yielded isomorphous orthorhombic crystals. (Tetragonal crystals were not observed for this protein.) However, crystallization events were less frequent, and the crystals took much longer to grow to usable sizes. Data Collection, Processing, Model Building, and Refinement—Diffraction data sets were all collected at cryogenic temperatures on synchrotron beamlines at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory/Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany and at Elettra in Trieste, Basovizza, Italy (see Table I). The only exception was the data set for the complex of the K236L mutant with acetone cyanohydrin, which was collected on a Schneider rotating anode generator in our laboratory. Data reduction involved DENZO and SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods Enzymol.276.

Open table in a new tab Before flash freezing, crystals were soaked for about 30 s in a cryoprotectant consisting of the reservoir solution with 30% glycerol and the substrate. Acetone and acetone cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-isobutyronitrile) in particular were found to rapidly damage HbHNL crystals leading to a severe loss in crystallographic resolution. The complexes of native and mutant enzyme with these compounds were thus prepared with a vapor diffusion technique. The crystal was first transferred to a drop of the regular cryoprotectant solution (mother liquor containing 30% glycerol), and this drop was then equilibrated (in a hanging drop fashion) with a reservoir solution containing the volatile substrate in concentrations of 5-10% v/v for about 1 min. This gas diffusion/freeze quenching was a delicate experiment; although a high substrate concentration had to be used to quickly saturate all of the active sites to surpass the ongoing chemical and enzyme-catalyzed cyanohydrin cleavage (the mother liquor of the crystals had pH 7.5), high concentrations of cyanohydrin were found to rapidly damage HNL crystals. Because the gas diffusion was not easily controlled, it necessitated a trial-and- error approach consuming a large number of crystal specimens. All crystal structures were found to be isomorphous to the published structures of HbHNL (18Wagner U.G. Hasslacher M. Griengl H. Schwab H. Kratky C.

https://openalex.org/W2074652755,"Rab7 is a key regulatory protein governing early to late endocytic membrane transport. In this study the proteasome α-subunit XAPC7 (also known as PSMA7, RC6-1, and HSPC in mammals) was identified to interact specifically with Rab7 and was recruited to multivesicular late endosomes through this interaction. The protein interaction domains were localized to the C terminus of XAPC7 and the N terminus of Rab7. XAPC7 was not found on early or recycling endosomes, but could be recruited to recycling endosomes by expression of a Rab7-(1-174)Rab11-(160-202) chimera, establishing a central role for Rab7 in the membrane recruitment of XAPC7. Although XAPC7 could be shown to associate with membranes bearing ubiquitinated cargo, overexpression had no impact on steady-state ubiquitinated protein levels. Most notably, overexpression of XAPC7 was found to impair late endocytic transport of two different membrane proteins, including EGFR known to be highly dependent on ubiquitination and proteasome activity for proper endocytic sorting and lysosomal transport. Decreased late endocytic transport caused by XAPC7 overexpression was partially rescued by coexpression of wild-type Rab7, suggesting a negative regulatory role for XAPC7. Nevertheless, Rab7 itself was not subject to XAPC7-dependent proteasomal degradation. Together the data establish the first direct molecular link between the endocytic trafficking and cytosolic degradative machineries.

Nevertheless, Rab7 itself was not subject to XAPC7-dependent proteasomal degradation. Together the data establish the first direct molecular link between the endocytic trafficking and cytosolic degradative machineries. Receptor-mediated endocytosis involves the sequential internalization and passage of internalized receptors through a series of endosomal compartments. Initially receptors pass through early endosomes from which plasma membrane recycling may take place or transfer to late endosomes can occur. Transfer to late endosomes, generally exhibiting a distinctive multivesicular morphology, often is accompanied by sorting from the limiting membrane of these structures to internal membrane vesicles. Sorting to the luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies is a process demonstrated to be important in the down-regulation of receptor signaling and membrane protein sorting (1Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Following sorting in late endosomes, membrane proteins may have at least two fates, including recycling to the trans-Golgi or transfer to lysosomes. The existence of a direct plasma membrane recycling route from late endosomes is suggested by the release of exosomes following the fusion of multivesicular bodies in antigen-presenting cells (2Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although receptor degradation may be initiated in late endosomes, complete degradation typically occurs only after lysosomal delivery. Thus the endocytic pathway, whose overall function is to correctly process and target incoming cargo to the appropriate destinations, is comprised of an intricate series of networked compartments, each specialized to execute specific activities. The proper transfer of internalized receptors from one endosomal compartment to the next is closely regulated and subject to control by recognition of sorting signals, inclusion within select membrane microdomains and specific targeting of endocytic carriers to their appropriate destination. Over the last decade a great deal of attention has focused on delineating the components of the endocytic transport and sorting machineries that ensure transport specificity. As a result the Rab GTPases have emerged as key regulators of endosomal transport, with 13 of over 60 identified family members having defined functions in endocytosis (3Stein M.P. Dong J. Wandinger-Ness A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2003; 55: 1421-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Among the endosomal Rab proteins, seven have been studied in detail, and results have provided insights into the control of individual endocytic transport steps. Rab5, Rab4, Rab11, and Rab15 are documented to control early endocytic and plasma membrane recycling, while Rab7, Rab9, and Rab34 control late endocytic events. The general consensus that has emerged from the study of these Rab GTPases and the identification of numerous interacting partners and effectors can be summarized as follows. The Rab GTPases serve as molecular switches that are activated on GTP binding and inactivated following nucleotide hydrolysis. In their active form, Rab proteins serve to provide temporal and spatial control over vesicle budding, cytoskeletal transport and membrane fusion (4Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab proteins accomplish this task by interacting with numerous partner proteins in a sequential and spatially defined manner. For example, Rab5 localized at the plasma membrane facilitates clathrin-coated vesicle budding and the subsequent interaction with the cytoskeleton mediates the transport of the small vesicles to early endosomes (5Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 6Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). On early endosomes, Rab5 recruits endosome tethering and fusion factors including the rabaptins and EEA1 to promote homotypic fusion. The latter processes are orchestrated by the formation of phosphorylated phosphoinositide lipid domains in response to the recruitment and activation of the PI 3′-kinase hVPS34/p150 complex by active early endosomal Rab5 (7Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar). Some Rab5 interacting proteins are shared in common between Rab4 and Rab7 that are operative on adjacent or overlapping branches of the endocytic pathway. However as increasing numbers of Rab-interacting proteins are identified, many are proving to be unique partners of individual Rab proteins. The importance and uniqueness of each of these processes is further underscored by the existence of distinct human diseases caused by mutations in different Rab proteins or associated transport machinery (3Stein M.P. Dong J. Wandinger-Ness A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2003; 55: 1421-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the endocytic Rab proteins collectively govern cargo selection, cytoskeletal transport and organization of specific membrane domains, but do so in a manner that appears uniquely tailored to each endocytic compartment and transport step. Our laboratory has focused on defining the function of the late endocytic Rab7 GTPase. Using both morphological and biochemical assays we have delineated a function for Rab7 in the transfer of both internalized cargo and newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from early to late endosomes (8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 9Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Lysosomal degradation has also been shown to depend on active Rab7, though it is unclear if Rab7 directly controls heterotypic fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes (11Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar).

Recently, two further Rab7 effectors have been identified, one a novel protein called Rabring7 (Rab7-interacting ring finger protein) and the second, an effector shared in common with Rab5, hVPS34/p150 (16Mizuno K. Kitamura A. Sasaki T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3741-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Stein M.P. Feng Y. Cooper K.L. Welford A.M. Wandinger-Ness A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 754-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Rabring7 contains a ring finger motif at its C terminus and interacts specifically with active Rab7 via its N-terminal sequences (16Mizuno K. Kitamura A. Sasaki T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3741-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rabring7 caused perinuclear clustering of endosomes and lysosomes much like RILP, but in contrast to RILP, also interfered with receptor degradation (12Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Mizuno K. Kitamura A. Sasaki T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3741-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The hVPS34-p150 complex was shown to colocalize preferentially to Rab7-positive late endosomes and hVPS34 phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity was dependent on nucleotide cycling of Rab7 (17Stein M.P. Feng Y. Cooper K.L. Welford A.M. Wandinger-Ness A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 754-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The cumulative data to date suggest Rab7 controls cargo transport to late endosomes and degradative compartments, in part through control of cytoskeletal associations and the generation of PI3P membrane domains. Furthermore, Rab7-interacting partners may have positive or negative regulatory properties on late endocytic transport. PI3P membrane domains provide an important platform for the recruitment and assembly of multiple protein complexes. In the case of late endosomes, emerging data suggest that PI3P membrane domains provide a critical link to late endosomal receptor sorting that is driven by a cycle of receptor ubiquitination and deubiquitination and depends in part on active proteasome (18Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Proteins containing FYVE domains are specifically recruited to membranes by virtue of PI3P recognition by the FYVE motif (19Stenmark H. Aasland R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4175-4183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the known FYVE-domain proteins, Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, also known as Vps27 in yeast) has been the focus of significant attention as a protein with dual binding specificities for PI3P and ubiquitin. Hrs also leads off the recruitment of the ESCRT protein complexes I-III that promote intraluminal vesicle formation and receptor sorting in an ubiquitin-dependent manner (20Katzmann D.J. Stefan C.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, Hrs serves as a key adaptor between PI3P domains and the recognition of ubiquitinated cargo via its ubiquitin-interacting motif. Because of the importance of Rab7 in regulating PI3P formation on late endosomes it was of significant interest to analyze whether or not Rab7 might also be linked to the machinery controlling receptor ubiquitination and late endosomal sorting. Here, we report the identification of an α-subunit of the 26 S proteasome as a new specific interacting partner of Rab7, demonstrating for the first time a direct molecular link between proteasomes and the endocytic sorting machinery. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—BHK21 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. BHK21 cells were grown in complete G-MEM (10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.6 mg/ml tryptose phosphate broth). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad, except acrylamide, which was obtained from Genomic Solutions (Ann Arbor, MI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL™) was from Pierce Biochemical Corp.

A rabbit polyclonal antiserum reactive against XAPC7, an α-type subunit of the 26 S canine proteasome, was raised using clone C7 (108 C-terminal amino acids of canine XAPC7) expressed in pGEX and purified from Escherichia coli on glutathioneagarose as the antigen. The polyclonal XAPC7 antibody specifically recognized the XAPC7 α-subunit (tested against hamster, canine, and human XAPC7), but not other α-subunits in immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays (data not shown). Monoclonal antibody FK2 demonstrated to recognize only mono- and multi-ubiquitinated proteins, but not free ubiquitin, as well as monoclonal antibodies reactive against proteasome subunits HC2 and XAPC7, and a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the 20 S core part of proteasome were all purchased from AFFINITI Research Products Ltd (Maunhead, UK).

Inserting an EcoR1 fragment containing the human transferrin receptor cDNA into pcDNA3 vector generated plasmid pcDNA3-hTfR. We replaced the 33 C-terminal residues of Rab7 with the 43 C-terminal residues of Rab11 to make the Rab7-(1-174)Rab11-(160-202) chimera. This cDNA fragment was obtained using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach (26Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), and inserted into the GFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The open reading frame of Rab7-(1-174)Rab11-(160-202) was completely confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Wild-type canine Rab2, Rab5, and Rab9 cDNAs (23Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) were cloned into pEG202 (2μ, HIS3+, Ampr) (27Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) such that the resulting bait proteins were fused to amino acids 1-202 of LexA and expressed under the control of the constitutive ADH1 promoter. To construct expression vectors encoding the full-length XAPC7 clone, we ordered human expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (IMAGE: 84457, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed that it encoded the full-length cDNA of proteasome α-subunit XAPC7 by nucleotide sequencing. We amplified the cDNA using PCR amplification and then subcloned it in pGEM3 by restriction digest with EcoRI and XhoI. The inserted fragment was released with EcoRI/HindIII digestion. An epitope-tagged variant of G-XAPC7 was generated in pCDNA3 by fusing the TDIEMNRLG sequence derived from VSVG protein in-frame onto the N terminus of XAPC7 using an appropriate primer and a PCR-based strategy. MDCK cDNA Library and Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—An MDCK cDNA library was constructed and screened as previously described (28Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, the library plasmids in pJG4-5 were prepared from a pool of unamplified 3.0 × 106 primary transformants. More than 95% of the library plasmids contained MDCK cDNA inserts with an average size of 1.3 kb. The yeast reporter strain EGY48 (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLexAop6-LEU2) was used as a host for all two-hybrid assays. The plasmid pLexA-Rab7Q67L (2μ, HIS3+, Ampr) with expression under the control of the constitutive ADH1 promoter was prepared and used as the two-hybrid bait (28Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D.

Transformants were plated on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, histidine, and uracil and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. The transformants were isolated, and Leu+ and LacZ+ yeast were selected (29Brent R. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 27Estojak J. Brent R.

Library plasmids from positive clones were rescued using E. coli XL1-Blue cells and subsequently analyzed by transformation tests and DNA sequencing. DNA databases were searched using GCG sequence analysis software package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). Four independent clones out of 123 positive clones encoded the C-terminal part of a proteasome α-subunit XAPC7. Clone C7 consisted of 600 bp and encoded the last 108 amino acids of canine XAPC7. C7 was used to test the interaction specificity with various wild-type Rab proteins or mutant Rab7 by growth and β-galactosidase assays (both liquid and agar plate assays). Accession Number and BLAST Analyses—The partial canine XAPC7 sequence was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AY526609). Over the length of the partial canine clone there is 98% amino acid sequence identity with the human XAPC7 protein. XAPC7 is also known as PSMA7 variant 1 and HSPC in humans; PSMA7, C6-I in mouse; PSMA7, RC6-1 in rat; DD5 in Dictyostelium discoideum; and α4 in fish and amphibians. Identity between mammalian forms of XAPC7 or PSMA7 is greater than 98%. Rat RC6-1, which contains a 6 amino acid insert, exhibits 95% identity. Goldfish and Xenopus laevis α4 exhibit 95% identity. Homologues with lower homologies exist in slime mold, insects, and plants. Transient Infection/Transfection—Transient overexpression studies were performed using the T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus expression system as described (30Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK21 grown to less than 70∼80% confluent were infected with T7 RNA polymerase-recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7.3). Cells were then transfected with plasmids containing cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all experiments, transfected cells were incubated for 5∼6 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator prior to analysis. Immunoprecipitations—As described above, BHK21 cells grown on 6-well plates were transiently infected/transfected with plasmids encoding XAPC7 or different forms of Rab7 or Rab5. Mock transfections were performed using vectors lacking an insert. Under the experimental conditions used, transfection efficiencies are very high (>90%). After 4.5 h, transfected BHK cells were incubated for 30 min in medium without methionine and cysteine and were metabolically labeled using 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS. For analysis, cells were lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) with PB/CLAP protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A) added freshly. RIPA lysates were clarified at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with Pansorbin for 1 h and subsequently clarified at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The primary antibodies and Pansorbin were added to the lysates with all incubations performed at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected and washed three times with RIPA buffer, and once more with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) by resuspension and centrifugation in a cold Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. The washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 7% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated to 95 °C for 10 min and resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. For IP/Westerns, unlabeled cell lysates were prepared as detailed above except 10-cm dishes of BHK cells were used for the initial transfection, lysates were prepared by addition of 300 μl of RIPA buffer, and immunoprecipitates were isolated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against Rab7 as the primary antibody. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For immunoelectron microscopy, cells in suspension were lightly fixed, pelleted, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 for 1 h. The pellets were washed and infiltrated in 25% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 1.86 m sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and sections were cut on a Leica EMFCS ultramicrotome. Cryosections were placed on formvar-coated grids and incubated for 1 h with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against Rab7 to detect overexpressed Rab7, or purified chicken IgY directed against Rab7 to detect the endogenous protein. Overexpressed G-XAPC7 was detected with a monoclonal antibody P5D4 against the G-epitope tag or a rabbit polyclonal directed against XAPC7. Appropriate gold-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Grids were washed, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min, counterstained with uranyl acetate for 40 min and embedded in polyvinyl alcohol. The grids were examined in a Hitachi H7500 electron microscope at 80 kV. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting—BHK-21 cells were transiently infected/transfected with a plasmid encoding XAPC7. Mock transfection was performed using vector lacking an insert. For each sample, two 100-mm dishes were washed twice and scraped in PBS using a wiper blade. From this point on, all buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture (PB/CLAP) consisting of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm in a rotor (model SA600; Sorvall) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (HB; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 2 mm CaCl2). The cells were again collected by centrifugation and resuspended in three-pellet volumes of HB. The suspension was passed through a 27-gauge needle 12 times. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by two successive centrifugation steps at 1,000 rpm for 5 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 1,950 × g for 20 min, and a crude membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min. About 300 μl of the total supernatant was collected as the cytosol fraction and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of RIPA buffer. Equal volumes of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Endogenous actin was used as control for protein loading and as a cytosolic marker. For IP/Westerns, immunoblot analysis of unlabeled immunoprecipitates was performed by resolving the immunoprecipitates and total lysate samples on 12% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a plate electrode blotter at 500 mA for 30 min. The membranes were probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against to XAPC7. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown and processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pre-permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v) saponin in Pipes buffer (80 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for 2-3 min and fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. All incubations with primary and detecting antibodies were conducted at room temperature for 30 min with antibodies diluted in PBS/0.05% saponin. The coverslips were washed four times with PBS/saponin and mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 oil immersion lens. Images were transferred as JPEG files to Adobe Photoshop for compilation. Morphological Assay of VSVG Protein Transport—The assay was performed as described previously (8Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 17Stein M.P. Feng Y. Cooper K.L. Welford A.M. Wandinger-Ness A.

https://openalex.org/W2135452372,"Quorum-sensing pheromones are signal molecules that are secreted from Gram-positive bacteria and utilized by these bacteria to communicate among individual cells to regulate their activities as a group through a cell density-sensing mechanism. Typically, these pheromones are processed from precursor polypeptides. The mechanisms of trafficking, processing, and modification of the precursor to generate a mature pheromone are unclear. In Staphylococcus aureus, AgrD is the propeptide for an autoinducing peptide (AIP) pheromone that triggers the Agr cell density-sensing system upon reaching a threshold and subsequently regulates expression of virulence factor genes. The transmembrane protein AgrB, encoded in the agr locus, is necessary for the processing of AgrD to produce mature AIP; however, it is not clear how AgrD interacts with AgrB and how this interaction results in the generation of mature AIP. In this study, we found that the AgrD propeptide was integrated into the cytoplasmic membrane by a conserved α-helical amphipathic motif in its N-terminal region. We demonstrated that membrane targeting of AgrD by this motif was required for the stabilization of AgrD and the production of mature AIP, although this region was not specifically involved in the interaction with AgrB. An artificial amphipathic peptide replacing the N-terminal amphipathic motif of AgrD directed the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane and enabled the production of AIP. Analysis of Bacillus ComX precursor protein sequences suggested that the amphipathic membrane-targeting motif might also exist in pheromone precursors of other Gram-positive bacteria.

Analysis of Bacillus ComX precursor protein sequences suggested that the amphipathic membrane-targeting motif might also exist in pheromone precursors of other Gram-positive bacteria. Quorum sensing is a way that bacteria communicate with each other (1Bassler B.L. Cell. 2002; 109: 421-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Bacteria produce autoinducing molecules at basal levels. When bacterial population density increases, the autoinducing molecule concentration reaches a threshold that results in the activation of the quorum-sensing system and subsequently alters the cell activity that enables bacteria to change their behavior as a group like multicellular organism. Quorum sensing is involved in the regulation of sporulation, mating, bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, and biofilm formation. Although acylated homoserine lactones with different acyl side chains are common autoinducers for Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria use small peptides as pheromones (2Dunny G.M. Winans S.C. Dunny G.M. Winans S.C. Cell-Cell Signaling in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 1-5Google Scholar). Well studied examples of peptide pheromones include the competence-stimulating peptide from Streptococcus pneumoniae (3Havarstein L.S. Coomaraswamy G. Morrison D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell-Cell Signaling in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Cell. 1997; 89: 917-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), sex pheromones of Enterococcus faecalis, and the autoinducing peptide (AIP) 1The abbreviations used are: AIP, autoinducing peptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: AIP, autoinducing peptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine. in staphylococci (7Novick R.P. Dunny G.M. Winans S.C. Cell-Cell Signaling in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 129-145Google Scholar). These pheromones are typically processed from precursor polypeptides with modifications in some cases. A leader peptide with a conserved double glycine sequence found in the lactobacterial lantibiotics and bacteriocin-inducing peptides (5Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Dunny G.M. Winans S.C. Cell-Cell Signaling in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 175-192Google Scholar) is considered important for propeptide trafficking. ATP-binding cassette transporters with proteolytic activity are postulated to be responsible for both processing of the propeptides and secretion of the mature pheromones. It is interesting to note that the precursor of the E. faecalis sex pheromone is first generated from a lipoprotein precursor by a signal peptidase. This precursor molecule, located in the membrane, is then processed through intramembranous proteolysis by a zinc metalloprotease (Eep) (8An F.Y. Sulavik M.C. Clewell D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5915-5921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9An F.Y. Clewell D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although the catalytic mechanism has yet to be determined. The leader peptide is also predicted in the competence and sporulation factor precursor, but the trafficking and processing of this precursor are not clearly defined. In Staphylococcus aureus, expression of the virulence factors is coordinately regulated by a quorum-sensing system encoded by the agr (accessory gene regulator) locus (7Novick R.P. Dunny G.M. Winans S.C. Cell-Cell Signaling in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 129-145Google Scholar). The agr locus encodes four proteins: AgrA, AgrB, AgrC, and AgrD. AgrC and AgrA compose a two-component signal transduction pathway, in which AgrC is the sensor kinase, and AgrA resembles a response regulator (10Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 11Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). AgrD is the precursor of AIP, a peptide pheromone that is secreted from the bacteria into the culture medium (12Ji G. Beavis R.C. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 13Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and that is the ligand of AgrC, a membrane protein with its N-terminal half, which has been proposed to contain the AIP-binding site, anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane via five transmembrane helices (14Lina G. Jarraud S. Ji G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15Lyon G.J. Wright J.S. Christopoulos A. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6247-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and with its C-terminal half, which composes a histidine kinase domain, located in the cytoplasm (11Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). AgrB is required for the production of AIP (13Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and functions as a protease that is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of AgrD (16Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that AgrB functions as an oligopeptide transporter that facilitates the secretion of mature AIP (10Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 16Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between AgrD and AgrB and the mechanisms of the processing of AgrD and the secretion of mature AIP by AgrB remain unclear. Based on the DNA sequences of agr loci and the specific interactions between AIP and AgrC and between AgrD and AgrB, four S. aureus groups have been defined (13Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 17Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). AIP from an S. aureus strain activates the Agr response in itself and in the same group members, but inhibits the Agr response in heterologous group members. The four S. aureus AgrD groups have 46 or 47 residues, and the AIPs have different amino acid sequences and lengths. An alignment of these AgrD groups (group I AgrD, NCBI accession number CAA36782; group II AgrD, accession number AAB63265; group III AgrD, accession number AAB63268; and group IV AgrD, accession number AAG03056) is shown, with the AIP sequences in boldface. The specific interaction between AgrB and AgrD is not so strict. AgrD of S. aureus group II is processed only in the presence of group II AgrB, whereas group I AgrD and group III AgrD are processed by group I AgrB and vice versa (7Novick R.P. Dunny G.M. Winans S.C. Cell-Cell Signaling in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 129-145Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the AgrD propeptide was anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by an N-terminal amphipathic region. We also demonstrate that the membrane targeting of AgrD by the amphipathic region was required for its normal processing to produce mature AIP, but was not involved in the specific interaction with AgrB. This amphipathic region is present in all staphylococcal AgrD sequences available in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank as revealed by sequence analysis. Furthermore, analysis of B. subtilis ComX sequences revealed the existence of similar amphipathic regions in their N-terminal parts, suggesting that the membrane targeting sequence might play an important role in the processing of the propeptides to generate active mature pheromones in other Gram-positive bacteria. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—The S. aureus plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Table I. S. aureus cells were grown in CY-GP broth (18Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), supplemented with antibiotics (5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 5 μg/ml erythromycin) when necessary. Bacteria grown overnight at 37 °C on GL plates (18Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) were routinely used to inoculate liquid cultures. Cell growth was monitored with either a Klett-Summerson colorimeter with a green (540 nm) filter (Klett, Long Island City, NY) or a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at A650 nm. Escherichia coli strain MC1061-5 (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed.

The PCR product was then digested with XbaI and cloned into the pRN5548 XbaI and EcoRI (blunted with Klenow fragment) sites. The group II AgrD-His6 expression plasmid pLZ4010 was made by PCR amplification of the SA502A agrD gene from pRN6958 (13Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) with primers GJ44 (5′-CTATTATTCCATGGACTTCATTTAC-3′, sequence around the NcoI site of the pRN5548 plasmid, with the NcoI site underlined) and LZ31 (5′-ATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTGTCGTATAAATTCGTTAATT-3′, with six histidine codons and one stop codon underlined and 3′ of group II agrD italicized). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and ligated to a SmaI- and NcoI-digested 2.2-kb fragment of pRN5548. Plasmids carrying genes encoding various epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant RN6390B (group I) AgrD proteins used in this study were created by PCR-based cloning. Plasmid pLZ4005 contains an NdeI-EcoRI DNA fragment (encoding the His6-T7 tag-Xpress™ epitope and multiple cloning sites sequence) of pRSET-A (Invitrogen) ligated to the 5′-end of agrD (16Zhang L.

A PCR product amplified from pLZ4005 with primer GJ45 (5′-GTAAATGAAGTCCATGGAATAATAG-3′, sequence around the NcoI site of pRN5548, with the NcoI site underlined) and 5′-phosphorylated (T4 polynucleotide kinase, MBI Fermentas) primer LZ8 (5′-ATGGCTAGCATGACT-3′, T7 tag coding sequence) was digested with BspHI and ligated to another BspHI-digested PCR product amplified from pLZ4005 with primer LZ8 and 5′-phosphorylated primer LZ9 (5′-ATGAGAACCCCGCAT-3′, sequence before the His6 coding region in pRSET-A). Plasmid pLZ4012 was made by ligating an NcoI-digested PCR product amplified from pLZ4011 with primers LZ32 (5′-CATGCCATGGTCGTCGTACAGATCCCGAC-3′, sequence in the Xpress™ epitope coding region, with the NcoI site underlined) and GJ44 to the 2.4-kb fragment of NcoI-digested pLZ4011. Plasmids pLIND5, pLIND10, and pLIND18 were constructed as follows. PCR products were amplified from pLZ4012 with primers GJ111 (5′-CATTGAATTCTGAACTTATTTTTTGATTTTATTAC-3′, agrD sequence plus an EcoRI site, with the EcoRI site underlined) and LIN25 (5′-AAAATCATGAAAATTTTAATTTGC-3′, sequence around the BspHI site of pRN5548, with the BspHI site underlined) for pLIND5, with primers GJ112 (5′-CATTGAATTCTGTTTATTACTGGGATTTTAAAAAAC-3′, agrD sequence plus an EcoRI site, with the EcoRI site underlined) and LIN25 for pLIND10, and with primers GJ113 (5′-CATTGAATTCTGATTGGTAACATCGCAGCTTATAGTACTTGTG-3′, agrD sequence plus an EcoRI site, with the EcoRI site underlined) and LIN25 for pLIND18. The PCR products were then digested with EcoRI and BspHI and ligated to an EcoRI- and BspHI-digested 3.1-kb fragment of pLZ4012. Plasmids pLIND12 and pLIND14 were constructed as follows. PCR products were amplified from plasmid pLIND10 using primers GJ56 and GJ120 (5′-AATCCCAGTAATTCCATGGTACCAGCTGC-3′, within agrD, fragment A), primers GJ56 and GJ122 (5′-TTTTAAAATAATTCCATGGTACCAGCTGC-3′, within agrD, fragment B), primers LIN25 and GJ119 (5′-CATGGAATTACTGGGATTTTAAAAAACATTGG-3′, within agrD, fragment C), or primers LIN25 and GJ121 (5′-CATGGAATTATTTTAAAAAACATTGGTAAC-3′, within agrD, fragment D). The PCR products were then prepared using GJ56 and LIN25 as primers and a mixture of fragments A and C or fragments B and D as the template, digested with XbaI and BspHI, and ligated to the XbaI and BspHI sites of pRN5548, generating plasmids pLIND12 and pLIND14, respectively. Plasmid pLZ4013 containing a coding sequence for an artificial amphipathic 11-amino acid peptide followed by the RN6390B AgrD C-terminal region coding sequence (amphiNDH) was constructed by ligating two T4 polynucleotide kinase-phosphorylated and NcoI-digested PCR products amplified from pRN6913: one with primers GJ44 and LZ17 (5′-CATTTTAAGTCCTCCTTA-3′, from the starting codon of agrD) and another with primers GJ45 and LZ49 (5′-ATTACCACTATCATCACTATCATCACTACTATTTTAAAAAACATTGGTAACATC-3′, with the artificial amphipathic 11-amino acid peptide coding sequence underlined and the RN6390B AgrD coding sequence italicized). Plasmid pLZ4014 was made by ligating two HpaII-digested and T4 polynucleotide kinase-phosphorylated PCR products amplified from pLZ4009 using primers LZ42 (5′-ACTGCTGACTTCATAATGGATG-3′, group I agrD sequence) and LZ43 (5′-ACCAATGTTTTTTAAAATCCCAG-3′, group I agrD sequence) and amplified from pLZ4010 using primers LZ44 (5′-ATTGTCGGTGGCGTAAAC-3′, group II agrD sequence) and GJ45. Similarly, plasmid pLZ4015 was constructed by ligating two HpaII-digested and T4 polynucleotide kinase-phosphorylated PCR products amplified from pRN6958 using primers LZ46 (5′-TCCAGCAGTTTATTTGATGAAC-3′, group II agrD sequence) and LZ47 (5′-TCCGATTGCTTTAGCTAAT-3′, group II agrD sequence) and amplified from pLZ4009 using primers LZ48 (5′-AACATCGCAGCTTATAGT-3′, group I agrD sequence) and GJ45. Plasmid pLZ4017 was constructed as follows. A PCR product was amplified from pLZ4011 with primers LZ48 (5′-AACATCGCAGCTTATAGT-3′, group I agrD sequence) and tmR (5′-CAGTGTGGCAATCACCAGAATCAGGGCAAACATATTCGCAATTCCATGGTACCAGC-3′, with the E. coli leader peptidase I gene sequence underlined and the pRSET-A multicloning site sequence italicized), digested with BspHI, and dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (MBI Fermentas). This fragment was ligated to a BspHI-digested and 5′-phosphorylated PCR fragment amplified from pLZ4011 with primers GJ45 and tmF (5′-GTGACGGGCATTTTATGGTGCGTGCGGCGGATTTTAAAAAACATTGGTAACATCGCAG-3′, with the E. coli leader peptidase I gene and two arginine codons underlined and the agrD sequence italicized). The resulting plasmid contained the coding sequence of the N-terminal transmembrane region of E. coli leader peptidase I (21 amino acids) followed by two arginine codons and the agrD sequence encoded the C-terminal 32 amino acids. This plasmid was used as a template to produce PCR products with primer pairs GJ44/LZ17 and GJ45/lepF (5′-GCGAATATGTTTGCCCTG-3′, the E. coli leader peptidase I coding sequence starting from the second codon). The PCR products were then digested with NcoI, 5′-phosphorylated, and ligated to produce pLZ4017. All PCR products used for plasmid construction were amplified with Pfu Turbo® high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The correct sequence of every newly constructed plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. AIP Activity Assays—AIP activities were measured using S. aureus cells containing an agr P3-blaZ fusion on plasmid pRN6683 (20Novick R.P. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Ross H.F. Ji G. Kreiswirth B.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). PhoA Fusion Plasmid Construction and Expression in E. coli Strains—The AgrD-PhoA fusion protein expression plasmid pLZ5001 was constructed as follows. A PCR product amplified from pGJ4002 (16Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with primers GJ93 (5′-GAAGATCTTCGTGTAATTGTGTTAATTC-3′, with the BglII site underlined) and GJ94 (5′-CGGGATCCATGAATACATTATTTAACTTATTTTTTG-3′, with the BamHI site underlined) was digested with BglII and BamHI. This product was then inserted into the BglII site of pAWLP-2 (16Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLZ5002, encoding a protein with only the N-terminal region of AgrD fused to PhoA (AgrDN-PhoA), was constructed by deleting the coding sequence for the C-terminal region of AgrD in pLZ5001. A PCR product amplified from pLZ5001 with primers LZ10 (5′-GAAGATCTTTTTTGCAGCTCAG-3′, with the BglII site underlined) and LZ15 (5′-GAAGATCTCTGCGATGTTACCAATGT-3′, with the BglII site underlined) was digested with BglII and DpnI and then self-ligated. E. coli strain MC1061-5 transformed with pLZ5001 or pLZ5002 was cultured overnight for PhoA activity assay or cell fractionation and Western blot hybridization. Alkaline Phosphatase (PhoA) Activity Assays—PhoA activity was measured as described (21Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) with modifications. E. coli MC1061-5 cells expressing AgrD-PhoA fusion proteins were grown in LB broth (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) at 37 °C overnight. Cells were collected, washed once with 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and suspended in the same buffer containing 1% SDS and 10% chloroform, followed by vortexing for 15 min to extract proteins. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104 solution) was then added to the mixtures. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, K2HPO4 solution (13%) was added to stop the reactions. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and the clear supernatant was measured at both 420 and 550 nm. Alkaline phosphatase activity units were calculated by a formula described previously (21Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—Harvested S. aureus cells were suspended in 1× sucrose/sodium maleate/MgCl2 solution containing 10 μg/ml lysostaphin and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The protoplasts were then lysed by addition of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or as otherwise indicated and supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was briefly sonicated, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein levels of the lysates were measured with Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent at A595 nm. Cell membrane fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. E. coli MC1061-5 cells containing pLZ5001 or pLZ5002 suspended in PBS with 1 mg/ml lysozyme were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and then lysed by brief sonication after addition of 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Membrane fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation. The pellets were dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) or as otherwise indicated. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Protein samples dissolved in SDS sample buffer were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before being separated by either Tris/glycine/SDS-PAGE (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) or Tris/Tricine/SDS-PAGE (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine albumin (Sigma), the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated in blocking buffer with a primary antibody (1:2000 dilution of mouse anti-tetrahistidine monoclonal antibody (QIAGEN Inc.) or 1:5000 dilution of anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen)) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblots were detected with an ECL Plus Western blot detection system followed by exposure to Hyper-film™ ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences). AgrD Is an Integral Membrane Protein—To determine the subcellular location of AgrD, we made two plasmids in which six histidine codons were added to the 3′-end of either the group I or II agrD gene and inserted downstream of the bla promoter of the pRN5548 expression vector (23Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Plasmids pLZ4009 and pLZ4010 were transformed into agr-null S. aureus strain GJ2035, creating strains LZ4009 and LZ4010, respectively. Western blot hybridization analysis with the anti-tetrahistidine monoclonal antibody used as a probe revealed a band with an estimated size of ∼6 kDa from whole cell lysate of LZ4009 or LZ4010 expressing His6-tagged AgrD (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 7). No band was observed from cell lysate of LZ0001 carrying pRN5548 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The sizes of the proteins detected were consistent with that of the predicted molecular mass of AgrD-His6. These ∼6-kDa bands were detected only in the membrane fractions prepared from LZ4009 and LZ4010 (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 9), but not in the cytoplasmic fractions (lanes 5 and 8), indicating that AgrD is a membrane-associated protein. To determine whether AgrD is an integral or peripheral membrane protein, we prepared protoplasts from S. aureus LZ4009 cells and lysed the protoplasts in PBS containing 1 m sodium chloride, in 0.2 m sodium carbonate, or in PBS containing 1% sarcosyl. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the whole cell lysates were fractionated by ultracentrifugation. Fig. 1B showed the results of Western blot hybridization with the anti-tetrahistidine monoclonal antibody as a probe. AgrD-His6 was not extracted from the membrane fraction by 1 m sodium chloride (Fig. 1B, lane 3) and was only partially extracted from the membrane fraction by 0.2 m sodium c"
https://openalex.org/W2115895007,"We studied the effect of intravascular activation of human neutrophils on the synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLT) and the formation of cerebral edema in guinea-pig brains. Challenge with the chemotactic formylated tripeptide fMLP (0.1 microM) of neutrophil-perfused brain in vitro resulted in blood-brain barrier disruption associated with a significant increase of cysLT. Both events were completely prevented by neutrophil pretreatment with a specific 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor. Perfusion with the 5-LO metabolite leukotriene B4 (10 nM), together with neutrophils treated with the 5-LO inhibitor, did not restore the alteration in permeability observed upon perfusion with untreated and activated neutrophils. The dual cysLT1-cysLT2 receptor antagonist BAYu9773 was more potent and more effective than a selective cysLT1 antagonist in preventing the brain permeability alteration induced by neutrophil activation. RT-PCR showed significant expression of cysLT2 receptor mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Intravital microscopy in mice showed that inhibition of leukotriene synthesis significantly reduced firm adhesion of neutrophils to cerebral vessels without affecting rolling. These data support the hypothesis that neutrophil and endothelial cells cooperate toward the local synthesis of cysLT within the brain vasculature and, acting via the cysLT2 receptor on endothelial cells, may represent a contributing pathogenic mechanism in the development of cerebral inflammation and edema."
https://openalex.org/W2041361794,"To understand the factors controlling expression of the cGMP phosphodiesterase type 6 (PDE6) genes, we have characterized the promoter of the human PDE6A gene that encodes the catalytic α-subunit. In vivo DNase I hypersensitivity assays revealed two sites immediately upstream of the PDE6A core promoter region. Transient transfection assay in Y79 cells of constructs containing varying lengths of the promoter region showed a decrease in promoter activity with increasing length. The most active segment contained a 177-bp upstream sequence including apparent Crx and Nrl transcription factor binding sites. Both Crx and Nrl transactivated the PDE6A promoter in HEK293 cells and showed a >100-fold increase when coexpressed. Coexpression of a dominant negative inhibitor of Nrl abolished Nrl transactivation but had no effect on Crx. DNase I footprinting assays identified three potential Crx binding sites within a 55-bp segment beginning 29 bp upstream of the transcription start point. Mutation of two of these sites reduced reporter gene activity by as much as 69%. Gel shifts showed that all three Crx sites required a TAAT sequence for efficient binding. Consistent with a requirement for Crx and Nrl in Pde6a promoter activity, Pde6a mRNA is reduced by 87% in the retina of Crx–/– mice and is undetectable in Nrl–/– mice at postnatal day 10.

The α- and β-subunits comprise the catalytic core of the enzyme, and the γ-subunit partially inhibits activity to maintain basal levels in the dark. We have focused our studies on the PDE6A gene, which encodes the α-subunit of PDE6. Defects in the coding region of this gene account for a subset of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (4Huang S.H. Pittler S.J. Huang X. Oliveira L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat.

Dissection of promoter architecture may also be important to develop safe gene therapy vectors with controlled targeted expression in specific cell types. Our initial characterization of the PDE6 α-subunit gene promoter indicated that it shows very weak activity compared with other photoreceptor gene promoters including the PDE6B gene promoter (7Piri N.

We suggest that the relatively weak expression of this promoter could be useful where overexpression with the well-characterized, most commonly used rhodopsin promoter could induce, rather than reverse, retinal degeneration (8Olsson J.E.

Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone. HEK293 and Y79 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin or in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.DNase I Hypersensitivity Assay—Y79 or HEK293 cell nuclei were isolated at 4 °C using a nuclei isolation kit (Sigma) following the manufacturers' protocol. The nuclei were pelleted at 2000 rpm in an IEC clinical centrifuge and resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Approximately 5 × 106 nuclei were digested with DNase I at varying concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μg/ml. The reaction was incubated for 10 min on ice, and reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). For Southern blot analysis, ∼15 μg of DNA was co-digested with AflII and XhoI at 37 °C for 4 h, with one addition of each enzyme after 2 h, and the digestion products were electrophoresed in a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 3′-end probe. The results were visualized by autoradiography after a 5-day exposure.Generation of Promoter Constructs—The following reporter constructs were used: (a) pGL3-Control encoding the firefly luciferase gene under control of the SV40 strong promoter and SV40 enhancer; and (b) pGL3-Basic containing no promoter and no enhancer.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was amplified with primers U-Sal (5′-TTTGTCGACGCTCTGTGCAGACATCTCTTCT-3′) and U-Xba (5′-AAATCTAGAACCTCCTCTGCTGTCACCT-3′), generating a 322-bp segment upstream of the ATG initiation codon. This fragment was cloned into the pBS II KS SmaI site (pBS-322). Eight promoter constructs were made driving luciferase reporter gene expression in the pGL3-Basic plasmid vector. These constructs were called pGL3-260, pGL3-260r (reverse orientation of pGL3-260), pGL3-300, pGL3-592, pGL3-1060, pGL3-1542, pGL3-3800, and pGL3-PL (promoterless). These eight constructs are representative of different lengths of the upstream region of the PDE6A gene. The pGL3-260 and pGL3-260r constructs were prepared by amplification with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using U-Sal and U-Xba primers with the pBS-322 vector as template. The PCR product was then cut with StuI, and the 260-bp fragment obtained was cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. Forward and reverse orientation was obtained and verified by PCR and restriction digests. The pGL3-300 construct was generated by restriction digest of the pBS-322 plasmid with SalI and NcoI and inserted into the XhoI/NcoI site of pGL3-Basic vector. The pGL3-1060 construct was generated by amplifying a ∼1279-bp fragment from pBS-4.1 using primers designed to amplify that portion of the upstream region (HAU6-R, 5′-GTGCTGGGATTACAGGCGTGAG-3′; HARE-3, 5′-CTGTAAATTCTCCTGAAAGTCCCGCAGGAG-3′). The product was partially digested with NcoI to obtain a 1060-bp fragment, which was cloned into the SmaI and NcoI sites of pGL3-Basic. The pGL3-3800 was prepared by digesting pBS-4.1 with XbaI and NcoI and cloning the ∼3.3-kb fragment into the NheI and NcoI sites of pGL3-Basic vector. A ∼500-bp NcoI to NcoI fragment was then cloned into this intermediate construct to generate the pGL3-3800 construct. The pGL3-593 construct was made by digesting pGL3-3800 with SacI and ApaI and purifying the vector with the insert using a Qiagen gel extraction kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The ends of the vector were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase and blunt-end-ligated together. The pGL3-1542 plasmid was generated by digesting the pGL3-3800 construct with NheI and MluI, followed by purifying the vector with insert using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. The ends of the vector were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase and blunt-end-ligated together. Plasmid preparations were performed using Qiafilter Endofree Maxi or Mega kits (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. All plasmids were sequenced to verify integrity.Plasmids containing mutated potential Crx binding sites (TAA to CCG) were generated using mutagenic primers with mutA1-R primer (5′-AGAGGGAGCAAGCTTGGGAGACCGAGTCATTAA-3′) or mutB-1-R primer (5′-AGAGGGAGCAAGCTTGGGAGATTAAGTCACCGATATTCTCA-3′) using pBS-322 as template and a reverse primer, GL2 (5′-ACCTTCTGCGGTTTTTGTATTTC-3′). Underlined sequences in the primers indicate mutated sites. Promoter constructs were created from the mutated PCR product from the pBS-322 vector by restriction digests with SalI and NcoI and inserted into the XhoI/NcoI site of pGL3-Basic vector. These promoter constructs are designated pGL3-M13 (m13) and pGL3-M16 (m16), respectively. The plasmids were sequenced to verify mutations. Crx, Nrl, and DD10 expression constructs have been described previously (14Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J.

Taylor R.E. Pittler S.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 106: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after infection and lysed in 100 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and light emission was measured immediately in a Turner Designs 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Values were normalized to viral β-galactosidase expression. All experiments were performed in triplicate a minimum of three times (n ≥ 9).Transfection of HEK293 Cells with Calcium Phosphate—HEK293 cells were transfected with calcium phosphate using a standard protocol. Briefly, ∼6 × 105 HEK293 cells were plated in a 60-mm Petri dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and grown for 24–36 h at 37 °C to achieve 50–75% confluence. The medium was changed once, 3 h before transfection. Up to 16 μg of DNA in 300 μl of 250 μm CaCl2 was combined dropwise with 300 μl of 2× Hank's balanced salt buffer and incubated for 30 min. The DNA consisted of 1 μg of β-galactosidase internal control, 4–5 μg of test plasmid, and 2–5 μg of Crx or Nrl expression construct. The DNA mixture was then added dropwise to the cells and incubated for 48 h, with one media change after 12 h of incubation.Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were harvested and lysed in 350 μl of Galacto-Star reporter lysis buffer (Tropix, Inc.), and cell debris was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. For luciferase assays, 20 μl of cytosolic extract was diluted to 300 μl, and light emission was measured immediately in the luminometer using a luciferase activity kit (Promega) following the suggested protocol. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed with the Galacto-Star activity kit (Applied Biosystems) using 20 μl of the same cytosolic extract diluted to 300 μl. The luminometer was set to 30% (for HEK293 cells) or 40% sensitivity (for Y79 cells), with a delay time of 2 s and an integration time of 10 s. All transfections were done in triplicate a minimum of three times.DNase I Footprinting of Crx—The plasmid pGL3-300 was used as a template for PCR separately with either sense or antisense radiolabeled primers to generate DNase I footprinting probes. The reaction was performed in binding buffer containing 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm ZnSO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, and 10% glycerol. Binding reactions were performed on ice for 20 min in a total volume of 50 μl including labeled probe and 1× binding buffer with or without 100 ng of purified bovine CrxHD-GST fusion protein (14Chen S.

For DNase I digestion, MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to final concentrations of 5 and 2.5 mm, respectively, followed by 0.005, 0.01, or 0.02 unit of DNase I for 1 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated with 90 μl of 1× stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.2 m NaCl, and 250 μg/ml glycogen). Ten μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min followed by phenol chloroform extraction, precipitation, and resuspension in 1× DNA sequencing gel loading buffer. DNA sequencing reactions were run alongside in a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (10Mohamed M.K. Taylor R.E. Feinstein D.S. Huang X. Pittler S.J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), with minor modification. KCl optimum was determined to be 75 mm, and 5% glycerol was included in the reactions. Incubations with and without label were done for 15 min. The binding reaction was run on a nondenaturing 6% acrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE for 2 h at 380 V. CrxHD-GST protein was purified on a glutathione affinity column as previously described (14Chen S.

The Crx–/– mouse was outcrossed to a congenic C57Bl/6 × SJL hybrid strain that is +/+ at the rd1 locus (6Pittler S.J. Baehr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8322-8326Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The mice were bred to homozygosity for the Crx knockout allele and maintained for >6 generations. Total RNA was isolated from the eyes of 10-day-old Crx–/– and Nrl–/– mice as well as background matched controls using RNAqueous RNA isolation kit (Ambion) or TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions (23Yu, J., Farjo, R., MacNee, S. P., Baehr, W., Stambolian, D. E., and Swaroop, A. Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R65Google Scholar) were performed with 2 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus (Ambion) or Superscript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer's guidelines. The reaction was diluted to 100 μl with water. One μl of the diluted cDNA was used in each PCR reaction using either the Dynamo SYBR green qPCR kit (MJ Research) or Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) with SYBR green I (Molecular Beacons). Primer pairs were used that amplify portions of Pde6a-F (5′-CCATGCTGGATGGGATCACTAAC) and PDE6A-R (5′-CAGGGTGACCTCCTCCTTCCTG), Pde6b-F (5′-GTATACAAGGAATTTTCTCG) and PDE6B-R (5′-CAAATTGCTATAGGCAGAGTCCG), rhodopsin-F (Rho) (5′-ATCCCTGAGGGCATGCAATGTTCATG) and Rho-R (5′-CTGCTTGTTCAACATGATGTAGATGAC), and Gapdh-F (5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG) and Gapdh-R (5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT). The reactions were run in the real-time PCR Opticon II system (MJ Research) or iCycler (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt) with Gapdh as the normalizer (dorakmt.tripod.com/genetics/realtime.html).RESULTSThe PDE6A Promoter Region Is in an Open Chromatin State in Y79 Cells—Promoter regions of genes that are transcriptionally active are often demarcated by a DNase I-accessible open chromatin region (24Montecino M. Pockwinse S. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 1 is the portion of the PDE6A core promoter region analyzed in this study. This region contains three potential Crx binding elements (CBE1–3), one site resembling an Nrl/AP1 binding element (NRE/AP1), and one additional segment that is conserved in the upstream regions of both human and mouse (10Mohamed M.K. Taylor R.E. Feinstein D.S. Huang X. Pittler S.J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To assess the chromatin status of the region around the PDE6A promoter region in vivo, a DNase I hypersensitivity assay was performed with Y79 cells, which transcribe PDE6A mRNA (26Di Polo A. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4016-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Treatment of intact Y79 nuclei with DNase I revealed two fragments in close proximity (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7) within a 6.4-kb AflII/XhoI genomic fragment spanning the promoter region (Fig. 2A). No cleavage products were observed using HEK293 nuclei, which do not express PDE6A (data not shown). The estimated size of these fragments places the hypersensitive sites immediately upstream of the predicted core promoter region. This result is consistent with an active promoter within the region previously identified in vitro (10Mohamed M.K. Taylor R.E. Feinstein D.S. Huang X. Pittler S.J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Fig. 2DNase I hypersensitivity mapping of the PDE6A core promoter region. Nuclei were isolated from Y79 Rb cells and treated with increasing amounts of DNase I followed by Southern blot analysis. A, shown is a diagram of the results. DNase I hypersensitive sites (vertical arrows) were found ∼550 and 650 bp upstream of the transcription start point at +1. The 650-bp band appears first (A, thicker vertical arrow; B, lane 5). B, after DNase I digestion, the DNA was extracted and digested with restriction enzymes AflII and XhoI that yield a 6.4-kb fragment spanning the PDE6A promoter region identified in vitro. Southern blot analysis was performed with a 272-bp PCR-amplified probe designated in A. Product in lane 1 was not predigested with DNase I, resulting in an intact 6.4-kb fragment. Lanes 2–7 contain increasing amounts of DNase I as noted. Two bands of 650 and 550 bp become increasingly visible in lanes 5–7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A 177-bp Segment of the Upstream Region Yields the Highest Reporter Gene Activity in Vitro —To delimit the core promoter region, luciferase reporter gene constructs containing varying lengths of the upstream region were assayed by transient transfection in Y79 Rb cells. Due to the relatively low promoter activity, a modified adenofection method was devised to increase the efficiency of gene transfer severalfold over previously reported methods (11White J.B. Taylor R.E. Pittler S.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 106: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the luciferase activity was highest with the shortest fragments tested, pGL3-300 and pGL3-260. Both of these constructs contain 177 bp of sequence extending upstream from the transcription start point and either the entire 5′-untranslated region (pGL3-300) or a downstream truncation of 40 bp (pGL3-260), respectively. Reversing the orientation of the pGL3-260 construct (pGL3-260r) reduced activity equivalent to the promoterless control (pGL3-pl). The remaining four constructs tested (pGL3-593, pGL3-1060, pGL3-1542, and pGL3-3800) all contain upstream repetitive elements (10Mohamed M.K. Taylor R.E. Feinstein D.S. Huang X. Pittler S.J. J. Mol.

Transient adenofection analysis (11White J.B. Taylor R.E. Pittler S.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 106: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was performed in Y79 cells using six constructs (pGL3-260 to pGL-3800) that contain varying lengths of the upstream region. Plasmid pGL3-260r contains the same 260-bp fragment in pGL3-260 in the reverse orientation, and pGL3-pl was used as a promoterless control. Luciferase activity was normalized to control (β-galactosidase), and the results are shown as a percentage of a pGL3-SV40-luc+ control plasmid. Values represent the average of three independent adenofections done in triplicate.

Transient transactivation assays were performed in HEK293 cells with and without Crx and Nrl expression constructs. As shown in Fig. 4, cotransfection of the pGL3-300 PDE6A promoter construct in the absence of Crx or Nrl expression is below detectable limits. In contrast, the inclusion of the Crx or NRL expression construct increased luciferase activity at least 15–20-fold above background levels. Inclusion in the assay of both Crx and Nrl expression constructs further stimulated activity (>100-fold over background), similar to the synergistic activation of rhodopsin (21Mitton K.P. Swain P.K.

Transient transfection was performed in HEK293 cells using plasmid pGL3-300 with Crx and/or Nrl expression plasmids. Crx (+CRX) or Nrl (+NRL) alone stimulated promoter activity as much as 15–20-fold.

https://openalex.org/W1984665129,"Angiotensin II is implicated in pathophysiological processes associated with vascular injury and repair, which include regulating the expression of numerous NF-κB-dependent genes. The present study examined the effect of angiotensin II on interleukin-1β-induced NF-κB activation and the subsequent expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Neither NF-κB activation nor iNOS or VCAM-1 expression was induced in cells treated with angiotensin II alone. However, when added together with interleukin-1β, angiotensin II, through activation of the AT1 receptor, inhibited iNOS expression and enhanced VCAM-1 expression induced by the cytokine. The inhibitory effect of angiotensin II on iNOS expression was associated with a down-regulation of the sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-κB by interleukin-1β, whereas the effect on VCAM-1 was independent of ERK activation. The effect of angiotensin II on iNOS was abolished by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) with SB203580, but not by inhibition of PI3 kinase with wortmannin or stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) with JNK inhibitor II. Thus, angiotensin II, by a mechanism that requires the participation of p38 MAPK, differentially regulates the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes in response to interleukin-1β stimulation by controlling the duration of activation of ERK and NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W1991663669,"Rexinoids and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two classes of nuclear receptor ligands that induce insulin sensitization in diabetic rodents. TZDs are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activators, whereas rexinoids are selective ligands for the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Activation of both the insulin receptor substrates (IRSs)/Akt and the c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP)/c-Cbl pathways are important in regulating insulin-stimulated glucose transport. We have compared the effects of a rexinoid (LG268) and a TZD (rosiglitazone) on these two signal pathways in skeletal muscle of diabetic (db/db) mice. The results we have obtained show that treatment of db/db mice with either LG268 or rosiglitazone for 2 weeks results in a significant increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle. Treatment with LG268 increases insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation in skeletal muscle without affecting the activity of the CAP/c-Cbl pathway. In contrast, rosiglitazone increases the levels of CAP expression and insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation without affecting the IRS-1/Akt pathway. The effects of LG268 on the IRS-1/Akt pathway were associated with a decrease in the level of IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that rexinoids improve insulin sensitivity via changes in skeletal muscle metabolism that are distinct from those induced by TZDs.

In contrast to the TZDs, much less is known about the cellular and molecular basis for the insulin-sensitizing activity of RXR agonists (rexinoids). Rexinoids are a class of nuclear receptor ligands that are structurally and functionally distinct from the TZDs. Because the RXRs serve as the obligate partners in a large number of nuclear receptor heterodimers, including the PPARs (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the insulin-sensitizing activity of rexinoids could be due to the activation of RXR/PPARγ heterodimers. In this model, rexinoids would function as “TZD-mimetics,” activating the same RXR/PPARγ heterodimers as the TZDs, inducing similar alterations in gene expression and producing comparable pharmacological effects. However, a direct comparison of the effects of rexinoids and TZDs on gene expression in diabetic animals has revealed marked differences in the patterns of gene expression produced by these two classes of nuclear receptor ligands. Although TZDs have their most marked effects on gene expression in adipose tissue, the primary effects of rexinoids involve alterations in gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle (14Singh Ahuja H. Liu S. Crombie D.L. Boehm M. Leibowitz M.D. Heyman R.A. Depre C. Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Davies P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results suggest that rexinoids and TZDs might produce insulin sensitization via distinct alterations in insulin-mediated metabolic signaling. Skeletal muscle accounts for the majority of insulin-regulated whole body glucose disposal. Glucose transport is the rate-limiting step in this process (15Klip A. Paquet M.R. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 228-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Insulin promotes glucose transport by activating at least two distinct intracellular signal transduction pathways, the insulin receptor (IR)/insulin receptor substrates (IRSs)/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and the IR/c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP)/c-Cbl pathway (16Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of a prototypic rexinoid, LG268, and a prototypic TZD, rosiglitazone, on these two signaling pathways in the muscles of diabetic (db/db) mice. The results we have obtained show that the treatment of db/db mice with rexinoids or TZDs for 2 weeks resulted in a significant increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle. Rexinoids increased the activity of components of the IRS-1/Akt pathway without alterations in the CAP/c-Cbl pathway. TZDs, on the other hand, increased the levels of expression and activity of components of the CAP/c-Cbl pathway without significant effects on the IRS-1/Akt pathway. The effects of rexinoids on the IRS-1/Akt pathway were associated with a decrease in the level of IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation as well as qualitative and quantitative alterations in the levels of intramyocellular fatty acyl-CoAs. Taken together, these findings suggest that rexinoids produce insulin sensitization via changes in muscle glucose and/or lipid metabolism that are distinct from those induced by the TZDs. Rexinoids appear to represent a novel class of insulin-sensitizing agents with potential applications in the treatment of insulin-resistant states.

Animals and Drug Administration—5-week-old male db/db mice and lean littermates (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed in plastic cages on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with free access to water and food (Purina 5008). After 2 weeks of acclimation, animals were weighed, bled via the tail vein, and assigned to treatment groups based on starting glucose values (first criterion) and initial body weights (second criterion). Mice were gavaged once daily with vehicle, LG268 (30 mg/kg), or rosiglitazone (30 mg/kg) for 15 days. On day 15, animals were weighed, blood was collected in the fed state 3 h after dosing, and serum glucose and triglyceride levels were measured using the glucose oxidase Trinder protocol (1Mukherjee R.

At the end of the experiments, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia, and skeletal muscles (soleus, white gastrocnemii, and quadriceps) were rapidly excised, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C for RNA and protein analysis and determination of intramyocellular long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. For insulin signaling studies, paired extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were used for ex vivo incubation. Long Chain Fatty Acyl-CoAs Measurement—Skeletal muscles (soleus and gastrocnemii) were assayed to determine the intramyocellular content of LCFA-CoAs using mass spectrometry as previously described (17Yu C. Chen Y. Cline G.W. Zhang D. Zong H. Wang Y. Bergeron R. Kim J.K. Cushman S.W. Cooney G.J. Atcheson B. White M.F. Kraegen E.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol.

Briefly, after removing visible adipose and connective tissues, the muscle samples (∼50 mg) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. LCFA-CoAs were extracted from the sample by solid-phase extraction and C17 CoA was added as an internal standard. A tandem mass spectrometer (API 3000, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) interfaced with a TurboIonspray ionization source was used for mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. LCFA-CoAs were ionized in a negative electrospray mode, and the transition pairs [M-2H]2–/[M-H-80]– were monitored in multiple reaction-monitoring mode. Doubly charged ions and corresponding product ions (precursor minus phosphate group) were selected as a transition pair for multiple reaction monitoring for quantitation. RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription and PCR—Total RNA extraction and real-time Q-RT-PCR were performed as described previously (14Singh Ahuja H. Liu S. Crombie D.L.

Briefly, muscles were homogenized in Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) with a Polytron, precipitated with isopropanol, and the homogenates were applied to RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). RNA was eluted and then treated with DNase (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by heat inactivation at 75 °C for 10 min, and storage at –80 °C. 10-ng aliquots of total RNA were reverse-transcribed in triplicate using 10 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) in the presence of 1 × RT buffer (Invitrogen), 300 nm reverse primer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm dNTPs, and 4 mm MgCl2 at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. An additional “no-RT” sample without reverse transcriptase was run in parallel as a control. The reverse transcription reaction (10 μl) was added to 40-μl PCR mix containing 1 × PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 300 nm forward and reverse primers, 100 nm fluorogenic probe, 1.25 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 500 μm dNTPs and 4 mm MgCl2. Real-time PCR was carried out by amplification of samples in 96-well plates in an ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT) at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 12 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were analyzed by the use of the Sequence Detection Application software, and the absolute values of transcripts were generated by interpolating the Ct value (number of cycles required to reach the threshold) of an unknown sample on a standard curve of a series of dilutions of a known amount of a synthetic amplicon (single-stranded DNA) run in parallel on the same 96-well plate. All values were corrected for RNA input by normalization to the level of cyclophilin mRNA. For each transcript, specific PCR primer pairs and a dual fluorochrome-labeled hybridization probe (TaqMan probe) were designed using ABI Primer Express software (Table I) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

Open table in a new tab Ex Vivo Muscle Incubation—Intact soleus and EDL muscles were rapidly dissected from both hindlimbs, and both ends of each muscle were tied with suture before mounting on stainless steel clips to maintain consistent resting muscle length and tension throughout the incubation. The incubation was performed in stoppered flasks gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 in a shaking water bath at 30 °C. Muscles were first preincubated in 3 ml of oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB, 104 mm NaCl, 22 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm KCl, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm Mg2SO4, and 6.7 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% BSA (RIA grade). After 40 min, the preincubation buffer was removed, and the muscles were incubated for 20 min in 3 ml of incubation buffer in the presence or absence of 104 microunits/ml insulin. The incubation was terminated by immediately freezing the muscles in liquid nitrogen. Frozen muscles were then placed into ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 × complete protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm NaF, and 5 mm Na3VO4. The muscles were homogenized using four 10-s bursts of a Polytron at maximum speed. The homogenates were allowed to sit on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were collected, proteins were determined using the BCA protein assay kit, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Procedures—For detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and c-Cbl, muscle lists containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 1 h (IR) or overnight (IRS-1 and c-Cbl) at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-IR-β, anti-IRS-1, or anti-c-Cbl antibodies in a final volume of 160 μl. 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose slurry was added to the immunoprecipitation reaction, and incubation was continued for another 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes bound to Sepharose were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, and 5 mm Na3VO4). The samples were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 6.0 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins on the gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Following blocking with 5% nonfat milk or BSA at room temperature for 2 h, the membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (1: 1000) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 40 min with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands of interest were visualized by ECL, scanned, and quantified by densitometry. When necessary, some PVDF membranes were subsequently stripped at 50 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for a second round of immunoblotting. For assessment of Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1, muscle homogenates (400 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal IRS-1 antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-phospho-IRS-1 (Ser307) antiserum. The bands of interests were detected as described above. To determine protein levels of CAP, IR-β, Akt, phospho-Akt, p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and PTEN, equal amounts of protein were prepared from muscle homogenates and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting procedures as described above. 2-Deoxyglucose Transport Activity in Muscle—Briefly, intact soleus and EDL muscles were preincubated for 40 min at 30 °C in 3 ml of oxygenated KHB buffer containing 5.5 mm glucose, 5 milliunits/ml insulin, and 1% BSA (RIA grade). Afterward, the muscles were incubated for 30 min in 3 ml of incubation medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (2-[3H]deoxyglucose/glucose = 19.5 nm/5.5 mm) and 0.1 μCi/ml [U-14C]sucrose, in the presence or absence of 104 microunits/ml insulin. At the end of incubation, the muscles were blotted on Kimwipes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, weighed, and homogenized in 0.8 ml of ice-cold 6% perchloric acid and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein. A portion of the supernatant was counted on a liquid scintillation counter pre-conFig.d for 3H and 14C dual channel counting. The rates of transport of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose into the muscle cells were calculated after correcting for any 2-[3H]deoxyglucose trapped in the extracellular space, which was determined using the [U-14C]sucrose. Results were expressed as micromoles of 2-deoxyglucose transported per hour per gram wet muscle weight (micromoles/h/g of tissue). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the effects of treatment within groups was determined by using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Effects of LG268 and Rosiglitazone on Body Weight, Serum Glucose, and Triglyceride Levels in db/db Mice—The goal of our studies has been to treat diabetic db/db mice with a rexinoid, LG268, or a well characterized TZD, rosiglitazone, and then to compare the effects of the two treatments on glucose transport activity and several components involved in insulin-mediated signaling in skeletal muscle. To ensure that the effects observed were conducted under comparable conditions, we treated the db/db mice with either LG268 or rosiglitazone both at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day, because previous investigations had shown that both compounds at this dose produced a maximal and an equivalent suppression of hyperglycemia in diabetic rats (14Singh Ahuja H. Liu S. Crombie D.L. Boehm M. Leibowitz M.D. Heyman R.A. Depre C. Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Davies P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Table II compares the body weight, serum glucose, and triglyceride levels of a group of db/db mice and their lean littermates at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment with vehicle, LG268, or rosiglitazone. The db/db mice were significantly heavier than their lean littermates at baseline (31.8 ± 1.9 versus 22.3 ± 2.0 g for diabetic and lean mice, respectively, p < 0.05), and they gained significantly more weight during the 2-week treatment period. The weight gain in the LG268-treated db/db animals was not different from the vehicle-treated controls, whereas rosiglitazone treatment resulted in a significant increase in weight gain for the db/db mice (11.4 versus 5.4 g of weight gain for rosiglitazone and vehicle treatments, respectively, p < 0.05). Neither LG268 nor rosiglitazone affected the weight gain of the lean animals.Table IIBody weight, serum glucose, and triglyceride concentrations in db/db mice and the lean littermatesBody weightSerum glucoseSerum triglyceride0 days15 days0 days15 days0 days15 daysgmg/dlDbVehicle31.8 ± 1.9ap < 0.05 versus untreated lean mice.37.2 ± 1.3370 ± 119ap < 0.05 versus untreated lean mice.531 ± 108119 ± 20ap < 0.05 versus untreated lean mice.130 ± 25LG26839.9 ± 2.7250 ± 64bp < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated db/db mice using Student's t test.52 ± 12bp < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated db/db mice using Student's t test.ROS43.2 ± 4.0bp < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated db/db mice using Student's t test.187 ± 89bp < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated db/db mice using Student's t test.67 ± 25bp < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated db/db mice using Student's t test.LeanVehicle22.3 ± 2.024.4 ± 1.9129 ± 14122 ± 1479 ± 6NDcND, not determined.LG26824.2 ± 2.2166 ± 22ROS25.0 ± 1.6117 ± 20a p < 0.05 versus untreated lean mice.b p < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated db/db mice using Student's t test.c ND, not determined.

Under the conditions of our studies, the baseline serum glucose level in the db/db mice was 370 ± 119 mg/dl, compared with a baseline level of 129 ± 14 mg/dl in the lean mice. In addition, the degree of hyperglycemia in the db/db mice increased significantly to 531 ± 108 mg/dl during the 2-week study period. Both LG268 and rosiglitazone markedly decreased the hyperglycemia of the db/db animals (by 68 and 83%, respectively). Neither drug affected the serum glucose level of the lean animals. In addition to being hyperglycemic, db/db mice were also hypertriglyceridemic (119 ± 20 versus 79 ± 6 mg/dl in diabetic and lean mice, respectively, p < 0.05). Although RXR ligands produce sustained hypertriglyceridemia in diabetic rats and in humans (19Davies P.J. Berry S.A. Shipley G.L. Eckel R.H. Hennuyer N. Crombie D.L. Ogilvie K.M. Peinado-Onsurbe J.

Effects of LG268 and Rosiglitazone on Insulin-stimulated Glucose Transport Activity in Skeletal Muscle of db/db Mice—We first compared the ability of isolated skeletal muscle to transport 2-deoxyglucose in db/db mice and their lean littermates. For these studies, paired soleus and EDL muscles were rapidly excised from both hindlimbs of diabetic and lean mice, incubated in physiological buffer containing 2-[3H]deoxyglucose in the presence or absence of 104 microunits/ml insulin at 30 °C for 30 min. 2-Deoxyglucose transport was then determined as described under “Experimental Methods.” There was no significant difference between the diabetic and lean mice in the basal level of glucose transport in either soleus (Fig. 1A) or EDL muscle (Fig. 1B). There was, however, a moderate reduction in the values of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in both soleus and EDL muscles from db/db mice compared with lean controls. The insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose transport was decreased by 30% in diabetic soleus (2.7 ± 0.4 versus 4.0 ± 0.4 μmol/g/h for diabetic and lean mice, respectively, p < 0.05) and 22% in diabetic EDL (2.9 ± 0.2 versus 3.7 ± 0.4 micromoles/g/h for diabetic and lean mice, respectively, p = 0.09). To determine whether treatment with either the rexinoid or the TZD affected the glucose transport activity of skeletal muscle, db/db mice were treated for 2 weeks with either vehicle, LG268, or rosiglitazone, paired EDL muscles were excised and basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose transport was measured as described above (Fig. 1C). LG268 had no effect on basal glucose transport (2.8 ± 0.3 versus 2.3 ± 0.2 μmol/g/h for LG268-versus vehicle-treated animals, p = 0.22), but it did induce a significant increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport (4.5 ± 0.3 versus 3.0 ± 0.2 μmol/g/h for LG268-versus vehicle-treated animals, 50% increase, p < 0.05). Treatment with rosiglitazone, on the other hand, resulted in a significant increase in both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose tr"

Here we examine the role of the 11 tyrosines in this domain of the 5-HT3 receptor in ligand binding and receptor function by substituting them for alanine, for serine, and, for some residues, also for phenylalanine. The mutant receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes and examined using radioligand binding, Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiology, and immunochemistry. The data suggest that Tyr50 and Tyr91 are critical for receptor assembly and/or structure, Tyr141 is important for antagonist binding and/or the structure of the binding pocket, Tyr143 plays a critical role in receptor gating and/or agonist binding, and Tyr153 and Tyr234 are involved in ligand binding and/or receptor gating. Tyr73, Tyr88, Tyr94, Tyr167, and Tyr240 do not appear to play major roles either in the structure of the extracellular domain or in ligand binding.

The Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels plays a critical role in neuronal transmission and are also the target of many neuroactive agents; understanding their molecular details is therefore a priority in this field. Among the different family members, the 5-HT3 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; nACh, nicotinic acetylcholine; HEK, human embryonic kidney; WT, wild type; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; dTC, d-tubocurarine; HBM, HEPES-buffered medium; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; nACh, nicotinic acetylcholine; HEK, human embryonic kidney; WT, wild type; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; dTC, d-tubocurarine; HBM, HEPES-buffered medium; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. receptor has the closest functional homology with the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor. The nACh receptor is particularly well characterized, because although no high resolution x-ray crystal structure is known, a vast array of techniques including chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, electron microscopy, and molecular modeling have provided a reasonable understanding of the structure-function relationships of the receptor. Molecular details of the N-terminal extracellular domain, which harbors the ligand-binding site, have recently been further clarified following publication of the high resolution structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), which is homologous to this domain (1Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). This work has confirmed that six regions of the sequence (loops A-F), previously indicated to be involved in ligand binding, are located in the binding pocket and has provided some insight into the molecular mechanisms of ligand recognition. More recently, superimposed structures of the AChBP and the nACh receptor have also elucidated gross structural rearrangements that occur upon ligand binding (2Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). AChBP also provides a good model for the extracellular domain of the 5-HT3 receptor (3Reeves D.C. Lummis S.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), although molecular details of the ACh-binding site cannot be directly extrapolated to this protein. There is, however, some overlap between pharmacophore models for the nACh and 5-HT3 receptors (4Cockcroft V. Ortells M. Lunt G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 757: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although compounds binding to both receptors can display different affinities for the two receptors or have opposing effects. For example, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist d-tubocurarine (dTC) displays differential affinities at the two nonidentical nACh receptor-binding sites, and nicotine, a nACh receptor agonist, behaves as an antagonist at the 5-HT3 receptor ligand-binding site (5Breitinger H.G. Geetha N. Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8419-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite this, the structural variation between ligand-binding sites responsible for these differences in action may be subtle; one report suggests the replacement of just one residue in the 5-HT3 receptor (F130N) is sufficient to produce a receptor responsive to ACh (6Steward L.J. Boess F.G. Steele J.A. Liu D. Wong N. Martin I.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1249-1255PubMed Google Scholar). The recently published model of the 5-HT3 receptor-binding site (7Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), therefore, is probably broadly accurate, even though it is based on a structure than binds ACh; however, because it is purely a homology model, it requires support from experimental data. Aromatic residues have been previously shown to be involved in ligand binding to the 5-HT3 receptor (3Reeves D.C. Lummis S.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In particular a role for tyrosine residues has been demonstrated (8Miquel M.C. Emerit M.B. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar): pretreatment of 5-HT3 receptors in NG108-15 cells with the tyrosine-modifying reagent tetranitromethane caused a 30% reduction in specific binding of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [3 H]zacopride. In addition, mutation of Tyr94 to alanine caused a small shift in [3H]granisetron binding affinity (9Yan D. Schulte M.K. Bloom K.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5537-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and alanine substitutions of Tyr141, Tyr143, and Tyr153 have been shown to affect both agonist and antagonist affinities and 5-HT-induced currents (10Venkataraman P. Venkatachalan S.P. Joshi P.R. Muthalagi M. Schulte M.K. BMC Biochemistry. 2002; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we extend these studies to examine the radioligand binding, electrophysiological, and cell surface expression properties of mutants of each of the 11 tyrosine residues in the mouse 5-HT3 receptor extracellular domain. The data reveal that specific tyrosine residues play roles in the structure and/or function of the receptor and also support the model of the 5-HT3 receptor extracellular domain (7Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Materials—All of the cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, except fetal calf serum which was from Labtech International (Ringmer, UK). [3H]granisetron (81 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The 5-HT3A receptor N-terminal domain antiserum, pAb120, was generated as previously described (11Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest obtainable grade. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained on 90-mm tissue culture plates at 37 and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F-12 (1:1) with GLUTAMAX I™ containing 10% fetal calf serum and passaged when confluent. The cells were grown in 90-mm-diameter dishes for radioligand binding studies and on 22-mm-diameter coverslips for immunocytochemistry and Ca2+ imaging studies. The cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (12Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) at 80-90% confluency. Following transfection the cells were incubated for 3-4 days before assay. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutagenesis reactions were performed using the method developed by Kunkel (13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) using the 5-HT3A(b) subunit DNA as previously described (14Hargreaves A.C. Gunthorpe M.J. Taylor C.W. Lummis S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1284-1294PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the recommendations of Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.54-15.56Google Scholar) and using some suggestions of the Primer Generator (16Turchin A. Lawler Jr., J.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (www.med.jhu.edu/medcenter/primer/primer.cgi). A silent restriction site was incorporated in each to assist rapid identification.

Sepulveda M.I. Kilpatrick G.J. Baker J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 243: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells that had been transfected with wild type (WT) or mutant DNA were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. They were then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing the following proteinase inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bacitracin and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The harvested cells were washed in HEPES with proteinase inhibitor and frozen at -20 °C. After thawing, they were washed twice with HEPES buffer and resuspended, and 50 μg was incubated in 0.5 ml HEPES buffer containing [3H]granisetron (81 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Initially, single-point radioligand binding assays were performed using 1 nm and sometimes 20 nm [3H]granisetron to test for specific binding. If specific binding was present, saturation binding (8 point) assays were performed on at least three separate plates of transfected cells for each mutant. Nonspecific binding was typically determined by the addition of 1 μm dTC. It was noticed, however, that for assays on some mutants (Y141A and Y153A), nonspecific binding was higher than expected. For these mutants nonspecific binding was determined using 100 μm dTC or 1 μm quipazine, which were able to reduce nonspecific binding to expected levels. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters presoaked for 3 h in 0.3% polyethyleneimine followed by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000sc). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin standards. The data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting (GraphPad, PRISM, San Diego, CA) according to the following equation: B = (Bmax [L]n)/([L]n + Kn), where B is bound radioligand, Bmax is maximum binding at equilibrium, K is the equilibrium dissociation constant, [L] is the free concentration of radioligand, and n is the Hill coefficient Ca2+ Imaging—Ca2+ imaging was as described previously (18Hargreaves A.C. Lummis S.C. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells were washed once with HEPES-buffered medium (HBM: 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 15 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in HBM containing 2 μm fura-2/acetoxymetyl ester and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After washing (twice with 1 ml of HBM) and at least 30 min further incubation, the cells were washed (twice with 1 ml) in Na+-free HBM where Na+ was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine, and coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. 340/380-nm image pairs were collected at 5-s intervals using Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.), and fluorescence ratios were formed by dividing pairs of images; these images were converted to [Ca2+]i by reference to a look-up table created using standard solutions (Molecular Probes). Data from concentration-response experiments were normalized to maximal current (Imax) readings and, using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), were fitted to the following Hill equation: I=(Imax[A]n)/(EC50n+[A]n), where Imax is the maximal current, [A] is the agonist concentration, n is the Hill coefficient, and EC50 is the agonist concentration that induces half-maximal response. Significance was calculated using a one-way analysis of variance and a Dunnett post-test. Immunofluorescent Localization—Immunofluorescent localization was as described previously (11Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were washed with three changes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) and fixed using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (66 mm Na2HPO4, 38 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2). After two TBS washes, the cells were incubated in pAb120 antisera at 1:1000 dilution in TBS to determine membranous expression. Intracellular receptor expression was determined by inclusion of 0.3% Triton X-100 (TTBS) for membrane permeabilization. Primary antibody incubation was overnight at 4 °C. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer's instructions. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector), and immunofluorescence was observed using a Nikon optiphot or confocal microscope. Oocyte Preparation—Oocyte preparation was as described previously (19Reeves D.C. Goren E.N. Akabas M.H. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42035-42042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Harvested stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were washed in four changes of OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), defolliculated in 1 mg/ml collagenase for ∼1 h, washed again in four changes of OR2, and transferred to 70% Leibovitz medium (Invitrogen) buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The following day they were injected with 5 ng mRNA produced by in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) from DNA subcloned into pGEMHE (20Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) as previously described (19Reeves D.C. Goren E.N. Akabas M.H. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42035-42042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological measurements were performed 24-72 h post-injection. Electrophysiological Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamping of Xenopus oocytes was performed using standard electrophysiological procedures as previously described (19Reeves D.C. Goren E.N. Akabas M.H. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42035-42042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, a GeneClamp 500B amplifier was connected to a PC running CLAMPEX version 6.0.3 software via a DigiData1200 Series Interface (all Axon Instruments, Inc.). Glass microelectrodes were pulled from GC150TF-10 glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) using a P-87 micropipette puller (Sutter) to a resistance of 0.5 mΩ and back-filled with 3 m KCl. 3 m KCl agar bridges connected ground electrodes to the bath. The oocytes were maintained at a holding potential of -30mV unless stated otherwise and perfused continuously with calcium-free frog ringer (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) at a rate of 3-4 ml/min. Serotonin (creatinine sulfate complex; Sigma) was diluted in calcium-free frog ringer and applied to the bath using a Valve Bank 8 II system (Automate Scientific, Inc.). Doses of 5-HT were applied at 3-min intervals to allow for recovery from desensitization. Concentration-response curves and parameters were obtained using Prism software as described above. Radioligand Binding Properties of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors—Radioligand binding assays were initially performed with the alanine and serine mutants of the 11 tyrosine residues. Specific, saturable binding was detected for 12 of the 22 mutants but could not be detected for Y50A, Y50S, Y91A, Y91S, Y141S, Y234A, or Y234S mutants despite the use of [3H]granisetron at concentrations up to 20 nm. At least two different DNA preparations of each of these mutants were used for transfection and simultaneous transfection of WT DNA yielded cell membrane preparations that bound [3H]granisetron with high affinity. It is therefore unlikely that the failure to detect radioligand binding was a result of unsuccessful transfection. For a subset of tyrosine residues (Tyr50, Tyr91, Tyr141, Tyr143, Tyr153, Tyr234, and Tyr240), radioligand binding assays using [3H]granisetron were performed on phenylalanine-substituted receptors. This more conservative mutation was able to reveal specific binding with a Kd for [3H]granisetron not significantly different from WT in all mutants except one (Y50F). The dissociation constants of [3H]granisetron binding are shown in Table II.Table IIAffinities of mutant 5-HT3 receptors for [3H]granisetron NB, no binding.ReceptorKdnReceptorKdnnmnmWild type0.32 ± 0.0357Y141SNB8Y50FNB3Y143F0.53 ± 0.103Y50ANB10Y143A1.2 ± 0.248Y50SNB13Y143S1.13 ± 0.237Y73A0.34 ± 0.0437Y153F0.90 ± 0.205Y73S0.57 ± 0.0865Y153A3.62 ± 1.75aSignificantly different from WT (p < 0.05)3Y88A0.27 ± 0.0903Y153SNB6Y88S0.22 ± 0.0367Y167A0.28 ± 0.0533Y91F0.80 ± 0.0363Y167S0.32 ± 0.0803Y91ANB15Y234F1.3 ± 0.364Y91SNB19Y234ANB5Y94A0.43 ± 0.0588Y234SNB5Y94S0.37 ± 0.0704Y240A0.10 ± 0.0138Y141F0.98 ± 0.154Y240S0.083 ± 0.0164Y141A8.97 ± 2.44aSignificantly different from WT (p < 0.05)4a Significantly different from WT (p < 0.05) Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescent Localization of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors—To ascertain whether the lack of binding observed for some tyrosine mutants (Y50F, Y50A, Y50S, Y91A, Y91S, Y141S, Y153S, Y234A, and Y234S) was due to an ablation of ligand binding ability or to a lack of cell surface receptor expression, the localization of these mutant receptors was investigated using an antisera specific to the extracellular domain of the 5-HT3 receptor (11Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Intracellular staining was observed in all cells transfected with WT or mutant receptors (Fig. 1, left-hand panels) but not mock transfected cells. Conversely cell surface staining, visualized as a well defined ring of fluorescence and indicating that the receptors are expressed on the plasma membrane (11Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V.

Neurosci. 2002; 18: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), was observed only for some mutant receptors (Fig. 1, right-hand panels). Thus, cells transfected with Y50F, Y50A, Y50S, Y91A, and Y91S mutants showed reduced levels or an absence of cell surface staining compared with cells transfected with WT subunit DNA (which had a robust ring of fluorescence around the cells), indicating that these subunits are not efficiently transported to the cell surface. Functional Characterization of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors—Mutant receptors for those tyrosine residues suspected of being involved in the function of 5-HT3 receptors were examined using calcium imaging of DNA expressed in HEK293 cells and, for some, also in oocytes. For WT receptors the concentration of 5-HT required to evoke a half-maximal response (EC50) was 1.47 ± 0.42 μm in HEK293 cells and 2.39 ± 0.23 μm (n = 5) in oocytes (Tables III and IV). The responses were blocked by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron and desensitized in the continued presence of agonist as previously described (22Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Gunthorpe M.J. Peters J.A. Gill C.H. Lambert J.J. Lummis S.C. J.

In addition no responses to 5-HT were observed with cells expressing Y50F-containing receptors, but responses with EC50s not significantly different from WT were observed in cells expressing Y91F and Y141F receptors, with values significantly greater than WT being observed for Y234F receptors. Both Y153A and Y153S receptors also had EC50 values significantly larger than WT receptors, although not as great as Y143S receptors, which had an EC50 > 500 μm. The data are shown in Table III. The wave forms of all the functional receptors were similar to WT, suggesting no major changes in the kinetics of the response. For mutations that we suspected may affect receptor assembly (Tyr50 and Tyr91), receptors were also expressed in oocytes. Oocytes are generally more tolerant than mammalian cells to expression of ion channel proteins, which probably require longer periods to fold correctly; the difference may arise primarily from the fact oocytes are incubated at lower temperatures (26Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Here responses to 5-HT could not be detected in oocytes injected with Y50A and Y50F 5-HT3 receptor mRNA, but oocytes injected with Y50S mRNA responded to 5-HT with an EC50 and Hill coefficient not significantly different from WT (Fig. 3). The responses also had similar wave forms to WT receptor, indicating no significant change in response kinetics. Imax values for this mutant, however, were noticeably reduced, with maximal currents only 13% those of WT. A comparison of the responses obtained is shown in Table IV. Y91A, Y91S, and Y91F mutant 5-HT3 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes elicited inward currents upon application of 5-HT. Y91F receptors appeared similar to WT, but, as shown in Table III, the EC50 values for the activation of Y91A and Y91S were significantly larger than WT, with a ∼6-fold increase in the EC50 of Y91A and an ∼24-fold increase in the EC50 of Y91S compared with WT (Fig. 3). There was no significant change in Hill coefficients or wave forms for any of these mutants. To identify the roles of tyrosine residues in the extracellular domain of the 5-HT3A receptor, we substituted the 11 tyrosines in this domain for alanine, for serine, and, for some residues, also for phenylalanine. The binding, function, and cell surface expression of the mutant receptors were then examined using the HEK293 and Xenopus oocyte expression systems. The data suggest that more than half of these residues play important roles in either the structure or the function of the receptor. Thus, Tyr50 and Tyr91 are critical for correct receptor assembly and/or structure, whereas Tyr141, Tyr143, Tyr153, and Tyr234 play roles in the structure and/or function of the receptor. These residues are discussed further below. Alanine and serine substitution of the tyrosine residues Tyr73, Tyr88, Tyr94, Tyr167, and Tyr240 resulted in mutant receptors that had [3H]granisetron binding properties not significantly different from WT receptors. This competitive antagonist binds with high affinity in the same binding pocket as 5-HT (e.g. 10) and is one of a selection of radioligands that have been used in similar conditions to probe the binding pocket (6Steward L.J. Boess F.G. Steele J.A. Liu D. Wong N. Martin I.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1249-1255PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yan D. Schulte M.K. Bloom K.E. White M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37962-37966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, we can been reasonably confident that this pocket is not significantly altered and that Tyr73, Tyr88, Tyr94, Tyr167, and Tyr240 do not play major roles in either the structure of the extracellular domain or in ligand binding. These observations are supported by the placement of these residues on a recent model of the 5-HT3 receptor extracellular domain based on the structure of AChBP (7Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Docking of 5-HT to the ligand-binding site on this model revealed seven possible agonist orientations, of which only two were supported by experimental evidence. These two only differ slightly (in the orientation of the primary amine), and because we cannot yet determine which of these is most favorable, we have chosen the orientation designated model 4 in Reeves et al. (7Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L"

PU.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors, expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells and microglia of brain. PU.1 plays an essential role in the development of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Opioids exert neuromodulatory as well as immunomodulatory effects, which are transduced by MOR. Moreover, MOR-deficient mice exhibit increased proliferation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting a possible link between the opioid system and hematopoietic development. The PU.1 protein binds to the 34-bp element of the MOR gene in a sequence-specific manner confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift assays. We have also determined endogenous PU.1 interactions with the 34-bp element of MOR promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In co-transfection studies PU.1 represses MOR promoter reporter constructs through its PU.1 binding site. When the PU.1 gene is disrupted as in PU.1 knock-out mice and using small interfering RNA-based strategy in RAW264.7 cells, the transcription of the endogenous target MOR gene is increased significantly. This increase is probably mediated through modification of the chromatin structure, as suggested by the reversal of the PU.1-mediated repression of MOR promoter activity after trichostatin A treatment in neuroblastoma NMB cells. Our results suggest that PU.1 may be an important regulator of the MOR gene, particularly in brain and immune cells.

Opioid receptors mediate the various functions of opioids and endogenous opioid peptides, including analgesia, euphoria, respiratory depression, and endocrine/immune regulation. Opioid receptors have been classified into three major types (μ, δ, and κ) using pharmacological studies and subsequently by molecular cloning studies (1Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar).

All three types of receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (2Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and the μ opioid receptor (MOR) is known to play an essential role in morphine-induced analgesia, tolerance, and dependence as indicated from pharmacological studies, i.e. MOR gene knock-out studies (7Loh H.H. Liu H.C. Cavalli A. Yang W. Chen Y.F. Wei L.N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The MOR is expressed mainly in the CNS, where it exhibits distinct temporal and spatial patterns of distribution (1Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar). MOR is also detected in immune cells, such as rat peritoneal macrophages (8Sedqi M. Roy S. Ramakrishnan S. Elde R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and a variety of human and monkey immune cells, including human CEM x174 T/B lymphocytes, human Raji B cells, human CD+ cells, human monocytes/macrophages, human neutrophils, monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and monkey neutrophils (4Chuang T.K. Killam Jr., K.F. Chuang L.F. Kung H.F. Sheng W.S. Chao C.C. Yu L. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The existence of MOR in immune cells can explain why drug abusers (opioids and heroin) frequently become more susceptible to external pathogenic challenges, especially as observed in human immunodeficiency virus-infected opiate users (9Sheng W.S. Hu S. Gekker G. Zhu S. Peterson P.K. Chao C.C. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (Warsz). 1997; 45: 359-366PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nyland S.B. Specter S. Im-Sin J. Ugen K.E. Adv. Exp. Med.

Several studies, including in situ hybridization studies and other methods (e.g. RNase protection assay and RT-PCR), indicate that expression of MOR is regulated at the transcriptional level, especially during embryonic development (13Zhu Y. Hsu M.S. Pintar J.E. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tong Y. Chabot J.G. Shen S.H. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Quirion R. J. Chem.

Opioid receptors of human and monkey lymphocytes were up-regulated by morphine treatment at the transcriptional and translational levels (17Suzuki S. Miyagi T. Chuang T.K. Chuang L.F. Doi R.H. Chuang R.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interleukin-1β treatment in primary astrocyte-enriched cultures was found to increase the level of MOR messenger RNA in striatal, cerebellar, and hippocampal cultures by 55–75% but not in cultures derived from the cortex or hypothalamus (18Ruzicka B.B. Akil H. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The expression of MOR in the rat mesentery was induced by treatment with a bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (19Chang S.L. Felix B. Jiang Y. Fiala M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 493: 187-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This induction may be mediated through the actions of IL-1 on MOR (19Chang S.L. Felix B. Jiang Y. Fiala M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 493: 187-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of MOR transcripts in discrete brain regions are also regulated by administration of other non-opioid drugs (the dopaminergic drugs, such as cocaine and haloperidol) (20Azaryan A.V. Clock B.J. Rosenberger J.G. Cox B.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Delfs J.M. Yu L. Ellison G.D. Reisine T. Chesselet M.F. J Neurochem. 1994; 63: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that the transcriptional regulation of MOR gene is closely associated with the dopaminergic system in the brain. However, the molecular mechanisms of MOR gene regulation are still not completely understood. Studies in our laboratory show that expression of MOR is driven by two promoters, distal and proximal (22Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both promoters exhibit characteristics of housekeeping genes lacking a TATA box (23Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the distal promoter is known to be 20-fold less active than the proximal promoter, based on quantitative RT-PCR using adult mouse brain mRNA (23Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Choe et al. (25Choe C. Im H.J. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol.

Our objective in this study was to identify the transcription factors that bind to the cis-acting element regulating transcription from the mouse MOR distal promoter. A member of the ets family of transcription factors, PU.1, was isolated using the yeast one-hybrid system, which helped identify the trans-acting factors that bind to the negative regulatory cis-acting element of the MOR distal promoter. This paper describes the in vitro and in vivo data on the regulation of MOR gene expression by PU.1. Plasmid Construction and in Vitro Translation—Constructs for the recombinant luciferase reporter gene plasmids pL1.3K/687, pL1.3K/728, Linker 3, Linker 6, and Linker 7 have been previously described (25Choe C. Im H.J. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression plasmid pcFLAG-PU.1 was constructed by inserting the EcoRI-XhoI fragment of the original library clone, pACT2-PU.1, in the same site of pcDNA-5′UT-FLAG (26Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For functional analysis of PU.1 protein, pJ6-PU.1 and expression vector pJ6 were gratefully obtained from Dr. M. J. Klemsz (27Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. In vitro translation was carried out with pcFLAG-PU.1 in a reaction mixture containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using a TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The labeled proteins were then electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE, and their sizes were compared with the predicted sizes. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assay—Human neuroblastoma NMB cells and the murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cell line were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Rat glioma C6 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained as described previously (28Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well and cultured overnight before transfection. Various plasmids at concentrations indicated in each figure were used with the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, for luciferase analysis of the distal MOR promoters, 0.5 μg of each reporter plasmid was mixed with the Effectene transfection reagent for 10 min before being added to various cells. Forty-eight hrs after transfection, cells grown to confluence were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, a 1:5 molar ratio of a pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) containing β-galactosidase gene under the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection for normalization. The luciferase and galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). For co-transfection assays, the procedures were the same as above, except that the plasmids were a mixture of the given amount of PU.1 construct and 0.5 μg of a corresponding reporter plasmid, pL1.3K/687, pL1.3K/728, Linker 3, Linker 6, and Linker 7. For trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma) and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC, Sigma) treatments, the pL1.3K/687 plasmid was transiently co-transfected either with vector pJ6 or with PU.1 plasmid into NMB cells, and 24 h after the co-transfection the cells were treated with indicated amounts of either TSA or 5-Aza-dC. Luciferase activities were analyzed after 24 h of treatment. Yeast One-hybrid Screening for cDNAs Encoding Negative Regulatory DNA-binding Proteins—The MATCHMAKER one-hybrid system (Clontech) was used according to the supplier's protocol. The following yeast one-hybrid screening was carried out as described in our recent paper (29Hwang C.K. Wu X. Wang G. Kim C.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3742-3750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Four tandem repeats of the –731 to –687-bp sequence (containing the negative regulatory 34-bp cis-acting element) of the mouse MOR distal promoter were ligated into the EcoRI-XbaI site of pHISi and EcoRI-XhoI site of pLacZi to generate pHISi-4xNM and pLacZi-4xNM, respectively (NM, negative modulator, denotes the sequence between –731 and –681). These two bait constructs were then linearized with XhoI and NcoI, respectively, and integrated into the genome of yeast strain YM4271. The resultant yeast cells with the integrated pHISi-4xNM were tested for growth on yeast growth medium lacking histidine (His–) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Background growth was inhibited in the presence of 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and this concentration was then used when yeast cells were transformed with a mouse brain cDNA library for one-hybrid screening. Five positive transformants grown on His– plates were selected. To exclude false positive clones, plasmids recovered from these five clones were used to transform yeast cells harboring the pLacZi-4xNM construct. Positive transformants grown on His- and leucine-negative (Leu–) medium containing 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were streaked onto a nylon filter and incubated by placing the filter on the same medium at 30 °C for 2 days. The filter was then soaked in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and placed on a Whatman Whatman No. 3MM filter that had been presoaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 60 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), containing 0.01% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Plasmids from five positive blue clones were sequenced, and their homology was analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Supershift Assay— Nuclear extracts from mouse brain and RAW264.7 cells were prepared using a modification of Dignam's procedure (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar, 31Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The upper and lower strands of each probe were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were then end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The end-labeled DNA probes were incubated with nuclear extracts or 2 μl of in vitro translated products in a final volume of 20 μl of EMSA buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 30 min. For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitor oligonucleotide was added to the mixture before adding the probe. For supershift assay, samples were incubated with 1 μl of each antibody for 30 min before adding the probe. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. Polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-neuron-restrictive silencer factor, anti-PU.1 (T-21, C-terminal epitope), and anti-PU.1 (D-19, N-terminal epitope) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) antibody was purchased from GeneTax, Inc. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—RAW264.7 and C6 cells were used for ChIP assays. ChIPs were performed by using a modified protocol from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cells in a 10-cm dish (70% confluent) were treated for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. The cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), and the nuclei were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). The lysate was sonicated under conditions yielding fragments ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. One-tenth diluted lysate was used for input, and the residual lysate was subjected to the following immunoprecipitation. Samples were subsequently precleared at 4 °C with recombinant protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) coated with salmon sperm DNA. Precleared lysate (100 μl) diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) was used for overnight immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of each antibody at 4 °C. Complexes were collected for 4 h by using recombinant protein A-agarose beads coated in salmon-sperm DNA. After washing and elution, formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed with 6 h incubation at 65 °C. After the reverse cross-linking step, DNA was precipitated after phenol/chloroform extraction and dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR reactions contained 4 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin sample with the following primers spanning either the rat or mouse MOR distal promoter region in 25 μl of total volume. Mouse MOR D2S and D4AS primers (produces a 245-bp PCR DNA): D2S forward, 5′-GCACATGAAACAGGCTTCTTTCAC-3′, and D4AS reverse, 5′-CCCTTATACCTCAACACTCTTCCG-3′; D7S and D7AS primers (produce 142-bp PCR DNA size): D7S forward, 5′-GCTTCTTTCACAAAAATTT-3′, and D7AS reverse, 5′-CCATATCTGAGGGAAAAC-3′. Rat MOR primers, same as above for D2S; for rD8AS (produces a 208-bp PCR DNA): rD8AS reverse, 5′-ATACTTAAACACTCTTCCGACTCA-3′ was used. After 35 cycles of amplification, 8 μl of PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. PU.1 Knock-out Mice and RT-PCR Experiments—The generation of PU.1 null mice has been reported previously (32McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The mice brain samples were obtained from the mid- and hindbrain of the animals. The brains were homogenized in 1 ml of RNA-Bee (TEL-TEST Inc.) with a Dounce homogenizer. All samples were placed immediately on dry ice and stored at –80 °C until used. Total RNA was isolated according to the supplier's protocol (TEL-TEST Inc.). The following cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The MOR primers for RT-PCR were used as follows; D2S forward (see the above primer) and P1AS reverse, 5′-CATCCCCAAAGCGCCACTCTCTGAG-3′, generating a 547-bp PCR product with PCR 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. This PCR was performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences PCR machine 9600. A similar reaction was carried out using primers for β-actin (33Chen H.C. Loh H.H. Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) as an internal control, except the number of cycles was reduced to 25. The resulting PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The DNA sequences of PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Quantitative analyses were carried out using ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences) software. Small Interfering RNA-based (siRNA) Experiments—siRNA strategy (34Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was employed to silence the endogenous PU.1 in RAW264.7 cells for the MOR gene regulation. PU.1 and scrambled siRNAs were generated using Donze's procedure (34Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Promega). Briefly, the siRNA sequences for PU.1 and primers were chosen using the web-based tool siRNA Target Designer from Promega. The primers are: PU.1 si-SS sense (nucleotides 70–88 relative to the start codon), 5′-AAGTTGGTATAGCTCTGAATCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATCC-3′, and PU.1 si-AS, antisense 5′-AAGATTCAGAGCTATACCAACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATCC-3′. The target sequences for PU.1 gene are underlined, and the remaining 3′ regions of each primer are the corresponding T7 promoter sequences. T7 si primer, 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′, was synthesized, and scrambled primers (sense and antisense) as negative siRNA control were also synthesized. The oligonucleotide-directed production of small RNA transcripts with T7 RNA polymerase, previously described (35Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) (34Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), was carried out using T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Promega). Sense and antisense 21-nucleotide RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions, incubating at 70 °C for 10 min, followed by 20 min at room temperature to obtain small interfering double-stranded RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. The mixture was then purified by isopropanol precipitation followed by 70% ethanol washing, dried, and resuspended in appropriate amount of nuclease-free water. The concentration of siRNAs was optimized to 2.5 μg in each transfection for RAW264.7 cells using RNAiFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, total RNA and protein samples were prepared using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). RT-PCR was performed to determine MOR expression at the mRNA level using the same PCR conditions as in “PU.1 Knock-out Mice and RT-PCR Experiments” under “Experimental Procedures.” For Western blotting, equal amounts of total proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Immobilon™-P (polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Millipore) membrane. The proteins were detected either with anti-PU.1 (T-21) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) and anti-MOR (generated from our laboratory) antibodies using ECF™ substrate (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was scanned using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics). Isolation of Transcription Factors That Interact with the Negative 34-bp Cis-acting Element Region in the MOR Distal Promoter—Studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of MOR is driven by two promoters, distal and proximal (22Min B.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have found that a 34-bp cis-acting element in the 5′-distal promoter regulatory sequence possesses a strong inhibitory effect against the distal promoter transcriptional function. To determine whether this negative cis-acting element could recruit transcriptional factors to regulate the promoter activity, EMSA experiments were carried out using nuclear extracts from mouse brain. A double-stranded oligonucleotide, SL-1 (see Fig. 2A), was prepared spanning the region from –731 to –681 of the MOR promoter, covering the region of the 34-bp-cis-acting element (–721 to –687) with the flanking sequences on both ends. The SL-1 sequence, containing the negative cis-acting element, could form sequence-specific DNA-protein complexes with the nuclear extracts of mouse brain (data not shown), suggesting the presence of endogenous transcription factors in brain. To identify transcription factors that bind to the negative element of the distal promoter, we utilized the yeast one-hybrid system to screen an adult mouse brain GAL4-AD fusion cDNA library (Fig. 1, A and B). The following yeast one-hybrid procedures are very similar to what we had done in our previous paper (29Hwang C.K. Wu X. Wang G. Kim C.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3742-3750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as described below. The SL-1 sequence (Fig. 2A) was used as bait, because it contains additional flanking sequences along with the 34-bp cis-acting element that could be important for transcription factor binding affinity. A double-stranded oligonucleotide having four tandem repeats of the SL-1 sequence was subcloned into pHISi. The resulting plasmid pHISi-4xNM was integrated into the yeast YM4271 genome. Using this yeast strain, 6 × 106 independent colonies from the library were screened. A total of five independent clones (histidine-positive clones) were selected (Fig. 1, A and B) and sequenced. The results revealed that one of the clones is identical to a PU.1 transcription factor. Some of the other positive (His+ and LacZ+) clones have been identified as COUP-TFII (36Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), NGFI-B (37Milbrandt J.

To exclude the possibility that this SL-1 element may form some specific sequences with the minimal HIS3 promoter that favor binding of the PU.1 protein, we used another reporter (LacZ) yeast strain containing the pLacZi-4xNM construct. We also used a control yeast strain without repeats of the cis-acting elements but with pLacZi integrated into its genome. The cloned PU.1 plasmid was transformed into these yeast strains individually. The PU.1 clone in yeast strains containing pLacZi-4xNM was found to be a true positive after the LacZ expression test. In control yeast strains containing pLacZi transformed with PU.1 plasmid, there was no activat"
https://openalex.org/W2045598335,"The aims of the present study were to determine the effects and mechanisms of angiotensin II (Ang II) on leukocyte-endothelium interactions and the role of Ang II in a novel model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in the mouse colon. Ang II dose-dependently increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion in colonic venules. Importantly, Ang II-induced leukocyte rolling was completely inhibited by immunoneutralization of P-selectin, and leukocyte adhesion was abolished in lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1)-deficient mice. The P-selectin-dependent rolling was found to be a precondition for the subsequent LFA-1-dependent leukocyte adhesion. Moreover, Ang II-induced leukocyte responses involved generation of reactive oxygen species and up-regulation of CXC chemokines. Notably, CXC chemokines, but not Ang II, stimulated leukocyte chemotaxis in vitro. I/R increased gene expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the colon and plasma concentrations of Ang II. Inhibition of ACE and the type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptor significantly decreased the I/R-induced leukocyte adhesion. Taken together, these novel findings demonstrate that Ang II exerts potent pro-inflammatory effects in the colonic microcirculation and that inhibition of Ang II expression or function protects against I/R-induced leukocyte responses in the colon. Thus, it is suggested that Ang II is a major target to control pathological inflammation in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2118151975,"Ahnak, a 700 kDa protein, is expressed in a variety of cells and has been implicated in different cell-type-specific functions. In the human heart, we observed an endogenous carboxyl-terminal 72 kDa ahnak fragment that copurified with myofibrillar proteins. Immunocytochemistry combined with confocal microscopy localized this fragment to the intercalated discs and close to the Z-line of cardiomyocytes. No endogenous myofibrillar ahnak fragment was observed in the skeletal muscle. We elucidated the role of the recombinant carboxyl-terminal ahnak fragment (ahnak-C2) in actin filament organization and in the function of muscle fibers. Addition of ahnak-C2 to actin filaments induced filament bundling into paracrystalline-like structures as revealed by electron microscopy. Incubation of demembranated skeletal muscle fibers with ahnak-C2 attenuated the decline in isometric force development upon repeated contraction-relaxation cycles. Our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal ahnak domain exerts a stabilizing effect on muscle contractility via its interaction with actin of thin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1997037518,"TruD, a recently discovered novel pseudouridine synthase in Escherichia coli, is responsible for modifying uridine13 in tRNAGlu to pseudouridine. It has little sequence homology with the other 10 pseudouridine synthases in E. coli which themselves have been grouped into four related protein families. Crystal structure determination of TruD revealed a two domain structure consisting of a catalytic domain that differs in sequence but is structurally very similar to the catalytic domain of other pseudouridine synthases and a second large domain (149 amino acids, 43% of total) with a novel α/β fold that up to now has not been found in any other protein. TruD, a recently discovered novel pseudouridine synthase in Escherichia coli, is responsible for modifying uridine13 in tRNAGlu to pseudouridine. It has little sequence homology with the other 10 pseudouridine synthases in E. coli which themselves have been grouped into four related protein families. Crystal structure determination of TruD revealed a two domain structure consisting of a catalytic domain that differs in sequence but is structurally very similar to the catalytic domain of other pseudouridine synthases and a second large domain (149 amino acids, 43% of total) with a novel α/β fold that up to now has not been found in any other protein. The most abundant modification seen in structured RNAs (transfer, ribosomal and splicing RNAs) is the isomerization of uridine (U) to pseudouridine (5-ribosyluracil, Ψ, 1The abbreviations used are: Ψ, pseudouridine; SeMet, selenomethionine; SAD, single wavelength anomalous dispersion; TGT, tRNA guanine transglycosylase; r.m.s.d., root mean squared deviation. Fig. 1A). Ψ is made by a set of enzymes called Ψ synthases, which select specific U residues in a polynucleotide chain for isomerization to Ψ. Ψ synthases are ubiquitous as putative synthase genes have been found in all genomes so far sequenced (1Ofengand J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 17-25Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the Ψ formation activity of 10 putative gene products has been experimentally demonstrated (see references cited in Table II of Ref. 2Del Campo M. Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1603-1615Google Scholar). These Ψ synthases are related by a set of amino acid sequence motifs and can be grouped into four families based on the degree of amino acid sequence homology (3Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Google Scholar, 4Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Google Scholar, 5Ofengand J. Rudd K.E. Garrett R.A.

A fifth family has recently been described whose members have no apparent sequence homology with the others. It was discovered by identifying the E. coli member of this family as an enzyme catalyzing the formation of Ψ13 in tRNAGlu (Fig. 1B) and was named TruD (6Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). Fifty-eight homologs of TruD, distributed among the genomes of Eubacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya were identified (6Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). The function of the homologs is not known except for Pus7p (YOR243c) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which makes Ψ13 in tRNA as well as Ψ35 in U2 snRNA (7Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.-T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1371-1382Google Scholar). Because all of the organisms known to have Ψ13 in their tRNAs also have a TruD homolog, it is reasonable to infer that TruD homologs in those organisms with tRNA Ψ13 are the responsible synthases. This need not, however, rule out synthase specificity for other sites in homologs which lack tRNA Ψ13. Crystal structures of a member from each of the original four families of Ψ synthases have revealed a striking correspondence of both overall structure and of certain conserved amino acids in the catalytic module, including an aspartate residue at the active site (8Foster P.G. Huang L. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 23-27Google Scholar, 9Hoang C. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar, 10Sivaraman J. Sauvé V. Larocque R. Stura E.A.

This raises the question of how the catalytic center of TruD is organized, since there is virtually no amino acid sequence homology, despite the presence of an essential aspartate residue (6Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). In this work, we report the crystal structure of TruD to a resolution of 2.2 angstroms. TruD folds into a V-shaped molecule with two distinct modules. One (57% of the total amino acids) closely resembles the catalytic module of the previously determined Ψ synthases despite the lack of amino acid sequence similarity. The other module (43%) lacks any similarity in either sequence or structure to known protein domains but is conserved in all TruD homologs. This domain, which we term the TRUD domain, appears to be a novel RNA binding domain. The truD gene was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen Inc.) as described previously (6Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). Native and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled TruD protein were expressed and purified essentially as described for RluD (14Del Campo M. Ofengand J. Malhotra A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1871-1873Google Scholar). After purification, TruD was concentrated to 20 mg ml–1 by Amicon Ultra centrifugation (Millipore Inc.). Diffraction quality crystals of TruD were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein (from 5 to 10 mg ml–1 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol) and a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, 12–14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The crystals were tetragonal (space group P43) with a single molecule of TruD in the asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a single flash-frozen SeMet TruD crystal and a single flash-frozen native TruD crystal at the X12-C beamline, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Details of data collection and refinement are presented in Table I (in Supplementary Materials). Diffraction data were processed using HKL (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar), and initial phases were determined for a SeMet derivative by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) in SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar). SOLVE located three of the five expected selenium sites using SAD data to 2.2 Å and generated an initial electron density map with an overall figure of merit of 0.29. This map was improved to a figure of merit of 0.61 using density modification and solvent flattening in RESOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Google Scholar). The automated model building function of RESOLVE placed ∼65% of the TruD model into the electron density, and the model was extended by several rounds of model building and refinement in O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) and CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), respectively. Using this model, the structure of native TruD was solved by molecular replacement in CNS followed by subsequent rounds of model building and refinement as above. The N-terminal polyhistidine tag and nine amino acids at the C terminus were not observed in the electron density and could not be modeled. The final model (R = 0.21, Rfree = 0.25) contains residues 1–340 and 240 water molecules in the asymmetric unit, and 88.4% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot with no residues in the disallowed region. Model quality was monitored using PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.V. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and the MOLPROBITY web tool (21Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I.W. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 50: 437-450Google Scholar). TruD folds into a V-shaped molecule with two domains: a catalytic domain and a TRUD domain linked together by three extended loops (Fig. 2, A and B). The catalytic domain adopts a mixed α/β fold characteristic of Ψ synthases from the four other families. The TRUD domain (residues 155–303) forms a compact fold that is tilted away from the catalytic domain to form a deep cleft in TruD which is lined with basic residues from each domain (Fig. 2C). Several conserved basic residues extend down and out from this cleft to provide an elongated positively charged surface that is similar in length to the longer anticodon arm of a typical L-shaped tRNA. The deep end of this cleft, which likely defines the tRNA binding site for TruD, leads to the putative catalytic aspartate (Asp80; Ref. 6Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). The N-terminal end of TruD (residues 1–25) forms a long extended loop (loop L1) that wraps around both the TRUD and catalytic domains (Fig. 2A), before plunging into the middle of a seven strand β sheet consisting of two anti-parallel sheets (β10-β11-β5-β1; β3-β2-β4). Another extended loop (L9; residues 154–161) leads from the catalytic domain into the TRUD domain. A third loop (L19; 300–306) from the TRUD domain extends back into the catalytic domain and forms one end (β10-β11) of the seven-strand β sheet. Despite the extensive topological connections between the catalytic and TRUD domains, the interface between them is not very extensive and covers only about 1100 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area (∼11% of the total solvent accessible surface of TruD). The interaction surface has several gaps and is only about half hydrophobic, which is characteristic of transient non-obligate protein-protein interactions (22Nooren I.M.A. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Google Scholar). The interface between the catalytic and TRUD domains also has several buried well ordered water molecules that can be seen in the electron density. These are indications of a weak interface between the two TruD domains. The fact that the cleft between the catalytic domain and the TRUD domain is too narrow to accommodate the width of a tRNA leads us to propose that the angle between the two domains can vary and that the V shaped TruD undergoes a hinge-like motion. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that there are several highly conserved glycines in the extended loops that connect these two domains. Movement upon binding RNA has been demonstrated for TruB. Comparison of apo and RNA-bound structures of TruB showed that a 29-residue loop reorganizes upon binding a stem-loop RNA (9Hoang C. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar, 23Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). Our structure cannot distinguish between the opening of the cleft as a result of tRNA binding to TruD and triggering this change or the binding of tRNA serving to trap an open form preexisting in equilibrium with the closed form seen in the crystal. TruD may also gain access to U13 by reorganizing the tRNAGlu structure upon binding. Recent co-crystal structures of tRNA guanine transglycosylases (TGTs) with RNA have shown that substantial reorganization of RNA structure can occur without concomitant changes in protein structure. Prokaryotic TGT rearranges the end of a stem-loop RNA to fit its active site, with little change of the enzyme (24Xie W. Liu X. Huang R.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 781-788Google Scholar). Archaeosine TGT (an archaeal enzyme) completely unfolds the D arm of tRNAVal converting the classic l-form tRNA to a “λ-form” to gain access to G15, but the enzyme structure changes little from the tRNA-free form (25Ishitani R. Nureki O. Nameki N. Okada N. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2003; 113: 383-394Google Scholar). Docking of the λ-form tRNA into the cleft of TruD was attempted but too many clashes were found (data not shown). Attempts at docking tRNAGlu from T. thermophilus (26Sekine S. Nureki O. Dubois D.Y. Bernier S. Chênevert R. Lapointe J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 676-688Google Scholar) produced fewer clashes; however, significant unfolding of the D-arm would be required to bring U13 into the catalytic pocket of TruD. Determining the actual mechanism TruD uses to gain access to U13 by co-crystallization with tRNAGlu is under way. How does TruD choose tRNAGlu from all the other tRNAs in the cell? In yeast, the TruD homolog, Pus7p, has been suggested to recognize the sequence motif Pu9(G/C)UNΨAPu15 and that U11 is particularly important (7Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.-T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1371-1382Google Scholar). In E. coli, only tRNAGlu has Ψ13 and only tRNAGly(NCC) has U13. The corresponding sequences are, respectively, 9CGUCΨAG15 and 9CGUAUAA15, both of which have U11 and both differ from the yeast sequence at position 9. Discounting the variation at position 9, since tRNAGlu is a substrate, the failure of tRNAGly(NCC) to be a substrate must be due to some more subtle feature distinguishing the two tRNAs. A DALI (27Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) search revealed that the closest structural neighbors of TruD in the Protein Data Bank are other Ψ synthases. TruA (Z score = 7.8, r.m.s.d. 3.1 Å over 156 Cα atoms) and TruB (Z score = 7.3, r.m.s.d. 3.2 Å over 144 Cα atoms) are the most similar followed by RsuA (Z score = 5.9, r.m.s.d. 2.9 Å over 119 Cα atoms) and RluD (Z score = 3.8, r.m.s.d. 3.1 Å over 105 Cα atoms). An alignment is shown in Fig. 3. The resulting superposition of the backbones of TruA and TruB, two Ψ synthases that also bind tRNAs, with TruD shows that the structural overlap is extensive except for the PUA and the TRUD domains (Fig. 4A). The overlap in the catalytic fold of TruA, TruB, RsuA, and RluD was characterized previously (11Sivaraman J. Iannuzzi P. Cygler M. Matte A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 87-101Google Scholar, 12Del Campo M. Ofengand J. Malhotra A. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 231-239Google Scholar) and can be simply summarized as the sharing of ten elements, six β strands, two α helices, and two loops, in a linear order along the amino acid sequence: β1, β2, α1, L4, β3, β5, β10, β11, L21, α8 (Fig. 2A). The catalytic aspartate always appears in the loop L4. This arrangement is also shared in the TruD family except that the first β strand in TruD corresponds to the last β strand in the other four families (Fig. 3). It is quite interesting that a way has been found to rearrange the linear order of these elements in TruD while keeping the same fold.Fig. 4Comparison of TruD to other Ψ synthases that bind tRNA. A, stereo view of backbone worms of TruD (red), TruA (Protein Data Bank entry 1DJ0; light blue) (8Foster P.G. Huang L. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct.

Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar). The TRUD domain of TruD and the PUA C-terminal RNA binding domain of TruB (32Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 49-55Google Scholar) are indicated. B, superposed side chains (starting at the Cα) from five active site residues in TruD, TruA, and TruB and one additional residue from TruD (Lys21). The N, Cα, Cβ, C, and O atoms of all five residues from TruA and TruB were superposed onto the equivalent five residues of TruD using LSQMAN (33Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1878-1884Google Scholar). The ribbon representation of TruD is shown semitransparent. Color coding is the same as in A. Prepared with PyMOL (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System at.www.pymol.orgDate: 2002Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Five conserved motifs in the TruA, TruB, RsuA, and RluA families of Ψ synthases have been characterized from comparison of the TruA, TruB, RsuA, and RluD structures (12Del Campo M. Ofengand J. Malhotra A. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 231-239Google Scholar). The corresponding structural alignment of TruD shows that it also contains these five motifs (Fig. 3). The major difference is that motif IIIa appears first in TruD. Residues from four motifs come together in the largely hydrophobic active sites of the TruA, TruB, RsuA, and RluD Ψ synthases (12Del Campo M. Ofengand J. Malhotra A. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 231-239Google Scholar). The essential catalytic Asp (motif II), a basic residue (usually Arg or Lys) that forms a salt bridge to the Asp (motif III), a tyrosine that provides stacking interactions with the uracil of the substrate uridine (motif IIa) (9Hoang C. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar, 23Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar), and two hydrophobic residues (an Ile or Val from motif III and a Leu from motif IIIa). In TruD, the Asp80 from motif II has been conserved, but its salt bridge partner is no longer a conserved basic residue from motif III because Thr331 occupies this location (Fig. 4B). Instead, Lys21 from loop 1 is the salt bridge partner of Asp80. Phe131 replaces Tyr from motif IIa, but a Phe could serve the same stacking function as the Tyr. Leu from motif IIIa has been replaced by the bulkier hydrophobic side chain Phe27, and a smaller hydrophobic residue, Ala330, has replaced the hydrophobic Ile or Val from motif III. The TRUD domain folds into a novel three-dimensional protein fold that is not found in any other protein. A DALI (27Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) search with either the entire TruD structure or only the TRUD domain alone did not find any structural homologs of the TRUD domain in the Protein Data Bank. Moreover, a search of the non-redundant sequence databases with PSI-BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) found that the protein sequence of the TRUD domain is always associated with a TruD-type catalytic domain and that it is not found on its own or attached to another type of protein as a separate module. Furthermore, there are no TruD-type catalytic domains that lack the TRUD domain insert. Although we found no known putative sequence in any other protein significantly similar to the TRUD domain, it is always possible that one will be found in a new genome or that this fold will be present in a different (as of yet unsolved) protein structure without sequence conservation. The TRUD domain is characterized by two conserved sequence motifs (motifs IV and V in Ref. 6Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). The first of these motifs (IV; residues 155–169 in Fig. 3) forms a long extended loop starting at the bottom of the inter-domain interface and extends up to form part of the cleft that likely binds tRNA. This motif has several conserved glycines as well as two aromatic side chains (Tyr159, Phe160) that form a part of the hydrophobic core of the TRUD domain. Arg164 and Phe165 in this motif are solvent exposed side chains that extend out of the TruD cleft and would likely be involved in tRNA binding. Gln163 is also solvent exposed but forms a weak salt bridge with the putative catalytic Asp80 in our structure. The second sequence motif (V, residues 196–211 in Fig. 3) lies along a long helix α4 that extends all along the length of the TRUD domain. Many of the conserved residues in this motif contribute to the hydrophobic core of the TRUD domain. Arg210 in this motif forms a salt bridge to the highly conserved Asp223. The TRUD domain sequence in the TruD family is also characterized by large insertions at several specific sites that are seen in many archaeal and eukaryotic homologs (marked by solid triangles in Fig. 3). These inserts all map to solvent exposed loops that face away from the TruD cleft and putative tRNA binding surface (Fig. 2B). In summary, TruD folds into a V-shaped molecule with a catalytic domain that is structurally very similar to the catalytic modules of the other known Ψ synthases despite its lack of sequence homology and likely arose by divergent evolution. In addition, TruD has acquired a large separate domain which is likely to be involved in substrate recognition. This domain has a unique fold that is not present in the Protein Data Bank and may represent a new RNA binding module.

Appropriately selective protein kinase inhibitors are sought after as research tools and as therapeutic drugs; several have already proven valuable in clinical use. The AGC subfamily protein kinase C (PKC) was identified early as a cause of cancer, leading to the discovery of a variety of PKC inhibitors. Despite its importance and early discovery, no crystal structure for PKC has yet been reported. Therefore, we have co-crystallized PKC inhibitor bisindolyl maleimide 2 (BIM2) with PKA variants to study its binding interactions. BIM2 co-crystallized as an asymmetric pair of kinase-inhibitor complexes. In this asymmetric unit, the two kinase domains have different lobe configurations, and two different inhibitor conformers bind in different orientations. One kinase molecule (A) is partially open with respect to the catalytic conformation, the other (B) represents the most open conformation of PKA reported so far. In monomer A, the BIM2 inhibitor binds tightly via an induced fit in the ATP pocket. The indole moieties are rotated out of the plane with respect to the chemically related but planar inhibitor staurosporine. In molecule B a different conformer of BIM2 binds in a reversed orientation relative to the equivalent maleimide atoms in molecule A. Also, a critical active site salt bridge is disrupted, usually indicating the induction of an inactive conformation. Molecular modeling of the clinical phase III PKC inhibitor LY333531 into the electron density of BIM2 reveals the probable binding mechanism and explains selectivity properties of the inhibitor.

Deregulated protein kinase activity causes a wide variety of human diseases, usually by producing an overactive kinase. This is consistent with the fact that most protein kinases in the cell are inactivated most of the time to ensure the integrity of signal transduction. Thus, the many diseases that are correlated with protein kinase deregulation, including the majority of all cancers, usually arise from mutations or other events that activate kinases, cause their overexpression, or disable their intracellular inhibition. The prevalence of kinase deregulation in disease clearly demonstrates the need for therapeutic protein kinase inhibitors, whereas the ubiquity and variety of protein kinases (collectively, the “kinome”) necessitate precise target selectivity. Despite this seeming difficulty, several protein kinase inhibitors have been approved for human treatment or are in advanced clinical trials. Crystal structure analyses of protein kinase inhibitor complexes reveal the intermolecular interactions responsible for ligand binding, and have thereby enabled structure-based rational design and optimization of kinase inhibitors. To date, crystal structures have been determined for some 30 protein kinases, representing some 6% of the 518 protein kinases in the human genome (1Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). Many of these structures have been complexes with protein kinase inhibitors, but most have shown an inactivated state often incompatible with inhibitor binding. Inactivity is associated most often with displacements of helix C, the major α helix of the kinase N-lobe, with concomitant disruption of the active site salt bridge in the active site between a conserved lysine residue and a conserved glutamate located in the middle of helix C. Similarly often, the activation loop shows unproductive conformations, either blocking the active site, or locking helix C into an inactive conformation, or causing other structural states of the kinase incompatible with kinase activity. Often, these structures are “open” with respect to the “closed” conformation of kinases in catalytic conformations. In more than half of all protein kinase structures inactivity is associated with a steric block in the ATP-binding site (2Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Despite the variations in sequence, the fold of the active protein kinase catalytic domain is well conserved. Inactivated protein kinase structures differ more, but cluster into protein kinase subfamilies that reflect different inactivation mechanisms. As a consequence of the conservation of the active structure, many properties can be analyzed with respect to relatively few sequence positions that define that property. A centrally important example of such a property is the selectivity of binding at the ATP binding pocket. Protein kinases share a common bi-lobal catalytic domain structure that forms the ATP-binding site at the lobal interface. ATP binds at this interface via interactions with some 15 residues of the protein, including about 10 side chain interactions that therefore are especially important as potential determinants of ATP site inhibitor selectivity. Thus, the essential binding properties of ATP and other ATP site ligands can in many cases be simulated for a particular protein kinase target by a limited set of point mutations of a closely related protein kinase. The construction of such hybrids has been demonstrated for kinases (5Fox T. Coll J.T. Xie X.L. Ford P.J. Germann U.A. Porter M.D. Pazhanisamy S. Fleming M.A. Galullo V. Su M.S. Wilson K.P.

Even though subtle differences in structure or flexibility can lead to quite different overall reaction kinetics, for practical ligand design purposes, most or all protein-ligand interactions will be revealed or can be modeled using the surrogate kinase approach. That a single residue can be identified as the principal selectivity determinant for an inhibitor type by mutation of a series of kinases verifies this approach (8Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L.

Huber R. Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 2003; 11: 1595-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The complexes with staurosporine, balanol, and Fasudil are in partially open conformations, in contrast to the other inhibitor/substrate-PKA complexes that are in closed conformations. In these three structures the hydrogen bond between the activation loop Thr197 phosphoryl group and His87 from helix C of the N-lobe is not formed as a result of the partial opening of the cleft via rotation of the N-lobe with respect to the C-lobe. Mutants of PKA have also been designed to improve its value as surrogate kinase for PKB inhibitors (7Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because of its close relationship to PKC and its well established crystallization conditions, PKA is currently also the best model system for studying PKC inhibitors. So far, co-crystallization attempts with PKA and the flexible bisindolyl maleimide (BIM) cognates of staurosporine, described as PKC inhibitors (13Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P.

However, the triple mutant V123A,L173M,Q181K of PKAα (PKAB3), originally designed as a model for PKB (7Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), has formed high quality crystals of a BIM inhibitor complex. A sequence alignment of PKAα and PKBα with PKC isoforms (Table I) shows how the PKAB3 triple mutant is similar to PKA as a surrogate for PKC with the additional ability to model inhibitor-methionine interactions for three conventional PKC isoforms.Table IAmino acids residues of different protein kinases Three distinct subfamilies of PKC isoforms can be defined according to their essential activators: conventional PKCs (α, βI/II, and γ) require phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+; novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) need phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol but not Ca2+; atypical PKCs (ζ and Ι) are insensitive to both diacylglycerol and Ca2+ although phosphatidylserine regulates activity (for reviews, see Refs. 18Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar and 19Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and citations therein). Furthermore, additional lipid mediators, like fatty acids and lysophospholipids, have been shown to influence the catalytic activity of PKCs (reviewed in Ref. 20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). In general, interaction of PKCs with the activators leads to phosphorylation of a threonine residue on the activation loop of all PKC isoforms and additionally of a serine or threonine residue in the hydrophobic motif of the conventional and novel PKCs. The atypical PKCs possess a glutamate at the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation position that intrinsically performs the activation function (for reviews, see Refs. 18Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar and 21Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms are involved in nearly all essential cell processes, PKCα, for example, is involved in regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell migration, adhesion, among other cellular and pathogenic processes (for a review, see Ref. 22Nakashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Despite its early identification and importance in cancer research, no PKC crystal structure has been reported to date. The only available co-crystal structures of PKC inhibitors with a kinase target are those of the relatively unselective staurosporine (IC50, PKC 5 nm (23Meggio F. Deana A.D. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M.

The bisindolyl maleimide class of PKC inhibitors is derived from staurosporine by elimination of a single bond that converts the extended planar aromatic group into the three aromats of the compound names with corresponding additional degrees of flexibility. One PKC inhibitor of this class, LY333531, shows PKC isoform specificity (e.g. 80- and 60-fold selectivity for PKCβ I and PKCβ II over PKCα (29Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Gonzalez C.M. Heath W.F. McDonald III, J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Singh U. Stramm L.E. Melikian-Badalian A. Baevsky M. Ballas L.M. Hall S.E. Winneroski L.L. Faul M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and is in phase III clinical trials for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema (Ref. 30Frank R.N. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 2002; 133: 693-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and citations therein). The effects of the additional flexibility of BIM inhibitors on the structural binding modes, and the means by which this alteration can introduce selectivity to the inhibitor have not been explained. Here we present the crystal structure of bisindolyl maleimide 2 (BIM2) in a complex with the triple mutant V123A,L173M,Q181K (PKAB3) of PKA. By means of this surrogate kinase approach, we identify the key binding modes and can evaluate their significance for PKC. The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure consists of two protein-inhibitor complexes, with different conformations of the two kinase molecules, bound with opposite orientations of different conformers of BIM2. One kinase monomer has an intermediate open state like in the staurosporine structure; the other is in the most open conformation observed for PKA so far. In the open conformation, the whole N-terminal lobe including helix C is rotated by more than 20° compared with the closed form. The active site salt bridge between Lys72 and Glu91 is disrupted, a characteristic of inactive kinase conformations. The two different inhibitor binding modes are enabled by the inherent symmetry of the maleimide moiety and the rotational freedom available to the indole moieties. The similarity of BIM2 and LY333531 (Fig. 1) allows modeling of LY333531-PKC interactions and suggests an explanation for the selectivity properties of the inhibitors. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant mutated bovine Cα catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAB3 (7Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) was solubly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and then purified via affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography as described earlier (9Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Two positions distinguish bovine (Asn32 and Met63) from human PKA (Ser32 and Lys63). 4-Fold phosphorylated protein was used for crystallization of BIM2. Activity Tests—The determination of enzyme activity was accomplished by an ATP regenerative NADH consuming assay according to Ref. 31Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar. After the addition of 0.42 mm MEGA 8 (ensures solubility of the inhibitor) to the assay mixture (100 mm Mops, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mm Kemptide, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 8 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 0.21 mm NADH) we have added the successive Me2SO/inhibitor solution and the enzyme and started the reaction with ATP. The decrease of NADH was measured as time-dependent at λ = 340 nm with three independent measurements per data point. Crystallization—BIM2 were purchased from Calbiochem and co-crystallized with PKAB3 in the presence of PKI(5-24) at 75 mm LiCl, 25 mm Mes/Bistris, pH 6.4. The hanging drop vapor diffusion method against 15% methanol as precipitant was used to obtain a 100 × 100 × 300-μm crystal. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were measured at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) from frozen crystals on a CCD detector (Mar research) at 1.05 Å wavelength. The data were processed with the programs MOSFLM and SCALA. The crystals have orthorhombic symmetry (P212121) with cell constants 82.06, 89.00, and 116.38 in a crystal packing arrangement not previously reported (Table II). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP from the CCP4 program suite. 2www.ccp4.ac.uk/main/html. As starting model we chose a PKA-PKI-(5-24)-staurosporine complex (1STC (10Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 1997; 5: 1627-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Calculation of Matthews coefficient and solvent content suggested two molecules in the asymmetric unit with 52.3% solvent. Indeed, very good monomer rotation and translation function solution was found, enabling determination of a second molecule with an R-factor of 47.5. A first map calculated after rigid body refinement (R-factor 45%) showed that PKI was not present in the complex, despite its presence in crystallization solutions as usual. Furthermore, difference densities in the B molecule showed that large segments of the molecule needed to be remodeled. We deleted the segments (the entire N-terminal lobe up to 123 and the C-terminal residues from 315 onwards) of about 150 amino acids together and calculated new maps. After several circles of model building and refinement the R-factor fell to 28.8% (R-free 33.9%) and most parts of molecule B were replaced. In molecule A only residues 315-350 were omitted and rebuilt. The segment 317-332 (330 for molecule B) remained undefined. Phosphorylation sites were found at Ser139, Thr197, and Ser338. Ser10 is not resolved. Water molecules were automatically inserted using CCP4 programs PEAK-MAX and WATPEAK and visually inspected. Finally, the inhibitor molecules were built and the whole complex was further refined. Refmac 5.1.24 was used for refinement, and MOLOC 3www.moloc.ch. was used for model building and graphical modeling.

In the case of MOLOC, amino acid residues 150-300 were used for superimposition of structures 1STC, 1CTP, 1CMK, and 1J3H and both molecules of the here presented structure on structure 1CDK as basis. The secondary elements were calculated with the program InsightII using the Kabsch-Sander algorithm. The angle determination was performed in the following way. The backbone of each first and last two amino acids of the helices were taken to calculate the center of masses using the gromacs package. 4www.gromacs.org. These center of masses defined the top and bottom of the helix axes. The coordinates of the top and bottom were used to create vectors in the R3 and with cosβ = x·y/|x|·|y| (x and y are the vectors defining the helix axes). The angle between these vectors of two different structures was calculated. Sequence Alignment—Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW. 5www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw. PKAB3 as Model for the PKC-ATP-binding Pocket—The structural and sequence similarities of AGC kinase subgroup members PKA and PKB (Ref. 32Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 1CDK; Ref. 33Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 1O6K) imply a correspondingly similar structure for the kinase domain of PKC. Thus, the clearest determinant of the selectivity of protein kinase inhibitors is the amino acid composition of the catalytic ATP-binding site. It follows that amino acid exchanges in the catalytic site of one kinase can be useful as a surrogate for another kinase, reported, for example, for PKA mutants that mimic PKB (7Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For this study we used the triple mutant PKAB3 (V123A,L173M,Q181K), which was originally constructed to model the adenine-binding site of PKB in PKA. Sequence alignment of PKA, PKB, and PKC shows that one of these mutations, namely L173M (numbering of PKA), introduces a residue that is conserved in PKB and the three classical PKC isoforms α, βI/II, and γ. The other PKC isoforms have, like PKA, a leucine residue in the corresponding position. The second exchange, V123A, does not occur among PKC isoforms, but the important contacts of residue 123 to inhibitors are backbone contacts and presumably relatively unaffected by the side chain. The third exchange, Q181K, was chosen only after observation that the double mutant (V123A,L173M) lead to a new rotamer conformation of the glutamine of PKA that placed the amide group into the ATP binding pocket (7Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This mutation introduces a residue conserved as a lysine among all PKC isoforms. Overall Structure—The triple mutated recombinant catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent PKA and the PKC inhibitor BIM2 formed crystals notably lacking the pseudo-substrate peptide PKI(5-24), although the peptide was present under the standard crystallization conditions. The 4-fold phosphorylated PKA is disordered at the N terminus including the phosphorylation position of (p)Ser10. The region between residues 317 and 332 is also not visible. The corresponding dimer formed the asymmetric unit in an orthorhombic space group P212121 (Table II) with cell constants and a packing arrangement previously unobserved for PKA (a = 82.1, b = 89.0, c = 116.4). This arrangement is apparently induced by BIM2 binding and arises from the two new N- and C-domain conformations of PKA in the crystal. One of the PKA complexes of the asymmetric unit (molecule A) is in an intermediate open conformation, similar to that observed for the PKA complex with staurosporine (1STC (10Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 1997; 5: 1627-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)) and also HA-1077 (1Q8W (12Breitenlechner C.B. Gaßel M.

The inhibitors in both molecules A and B occupy the ATP-binding site, but different conformations of the inhibitor bind with different orientations in the two molecules (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Superposition of structures 1CDK, BIM2MolA, and BIM2MolB. Superposition of 1CDK (gray), BIM2MolA (red), and BIM2MolB (blue) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Many different relative N- and C-lobe orientations have been observed for PKA. One measure to identify the closed conformations is the existence of an H-bond between the imidazole of His87 from helix C and the phosphoryl group of Thr197 from the activation loop. Structures for which this His87-(p)Thr197 contact is broken because of the opening movement of the N-lobe exhibit a variety of open conformations (Fig. 2). The hinging movements of PKA that cause the opening occur primarily within the dipeptide segment of Gly125 and Gly126 positioned between the ATP binding residues and helix D, as defined originally by Olah and co-workers (34Olah G.A. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T.R. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rotations of helix C can be taken as a measure of the opening of PKA structures, and ranks structures from the most closed in structure 1CDK through other open conformations of PKA such as staurosporine bound (1STC (10Prade L.

https://openalex.org/W2171257727,"Signaling molecules that bind to chemokine receptors should play key roles in regulation of cell migration induced by chemokines. To characterize the CCR1-mediated cellular signal transduction mechanism, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify a cellular ligand for CCR1. LZIP, which has been known as a transcription factor in various cell types, was identified as a CCR1 binding protein. Although the ability of LZIP to bind DNA is possibly what allows it to function as a transcription factor, its detailed function and participation in chemotaxis have not been established. We found that LZIP binds to CCR1 based on results of a mammalian two-hybrid assay and immunoprecipitation experiments. The 21-260 residues of LZIP were essential for interaction with CCR1. Results from a chemotaxis assay using LZIP transfected cells showed that LZIP enhanced Lkn-1-induced chemotaxis, whereas the chemotactic activities induced by other CC chemokines that bind to CCR1, including MIP-1alpha, RANTES, or HCC-4, were not affected by LZIP overexpression. These data indicate that LZIP binds to CCR1 and that the interaction between CCR1 and LZIP participates in regulation of Lkn-1-dependent cell migration without affecting the chemotactic activities of other CC chemokines that bind to CCR1."
https://openalex.org/W2159184608,"Bradykinin (BK), a vasoactive, proinflammatory nonapeptide, promotes cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression, leukocyte sequestration, inter-endothelial gap formation, and protein extravasation in postcapillary venules. These effects are mediated by bradykinin-1 (B1R) and-2 (B2R) receptors. We delineated some of the mechanisms by which BK could influence chronic inflammation by altering CAM expression on leukocytes, endothelium, and synovium in joint sections of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-injected Lewis rats. Blocking B1R results in significantly increased joint inflammation. Immunohistochemistry of the B1R antagonist group revealed increased leukocyte and synovial CD11b and CD54 expression and increased CD11b and CD44 endothelial expression. B2R antagonism decreased leukocyte and synovial CD44 and CD54 and endothelial CD11b expression. Although these findings implicate B2R involvement in the acute phase of inflammation by facilitating leukocyte activation (CD11b), homing (CD44), and transmigration (CD54). Treatment with a B2R antagonist did not affect the disease evolution in this model. In contrast, when both BK receptors are blocked, the aggravation of inflammation by B1R blockade is neutralized and there is no difference from the disease-untreated model. Our findings suggest that B1R and B2R signaling show physiologic antagonism. B1R signaling suggests involvement in down-regulation of leukocyte activation, transmigration, and homing. Further studies are needed to evaluate the B1 receptor agonist's role in this model."

To understand how APs might impact disease progression in otitis media (OM), our goal was to identify and characterize APs expressed by the epithelium lining the uppermost airway of the chinchilla, the established rodent host for the study of the bacterial-viral pathogenesis in OM. Using a molecular approach, we cloned a cDNA encoding a homolog of human β-defensin 3, designated chinchilla β-defensin-1 (cBD-1), and found by Northern analysis expression of the corresponding mRNA in nasopharyngeal and tongue mucosae as well as skin. By reverse transcription-PCR, cBD-1 mRNA was also detected in RNA isolated from trachea, lung, and Eustachian tube tissues. The predicted mature form of cBD-1, expressed as a recombinant peptide in Escherichia coli, demonstrated bactericidal activity against the three primary opportunistic pathogens of OM as well as Candida albicans. Continued study of this and other APs will allow us to determine their role in bacterial colonization of the upper airway as well as how viruses might contribute to the pathogenesis of OM by modulating AP expression.

Brogden K.A. Guthmiller J.M. Polymicrobial Diseases. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 259-298Google Scholar, 2Faden H. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2001; 160: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The most common sequela of OM is conductive hearing loss accompanied by delays in language, behavioral, and cognitive development. Streptococcus pneuomoniae, nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae (NTHI), and Moraxella catarrhalis are responsible for the majority of bacterial OM. These bacteria colonize the nasopharynx (NP) soon after birth and are typically carried asymptomatically, thereby constituting members of the normal nasopharyngeal flora. During an upper respiratory tract infection (most often viral), the defensive functions of the Eustachian tube (ET) are compromised, and the load of bacterial pathogens in the NP increases significantly (3Faden H. Waz M.J. Bernstein J.M. Brodsky L. Stanievich J. Ogra P.L. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 1991; 100: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Faden H. Stanievich J. Brodsky L. Bernstein J. Ogra P.L. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1990; 9: 623-626PubMed Google Scholar), thus facilitating sequential ascension of the ET and invasion of the middle ear cavity. Retrograde ascension of bacteria into the middle ear is ordinarily prevented, in part, by innate host defenses at this site. These defenses include the mucociliary action of the ET epithelium, which moves debris away from the middle ear cavity and into the oropharynx for swallowing, as well as the activity of several antimicrobial components such as surfactants, complement, preexisting secretory IgA, lysozyme, and lactoferrin (2Faden H. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2001; 160: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Lim D.J. Chun Y.M. Lee H.Y. Moon S.K. Chang K.H. Li J.D. Andalibi A.

One class of antimicrobial peptides (APs), the β-defensins, are of special interest, since they are implicated in defending the mucosal barrier against colonization and/or invasion by pathogens. β-defensins are small (3–5 kDa) cysteine-rich, highly cationic peptides produced by various epithelia with broad spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses in vitro (7Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6798) Google Scholar). Of the four human β-defensins (hBD) that have been characterized to date, only expression of hBD-1 and hBD-2 have been investigated in the upper airway. hBD-1 is constitutively expressed in normal and inflamed nasal and middle ear mucosae, whereas hBD-2 is expressed only in inflamed tissues (8Lee S.H. Kim J.E. Lim H.H. Lee H.M. Choi J.O. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 2002; 111: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Lee H.Y. Andalibi A. Webster P. Moon S.K. Nagura M. Kang S.H. Teufert K. Lim D.J. Santi P.A. Twenty-Fifth Annual Midwinter Research Meeting, Association for Research in Otolaryngology. Association for Research in Otolaryngology, Mt. Royal, NJ2002: 223Google Scholar). Additionally, inducible hBD-2 expression was demonstrated in both a human middle ear epithelial cell line and in primary nasal epithelial cells in response to proin-flammatory cytokines or bacterial components, a common feature of hBD-2 expression in multiple in vitro systems (10Moon S.K. Lee H.Y. Li J.D. Nagura M. Kang S.H. Chun Y.M. Linthicum F.H. Ganz T. Andalibi A. Lim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1590: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The detection of these defensins in nasal and middle ear mucosae suggests a role for these peptides in maintaining the health of the uppermost airway and thus perhaps preventing OM. Experimental OM is currently modeled in the chinchilla for several reasons (1Bakaletz L.O. Brogden K.A. Guthmiller J.M. Polymicrobial Diseases. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 259-298Google Scholar, 11Giebink G.S. Microb. Drug Resist. 1999; 5: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The chinchilla ET is semipatulous, similar to the “floppy” ETs of a human child. The animals possess a large accessible cephalid bulla, thereby permitting serial recovery of middle ear fluids without compromising the integrity of the tympanic membrane. Chinchillas do not develop OM naturally, yet they can be colonized and/or infected with many of the human viral and bacterial pathogens associated with OM (1Bakaletz L.O. Brogden K.A. Guthmiller J.M. Polymicrobial Diseases. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 259-298Google Scholar). In order to dissect the role APs may play during the pathogenesis of OM, we sought to identify and characterize those peptides expressed in the uppermost airway of this chinchilla host. This work describes cloning of a cDNA encoding a chinchilla β-defensin, expression of the transcript in the uppermost airway, and the antimicrobial activity of the defensin in vitro. Animals—Healthy adult chinchillas (∼500–700 g) were purchased from Rauscher's Chinchilla Ranch (LaRue, OH) and fed chinchilla chow (Cincinnati Lab Supplies, Cincinnati, OH) and water ad libitum. The animals were free of middle ear disease as evidenced by otoscopy and tympanometry. For recovery of normal airway and other tissues, animals were deeply anesthetized with xylazine (2 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and ketamine (10 mg/kg, Phoenix Scientific Inc., St. Joseph, MO), exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, and sacrificed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (The Butler Co., Columbus, OH). Tissues of interest were then dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until needed. Antimicrobial Assays—For microbicidal assays, E. coli strain ML35, NTHI strains 86-028NP and 1128, M. catarrhalis strain 1857, Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 14), and Candida albicans were cultured to midlog phase. NTHI 86-028NP and 1128 were cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with 2 μg of NAD/ml (Sigma) and 2 μg of hemin/ml (Sigma) (sBHI) or on chocolate agar. M. catarrhalis 1857 and S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) were cultured in BHI. C. albicans was grown in YPD broth or on YPD agar. Static cultures of NTHI, S. pneumoniae, and E. coli were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, whereas M. catarrhalis and C. albicans broth cultures were incubated at 37 °C in air with shaking (200 rpm). E. coli ML35 is a standard strain for used to assay microbicidal activity, since it expresses a mutated form of lipopolysaccharide that renders it highly sensitive to the action of APs (12Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown in LB broth or on LB agar. Various concentrations of recombinant cBD-1 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with 1 × 104 microorganisms in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing either 1% sBHI for S. pneumoniae, NTHI, and M. catarrhalis or 1% YPD for C. albicans. Bacteria and yeast were serially diluted and plated onto chocolate agar and YPD agar, respectively, and the colony-forming units of surviving microorganisms per ml was determined following overnight incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Data from a minimum of three replicate assays per strain are presented as mean percentage of survival ± S.D. relative to concentration of recombinant cBD-1 ((r)cBD-1). Cloning of cBD-1 cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from chinchilla tongue and trachea as described (13Tarver A.P. Clark D.P. Diamond G. Russell J.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cohen K.S. Jones D.E. Sweeney R.W. Wines M. Hwang S. Bevins C.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from these RNA samples using a modified oligo(dT) primer, (Table I; Marathon cDNA synthesis primer, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), according to the supplier's recommended modification of published methods (13Tarver A.P. Clark D.P. Diamond G. Russell J.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cohen K.S. Jones D.E. Sweeney R.W. Wines M. Hwang S. Bevins C.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA product was used as a template in PCR (30 cycles, 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min) with 0.2 μm each of oligonucleotide primers, MBD-84s, and the Clontech anchor primer, AP1 (Table I). The sequence of primer MBD-84s was derived from common sequences in mouse β-defensins 3 and 4 and rat β-defensin 2 (13Tarver A.P. Clark D.P. Diamond G. Russell J.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cohen K.S. Jones D.E. Sweeney R.W. Wines M. Hwang S. Bevins C.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel, purified using the QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated to pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Ligation reaction products were desalted using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and electroporated into E. coli ElectroMax DH10B (Invitrogen) using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (25 microfarads, 200 ohms, 2.5 V). Transformants were selected on LB agar containing 50 μg of kanamycin/ml and 40 μg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal)/ml. Plasmid DNA from white colonies was isolated using the QIAprep miniprep kit (Qiagen). Plasmid inserts were sequenced by dye terminator chemistry using an Applied Biosystems Model 3100 Genetic Analyzer by the DNA Sequencing Core Facility of the Columbus Children's Research Institute. Resulting sequences were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base using the BLASTX algorithm. A plasmid containing the cBD-1 insert was saved as pCBD1.Table IPrimers and used in this studyNamePrimer sequenceOligo(dT)5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCT18VN-3′m84s5′-GCTTCAGTCATGAGGATCCATT-3′AP15′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′cBD-A5′-CTCCTGTTTGCTGTGCTCTTCTTG-3′cBD-B5′-TATTTCCTTGTTCGGCAGCATTTC-3′JAD15′-CTGGGTACCGACGACGACGACAAGGGGATCATAAATACAATACA-3′JAD25′-CGCGGATCCTTTATTTCCTTGTTCGGCAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Southern Blot Analysis—Chromosomal DNA was isolated from chinchilla liver using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). As a source of human DNA, A549 lung carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg gentamicin/ml (Invitrogen) and chromosomal DNA isolated as described above. Chinchilla DNA was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and PstI. Human DNA was digested with HindIII. pCBD1 digested with HindIII served as a positive control (data not shown). The restricted DNA was electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.4 n NaOH using the Turboblotter rapid transfer system (Schleicher & Schuell). The blot was neutralized with 5× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) and 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and air-dried, and the DNA was UV-cross-linked to the membrane. A cBD-1 cDNA probe was generated by randomly labeling the DNA with 32P to a specific activity of ∼109 dpm/μg using the Random Primers DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen). The blot was probed at 65 °C in 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 7% SDS, and 1.5× SSPE (1× SSPE: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 1 mm EDTA). The membrane was washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS (three times, 20 min, 65 °C) and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and the signal was captured using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from chinchilla tissues using the TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen). Thirty μg of RNA was size-fractionated through a 1% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel, blotted to Hybond N+ nylon membrane in 10× SSC as described above, and UV-cross-linked to the membrane. Hybridization was performed in ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech) with random 32P-labeled cBD-1 cDNA probe generated as described above. The blot was first washed with 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS (4×, 10 min, room temperature) and then with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS (2×, 20 min, 50 °C). The signal was captured using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described above from chinchilla tongue, nasopharyngeal mucosa, trachea, lung, ET mucosa, and skin. Contaminating DNA was degraded using the DNA-free DNase treatment and removal kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech) was employed to generate first strand cDNA from total RNA using random hexamers. Two hundred fifty ng of tongue, ET, NP, or skin cDNA or 500 ng of lung or tracheal cDNA served as template in PCR (40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s) with 0.2 μm primers cBD-A and cBD-B (Table I). A set of reactions conducted without RT served as a control for DNA contamination. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred to Hybond N+ in 10× SSC using a Bio-Rad vacuum blotter and probed with cBD-1 cDNA that had been directly labeled with horseradish peroxidase using the Enhance Chemiluminescence labeling and detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was washed with 0.5× SSC and 0.4% SDS (once for 10 min and twice for 5 min, 50 °C), 2× SSC, incubated for 1 min in the ECL substrate, and exposed to x-ray film. Preparation and Purification of Recombinant cBD-1—A 171-bp fragment encoding the predicted mature cBD-1 was amplified by PCR from the pCBD1 clone using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 0.2 μm each of primers JAD1 and JAD2 (Table I). JAD1 encodes an enterokinase cleavage site positioned directly upstream of the first codon in the cBD-1 cDNA. The fragment was gel-purified, digested with KpnI and BamHI, and ligated into similarly digested pET30a (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression of cBD-1. The ligation mixture was desalted and electroporated into E. coli ElectroMax DH10B as described above. Positive clones were identified by gel electrophoresis following digestion with KpnI and BamHI, and the insert in selected clones was verified by sequencing. A plasmid with the correct sequence was saved as pCBD101. Recombinant cBD-1 was expressed as an N-terminal His-tagged fusion peptide in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) transformed with the pCBD101 construct. Bacteria were grown in three 1-liter cultures to an A600 = 0.5–0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in 24 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). The sample was sonicated on ice for 5 min (15-s pulse, 45-s rest) at 15% maximum output using a 550 sonic dismembrator (Fisher) and clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 15 min). His-tagged cBD-1 was batch-purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (NTA) (Novagen). Six milliliters of resin were added to the clarified supernatant and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed twice with 30 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 6.3), and His-tagged cBD-1 was eluted from the resin with 12 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl (pH 4.5). The eluate was concentrated using Centriplus concentrators (Millipore Corp.) and sequentially dialyzed against cold 1% acetic acid and H2O using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce). The sample was treated with 2.5 units of enterokinase/mg of peptide (Novagen) to cleave the His tag from cBD-1. This material was then incubated with 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin for 1 h and applied to an empty chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and the flow-through (containing recombinant cBD-1) was collected. Samples from different stages in the purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant cBD-1 was further purified by weak cationic exchange followed by reverse phase HPLC as described previously, except the peptide was eluted from the weak cation exchange column with a gradient of acetic acid (13Tarver A.P. Clark D.P. Diamond G. Russell J.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cohen K.S. Jones D.E. Sweeney R.W. Wines M. Hwang S. Bevins C.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two sequential fractions containing cBD-1 were pooled, dialyzed against H2O, and tested for microbicidal activity as described above. Protein sequencing was performed as described above. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a Micromass Q-Tof II by the Campus Chemical Instrumentation Center at The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH). In Situ Hybridization—To generate RNA probes for in situ hybridization, cBD-1 cDNA was released from pCBD1 with HindIII, and the overhangs were filled in with Klenow and cloned into SmaI-digested pSPT18 (Roche Applied Science). The plasmid clone, linearized with EcoRI or PstI, served as template for making digoxigenin-labeled sense or antisense cBD-1 probe, respectively, using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Sp6/T7) (Roche Applied Science). Dissected ET was fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (10 μm) were floated onto Superfrost glass slides (Fisher), heat-fixed for 2 h at 60 °C, deparaffinized, and hydrated. Sections were sequentially incubated in PBS (twice for 5 min each), PBS with 100 mm glycine (twice for 5 min each), and PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (15 min). After washing with PBS (twice for 5 min each), sections were treated with 5 μg of proteinase K/ml of PBS for 30 min at 37 °C followed by fixation with cold PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS (twice for 5 min each), and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 100 mm triethanolamine (pH 8.0). The sections were equilibrated in 4× SSC, 50% formamide for 10 min at 37 °C, incubated in hybridization solution (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 4× SSC, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg of yeast tRNA/ml, 1 mg of salmon sperm DNA/ml) containing 150 ng/ml of sense or antisense cBD-1 probe at 55 °C overnight and subsequently washed in 2× SSC (twice for 15 min each, 37 °C), 1× SSC (twice for 15 min each, 37 °C), and 0.1× SSC (twice for 30 min each, 37 °C). After a 10-min incubation in buffer 1 (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5)), the sections were blocked for 30 min with buffer 1 containing 2% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. A 1:500 dilution of the anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) in buffer 1 containing 1% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 was applied to the sections for 2 h. The sections were again washed in buffer 1 (twice for 10 min each) and incubated for 10 min in 100 mm Tris (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2. Hybridized probes were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Promega, Madison, WI), and reactions were stopped with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. The sections were briefly immersed in water, counterstained with fast green FCF (Aldrich), and mounted with Aquamount (Fisher). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axioscope 40 microscope equipped with a digital camera. Cloning of the cDNA for cBD-1—The 5′ portions of defensin cDNAs that encodes the prepro-region of these peptides share considerable nucleotide identity (13Tarver A.P. Clark D.P. Diamond G.

Defensin-specific primers were thereby designed from a consensus of these invariant sequences comprising the 5′-untranslated and proximal coding regions in mouse β-defensins 3 and 4 and rat β-defensin 2 cDNAs. These primers were used in an anchored PCR to amplify related β-defensin cDNAs from chinchilla airway tissues. Thus, total RNA was isolated from chinchilla trachea and tongue and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer containing a 31-nucleotide extension at its 5′-end. The cDNAs were used as templates in a PCR with the defensin-specific primer and an anchor primer corresponding to the 5′ nucleotide extension in the oligo(dT) primer. Fragments in the appropriate size range (300–500 bp) were identified and subsequently cloned and sequenced (data not shown). BLASTX searches of the NCBI databases revealed that the conceptual translation of 52% (29 of 56) of the cDNA clones (Fig. 1A) from chinchilla trachea and tongue shared a sequence that was 77% identical to the unprocessed hBD-3 peptide (14Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). As such, the term “chinchilla β-defensin one” (cBD-1) was coined. The conceptual translation of the cBD-1 cDNA was also 59 and 68% identical to the translated sequence of murine β-defensin 14 (15Schutte B.C. Mitros J.P. Bartlett J.A. Walters J.D. Jia H.P.

Based on the first amino acid in processed hBD-3, the predicted mass of mature cBD-1 peptide is 5130 Da, in its reduced form with a pI of 10.8. Due to the significant nucleotide identity (77%) between hBD-3 and cBD-1 cDNAs, Southern analysis was performed to confirm the chinchilla origin of cBD-1. When chinchilla DNA, digested with EcoRI or HindIII with PstI or HindIII, were probed with cBD-1 cDNA, only a single fragment from chinchilla DNA hybridized to the probe (Fig. 2). These data indicated that the cBD-1 gene was present in a single copy and was sufficiently distinct from the human defensin genes such that there was no cross-hybridization.Fig. 2Detection of the cBD-1 gene by Southern analysis. Restriction enzyme-digested chromosomal DNAs isolated from chinchilla liver and A549 human lung carcinoma cells were blotted and probed with cBD-1 cDNA. Restriction enzymes EcoRI (E), HindIII (H), and PstI (P) were used. The cBD-1 gene was detected only in chinchilla DNA and is present in a single copy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tissue Expression of cBD-1 mRNA—In order to determine how broadly expressed cBD-1 was among various sites as well as to determine the relative expression of cBD-1 among chinchilla airway tissues, total RNA was isolated from tongue, Eustachian tube, nasopharyngeal mucosa, lung, and trachea prior to blotting and probing with 32P-labeled cBD-1 cDNA. Total RNA from skin was also subjected to Northern analysis, since the cBD-1 homolog, hBD-3, was originally isolated from psoriatic skin lesions and is highly expressed in normal skin tissue (14Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the cBD-1 probe detected a ∼0.5-kb transcript in tongue, nasopharyngeal mucosa, and skin but not in ET, lung, or trachea. To confirm and extend these observations, RT-PCR was performed using cBD-1-specific primers and DNase-treated total RNA from the same tissues used for Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, a prominent 175-bp product corresponding to the expected size for cBD-1 was amplified from tongue, nasopharyngeal mucosa, and skin RNA as well as from ET RNA. A less intense 175-bp product was also observed in the reaction using tracheal RNA as a template, whereas a faint product of the same size was amplified from lung RNA. To confirm that the RT-PCR products were indeed cBD-1 cDNA, the DNA was blotted, probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled cBD-1 cDNA, and detected by chemiluminescence. The 175-bp product in each sample hybridized to the cBD-1 probe (Fig. 3B). The PCR products from tongue, ET, NP, and skin were directly sequenced independently, confirming that the RT-PCR products were cBD-1 cDNA (data not shown). The expression data indicated that the cBD-1 transcript was produced throughout the airway of the chinchilla, albeit at a much lower level in trachea, lung, and ET. In order to localize expression of cBD-1 mRNA to a specific cell type within the mucosae of the uppermost airway, we performed in situ hybridization on tissue sections of the ET. As shown in Fig. 4, cBD-1 mRNA was detected in the ciliated columnar epithelia in the proximal and middle portions of the ET when sections were hybridized to an antisense cBD-1 riboprobe. No signal was detected when serial sections were exposed to the sense cBD-1 RNA probe. Purification and Antimicrobial Activity of (r)cBD-1— (r)cBD-1 was expressed in E. coli as a His tag fusion peptide and purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Fig. 5A). The His tag was removed from (r)cBD-1 by cleaving the fusion peptide with enterokinase and binding the His tag to the Ni2+ resin. (r)cBD-1 was further purified by weak cation exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC eluting as a single fraction at ∼40 min (Fig. 5B). Mass spectrometry analysis of (r)cBD-1 revealed that the peptide has a mass of 5123 Da, which is consistent with the predicted mass of oxidized cBD-1. The antimicrobial activity of (r)cBD-1 was assessed in a microbicidal assay in vitro against the three major pathogens of OM (NTHI, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis) and the fungal pathogen C. albicans. As shown in Fig. 6A, (r)cBD-1 was active against NTHI, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis with 50% of bacteria surviving incubation with 5, 2.5, and 0.625 μg/ml (r)cBD-1, respectively. Similarly, C. albicans was also killed when exposed to (r)cBD-1, albeit within a narrow range of concentrations (12.5–20 μg/ml) (Fig. 6B). The concentrations necessary to kill 50% of microorganisms were comparable with that observed for hBD-3, indicating that cBD-1 has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial peptides are effector molecules of the innate immune system, implicated in controlling infections by directly clearing pathogens, acting as opsonins, and/or recruiting inflammatory cells to the site of infection (7Zasloff M.

In particular, mutation of three amino acids (Trp284, Val296, and Val297) to alanine significantly diminished δ-opioid receptor affinity for δ-selective ligands. To assess the changes in conformation accompanying binding of the endogenous opioid peptide deltorphin II to the δ-opioid receptor at both the receptor and ligand levels as well as to determine points of contact between the two, an in-depth spectroscopic study that addressed these points was initiated.

Opioid receptors are widely recognized for their role in mediating pain. Recent cloning of the cDNAs encoding the three opioid receptor subtypes (κ, μ, and δ) defined them as belonging to the superfamiliy of G protein-coupled receptors. Upon comparison of the different opioid receptor subtypes, considerable amino acid identity has been found in the transmembrane and intracellular regions, with a 60% receptor homology overall (1Evans C.J.

The goal was to investigate changes occurring at both the receptor peptide and ligand levels following formation of the complex that may explain events following deltorphin II binding to hDOR. Four peptides of different length containing the ECLIII and some of the transmembrane amino acids of hDOR were synthesized. The conformations of these peptides in 88% hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP) and 12% H2O were assessed using CD and NMR spectroscopy. The results suggest that the interaction of deltorphin II with the hDOR ECLIII generally destabilizes a helix at the N terminus of the extracellular loop and promotes a β-structure at its C terminus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The chemical structures of the opioid receptor ligands used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Deltorphin II and dynorphin A-(1–13) were obtained from Bachem California. High purity endomorphin-1 and -2 were purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. U-50488 and sodium Pi were from Sigma. Trifluoroethanol (TFE) and HFIP were obtained from Aldrich. SDS was purchased from Bio-Rad.Peptide Synthesis—The linear hDOR ECLIII peptides hDOR-(283–297), hDOR-(283–299), hDOR-(281–297), and hDOR-(279–299) (Fig. 2) were synthesized on solid support using a Symphony multiple peptide synthesizer and standard Fmoc chemistry procedures with HATU as coupling reagent. The polymeric starting material was CLEAR amide resin and TentaGel R RAM (Peptides International Inc.) with 0.4 and 0.22 mmol/g resin loading capacity, respectively. The crude peptides were cleaved from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/thioanisole/H2O (94:2:2:2) and then isolated by ether precipitation. Peptides were subsequently purified to homogeneity by preparative chromatography on a Hitachi HPLC instrument equipped with a Jupiter RP-4 column (250 × 22 mm). The synthesized products were obtained in high yield with purity ≥ 96% as determined by analytical high performance liquid chromatography on a Jupiter RP-18 column and a Vydac 218TP54 column and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry using a Micromass LCT mass spectrometer provided the correct molecular weight for each peptide. All peptides were amidated at the C terminus.Fig. 2Linear hDOR ECLIII peptides examined in this study.

The final purities of all peptides were >95%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sample Preparation—Samples for CD spectroscopic studies were prepared by dissolving a sufficient amount of peptide in 500 μl of one of three solvent systems (440 μl of TFE and 60 μl of H2O, 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of H2O, and 200 mm SDS in 50 mm sodium Pi (pH 6.0)) to provide a final peptide concentration of 2 mm, unless otherwise stated. NMR samples contained 2 mm peptide in 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of H2O. All non-aqueous reagents used for NMR experiments were fully deuterated. The solvents systems were chosen to provide a membrane-mimetic environment and to maximize peptide solubility.For studies aimed at examining the interaction between opioid ligands and various hDOR ECLIII peptides, a 2 mm sample of the chosen receptor peptide was first prepared in HFIP/H2O as described above. The ligand was then added to a peptide concentration of 2 mm.CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. Ten scans were collected for each sample over a wavelength range of 180–260 nm under the following conditions: 0.2-nm resolution, 1.0-nm bandwidth, 100-nm/min scan speed, and 0.25-s response time. The CD cell path length employed for all experiments was 0.01 cm. The collected spectra were improved through background subtraction and smoothing and then converted to units of molar ellipticity/residue (degrees cm2 dmol-1). Estimates of the helical fraction of the peptide were calculated by the method of Greenfield and Fasman (22Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar) using a value of [θ] at 222 nm.NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer at 300 K. 3,3,3-Trimethylsilyl propionate was used as an internal reference (0.0 ppm). 1H signals for each peptide were assigned from analysis of the cross-peaks in total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra acquired with a 50-ms mixing time and from the sequential connectivities determined from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlation spectroscopy spectra obtained with a mixing time of 200 ms. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOE correlation spectroscopy experiments were carried out in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-time-proportional phase incrementation (TPPI) method. In cases where TFE/H2O and HFIP/H2O solvent mixtures were employed, the solvent signals appeared as two broad peaks, one originating from the water protons and the other from the residual alcohol OH. Chemical exchange between the two labile proton sites resulted in similar solvent peak intensities. The best overall solvent suppression was thus achieved by presaturating one of the solvent peaks for a period of 1 s prior to the first pulse of each free induction decay acquisition.The amide proton exchange rates in deltorphin II were measured by first incubating a 2 mm solution of peptide in 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of D2O for 24 h and then lyophilizing the sample. The lyophilized sample was resuspended in a mixture of 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of H2O, and two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were acquired at 15-min intervals immediately following dissolution. After 3 h of incubation, hDOR-(279–299) was added to the HFIP/H2O sample at 2 mm, and spectral monitoring was continued.A second amide exchange rate experiment involved first incubating the receptor peptide hDOR-(281–297) at 2 mm in HFIP/H2O and then lyophilizing the sample. Samples were dissolved in 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of D2O. Disappearance of the amide proton signals was monitored through acquisition of two-dimensional TOCSY spectra every 15 min following sample preparation. The experiment was repeated with deltorphin II also contained in the sample at 2 mm.RESULTSCD SpectroscopyOptimization of Organic Solvent Conditions—A general study was performed in which the percentage of organic solvent (TFE or HFIP) in the alcohol/water solvent systems was varied, and the solubility of the hDOR ECLIII peptides was monitored. Fluorinated alcohol/water solvents systems have been widely employed for examining peptide conformations in a membrane-like environment. In addition, TFE and HFIP are structure-promoting solvents that are particularly effective in stabilizing helical conformations without inducing intermolecular aggregation (23Gordon L.M. Mobley P.W. Pilpa R. Sherman M.A. Waring A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1559: 96-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Waring A.J. Mobley P.W. Gordon L.M.

Sci. 1997; 3: 299-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Optimal solubility conditions were noted when the fraction of organic solvent reached 88%. Sample stability over time was marginally better when HFIP was employed as the organic solvent. To ensure that the conformation of the hDOR ECLIII peptides were not affected by a change in peptide concentration, CD spectra were obtained for the longest peptide, hDOR-(279–299), in 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of H2O using four different peptide concentrations ranging from 2 to 0.1 mm. The CD spectra did not change over the entire concentration range studied. Therefore, the peptide did not aggregate at 2 mm. These controls were repeated for the remaining peptides, leading to the same conclusions.Conformational Analyses—To assess the overall conformational preference of the hDOR ECLIII peptides, CD spectra were first acquired for the longest peptide, hDOR-(279–299), in a number of solvent systems. As shown in Fig. 3, the CD spectrum of this peptide in HFIP/H2O contained a well resolved shoulder near 222 nm, a negative peak at 208 nm, and a positive peak at 192 nm. These spectral properties are consistent with a partial helical peptide. Almost an identical spectrum was observed when the peptide was dissolved in TFE/H2O (Fig. 3). However, the percentage helicity marked by the absorbance at 222 nm was more pronounced in this case. In SDS, the shape of the CD curve was typical of a peptide with β-sheet structure and contained a broad band centered at 216 nm (Fig. 3). The β-conformation likely reflects the presence of an aggregated peptide system in the detergent environment. Indeed, support for this statement stems from the observation of a white precipitate in the micellar sample.Fig. 3CD spectra acquired for hDOR-(279–299) in three different solvent systems (440 μl of HFIP and 60 μlofH2O, 440 μlof TFE and 60 μl of H2O, and 200 mm SDS in 50 mm sodium Pi (pH 6.0)).

The spectrum for the medium length peptide hDOR-(281–297) displayed a partial α-helical conformation as judged by the observation of two negative peaks at 222 and 202 nm and a positive peak at 190 nm (Fig. 4). The left shift of the negative band at 202 nm indicated a destabilization of the helix compared with that associated with hDOR-(279–299). Deletion of the N-terminal Ile279-Phe280 motif and the C-terminal Ala298-Ala299 motif in hDOR-(279–299) thus had the effect of moderately destabilizing the secondary structure of the peptide. CD spectra acquired for the remaining medium length peptide, hDOR-(283–299), and smallest analog, hDOR-(283–297), suggested that less helix stability was associated with these two molecules. This result implies that further removal of N-terminal residues Val281 and Ile282 abolishes the helical conformation. Perhaps there is no longer a critical number of amino acids available for establishment of two helical turns along the peptide backbone. However, some conformational preference for the pair was evident from the shoulder at 222 nm and the positive peak at 190 nm in their associated CD spectra (Fig. 4).Fig. 4CD spectra acquired for hDOR ECLIII peptides hDOR-(283–297), hDOR-(283–299), hDOR-(281–297), and hDOR-(279–299) at 2 mm in 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of H2O.

The CD spectrum acquired for hDOR-(279–299) in the presence of deltorphin II exhibited a reduced negative ellipticity at 222 nm and a shift in the absorption maximum from 208 to 205 nm compared with that obtained for the receptor peptide alone (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, adding endomorphin-1 and -2 (endogenous ligands of the μ-opioid receptor) to a sample of hDOR-(279–299) also resulted in reduced negative ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 5, b and c, respectively). Addition of a κ-selective peptide agonist, dynorphin A-(1–13), to a hDOR-(279–299) sample actually increased very marginally the negative absorbance at 222 nm (Fig. 5d), suggesting that helix stabilization occurred. No change was observed in the hDOR-(279–299) CD spectrum when a small molecule κ-selective agonist (U-50488) was added.Fig. 5CD spectra of hDOR-(279–299) in presence of the δ-selective peptide deltorphin II (a), the μ-selective peptides endomorphin-1 (b) and endomorphin-2 (c), and the κ-opioid receptor agonist dynorphin A-(1–13) (d). The solid lines correspond to hDOR-(279–299) alone in solution. Ten scans were collected for each sample over a wavelength range of 180–260 nm. Deg, degrees.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Addition of deltorphin II to samples of the other three hDOR ECLIII peptides in general did not change their CD spectra (data not shown). Only a small decrease was observed in the negative ellipticity of hDOR-(281–297) at 202 and 222 nm when deltorphin II was added, again reflecting destabilization of the helical conformation.NMR SpectroscopyMore detailed conformational properties of the hDOR ECLIII peptides were examined by NMR spectroscopy. Initially, a search for secondary structure was performed using the chemical shift analysis method developed by Wishart et al. (26Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). As stipulated by this method, observed pronounced upfield α-H chemical shift deviations (>0.1 ppm) from random coil values within a stretch of four or more residues signal the presence of a helical structure. Conversely, a stretch of three or more pronounced α-H downfield resonance shifts defines a region of β-structure. Analysis of the α-H chemical shifts for the longest loop peptide, hDOR-(279–299), indicated that there is a helix in the Val283–Arg291 region (Fig. 6a). No such feature was observed in any of the other three peptides according to the chemical shift data alone (Fig. 6, b–d). However, a short density of upfield-shifted α-proton frequencies (>0.1 ppm) was noted in the Asp289–Arg291 region in the case of hDOR-(281–297) (Fig. 6b). It is likely that a nascent helix populates this region of the peptide because the CD spectrum acquired for the same sample supports the presence of a weak helical structure. The main difference between hDOR-(279–299) and hDOR-(281–297) at the N-terminal end is the absence of two transmembrane domain amino acids (Ile279 and Phe280). Therefore, a Ile279-Phe280 sequence may play an important role in stabilizing an N-terminal helix in the hDOR ECLIII.Fig. 6α-Proton chemical shift indices determined for hDOR ECLIII peptides in 440 μl of HFIP and 60 μl of H2O according to the method of Wishart et al.

A stretch of residues where index values are more negative than -0.1 ppm for at least four residues and containing no points with values >0.1 ppm defines a helix region, whereas a similar series of index points >0.1 ppm uninterrupted by a -0.1-ppm point indicates a β-conformation. Residue numbers and chemical shift indices (δ ppm) are plotted on the x and y axes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An additional noteworthy observation was the β-conformation formed at the C terminus of hDOR-(281–297) and hDOR-(283–297) (Fig. 6, b and d). Supporting evidence for this assessment was obtained from the NOE results. Two i,i+2 NOEs including Asp293 α-H to Leu295 NH and Pro294 α-H to Val296 NH were observed only in the case of hDOR-(281–297) and hDOR-(283–297). These data suggest the presence of a C-terminal β-turn structure. Because the remaining two peptides, hDOR-(279–299) and hDOR-(283–299), end with an Ala298-Ala299 motif, it may be hypothesized that the presence of these two amino acids destabilizes the β-structure.When the α-H chemical shift analysis was repeated for the longest peptide, hDOR-(279–299), in the presence of deltorphin II, considerable changes were noted. According to the α-H chemical shift data, a β-structure formed at the C terminus between Asp293 and Val297. Moreover, the binding of deltorphin II destabilized the helix originally present in hDOR-(279–299) (Fig. 7a). Dramatic changes in the hDOR-(279–299) α-H chemical shifts occurred for five receptor amino acids: Trp284, Leu286, Leu295, Val296, and Val297.Fig. 7α-Proton chemical shift indices for hDOR ECLIII peptides in HFIP/H2O following addition of deltorphin II. a, hDOR-(279–299); b, hDOR-(281–297). All peptides are at 2 mm. Residue numbers and chemical shift indices (δ ppm) are plotted on the x and y axes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Addition of deltorphin II to a sample of hDOR-(281–297) also resulted in an overall destabilization of the helical conformation between Asp288 and Arg291. This is indicated by the shift in α-H chemical shift indices to more positive values and above the -0.1-ppm helix cutoff for amino acids in this region (Fig. 7b). When deltorphin II was added to samples of hDOR-(283–299) and hDOR-(283–297), no changes in their respective α-H chemical shifts occurred; and hence, peptide secondary structure was not affected in either case (data not shown).When the focus of NMR analysis was shifted from the receptor peptides to the ligand deltorphin II, some interesting observations were made. A sample of deltorphin II was first incubated in HFIP/D2O to allow an NH-to-ND exchange among the amide protons. The sample was then freeze-dried and resuspended in HFIP/H2O. The degree to which each amide proton was shielded from the aqueous solvent was determined by examining the rate of reappearance of the NH signals in TOCSY spectra over time. Within a short period of time (15 min) after dissolving the peptide, all the NH signals reappeared with reasonable intensity, except for the amide proton signal associated with Glu4. Absence of a Glu4 NH signal was still apparent 3 h following dissolution of the peptide in the HFIP/H2O milieu (Fig. 8a). This result suggests that the amide proton of Glu4 is engaged in a hydrogen bond or is otherwise inaccessible to the surrounding water molecules. When the receptor peptide hDOR-(279–299) was added to the same sample at the 3-h time point, the Glu4 NH signal intensified t"

It has been linked to mutations in the ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1). Here we describe the establishment of permanent Tangier cell lines using telomerase. Ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase extended the life span of control and TD skin fibroblasts, and (in contrast to immortalization procedures using viral oncogenes) did not impair apolipoprotein A-I-induced lipid efflux. The key characteristics of TD fibroblasts (reduced cholesterol and phospholipid efflux) were observed both in primary and telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts from two unrelated homozygous patients. Surprisingly, the apolipoprotein-inducible cholesterol efflux in TD cells was significantly improved after immortalization (up to 40% of normal values). In contrast to ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, this efflux was not inhibited by brefeldin A, glybenclamide, or intracellular ATP depletion but was inhibited in the presence of cytochalasin D. Apolipoprotein A-I-dependent cholesterol efflux was inversely correlated with the population doubling number in cell culture and was inhibited up to 40% in near-senescent normal diploid fibroblasts. This inhibition was completely reversed by telomerase. Thus ectopic expression of telomerase is a way to circumvent the lack of critical experimental material and represents a major improvement for studying cholesterol efflux pathways in lipid disorders. Our findings indicate the existence of an ABCA1-independent but cytoskeleton-dependent cholesterol removal pathway that may help to prevent early atherosclerosis in Tangier disease but may also be sensitive to aging phenomena ex vivo and possibly in vivo.

Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). It is widely assumed that HDL protects against atherosclerosis by mobilizing excess cholesterol from arterial cells and transporting the cholesterol to the liver, a process called “reverse cholesterol transport” (2von Eckardstein A. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which HDL mobilizes cellular cholesterol is still obscure, and the relative contribution of “nonspecific” diffusion-like or more active apolipoprotein-inducible transport components has been hotly debated during the past 2 decades (3Oram J.F.

These studies indicated that ABCA1 is essential in the initial steps of HDL formation and that impaired function of ABCA1 in TD is associated with higher coronary risk (9Tall A.R. Arterioscler.

J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Based on homology with other ATP-binding cassette transporters, it was suggested that ABCA1 transports lipids across the plasma membrane by an energy-dependent process that helps to protect cells from cholesterol overloading (9Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 710-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Am. J. Cardiol. 2003; 91: E3-E11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, ABCA1 was also localized to intracellular organelles (13Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting a more general role in cellular trafficking; and the exact physiological role of ABCA1 is still unclear. Moreover, it is not understood why the manifestation of atherosclerosis in many TD patients occurs at a relatively advanced age (14Singaraja R.R. Brunham L.R. Visscher H. Kastelein J.J.P. Hayden M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol.,. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) and is apparently completely lacking in some patients (15Walter M. Kerber S. Fechtrup C. Seedorf U. Breithardt G. Assmann G.

Lancet. 1993; 342: 1455-1458Abstract PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) despite near-complete HDL deficiency in all homozygote patients. This has been explained by the multifactorial origin of atherosclerosis, the existence of undefined anti-atherosclerotic properties of ABCA1 (that may vary among mutations), long disease process before clinical signs become manifest, low low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in TD patients, and unknown compensatory mechanisms that may operate more efficiently at younger age. For further studies on cholesterol efflux in TD and on potentially anti-atherogenic compensatory mechanisms, permanent cell lines from TD patients would be very helpful. The limit on cell proliferation in primary cells represents an obstacle to the study of cultivated fibroblasts, especially since many rounds of cell division are required to produce large quantities of cells for biochemical analysis. Moreover, the cellular phenotype might be influenced by aging in cell culture. Age seems to be an important modulator of cholesterol efflux and a critical factor in TD patients because HDL cholesterol levels in heterozygote TD patients significantly decrease with increasing age (12Clee S.M. Kastelein J.J. van Dam M. Marcil M. Roomp K. Zwarts K.Y. Collins J.A. Roelants R. Tamasawa N. Stulc T. Suda T. Ceska R. Boucher B. Rondeau C. DeSouich C. Brooks-Wilson A. Molhuizen H.O. Frohlich J. Genest Jr., J. Hayden M.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Moreover, cultivated TD cells have a reduced in vitro growth rate (17Drobnik W.

Biol. 1999; 19: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and may have a reduced proliferative life span, which further complicates biochemical studies. Most experiments on TD have been performed with human skin fibroblasts because this cell type can easily be obtained from patients. The key characteristics of the disease are detectable in these cells, including cholesterol accumulation and reduced cholesterol efflux in response to apolipoproteins (18Assmann G. von Eckardstein A.

However, the immortalization of skin fibroblasts by using viral oncogenes dramatically decreases apolipoprotein-inducible cholesterol efflux (22Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the human telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT to immortalize skin fibroblasts from healthy controls and from two homozygous TD patients. Telomerase is a specialized cellular reverse transcriptase that can compensate for the erosion of telomeres by synthesizing new telomeric DNA. It has been shown previously that the forced expression of exogenous hTERT in normal human cells is sufficient to produce telomerase activity in these cells, prevent the erosion of telomeres, and circumvent the induction of senescence and crises (23Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar, 24Wood L.D.

Our results show that the expression of hTERT efficiently extends the life span of Tangier fibroblasts without changing the key characteristics of this disease. Moreover, we show that hTERT expression circumvents a marked reduction of an ABCA1-independent cholesterol efflux pathway observed at higher cell passages of normal fibroblasts. Materials—Cholesterol, essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), oligomycin (dissolved in Me2SO as 0.1 μg/ml stock solution), cytochalasin D, glyburide, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), brefeldin A, and 2-deoxyglucose were purchased from Sigma. Thin layer chromatography plates (LK6DF Silica Gel 60 A) were purchased from Whatman. [1,2-3H]Cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol) and [methyl-3H]choline chloride (75 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture—Human skin fibroblasts cultured from biopsies of adult human hip skin were isolated as described previously (19Walter M. Gerdes U. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 30: 850-856Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Tangier cells were initially maintained using 1:3 split ratios, and based upon this we estimated they had undergone 22 and 25 population doublings since the start of these experiments. Subsequent doublings were determined by cell counts. For immortalization, cells were infected with retroviral supernatants obtained from packaging cells stably expressing hTERT cloned into the pBabePuro vector (27Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Cells were then selected for 2 weeks using puromycin at 750 ng/ml. For lipid efflux measurements, normal cells between passage levels 20 and 25 and immortalized cells at different passage levels, as indicated, were plated at 25,000 cells/15-mm well or 50,000 cells/35-mm well and grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Telomerase Activity and Telomere Length Analysis—Telomerase activity was determined using the TRAP assay as described previously (28Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Piatyszek M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3794-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Telomere length was measured after DNA extraction from cell samples with different population doublings by digestion with the restriction enzymes AluI, CfoI, HaeIII, HinfI, MspI, and RsaI and electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels as detailed elsewhere (29Ouellette M.M.

The gels were denatured, dried, and neutralized, and the signal was detected in situ by using a telomeric probe end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. After hybridizing to radiolabeled (T2AG3)3 probes, signals were analyzed with the program Telorun (www.swmed.edu/home_pages/cellbio/shaywright/research) using weighted mean calculations designed to normalize signal intensity relative to the digestion product size. Cholesterol Efflux Measurements—Cholesterol efflux measurements were performed as described previously (19Walter M. Gerdes U. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 30: 850-856Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). At ∼50% confluence, 0.5 or 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol was added to the cell medium. When the cells reached confluence, they were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the medium was replaced for 24 h by DMEM containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free albumin (FAFA) and 20 μg/ml of free non-lipoprotein cholesterol, added from a 10 mg/ml stock in ethanol. Cellular cholesterol pools were allowed to equilibrate for another 24 h in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml FAFA. Efflux studies (0–24 h) were then performed in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml FAFA and different concentrations of apoA-I or HDL3. In some experiments, cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP. Cells received 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP during 24 h of pretreatment and during the incubation for measuring efflux. For inhibition of ABCA1, fibroblasts were preincubated with 100 μm glyburide for 30 min at 37 °C, and 100 μm glyburide was present during the efflux phase. Brefeldin A was added at 10 μg/ml from a stock solution 10 mg/ml in ethanol 15 min before starting the efflux and during the efflux phase. For ATP depletion, cells were pretreated for 16 h with 30 μm oligomycin in glucose-free medium containing 6 mm 2-deoxyglucose with oligomycin present in the efflux phase. Cells treated with 1 μm cytochalasin D were preincubated for 1 h with the same concentration. At the end of the efflux time the medium was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove floating cells. Cellular [3H]cholesterol content was measured by dissolving cells in 500 μl of 0.2% SDS (15 min of shaking at room temperature) and scintillation counting a 100-μl aliquot. Percent cellular cholesterol efflux was calculated as (3H dpm in medium/(3H dpm in medium + 3H dpm in cells)) × 100. Cell protein content was determined with the DC Bio-Rad assay by using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Phospholipid Efflux Measurements—Efflux of phospholipid was performed as described previously (26See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R.

For each individual experiment, fibroblasts were plated in triplicate at a density of 25,000 cells per well in 12-well dishes and labeled with 5 μCi per ml [3H]choline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.5 ml of DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After labeling, cells were first washed with equilibration medium (DMEM containing 0.2% FAFA) and then equilibrated in the same medium for 1 h. The medium was then replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM in the presence or absence of apoA-I, apoA-II, or HDL and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Medium was collected, and the cells were removed by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and then 0.4 ml of the supernatant was transferred into a glass test tube. Cells remaining in the dish were lysed in 250 μl of 0.2% SDS by rocking for 10 min at room temperature and transferred to a second glass test tube. Remaining cellular debris was collected by washing the wells with 0.25 ml of water and pooling this with the 0.2% SDS lysates. Lipids were extracted by a 30-s vortex with a 1.5-ml chloroform/methanol mixture (1:2, v/v) followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After adding 0.5 ml of water and 0.5 ml of chloroform, the tubes were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm at room temperature. The organic (lower) phase was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of methanol by vortexing. Samples were then mixed with scintillation fluid and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Percent efflux was calculated by determining the ratio of counts released into the medium over the total counts. Student's t test was used to detect significant differences among samples. For fractionation of phospholipids by TLC, the chloroform/methanol extracts prepared as described above were dried under vacuum and suspended in 35 μl of chloroform. Samples were then loaded onto Whatman LK5D silica plates and developed in a TLC chamber containing a chloroform/methanol/water mixture (65:25:4) (v/v). Labeled [3H]choline-containing phospholipids, identified by their co-migration with pure standards, were visualized by autoradiography and then quantified by scanning densitometry. Immortalization of Control and Tangier Cell Lines—The hTERT cDNA was transferred into cells derived from two normal individuals and two homozygous TD patients (T1 and T2). The patient T1 (63-year-old, female) is homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AATAGT; amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product). The molecular defect (30Utech M. Hobbel G. Rust S. Reinecke H. Assmann G. Walter M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in deletion of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence (8Rust S. Rosier M. Funke H. Real J. Amoura Z. Piette J.C. Deleuze J.F. Brewer H.B. Duverger N. Denefle P. Assmann G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The virtually complete absence of HDL in three homozygous patients with this mutation is associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Primary fibroblasts from the patients and two healthy controls were infected with a defective retrovirus encoding hTERT (pBabepuro-hTERT). All fibroblasts were derived from skin. Neonatal BJ foreskin fibroblasts have been described elsewhere (31Steinert S. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and will be referred to as control 1 (C1) here. The second control cell line was derived from hip skin of an apparently healthy 35-year-old female individual with normal plasma lipid values (referred to as C2). Each sample was divided into two populations as follows: a control population that was uninfected, and a test population that was infected and subsequently selected for retroviral integration with puromycin. All immortalized cell lines were compared with the uninfected cells to demonstrate the presence of telomerase activity and the ability to grow beyond the number of population doublings of uninfected control cells. By using the telomere repeat amplification protocol assay, telomerase activity was found to be absent from all uninfected samples but present in samples that had been infected with the hTERT vector (Fig. 1A). The level of activity detected in the infected cells was comparable with that detected in the human lung cancer cell line H1299 (31Steinert S. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Telomeres in the immortalized cells were longer than in their uninfected counterparts (Fig. 1B). All samples were continuously passaged to determine cellular life span. C1 samples entered senescence after 85–90 population doublings, and C2 samples entered senescence after ∼40 population doublings, typical of the range normally seen for adult donors (32Allsopp R.C. Vaziri H. Patterson C. Goldstein S. Younglai E.V. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Primary (uninfected) Tangier samples entered senescence after 25–30 population doublings (Fig. 2), which is still in the normal range for adult donors (32Allsopp R.C. Vaziri H. Patterson C.

The presence of exogenous telomerase extended the life span of all samples irrespective of their origin. At the present time, all telomerase-expressing cultures have exceeded at least twice the life span at which the uninfected cultures senesced and are probably immortal.Fig. 2Life span of primary and hTERT-infected Tangier cells with the results expressed in population doublings. T1 cells were infected at population doubling (PD) 25, and T2 cells were infected at PD22. All cells infected with the hTERT vector (TT1 and TT2) grew well past the PD number at which senescence was induced in the corresponding control strain (T1 and T2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Immortalization Procedure Does Not Impair Apolipoprotein-induced Lipid Efflux—Lipid-free apolipoproteins remove cellular cholesterol by an active ABCA1-mediated process that is up-regulated by both loading cells with cholesterol and inhibiting cell proliferation (34Oppenheimer M.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown previously (22Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that immortalization of human skin fibroblasts with oncogenes markedly reduced the activity of this lipid removal pathway. We therefore compared cholesterol efflux in normal and hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts subsequent to cholesterol loading and growth arrest. As shown in Fig. 3, apoA-I stimulated cholesterol efflux in a time- and concentration-dependent manner to a similar extent in normal and immortalized fibroblasts. The up-regulation of cholesterol efflux after cholesterol loading and growth arrest (Fig. 3C) is maintained in hTERT-immortalized cells, in contrast to fibroblasts immortalized with oncogenes (22Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect evidence suggests that phospholipids may be the primary substrate of ABCA1 and that cholesterol is transported through spontaneous diffusion-mediated processes after sufficient phospholipid has complexed with lipid-poor apoA-I to create a cholesterol sink (35Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore measured apoA-I-induced phospholipid efflux after labeling cholesterol-loaded and growth-arrested fibroblasts with radioactive [3H]choline. ApoA-I-dependent phospholipid efflux in the normal fibroblast strains was found to increase up to 4–5-fold of basal values during a 6-h incubation period. There was no significant difference in the phospholipid efflux of primary and the respective immortalized control cell lines (Fig. 4). A possible reason for the marked reduction of apolipoprotein-inducible cholesterol efflux in cells immortalized with oncogenes is the depletion of cAMP that is observed in these cells (22Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, the apoA-I-inducible lipid efflux in hTERT-immortalized cells was only slightly increased by the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP to a similar extent as in the corresponding primary cells. This is in sharp contrast to fibroblasts immortalized with oncogenes (22Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and excludes depletion of cAMP as a problem for studying cholesterol efflux in hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts. Cholesterol and Phospholipid Efflux from TERT-immortalized Tangier Cell Lines—Fibroblasts from the TD patient T1 have been found previously to have reduced cholesterol and phospholipid efflux (19Walter M.

Cholesterol and phospholipid efflux in T1 and T2 fibroblasts was reduced ∼85–95% compared with fibroblasts from healthy control donors (Figs. 4 and 5).

Although the role of ATP in the mitochondrial matrix in mitochondrial protein import has been extensively studied, the role of ATP outside mitochondria (external ATP) remains only poorly characterized. Here we developed a protocol for depletion of external ATP without significantly reducing the import competence of precursor proteins synthesized in vitro with reticulocyte lysate. We tested the effects of external ATP on the import of various precursor proteins into isolated yeast mitochondria. We found that external ATP is required for maintenance of the import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins but that, once they bind to mitochondria, the subsequent translocation of presequence-containing proteins, but not the ADP/ATP carrier, proceeds independently of external ATP. Because depletion of cytosolic Hsp70 led to a decrease in the import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins, external ATP is likely utilized by cytosolic Hsp70. In contrast, the ADP/ATP carrier requires external ATP for efficient import into mitochondria even after binding to mitochondria, a situation that is only partly attributed to cytosolic Hsp70.

Many eukaryotic proteins have to move across one or more biological membrane(s) to reach their destinations after synthesis (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Protein translocation across the organellar membranes is mediated by translocators or translocases, which are membrane-protein complexes and provide a protein-conducting channel through which organellar proteins thread, in most cases, in unfolded conformations. Several translocation systems can actively unfold precursor proteins and achieve their vectorial movement across the membranes by using various forms of energy (2Horst M. Azem A. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mitochondria consist of the outer and inner membranes and two aqueous compartments, the intermembrane space and matrix. The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. Precursors of most matrix proteins and many inner membrane proteins have a positively charged presequence that contains targeting information for mitochondria and is removed by the processing peptidase in the matrix. These proteins utilize the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane; TIM, translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane; AAC, ADP/ATP carrier; DHFR, mouse dihydrofolate reductase; Hsp70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; ctHsp70, Hsp70 in the cytosol; mtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70; Hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein; MSF, mitochondrial import stimulating factor; pADH, precursor of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase III; pCoxIV, precursor of yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV; pF1β, precursor of yeast β-subunit of F1-ATPase; pHsp60, precursor of yeast mtHsp60; pSu9, precursor of subunit 9 of Neurospora crassa Fo-ATPase; Δcys, pCoxIV-DHFR mutant with Cys7 → Ser mutation; SCC, pCoxIV-DHFR mutant with Cys7 → Ser/Ser42 → Cys/Asn49 → Cys mutations; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. to cross the outer membrane and the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the TIM23 complex, for translocation across the inner membrane (4Neupert W.

The targeting information in the presequence is recognized by Tom20, a general presequence receptor subunit of the TOM complex (6Endo T. Kohda D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Polytopic inner membrane proteins, including members of the carrier protein family such as the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), are not synthesized with cleavable presequences but instead contain internal mitochondrial targeting signals. Members of the carrier protein family utilize the TOM complex to cross the outer membrane and another translocase of the inner membrane, the TIM22 complex, for integration into the inner membrane (7Koehler C. Merchant S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 428-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein import generally requires two forms of energy, ATP hydrolysis and membrane potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane. Δψ (negative inside) traps or even exerts a physical force to positively charged presequences or internal targeting signals, thereby pulling the translocating protein. This is essential for the initial translocation of the presequence of presequence-containing precursor proteins across the inner membrane, which is followed by engagement with mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) (2Horst M. Azem A. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 14Martin J. Mahlke K. Pfanner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18051-18057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Δψ is also essential for the late step of insertion of polytopic inner membrane proteins into the inner membrane (7Koehler C. Merchant S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 428-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). ATP in the mitochondrial matrix (“internal ATP”) is utilized by mtHsp70. mtHsp70 binds to unfolded segments of the incoming polypeptide at the outlet of the TIM23 import channel and facilitates the vectorial movement and unfolding of the translocating protein (15Matouschek A. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, internal ATP is essential for the import of presequence-containing precursor proteins mediated by the TIM23 complex, but not for the insertion of carrier proteins mediated by the TIM22 complex. In addition to the internal ATP, some mitochondrial proteins require ATP outside mitochondria (“external ATP”) for their import (17Pfanner K. Rassow J. Guiard B. Söllner T. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16324-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Presumably, two cytosolic chaperones, Hsp70 in the cytosol (ctHsp70) and the mitochondrial import stimulation factor (MSF), are responsible for the extramitochondrial ATP requirement (19Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Wener-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 20Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ctHsp70 is important for the maintenance of import competence of some mitochondrial precursor proteins (18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Terada K. Ueda I. Ohtsuka K. Oda T. Ichiyama A. Mori M. Mol. Cell.

However other studies reported that mitochondrial precursor proteins bound to ctHsp70 can be transferred to Tom20 of the TOM complex without hydrolysis of ATP (24Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). MSF in the rat cytosol binds to mitochondrial precursor proteins, prevents their aggregate formation, and targets them to Tom70 of the TOM complex (26Hachiya N. Komiya T. Alam R. Iwahashi J. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5146-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In vitro import experiments with purified MSF showed that docking of the mitochondrial protein-MSF complex to Tom70 does not need ATP hydrolysis, but subsequent release of MSF from the TOM complex/precursor protein requires it (24Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on the analyses of the requirement of external ATP for the import of various mitochondrial precursor proteins (18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), Lithgow et al. proposed that a group of precursor proteins that require external ATP for their import depend on MSF and enter mitochondria via Tom70 (27Lithgow T. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 98-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tom70 is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane by its N-terminal transmembrane segment and exposes the C-terminal receptor domain to the cytosol. The receptor domain contains the N-terminal dicarboxylate clamp domain as well as the central core domain responsible for binding to the internal targeting signals of presequence-less precursor proteins (28Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The clamp domain contains three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs and binds to human Hsp90 and both yeast and human ctHsp70 (29Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In yeast, the docking of ctHsp70 associated with AAC to the Tom70 clamp domain is important for productive binding of AAC to the core domain of Tom70 (29Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Although external ATP allows the Tom70-bound AAC to be released from Tom70 for translocation across the outer membrane, it is not clear if it is ctHsp70 that hydrolyzes ATP at this point. In the present study, we reinvestigated the requirement of external ATP for the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins into mitochondria in vitro. By minimizing the decrease in import competency of precursor proteins during the process of ATP depletion, we could distinguish the external ATP requirement for import upon or after binding to mitochondria from the requirement before binding. The presequence-containing precursor proteins require external ATP for maintaining their import competence but do not need external ATP upon or after binding to mitochondria. This external ATP requirement for maintenance of import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins is most likely due to ctHsp70. In contrast, AAC requires external ATP for efficient import into mitochondria even after binding to them, a situation that is only partly ascribed to ctHsp70. Precursor Proteins—The precursor proteins used here were all from Saccharomyces cerevisiae except for the fusion proteins. pSu9-DHFR and pCoxIV-DHFR are fusion proteins joining mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with the presequence of subunit 9 of Neurospora crassa Fo-ATPase precursor and with the presequence of the yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV precursor, respectively. The genes for the Cys7 → Ser (Δcys) and the Cys7 → Ser/Ser42 → Cys/Asn49 → Cys (SCC) mutants of pCoxIV-DHFR were constructed as described previously for the 7/188/189 and 7/42/49 mutants of pCoxIV-DHFR (30Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); the Δcys mutant lacks Gln188 and Cys189 of the 7/188/189 mutant, and the SCC mutant is the same as the 7/42/49 mutant. The radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in a cell-free translation system with rabbit reticulocyte lysate or PURESYSTEM (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd.) (31Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) in the presence of [35S]methionine.

Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After synthesis of 35S-labeled precursor proteins with reticulocyte lysate, translation was stopped by the addition of 10 μg/ml RNase A and 1 mg/ml cold Met, and the translation products were depleted of ATP by treatment with apyrase or gel filtration. For apyrase treatment, the reticulocyte lysate was incubated with 25 units/ml apyrase (grade III; Sigma), which was pretreated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for the indicated times at 10 °C. For gel filtration, the reticulocyte lysate was passed through a NAP5 column with 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. ATP concentrations were measured as described previously (32Kubo Y. Tsunehiro T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Ikeda E. Toh-e A. Morishima N. Shibata T. Endo T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In parallel, mitochondria (3 mg/ml) were treated with 100 μg/ml atractyloside and 5 units/ml glycerokinase for 10 min at 10 °C in SHK buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm potassium Pi, 5 mm methionine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 10 mm glycerol). The mitochondria were washed once with SHK buffer with 100 μg/ml atractyloside, suspended in import buffer (see below) containing 100 μg/ml atractyloside, 2 mm NADH, and 5 mm α-ketoglutarate to regenerate matrix ATP, and subjected to import assays. Import Assays—In vitro protein import into isolated yeast mitochondria with ATP was performed as described previously (33Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11770-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were isolated from the yeast strain D273-10B (34Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A radiolabeled precursor protein in 10 μl of the translation product was added to mitochondria (0.25 mg/ml) in 190 μl of import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Mops-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm methionine, and 1 mg/ml BSA) containing 2 mm NADH and 2 mm ATP and incubated for 8 min at 30 °C. Import reactions were stopped by the addition of valinomycin to 10 μg/ml, and the mitochondria were treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice. The mitochondria were re-isolated by centrifugation and washed once with 300 μl of SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Mops-KOH, pH 7.2). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging with a Storm 860 image analyzer (Molecular Dynamics). The “imported proteins” represent protease-protected forms. Import of Precursor Proteins in the Absence of Hsc70 —The monoclonal antibody 1B5 was raised against Hsc70 (21Terada K. Ueda I. Ohtsuka K. Oda T. Ichiyama A. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6103-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Depletion of Hsc70 (ctHsp70) from reticulocyte lysate was carried out by treatment with 1B5 antibody-conjugated Sepharose resin as described previously (21Terada K. Ueda I. Ohtsuka K. Oda T. Ichiyama A. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6103-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, reticulocyte lysate without translation or a translation product was mixed with suspension of the 2-fold volume (bed volume) of 1B5 antibody-conjugated Sepharose resin in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 80 mm potassium acetate, incubated for 4 h or 30 min, respectively, at 4 °C with gentle shaking, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was found to contain <2% (reticulocyte lysate without translation) or <10% (translation product) of Hsc70 by immunoblotting. For +Hsc70 control, reticulocyte lysate was treated with unconjugated Sepharose resin instead of 1B5 Sepharose resin. For another control, 10 mg/ml BSA in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 80 mm potassium acetate was added to the reticulocyte lysate that had been depleted of Hsc70. 1 μl of the translation product (depleted of Hsc70) was mixed with 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate, reticulocyte lysate without Hsc70, or 10 mg/ml BSA in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 80 mm potassium acetate. Then, 10 μl of 5 mm ATP, 30 mm creatine phosphate, 0.4 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 10 mm MgCl2 were added, incubated for 0–30 min at 30 °C, and subjected to import assays (for 8 min at 30 °C). Depletion of External ATP—According to the previously adopted protocol for analyzing the role of external ATP in mitochondrial protein import (18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), precursor proteins synthesized in reticulocyte lysate were first depleted of ATP with an ATPase such as apyrase, hexokinase with 2-deoxyglucose, and glycerokinase with glycerol, and then the effects of the addition of an excess amount of external ATP on protein import were analyzed. However, during the incubation of translation products with ATPase, precursor proteins may lose their import competence, probably because the functions of ATP-dependent cytosolic chaperones in reticulocyte lysate can also be inhibited by ATP depletion. Therefore, this ATP depletion protocol does not allow us to discriminate the ATP requirements before precursor binding to the mitochondrial surface from the ATP requirements upon or after binding. We thus tried to develop an improved protocol that would allow us to deplete ATP from in vitro translation products of mitochondrial precursor proteins with minimized decrease in their import competency. To maintain import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins, prolonged incubation of the translation products at high temperature (e.g. ≥30 °C) should be avoided. We found that ≈ 1 mm ATP in the reticulocyte lysate can be decreased to 1.6 and 0.6 μm ATP by incubation with apyrase for 20 min at 10 °C and by gel filtration, respectively, without a significant decrease in the import competence of precursor proteins (not shown). Therefore, we adopted these procedures of ATP depletion of the translation products in the following experiments. Incubation at a High Temperature without ATP Reduces the Import Competence of Precursor Proteins—We first asked if incubation of translation products in the absence of ATP at high temperature reduces import competence of precursor proteins. The precursor proteins we tested are precursors of alcohol dehydrogenase III (pADH), the β-subunit of F1-ATPase (pF1β), cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (pCoxIV), mitochondrial Hsp60 (pHsp60), and a fusion protein joining cytochrome oxidase subunit IV with mouse dihydrofolate reductase (pCoxIV-DHFR). Previously, pADH, pF1β, and AAC were reported to require external ATP for their import into isolated mitochondria, whereas pHsp60, pCoxIV, and pCoxIV-DHFR were imported in the absence of external ATP (18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Hwang S.T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8432-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We synthesized the radiolabeled precursor proteins in reticulocyte lysate and divided them into two. One aliquot was first depleted of ATP by incubation with apyrase at 10 °C and subsequently incubated for various times at 30 °C (–ATP). The other aliquot was first incubated for various times at 30 °C and subsequently incubated with apyrase at 10 °C (+ATP). Then, both aliquots were incubated with mitochondria under the condition where ATP was present on both sides of the inner membrane to test their import abilities (Fig. 1). Prolonged incubation of the translation products at 30 °C without ATP decreased the import competence of the precursor proteins, although the decrease in the import competence varied with different precursor proteins. The import abilities of pADH, pF1β, and pCoxIV-DHFR rapidly decreased to <30% after a 30-min incubation without ATP, whereas >50% of the import abilities of pCoxIV and pHsp60 still remain after a 30-min incubation without ATP. When analyzed by glycerol density gradient centrifugation, pF1β that was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and incubated without ATP for 20 min at 30 °C formed aggregates, whereas pF1β that was incubated with ATP for 20 min at 30 °C remained soluble as a monomer (Fig. 2). The soluble form, but not the aggregated form, of pF1β was import-competent (Fig. 2). Therefore, ATP-dependent chaperones in reticulocyte lysate are important for preventing the aggregation of precursor proteins, thereby maintaining them in import-competent states. Presequence-containing Precursor Proteins Can Be Taken Up by Mitochondria in the Absence of External ATP—It was previously shown that a carrier protein, AAC, requires external ATP for its import both before and after binding to the TOM complex, but before insertion into the inner membrane (38Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Ryan M.T. Müller H. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20619-20627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 40Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the timing of the external ATP requirement for presequence-containing precursor proteins is not clear. We thus performed a test to determine whether external ATP is essential for the import of presequence-containing precursor proteins into mitochondria before or after binding to mitochondria. pF1β and pCoxIV, as well as AAC, were depleted of ATP by gel filtration of the translation products. Mitochondria were depleted of external ATP by preincubation with glycerokinase and atractyloside (to block transport of ADP/ATP across the inner membrane). Then, pF1β, pCoxIV, and AAC were incubated with mitochondria under the condition where ATP is present only in the matrix. Both pF1β and pCoxIV were efficiently imported into mitochondria in the absence of external ATP, and the addition of ATP did not stimulate their import (Fig. 3, graphs for pF1β and pCoxIV). As a control, the presence of glycerokinase, which would hydrolyze possible residual ATP, if any, outside the mitochondria, did not affect the import kinetics of pF1β and pCoxIV either (Fig. 3, lines marked GK). Therefore, external ATP is not required for either release from the ATP-dependent chaperones or for the subsequent process of translocation across mitochondrial membranes. This is in contrast to AAC, which required external ATP for its import into mitochondria (Fig. 3, graph for AAC). The above results, which show that pF1β and pCoxIV can be imported into mitochondria in the absence of external ATP, may be due perhaps to the slow leakage of ATP from the matrix by an uncharacterized mechanism. Indeed, slow and inefficient import of AAC into mitochondria even after glycerokinase treatment of the mitochondria (Fig. 3, lines marked GK) could reflect such slow leakage of ATP from the matrix. To test this possibility, we performed two-step import experiments for presequence-containing precursor proteins as well as for AAC (Fig. 4). Mitochondria were first incubated with oligomycin (to inhibit F1Fo-ATPase), atractyloside (to inhibit ADP/ATP transport across the inner membrane), and NADH (to maintain Δψ), and pSu9-DHFR, pF1β, pADH, pHsp60, and AAC were depleted of ATP by gel-filtration of the translation products. Then the precursor proteins were incubated with the mitochondria with (Fig. 4, bars 1–4) or without (bars 5–8) external ATP (first incubation) for 5 min at 25 °C. The mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation and subjected to incubation with (Fig. 4, bars 2–4 and 6–8) or without ATP (bars 1 and 5) in the matrix, but they were incubated in the absence of external ATP (bars 1–3 and 5–7), for 10 min at 25 °C (second incubation). Because there is no ATP on both sides of the mitochondria during the first incubation (Fig. 4, bars 5–8), the precursor proteins recovered with mitochondria should not require external ATP for their binding to mitochondria. Therefore, the subsequent chase of the bound precursor proteins into the matrix in the presence of ATP only in the matrix will allow us to estimate the amount of productive binding during the first incubation in the absence of external ATP. Fig. 4 shows that pSu9-DHFR, pADH, and pHsp60 bound to the mitochondria in the absence of ATP on both sides of the mitochondria, and the bound forms were chased into the matrix by the replenishment of internal ATP. The presence of Δψ during the second incubation did not affect the chase of pSu9-DHFR, or it affected only moderately the chase of pHsp60 and pADH (Fig. 4), because Δψ is mainly required for the initial binding to mitochondria. The different effects of Δψ during the second incubation on different precursor proteins may reflect the difference in stabilities of the productive translocation intermediates generated in the absence of matrix ATP and Δψ during the first incubation. On the other hand, AAC that bound the mitochondria in the absence of external ATP during the first incubation was not efficiently chased into mitochondria by the second incubation, irrespective of the presence of Δψ or ATP in the matrix, unless external ATP was supplied (Fig. 4). Taken together, the present results indicate that external ATP is required for presequence-containing proteins only prior to the binding to mitochondria, whereas external ATP is essential for AAC after binding to the mitochondria. Therefore, the previously observed requirement of external ATP for the import of presequence-containing mitochondrial precursor proteins (18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) reflects solely the decrease in import competency of precursor proteins before engaging the TOM complex. Hsc70 in the Cytosol Is Responsible for the Maintenance of Import Competency—Which cytosolic chaperones are responsible for the maintenance of import competency of mitochondrial precursor proteins? Because ctHsp70 has been suggested to play such a role in mitochondrial protein import, we tested the effects of depletion of ctHsp70 (Hsc70) from the translation products on import of pCoxIV-DHFR into mitochondria. After synthesis of pCoxIV-DHFR in reticulocyte lysate, >90% of Hsc70 was immuno-depleted from the translation products by the immobilized anti-Hsc70 monoclonal antibody (1B5). Most of pCoxIV-DHFR was not co-immunoprecipitated with Hsc70, suggesting that the binding of pCoxIV-DHFR to Hsc70, if it occurs at al, is dynamic. Then, the translation products of pCoxIV-DHFR depleted of Hsc70 was diluted 10-fold with untreated reticulocyte lysate, Hsc70-depleted lysate, or buffer containing BSA and incubated for various times at 30 °C. The remaining import competence of pCoxIV-DHFR was assessed by subsequent incubation with mitochondria in the presence of ATP on both sides of the mitochondria. Fig. 5A (graph labeled WT) shows that incubation of pCoxIV-DHFR with reticulocyte lysate depleted of Hsc70 resulted in a moderate decrease in its import ability, which is comparable to the incubation with buffer containing BSA. When pCoxIV-DHFR was digested with trypsin, the presequence was cleaved off easily whereas the DHFR domain resisted degradation, suggesting that the DHFR domain is tightly folded (Fig. 5B, graph labeled WT). We now asked if mutations that destabilize the structure of DHFR affect the requirement of Hsc70. The mutations in the DHFR domain, namely Cys7 → Ser, which we have designated Δcys, and Cys7 → Ser/Ser42 → Cys/Asn49 → Cys, which we call SCC, made the DHFR domain more sensitive to trypsin digestion, suggesting that these mutations indeed destabilize the structures of the DHFR domain (Fig. 5B and Ref. 28Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These destabilized mutants of pCoxIV-DHFR showed more significant decrease in import competence after incubation with reticulocyte lysate depleted of Hsc70 or buffer containing BSA (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that Hsc70 is the major chaperone responsible for the maintenance of import competence of pCoxIV-DHFR and that a less stable precursor protein depends more on Hsc70 to remain import competent. Hsc70 Is Not Essential for the Requirement of External ATP for the Import of AAC—Is it only Hsc70 that is responsible for the external ATP requirement of the mitochondrial protein import? We thus compared the external ATP dependence of mitochondrial protein import between conditions with and without Hsc70 in the absence of preincubation at 30 °C (Fig. 6). When we compare the import with and without Hsc70, pCoxIV-DHFR was imported into mitochondria independently of the presence of Hsc70. When we compare the import with and without ATP, import of pCoxIV-DHFR into mitochondria was slightly suppressed in the absence of external ATP, irrespective of the presence of Hsc70. However, this small effect of ATP depletion could be due merely to the slight loss of the import competence of pCoxIV-DHFR during the process of ATP depletion from the translation product. Depletion of Hsc70 moderately affected the import rate of AAC into mitochondria (Fig. 6), which is consistent with the suggested important role of Hsc70 in the import of AAC (29Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). However, even after the depletion of Hsc70, AAC was still imported into mitochondria to some extent, and this residual import was suppressed by the depletion of external ATP. Of course, we cannot eliminate the possibility that this inefficient import reflects the role of a residual amount of Hsc70 that escaped the Hsc70 depletion treatment with anti-Hsc70 antibody. However, an alternative explanation could be that not only Hsc70 but also other ATP-dependent factor(s) may be involved in the import of AAC into mitochondria. To further examine the role of ctHsp70 in the AAC import, we performed two-step import of AAC into mitochondria in the presence or absence of Hsc70 (Fig. 7). For depletion of Hsc70, AAC synthesized in reticulocyte lysate was treated with the immobilized anti-Hsc70 monoclonal antibody. Then AAC with and without Hsc70 was incubated with isolated mitochondria, which had been treated with oligomycin (to inhibit F1Fo-ATPase) and NADH (to maintain Δψ), in the presence or absence of external ATP at 25 °C for 10 min (first incubation). The mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation and subjected to incubation with or without external ATP but in the absence of ATP in the matrix for 10 min at 25 °C (second incubation). When external ATP was present during the first incubation, AAC was imported into mitochondria without accumulation of the surface-bound intermediate so that the imported AAC did not increase (or chase was not observed) during the second incubation. When external ATP was absent during the first incubation, imported AAC increased (or bound AAC was chased into the mitochondria) during the second incubation only when external ATP was present. This ATP-dependent chase of the AAC intermediate during the second incubation was observed even when Hsc70 was depleted. This is consistent with our interpretation that an ATP-dependent factor(s) other than Hsc70 is involved in the import of AAC into mitochondria. To characterize the ATP-dependent factor required for the AAC import, we took advantage of the use of PURESYSTEM, a cell-free translation system reconstituted from purified components including ribosomes, translation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, T7 RNA polymerase, and tRNAs, but free of any chaperones (31Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). pSu9-DHFR and AAC were synthesized with PURESYSTEM (Fig. 8, bars 1–4) or reticulocyte lysate (bars 9–12) in the presence of [35S]methionine and subjected to import into isolated yeast mitochondria. Although pSu9-DHFR synthesized with PURESYSTEM and reticulocyte lysate was imported into mitochondria at similar efficiencies, the import of AAC synthesized with PURESYSTEM into mitochondria was much less efficient than that of AAC synthesized with reticulocyte lysate. Interestingly, import of PURESYSTEM-made AAC was not stimulated by the presence of reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 8, bars 3, 4), or, conversely, that of reticulocyte lysatemade AAC was not inhibited by the presence of PURESYSTEM during the import (Fig. 8, bars 11 and 12). The import efficiency of AAC was not improved even if it was synthesized with PURESYSTEM in the presence of reticulocyte lysate from the beginning (Fig. 8, bars 5–8). These results suggest that the ATP-dependent factors, including Hsc70 in the reticulocyte lysate, are required during the synthesis of AAC as well as during the import and are incompatible with the prokaryotic protein translation system. Hsc70 and other cytosolic factor(s) in reticulocyte lysate may interact with eukaryotic ribosomes, but not with prokaryotic ribosomes, to maintain the import competence of newly synthesized AAC. In the present study, we re-examined the requirement of external ATP for the import of various mitochondrial precursor proteins into isolated yeast mitochondria. By minimizing the decrease in import competency of precursor proteins during the process of ATP depletion, we could assess the external ATP requirement of precursor proteins for their import into mitochondria upon or after, but not prior to, binding to the mitochondria. Although pADH and F1β were reported to require external ATP (18Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we found here that they do not require external ATP for their import into mitochondria and that the previously observed requirement of external ATP arose from the decrease in their import competency before binding to mitochondria. This means that, because MSF requires ATP to release the substrate precursor protein at the docking site of the TOM complex, Tom70 (24Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the presequence-containing precursor proteins studied here do not require MSF in the reticulocyte lysate for their import into mitochondria either. Previous in vitro studies showed that MSF was required for mitochondrial protein import if artificially denatured precursor proteins were pre-loaded onto MSF before incubation with isolated mitochondria (24Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the role of MSF in vivo still remains unclear because the yeast MSFs, Bmh1p and Bmh2p, are not essential for yeast cell growth (6Endo T. Kohda D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because depletion of Hsc70 in the translation products led to a decrease in the import competence of pCoxIV-DHFR fusion proteins (Fig. 5), the external ATP is most likely utilized by Hsc70, but not by MSF, to maintain precursor proteins in import-competent states. In contrast to the presequence-containing precursor proteins, AAC requires external ATP for translocation across the outer membrane after binding to mitochondria. This requirement of external ATP may well be connected to the requirement of Hsc70 for productive binding of AAC to Tom70 (29Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). However, even after depletion of >90% of Hsc70 from the AAC translation products, AAC could be still imported into mitochondria to some extent. On the other hand, Young et al. showed that a mutation in the clamp domain of Tom70 that abrogates binding to Hsc70 inhibited the productive binding of AAC to Tom70 in its import into mitochondria completely (29Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that a small residual amount of Hsc70 in reticulocyte lysate could still manage to mediate the AAC import, there may be a factor other than Hsc70 in reticulocyte lysate that interacts with AAC upon its synthesis on the ribosome and targets it to the clamp domain of Tom70, thereby substituting for Hsc70 when Hsc70 is depleted. Clearly, further analysis is necessary to address this question, and such a study is underway in our laboratory."
