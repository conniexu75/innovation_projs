https://openalex.org/W2041895575,"Results of high-pressure experiments on samples of hydrated mantle rocks show that the serpentine mineral antigorite is stable to approximately 720 degrees C at 2 gigapascals, to approximately 690 degrees C at 3 gigapascals, and to approximately 620 degrees C at 5 gigapascals. The breakdown of antigorite to forsterite plus enstatite under these conditions produces 13 percent H(2)O by weight to depths of 150 to 200 kilometers in subduction zones. This H(2)O is in an ideal position for ascent into the hotter, overlying mantle where it can cause partial melting in the source region for calc-alkaline magmas at a depth of 100 to 130 kilometers and a temperature of approximately 1300 degrees C. The breakdown of antigorite in hydrated mantle produces an order of magnitude more H(2)O than does the dehydration of altered oceanic crust."

However, the raw material has a disordered structure, which restricts investigations of both the properties and applications of the nanotubes. A method has been developed to produce thin films of aligned carbon nanotubes. The tubes can be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the surface, as verified by scanning electron microscopy. The parallel aligned surfaces are birefringent, reflecting differences in the dielectric function along and normal to the tubes. The electrical resistivities are anisotropic as well, being smaller along the tubes than perpendicular to them, because of corresponding differences in the electronic transport properties."
https://openalex.org/W2007522509,"Cleavage of the relatively inert dinitrogen (N(2)) molecule, with its extremely strong N identical withN triple bond, has represented a major challenge to the development of N(2) chemistry. This report describes the reductive cleavage of N(2) to two nitrido (N(3-)) ligands in its reaction with Mo(NRAr)(3), where R is C(CD(3))(2)CH(3) and Ar is 3,5-C(6)H(3)(CH(3))(2'), a synthetic three-coordinate molybdenum(III) complex of known structure. The formation of an intermediate complex was observed spectroscopically, and its conversion (with N identical withN bond cleavage) to the nitrido molybdenum(VI) product N identical withMo(NRAr)(3) followed first-order kinetics at 30 degrees C. It is proposed that the cleavage reaction proceeds by way of an intermediate complex in which N(2) bridges two molybdenum centers."
https://openalex.org/W2027237425,"Near-source observations show that earthquakes initiate with a distinctive seismic nucleation phase that is characterized by a low rate of moment release relative to the rest of the event. This phase was observed for the 30 earthquakes having moment magnitudes 2.6 to 8.1, and the size and duration of this phase scale with the eventual size of the earthquake. During the nucleation phase, moment release was irregular and appears to have been confined to a limited region of the fault. It was characteristically followed by quadratic growth in the moment rate as rupture began to propagate away from the nucleation zone. These observations suggest that the nucleation process exerts a strong influence on the size of the eventual earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2005708739,"The discovery of Triassic (Norian) turtles from the northwest part of Argentina extends the South American record of turtles by 60 million years. Two skeletons, one almost complete, represent a new genus and species of a basal turtle, Palaeochersis talampayensis. This turtle is a member of the family Australochelidae that was recently erected for Australochelys africanus from the Lower Jurassic of South Africa. Here, it is proposed that Australochelidae is the sister group of Proterochersis plus Casichelydia, that turtles were diverse by the Late Triassic, and that Casichelydia probably originated during the Jurassic."
https://openalex.org/W2051447055,"Fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background have now been detected over a wide range of angular scales, and a consistent picture seems to be emerging. This article describes some of the implications for cosmology. Analysis of all of the published detections suggests the existence of a peak on degree scales with a height 2.4 to 10 (90 percent confidence level) times the amplitude of the power spectrum at large angular scales. This result confirms an early prediction, implies that the universe did in fact recombine, and limits theories of structure formation. Illustrative examples show how comparison of the microwave background data and the large-scale structure data will be a potentially powerful means of answering fundamental questions about the universe."

https://openalex.org/W1980064487,"Inelastic helium atom scattering has been used to measure the phonons on a stepped metallic crystalline surface, Ni(977). When the scattering plane is oriented parallel to the step edges and perpendicular to the terraces, two branches of step-induced phonons are observed. These branches are identified as transversely polarized, step-localized modes that propagate along the step edge. Analysis reveals significant anisotropy in the force field near the step edge, with all forces near the step edge being substantially smaller than in the bulk. Such measurements provide valuable information on metallic bonding and interface stability near extended surface defects."

https://openalex.org/W2042868323,"This article discusses the need for a fresh policy approach toward forests as a new organization is established - the World Commission on Forest and sustainable Development. Forests once covered more than 40% of Earth`s land surface, but this has been reduced by one third. The consequences of forest loss are not recognized in their full scope by political leaders and policy makers. Forest protect soils, play a major role in hydrological cycles, exert a gyroscopic effect in atmospheric processes and other global climate factors, second only to the ocean. They are critical to the energy budget and albedo of Earth, and they harbor a majority of species on land. A policy apprasial should address both the scope of change necessary for forests to undergo sustainable development, and the scope required for forests to contribute fully to sustainable development in the countries concerned and in the world at large. 17 refs."

M. R. C. Greenwood, in her Editorial “Dancing with wolves” ([29 Mar., p. 1787][2]), lists a large number of “notabl[e]” scientific societies that “are or have recently been headed by women or minorities.” Without disparaging Greenwood's choice of the societies worthy of note in this regard, I would like to point out that the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology could have been safely added to the list. Our current president, Susan Taylor of the University of California at San Diego, is the fifth female scientist in recent years to head the society.

The cover image of the 5 July issue taken from the painting “Three Ages of Woman” by Gustav Klimt (1905), also shown on page 41 of the same issue, depicts an elderly, naked, despondent woman at the left. Where are the old and decrepit men pictured? Old men are wearing suits and ties (pp. 23 and 24) or are on mountaintops (p.26).

The oil threatens salmon fisheries and marshlands used for grazing cattle and raindeer. This article discusses the spill in relation to other large spills and the possible ecological damage. Russian authorities, first reluctant to come to grips with the spill, are changing their attitudes, a position essential to gaining access to threatened regions for important monitoring studies."

https://openalex.org/W2002087008,"Constance Holden's article “Publisher draws censorship charge” (News, [12 July, p. 177][1]) is a concise and accurate synopsis of a protracted and nasty series of events. Although charges of anti-Semitism against me are wrong, they are also understandable. My review ([1][2]) of Kevin MacDonald's excellent book, A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy ([2][3]), made unrealistic assumptions about readers' familiarity with issues at hand, and so drew conclusions based on inadequately supplied information.

Unfortunately, one way to make charges of anti-Semitism stick is to publish a submission that draws such charges, then refuse to publish a rejoinder ([3][4]) that apologizes for shortcomings, attempts to clarify misunderstandings, and refers readers to ad hoc sources of relevant information ([4][5]). Five editorial board members of Ethology and Sociobiology judged my rejoinder to be such a submission, but the journal's publisher, Elsevier Inc., still refuses to publish it.

I ask interested readers to withhold judgment until they have a fuller explanation of my views—which can be obtained (including a copy of the accepted-but-censored addendum) by forwarding an address label to the address below.
