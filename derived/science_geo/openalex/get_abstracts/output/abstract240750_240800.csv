https://openalex.org/W2026490476,"Plants under attack by arthropod herbivores often emit volatile compounds from their leaves that attract natural enemies of the herbivores. Here we report the first identification of an insect-induced belowground plant signal, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which strongly attracts an entomopathogenic nematode. Maize roots release this sesquiterpene in response to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a maize pest that is currently invading Europe. Most North American maize lines do not release (E)-beta-caryophyllene, whereas European lines and the wild maize ancestor, teosinte, readily do so in response to D. v. virgifera attack. This difference was consistent with striking differences in the attractiveness of representative lines in the laboratory. Field experiments showed a fivefold higher nematode infection rate of D. v. virgifera larvae on a maize variety that produces the signal than on a variety that does not, whereas spiking the soil near the latter variety with authentic (E)-beta-caryophyllene decreased the emergence of adult D. v. virgifera to less than half. North American maize lines must have lost the signal during the breeding process. Development of new varieties that release the attractant in adequate amounts should help enhance the efficacy of nematodes as biological control agents against root pests like D. v. virgifera."

https://openalex.org/W2038425317,"Arginase 1, an enzyme induced by Th2 cytokines, is a hallmark of alternatively activated macrophages and is responsible for the hydrolysis of L-arginine into ornithine, the building block for the production of polyamines. Upregulation of arginase 1 has been observed in a variety of diseases, but the mechanisms by which arginase contributes to pathology are not well understood. We reveal here a unique role for arginase 1 in the pathogenesis of nonhealing leishmaniasis, a prototype Th2 disease, and demonstrate that the activity of this enzyme promotes pathology and uncontrolled growth of Leishmania parasites in vivo. Inhibition of arginase activity during the course of infection has a clear therapeutic effect, as evidenced by markedly reduced pathology and efficient control of parasite replication. Despite the clear amelioration of the disease, this treatment does not alter the Th2 response. To address the underlying mechanisms, the arginase-induced L-arginine catabolism was investigated and the results demonstrate that arginase regulates parasite growth directly by affecting the polyamine synthesis in macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2162075565,"The human hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) system is activated under various pathological conditions, yet less is known about its physiological regulation in healthy human tissue. We have studied the effect of exercise on the activation of HIF-1 in human skeletal muscle. Employing a model where oxygen consumption increases and oxygen tension can be manipulated, nine healthy male subjects performed 45 min of one-legged knee-extension exercise. Biopsies were taken before, directly after, and 30, 120, and 360 min after exercise. Exercise led to elevated HIF-1alpha protein levels and a more prevalent nuclear staining of HIF-1alpha. Interestingly, a concurrent decrease in von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) levels was detected in some subjects. Moreover, exercise induced an increase in the DNA binding activity of HIF-1alpha. Characterization of gene expression by real-time PCR demonstrated that the HIF-1 target genes VEGF and EPO were activated. VEGF mRNA was further increased when blood flow to the exercising leg was restricted. In conclusion, these data clearly demonstrate that physical activity induces the HIF-1-mediated signaling pathway in human skeletal muscle, providing the first evidence that human HIF-1alpha can be activated during physiologically relevant conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2127464082,"Chronic inflammation is known to promote cancer, suggesting that negative regulation of inflammation is likely to be tumor suppressive. We found that p53 is a general inhibitor of inflammation that acts as an antagonist of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB). We first observed striking similarities in global gene expression profiles in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP transduced with p53 inhibitory genetic element or treated with TNF, suggesting that p53 inhibits transcription of TNF-inducible genes that are largely regulated by NFkappaB. Consistently, ectopically expressed p53 acts as an inhibitor of transcription of NFkappaB-dependent promoters. Furthermore, suppression of inflammatory response by p53 was observed in vivo in mice by comparing wild-type and p53 null animals at molecular (inhibition of transcription of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines, reducing accumulation of reactive oxygen species and protein oxidation products), cellular (activation of macrophages and neutrophil clearance) and organismal (high levels of metabolic markers of inflammation in tissues of p53-deficient mice and their hypersensitivity to LPS) levels. These observations indicate that p53, acting through suppression of NFkappaB, plays the role of a general ""buffer"" of innate immune response in vivo that is well consistent with its tumor suppressor function and frequent constitutive activation of NFkappaB in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2079484449,"Although the Toll-like receptors used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis membrane and secreted factors are known, the pathways activated by M. tuberculosis heat shock proteins are not. An efficient immune response against the intracellular pathogen M. tuberculosis is critically dependent on rapid detection of the invading pathogen by the innate immune system and coordinated activation of the adaptive immune response. Macrophage phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis is accompanied by activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and secretion of inflammatory mediators that play an important role in granuloma formation and immune protection during M. tuberculosis infection. The interaction between M. tuberculosis and the various Toll-like receptors is complex, and it appears that distinct mycobacterial components may interact with different members of the Toll-like receptor family. Here we show that recombinant, purified, mycobacterial heat shock proteins 65 and 70 induce NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner in human endothelial cells. Furthermore, we show that whereas mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 signals exclusively through Toll-like receptor 4, heat shock protein 70 also signals through Toll-like receptor 2. Mycobacterial heat shock protein 65-induced NF-κB activation was MyD88-, TIRAP-, TRIF-, and TRAM-dependent and required the presence of MD-2. A better understanding of the recognition of mycobacterial heat shock proteins and their role in the host immune response to the pathogen may open the way to a better understanding of the immunological processes induced by this important human pathogen and the host-pathogen interactions and may help in the rational design of more effective vaccines or vaccine adjuvants.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to be a major global health problem, infecting nearly one-third of the world's population and killing at least 3 million people each year (1Flynn J.L. Chan J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 93-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 2Frieden T.R. Sterling T.R. Munsiff S.S. Watt C.J. Dye C. Lancet. 2003; 362: 887-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The immune response mounted to the infection is generally successful in containing, although not eliminating, the pathogen (1Flynn J.L. Chan J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 93-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Traditionally, protective immunity to M. tuberculosis has been ascribed to T cell-mediated immunity, with CD4+ T cells playing a crucial role. This is primarily because the organism lives within cells, usually macrophages; thus T cell effector mechanisms, rather than antibody responses, are required to control or eliminate the bacteria (1Flynn J.L. Chan J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 93-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The breakdown of immune responses designed to contain the infection can result in reactivation and replication of the bacilli, with necrosis and damage to lung tissue (1Flynn J.L. Chan J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 93-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Recent immunological and genetic studies support the model that innate immunity plays an important role in host defenses against M. tuberculosis (3van Crevel R. Ottenhoff T.H. van der Meer J.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 294-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). An efficient immune response against the intracellular pathogen M. tuberculosis is critically dependent on the rapid detection of the invading pathogen by the innate immune system and the coordinated activation of the adaptive immune response, but a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating these responses has only recently been addressed (4Schwandner R.

Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In addition, TLRs influence the adaptive immune response by up-regulating co-stimulatory molecules to support the development of a Th1 response (12Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). TLRs comprise a family of at least eleven cell-surface pattern recognition molecules that alert the host to the presence of microbial pathogens (12Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). TLR4 initiates signaling cascades in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (13Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H.

Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that the M. tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein, a potent inducer of T cell responses, activates murine and human macrophages to secrete TNF and nitric oxide (7Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L.

Lipoarabinomannan, a glycolipid that is abundant in the mycobacterial cell wall, is a key molecule in eliciting cytokine secretion by macrophages (9Moreno C. Taverne J. Mehlert A. Bate C.A. Brealey R.J. Meager A. Rook G.A. Playfair J.H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 76: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). Uncapped lipoarabinomannan (AraLAM) induces cell activation via TLR2 (5Means T.K. Wang S.

A. 1999; 96: 14459-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). STF contains mannosylated phosphatidylinositol that possesses TLR2 agonist activity (20Jones B.W. Means T.K. Heldwein K.A. Keen M.A. Hill P.J. Belisle J.T. Fenton M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 1036-1044PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated previously a functional interaction between TLR2 and TLR6 in the cellular response to STF (21Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). TLR2 activation leads to the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis in both mouse and human macrophages. Whereas in mouse macrophages this pathway is nitric oxide-dependent, in human monocytes and alveolar macrophages it is nitric oxide-independent (11Thoma-Uszynski S. Stenger S. Takeuchi O. Ochoa M.T. Engele M. Sieling P.A. Barnes P.F. Rollinghoff M. Bolcskei P.L. Wagner M. Akira S. Norgard M.V. Belisle J.T. Godowski P.J. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 2001; 291: 1544-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar).In contrast to the findings in some earlier publications, more recent reports found that mycobacterial mannosylated phosphatidylinositol induces both TLR2- and TLR4-dependent signaling (10Abel B. Thieblemont N. Quesniaux V.J. Brown N. Mpagi J. Miyake K. Bihl F. Ryffel B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3155-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Means et al. reported that both soluble and cell-associated mycobacterial factors can activate TLR-dependent signaling in a CD14-independent manner (5Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927PubMed Google Scholar). They observed that a soluble, heat-stable, and protease-resistant mycobacterial factor mediated TLR2-dependent activation, whereas a heat-labile, cell-associated mycobacterial factor activated cells in a TLR4-dependent manner (5Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927PubMed Google Scholar, 19Means T.K. Jones B.W. Schromm A.B. Shurtleff B.A. Smith J.A. Keane J. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas purified mycobacterial antigens such as 19-kDa lipoprotein, lipoarabinomannan, and STF preferentially interact with TLR2, infection with whole bacilli evokes a more complex activation pattern involving at least TLR2 and TLR4 and leads to differential activation of antibacterial effector pathways (5Means T.K.

A recent study suggested that TLR2 and TLR4 are redundant to control M. tuberculosis infection and that only at extremely high infectious doses was survival reduced in TLR2-deficient mice (26Reiling N. Holscher C. Fehrenbach A. Kroger S. Kirschning C.J. Goyert S. Ehlers S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3480-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Another study demonstrated that both standard and high doses of aerosol infection with live M. tuberculosis resulted in significantly increased bacterial loads, defective granulomatous response, and chronic pneumonia in TLR2-deficient mice (27Drennan M.B.

Whereas studies with C3H/HeJ mice, a strain harboring a mutation in the signaling domain of TLR4 that renders mice unresponsive to LPS, showed that TLR4 may not play a significant role in immunity to M. tuberculosis (28Kamath A.B.

These authors suggested that TLR4 signaling appears to be required to control the local growth and dissemination of M. tuberculosis infection from lungs (10Abel B. Thieblemont N. Quesniaux V.J.

In summary, previous studies suggest that the interaction between M. tuberculosis and the various TLRs is complex, and it appears that distinct mycobacterial components may interact with different members of the TLR family.Mycobacterial (Mtb) HSPs may also participate in cytokine expression resulting from infection by M. tuberculosis (30Young D.B. Garbe T.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3086-3093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSPs stabilize cellular proteins in response to diverse sources of stress or injury (31Pockley A.G.

Given the importance of Mtb HSPs 65 and 70 in the pathogenesis of the M. tuberculosis infection, we sought to clarify the role of TLRs in the innate immune response to these ligands. Here we report that recombinant purified M. tuberculosis HSP65 signals exclusively through TLR4, whereas M. tuberculosis HSP70 signals through both TLR4 and TLR2 to activate the innate immune system in a myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP)-, TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-, and TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM)-dependent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Immortalized human dermal endothelial cells (HMECs) (a generous gift from Dr. Francisco J.

HEK 293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as recommended.Recombinant Purified M. tuberculosis HSP65 and HSP70 —Purified recombinant M. tuberculosis HSP65 and HSP70 were produced using a bacterial expression system. For Mtb HSP70, protein was obtained from heat-induced (42 °C) cells of Escherichia coli strain M1592 with plasmid pKAM2101. Cells were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the recombinant 70-kDa protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose), followed by ATP affinity chromatography and again by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized (32Young D.B. Kaufmann S.H. Hermans P.W. Thole J.E. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2085122822,"The tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two components. Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black holes in the Universe and can account for >30% of the total cosmological black-hole growth. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star formation and already host massive black holes [>10^(8) M(Sun)], there must have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range ~10^(6)-10^(8) M(Sun)]. The likely signature of this earlier stage is simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z>1; >8 billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval galaxy populations. We show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies is consistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase."

It is induced in human cells in response to several stress stimuli, including genotoxic stress (radiation, doxorubicin) and overexpression of E1A or p53 but not by ER stress pathways resulting from protein malfolding. BIK initiates an early release of Ca2+ from ER upstream of the activation of effector caspases. Release of the mobile ER Ca2+ stores in baby mouse kidney cells doubly deficient in BAX and BAK, on the other hand, is resistant to BIK but is sensitive to ectopic BAK. Over-expression of p53 stimulates recruitment of BAK to the ER, and both its recruitment and assembly into higher order structures is inhibited by BIK small interfering RNA. Employing small interfering RNA knockdowns, we also demonstrated that release of ER Ca2+ and mitochondrial apoptosis in human epithelial cells requires BIK and that a Ca2+-regulated target, the dynamin-related GTPase DRP1, is involved in p53-induced mitochondrial fission and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. Endogenous cellular BIK, therefore, regulates a BAX,BAK-dependent ER pathway that contributes to mitochondrial apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2136520694,"Endurance exercise improves insulin sensitivity and increases fat oxidation, which are partly facilitated by the induction of metabolic transcription factors. Next to exercise, increased levels of FFA's also increase the gene expression of transcription factors, hence making it difficult to discern the effects from contractile signals produced during exercise, from those produced by increased circulatory FFA's. We aimed to investigate, in human skeletal muscle, whether acute exercise affects gene expression of metabolic transcriptional co-activators and transcription factors, including PGC-1alpha, PRC, PPARalpha, beta/delta, and gamma and RXR, SREBP-1c and FKHR, and to discern the effect of exercise per se from those of elevated levels of FFA. Two hours of endurance exercise was performed either in the fasted state, or following carbohydrate ingestion prior to and during exercise, thereby blunting the fasting-induced increase in FA availability and oxidation. Of the genes measured, PGC-1alpha and PRC mRNA increased immediately after, while PPARbeta/delta and FKHR mRNA increased 1-4 h after exercise, irrespective of the increases in FFA's. Our results suggest that the induction in vivo of metabolic transcription factors implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis are under the control of inherent signals, (PGC-1alpha, PRC), while those implicated in substrate selection are under the control of associated signals (PPARbeta/delta, FKHR) stimulated from the contracting skeletal muscle that are independent of circulating FFA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1983112008,"The mTOR protein kinase is the target of the immunosuppressive and anti-cancer drug rapamycin and is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of cell growth in mammals. S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is the best characterized effector of mTOR, and its regulation serves as a model for mTOR signaling. Nutrients and growth factors activate S6K1 by inducing the phosphorylation of threonine 389 in the hydrophobic motif of S6K1. As phosphorylation of Thr(389) is rapamycin sensitive and mTOR can phosphorylate the same site in vitro, it has been suggested that mTOR is the physiological Thr(389) kinase. This proposal is not supported, however, by the existence of mutants of S6K1 that are phosphorylated in vivo on Thr(389) in a rapamycin-resistant fashion. Here, we demonstrate that the raptor-mTOR complex phosphorylates the rapamycin-sensitive forms of S6K1, while the distinct rictor-mTOR complex phosphorylates the rapamycin-resistant mutants of S6K1. Phosphorylation of Thr(389) by rictor-mTOR is independent of the TOR signaling motif and depends on removal of the carboxyl terminal domain of S6K1. Because many members of the AGC family of kinases lack an analogous domain, rictor-mTOR may phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of other kinases."

The MSH2-MSH6 complex bound to a mispaired base was found to be converted by ATP binding to a form that showed rapid sliding along the DNA and dissociation via the DNA ends and also showed slow, direct dissociation from the DNA. In contrast, the MSH2-MSH6 complex bound to a base pair containing DNA only showed direct dissociation from the DNA. The MLH1-PMS1 complex formed both mispair-dependent and mispair-independent ternary complexes with the MSH2-MSH6 complex on DNA. The mispair-independent ternary complexes were formed most efficiently on DNA molecules with free ends under conditions where ATP hydrolysis did not occur, and only exhibited direct dissociation from the DNA. The mispair-dependent ternary complexes were formed in the highest yield on DNA molecules with blocked ends, required ATP and magnesium for formation, and showed both dissociation via the DNA ends and direct dissociation from the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2086334687,"In this study, we investigated recruitment of coactivators (SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3) and corepressors (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, SMRT, and NCoR) to the IκBα gene promoter after NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor-α. Our data from chromatin immunoprecipitation assay suggest that coactivators and corepressors are simultaneously recruited to the promoter, and their binding to the promoter DNA is oscillated in HEK293 cells. SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3 all enhanced IκBα transcription. However, the interaction of each coactivator with the promoter exhibited different patterns. After tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, SRC-1 signal was increased gradually, but SRC-2 signal was reduced immediately, suggesting replacement of SRC-2 by SRC-1. SRC-3 signal was increased at 30 min, reduced at 60 min, and then increased again at 120 min, suggesting an oscillation of SRC-3. The corepressors were recruited to the promoter together with the coactivators. The binding pattern suggests that the corepressor proteins formed two types of corepressor complexes, SMRT-HDAC1 and NCoR-HDAC3. The two complexes exhibited a switch at 30 and 60 min. The functions of cofactors were confirmed by gene overexpression and RNA interference-mediated gene knockdown. These data suggest that gene transactivation by the transcription factor NF-κB is subject to the regulation of a dynamic balance between the coactivators and corepressors. This model may represent a mechanism for integration of extracellular signals into a precise control of gene transcription."

The capsids of the empty particles are thought to be composed of core protein but have not been studied in detail. In the present study, the protein composition of the particles was examined using new enzyme immunoassays for the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and for the HBV precore/core proteins (core-related antigens, HBcrAg). HBcrAg were abundant in fractions slightly less dense than HBcAg and HBV DNA. Three times more Dane-like particles were observed in the HBcrAg-rich fraction than in the HBV DNA-rich fraction by electron microscopy. Western blots and mass spectrometry identified the HBcrAg as a 22-kDa precore protein (p22cr) containing the uncleaved signal peptide and lacking the arginine-rich domain that is involved in binding the RNA pregenome or the DNA genome. In sera from 30 HBV-infected patients, HBcAg represented only a median 10.5% of the precore/core proteins in enveloped particles. These data suggest that most of the Dane particles lack viral DNA and core capsid but contain p22cr. This study provides a model for the formation of the DNA-negative Dane particles.

The HBV genome encodes two core-related open reading frames, precore and core genes (Fig. 1). These are expressed because of two in-frame ATG initiation codons located at the 5′ end of the genes. The first ATG encodes a 25-kDa protein (p25) containing the 29-amino acid (aa) precore sequence fused to the N terminus of the HBV core antigen (HBcAg). The p25 is directed toward the secretory pathway by a 19-aa signal sequence that is cleaved during translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), producing a 22-kDa protein. Subsequent proteolytic cleavages within the arginine-rich C-terminal region (34 aa) generate a 17-kDa protein that is secreted as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (7Ou J.-H. Laub O. Rutter W.J. Proc.

The present study investigated precore/core proteins in HBV-infected human sera using the new assays. The results suggest that most of the Dane particles were DNA-negative and were composed of a 22-kDa precore protein containing the uncleaved signal peptide and lacking the C-terminal arginine-rich domain. We present a new model for the formation of HBV DNA-negative particles. Serum/Plasma Samples—Hepatitis B plasma panels were purchased from Boston Biomedica, Inc. (BBI, West Bridgewater, MA), or ProMedDx (Norton, MA). Clinical sera were collected between 1997 and 2001 at the Shinshu University Hospital (Matsumoto, Japan) from patients with persistent HBV infection. Thirteen of these serum samples containing ≥0.05 ng/ml HBcAg were immunoprecipitated to examine HBcAg/HBcrAg ratios. Of the 30 total serum samples (from 23 males and 7 females), 22 were HBeAg-positive, and 7 were HBeAb-positive. The remaining sample was positive for both HBeAg and HBeAb. None of the 30 patients was treated with anti-viral agents such as interferon or lamivudine. All sera were stored at –30 °C or below until testing. The study design conformed to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committees of the institutions involved in this study. A written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Recombinant HBV Core-related Antigens—Recombinant HBcAg (rH-BcAg, aa 1–183) and HBeAg (rHBeAg, aa –10 –149) were expressed and purified as described (21Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Matsumoto A. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 1901-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Sakamoto Y. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The concentration of these antigens was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin standards according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monoclonal Antibodies and EIAs for HBcAg or HBcrAg—Anti-HB-cAg and anti-HBcrAg monoclonal antibodies were established as reported previously (21Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Matsumoto A. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 1901-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Sakamoto Y. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The HBcAg-specific monoclonal antibody, HB50, recognizes SPRRR repeats in the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg (21Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Matsumoto A. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 1901-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas the anti-HBcrAg monoclonal antibody, HB91, recognizes aa 1–19 of HBcAg and thus reacts to denatured HBcAg, HBeAg, and other precore/core proteins (22Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Sakamoto Y. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). HBcAg and HBcrAg were measured by EIA as described previously (21Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Matsumoto A. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 1901-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kimura T. Rokuhara A. Sakamoto Y. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Maki N. J. Clin.

Viral Hepat. 2003; 10: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The assays contain a sample pretreatment step that inactivates antibodies and dissociates antigens in samples. The assays can thus detect antigens within the viral envelope or complexed with antibodies in addition to free antigens. HBV Markers and HBV DNA Measurement—HBeAg and HBsAg were measured by radioimmunoassay or by chemiluminescent immunoassay (Abbott, Tokyo), respectively. HBV DNA was detected by PCR using the Amplicor HBV monitor test (Roche Applied Science). Samples showing values over the detection range were remeasured after dilution to obtain quantitative results. Sucrose Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Aliquots (1.7 ml) of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% (w/w) sucrose in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) were carefully layered in a 12-ml Ultracentrifuge tube and left at room temperature for 6 h. HBeAg-positive plasma (0.1–1.0 ml) was layered on this sucrose gradient, and ultracentrifugation was performed at 200,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C in a Beckman Sw40Ti rotor. Fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient. The density of each fraction was calculated from the weight and volume. Each fraction was diluted 10-fold and tested for HBcAg and HBcrAg as well as for HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out using magnetic beads coated with polyclonal anti-HBsAg from the “HBV-Direct Mag kit” (JSR Corp., Tokyo) (24Mukaide M. Tanaka Y. Katayose S. Tano H. Murata M. Hikata M. Fujise K. Sakugawa H. Suzuki K. Zaunders J. Nagasawa Y. Toda G. Mizokami M. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2003; 18: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A 200-μl aliquot of sample was mixed with 50 μl of reaction buffer from the kit and 50 μl of a magnetic bead suspension. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation and then magnetically separated. HBcAg and HBcrAg in supernatant and precipitate were measured by EIA. Because some samples contain a large amount of HBsAg, which exceeds the capacity of anti-HBsAg beads, if the precipitated HBcAg ratio was less than 90%, the sample was diluted 10- or 100-fold and then reimmunoprecipitated. Electron Microscopy—A 500-μl aliquot of HBV-positive plasma was subjected to ultracentrifugation on linear 10–50% (w/w) sucrose density gradients. The high density HBcrAg peak fractions (corresponding to Fig. 3A, fractions 23 and 24) and HBcAg peak fractions (corresponding to Fig. 3A, fractions 25 and 26) were separated by the second ultracentrifugation through linear 35–50% (w/w) sucrose density gradients. The fractions were fixed by adding paraformaldehyde solution to a final concentration of 4%. A 4-μl aliquot of each fraction was diluted in 90 μl of distilled water in 5-mm diameter polyallomer centrifugation tubes (Beckman Instruments), and copper grids filmed with Formvar membranes and treated additionally with poly-l-lysine were placed on the bottom of the tubes in the solution. Ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 4 °C, 2 h) was performed in a Beckman TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor to concentrate the virus particles and allow them to attach to the Formvar membranes on the copper grids. Afterward, the attached virus particles were negatively stained with 4% uranyl acetate and observed at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV in an electron microscope (H-7500, Hitachi, Tokyo). Fifteen electron micrographs of the virus particles from each fraction were taken randomly at a magnification of ×80,000. The number of virus particles in the 3.76 μm2 area was then counted on each electron micrograph. The diameters of the virus particles in each fraction were also measured. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE through a 15–25% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Proteins in the gel were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) at 15 V for 45 min. The membrane was blocked and probed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated HB50 (for HBcAg) or HB91 (for HBcrAg) monoclonal antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed and incubated with 5-bro-mo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) for 15 min (for HBcrAg) or 90 min (for HBcAg), respectively. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—A 6-ml aliquot of HBV-positive plasma was subjected to ultracentrifugation on linear 10–60% (w/w) sucrose density gradients, and subsequently the high density HBcrAg peak fractions (Fig. 3A, fractions 23 and 24) were separated by gel filtration through Superose 6 HR (Amersham Biosciences). Void fractions were collected and ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. The precipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) at 15 V for 45 min. Proteins on the membrane were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R250. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 22-kDa band was analyzed using the Procise 494 cLC protein sequencing system at the Apro Life Science Institute, Inc. (Tokushima, Japan). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The 22-kDa protein was purified as described above. The 22-kDa band was cut from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and digested in-gel by trypsin at 35 °C for 20 h. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of the digested sample was performed on a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) in positive ion reflection mode. External mass calibration was performed using four points bracketing the mass range of interest. Results were analyzed using the NCBI non-redundant data base (molecular mass range 15–30 kDa) by the MS-Fit 3.1.1 ProteinProspector 3.2.1 program (University of California), taking into account probable post-translational modifications. LC-MS/MS was performed using a Q-Tof2 (Micromass, Manchester, UK) quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometer in nanoflow LC ionization mode. The analyses were performed at the Apro Life Science Institute, Inc. Statistical Analyses—The virus particle numbers on each electron micrograph were statistically compared by Welch's t test. The diameters of the virus particles were statistically compared by Student's t test. Paired t tests were used to analyze differences between log concentrations of HBcrAg and those of HBcAg. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Specificity of HBcAg and HBcrAg EIAs—The specificity of the HBcAg and HBcrAg assays was confirmed by using rHB-cAg and rHBeAg. The HBcAg assay specifically reacted to rHBcAg but not to rHBeAg (Fig. 2A). The HBcrAg assay reacted equally to rHBcAg and rHBeAg (Fig. 2B). Density Distribution of HBV Precore/Core Proteins—HBV DNA-positive plasma (ProMedDx 9990776, HBsAg-positive, HBeAg-positive, HBV DNA 9.1 log copies/ml) was subjected to ultracentrifugation through a 10–60% (w/w) sucrose density gradient. Fractions were tested for HBcAg, HBcrAg, HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA (Fig. 3A). HBcAg appeared in the high density fractions and peaked in the same fraction (fraction 25) as HBV DNA. HBsAg was distributed in fractions of lower density, and HBeAg was dispersed widely in fractions of much lower density. HBcrAg peaked in fraction 24, slightly lower in density than the HBV DNA and HBcAg peaks in addition to a peak corresponding to HBeAg at much lower density. The concentration of HBcrAg in fraction 24 was 13-fold higher than the concentration of HBcAg in fraction 25. The high density HBcrAg peak was therefore predominantly composed of precore proteins other than core protein. High density HBcrAg fractions (Fig. 3A, fractions 23–26) were reanalyzed under gentler (30–50%) sucrose density gradient sedimentation (Fig. 3B). HBcrAg concentration peaked in lower density fractions than HBcAg and HBV DNA, indicating that high density HBcrAg clearly differs from HBcAg. HBsAg concentration exhibited a shoulder at the HBcrAg peak fraction. Immunoprecipitation by Anti-HBsAg—Sucrose density fractions (Fig. 3A) were immunoprecipitated by the anti-envelope protein HBsAg. Most of the HBcAg (97.5, 97.8, 96.2, and 95.1% from fractions 23–26) was precipitated by anti-HBsAg. Although more than 94% (94.5, 94.1, and 94.3% from fractions 7, 10, 13) of low density HBcrAg was observed in the supernatant, more than 96% (96.2, 96.8, 96.9, and 96.5% from fractions 23–26) of high density HBcrAg was in the precipitate. These data suggest that similar to the core protein, the high density HBcrAg exists in enveloped particles. Stability of HBcrAg Particles—The HBV core forms very stable capsid particles resistant to denaturing pH, temperature, or detergents (25Newman M. Suk F-M. Cajimat M. Chua P.K. Shih C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12950-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Particle fractions of HBV-positive plasma were treated with or without 3% Nonidet P-40 detergent at 37 °C for 30 min and then subjected to gel filtration through Superose 6 HR (exclusion limit = 4 × 107 Da). Fractions were tested for HBcrAg and HBcAg. Regardless of Nonidet P-40 treatment, HBcrAg and HBcAg appeared in the void fractions (Fig. 4), indicating that HBcrAg formed high molecular mass (> 107 Da) particles resistant to 3% Nonidet P-40 treatment, as did the HBcAg. Electron Microscopy—HBcAg and HBcrAg in plasma 9990776 were separated by sequential sucrose density ultracentrifugation. The resultant HBcrAg-rich fraction (fraction A) contained 6.06-fold more HBcrAg than the HBcAg-rich fraction (fraction B) but contained only 3 and 38% of the HBV DNA and HBcAg, respectively, found in fraction B (Table I). Virus particles in the two fractions were concentrated and attached to the copper grids by ultracentrifugation and then negatively stained and observed under the electron microscope. Although virus particles appearing similar to Dane particles were observed in fraction B, more such Dane-like particles were seen in fraction A (Fig. 5), which contained HBV DNA at only 3% of that in fraction B. Fraction A contained 17.9 ± 11.6/3.76 μm2 Dane-like particles, which was significantly more than in fraction B (5.6 ± 3.8/3.76 μm2) (n = 15, p < 0.001) (Table I). The Dane-like particles in fractions A and B were not morphologically distinguishable (Fig. 5) but were quite similar to those reported previously (2Dane D.S. Cameron C.H. Briggs M. Lancet. 1970; 1: 695-698Abstract PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 3Gerin J.L. Ford E.C. Purcell R.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1975; 81: 651-668PubMed Google Scholar, 4Alberti A. Diana S. Scullard G.H.

The mean diameters of the measured particles were 41.5 ± 2.2 nm in fraction A and 42.0 ± 2.2 nm in fraction B (Table I). The mean diameters were not significantly different from one another (n = 60, p = 0.27) and were similar to the sizes reported previously (2Dane D.S. Cameron C.H. Briggs M.

Open table in a new tab Identification of Particle HBcrAg as a 22-kDa Precore Protein (p22cr) Lacking the C-terminal Domain—HBV DNA-positive plasma (BBI PHM935A-14) was subjected to a 10–60% sucrose density gradient and fractionated into 15 fractions. The fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies for HBcAg and HBcrAg (Fig. 6A). HBcAg was detected only in fraction 8 and the original plasma. Conversely, four bands were detected by anti-HBcrAg in plasma. HBeAg and two additional proteins, which were considered HBeAg precursors, were detected in low density fractions by anti-HBcrAg. A 22-kDa protein, which was termed p22cr, was also detected in fraction 8. To confirm whether p22cr was identical to HBcAg, the p22cr band was compared with the neighboring HBcAg band (Fig. 6B). The p22cr protein exhibited slightly higher molecular weight than HBcAg. A fainter HBcAg band was also detected by anti-HBcrAg. Because p22cr did not react with the HB50 anti-HBcAg antibody, SPRRR sequences (positioned at aa 155–174 as three repeats) were presumed absent. Furthermore, p22cr maintained its 22-kDa molecular mass without the N-glycosylation consensus site. These data suggest that p22cr contains a complete or nearly complete precore region, including the signal sequence. The p22cr protein was purified, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed. p22cr showed no significant amino acid signal (data not shown), suggesting that the N terminus of p22cr might be blocked. We then applied mass spectrum analysis. Data from MALDI-TOF MS were analyzed by MS-Fit search using the NCBI non-redundant data base. The search selected 117 of 87,559 entries for the molecular mass range 15–30 kDa. The top 20 matches were all HBV core or precore proteins. Six of 50 input peptide masses matched five precore/core peptides (Table II) that spanned 40% (86 of 212 aa) of the sequence. The N-terminal precore tryptic peptide (peptide 1, aa –28 to aa –9) was found to be N-terminally acetylated and was, therefore, not directly accessible to Edman sequencing. p22cr lacked the first N-terminal methionine of the precore protein. Another peptide, peptide 5, was identified as a precore/core peptide comprising aa 128–150. LC-MS/MS analysis was also applied. Two peptide fractions corresponding to peptides 2 and 5 of Table II were recognized as HBV precore/core proteins. Thus, the p22cr protein was confirmed to be a precore protein from N-terminally acetylated aa –28 to at least aa 150.Table IIMALDI-TOF MS analysis of p22crPeptidem/z observed[M+H]+ matchedΔPeptide sequenceModificationsAmino acidsStartEndppm12233.14382233.118311.4048QLFHLCLIISCSCPTVQASKN-terminally acetylated-28-921237.63881237.6428-3.2413DLLDTASALYR293931913.91671913.892812.4530EALESPEHCSPHHTALR405631984.91531984.9299-7.1477EALESPEHCSPHHTALRAcrylamide-modified Cys405641552.77981552.8045-15.8855DLVVSYVNTNMGLK839652490.36632490.3720-2.2840TPPAYRPPNAPILSTLPETTVVR128150 Open table in a new tab HBcAg and HBcrAg Levels in HBsAg-positive Particles from Chronic Hepatitis B Sera—The levels of precore/core proteins were investigated in HBV particles of chronic hepatitis B sera. Sera were immunoprecipitated by anti-HBsAg, and then levels of HBcAg and HBcrAg in the supernatant and precipitate were measured. More than 91% of the HBcAg was detected in precipitate fractions. HBcrAg in precipitate fractions included p22cr and HBcAg. In the precipitate fractions, HBcAg concentration ranged from 0.08 to 165 ng/ml, whereas HBcrAg ranged from 0.59 to 1,079 ng/ml (Fig. 7A). Log concentrations of HBcrAg were significantly higher than those of HBcAg (p < 0.001). HBcrAg predominated over HBcAg in precipitates from both HBeAg-positive and -negative sera. HBcAg represented only 3.1–37.4% (median 10.5%) of HBcrAg (Fig. 7B), indicating that the remaining p22cr was the dominant precore/core protein in HBsAg-positive particles. Similar results were also obtained from high density fractions of the sucrose gradient in six tested samples. In the present study, we demonstrated that HBV DNA-negative Dane particles are dominant in serum and are composed of a precore protein p22cr, which contains an uncleaved signal sequence and lacks a C-terminal arginine-rich domain. Early electron microscopic and radiolabeling studies have suggested that less than 10% of Dane particles include full cores with viral DNA (3Gerin J.L. Ford E.C. Purcell R.H. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W1967315314,"Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) expression is directly correlated to fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. UCP3 has been hypothesized to facilitate high rates of fatty acid oxidation, but evidence thus far is lacking. Our aim was to investigate the effects of UCP3 overexpression and ablation on fatty acid uptake and metabolism in muscle of mice having congenic backgrounds. In mice constitutively expressing the UCP3 protein (human form) at levels just over twofold higher than normal (230% of wild-type levels), indirect calorimetry demonstrated no differences in total energy expenditure (VO2), but a shift toward increased fat oxidation compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Metabolic efficiency (gram weight gain/kcal ingested) was similar between Ucp3 overexpressors, WT and Ucp3 (-/-) mice. In muscle of Ucp3-tg mice, plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm) content was increased compared with WT mice. Although hormone-sensitive lipase activity was unchanged across the genotypes, there were increases in carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, beta-hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase activities and decreases in intramuscular triacylglycerol in muscle of Ucp3-tg mice. There were no differences in muscle mitochondrial content. High-energy phosphates and total muscle carnitine and CoA were also greater in Ucp3-tg compared with WT mice. Taken together, the findings demonstrate an increased capacity for fat oxidation in the absence of significant increases in thermogenesis in Ucp3-tg mice. Findings from Ucp3 (-/-) mice revealed few differences compared with WT mice, consistent with the possibility of compensatory mechanisms. In conjunction with our observed increases in CoA and carnitine in muscle of Ucp3 overexpressors, the findings support the hypothesized role for Ucp3 in facilitating fatty acid oxidation in muscle."

Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 950-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The Arthropoda display a more limited suite of NRs (3Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 611-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) about 21 of which occur in Drosophila melanogaster. Among these is the receptor for the major arthropod steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, which is involved in the regulation of insect molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction (4Koelle M.R.

The receptor is absent from mammals and is thus potentially useful as a safe insecticide target. Indeed members of the bisacylhydrazine family exert their insecticidal activity by binding to the ecdysone receptor and exhibit remarkable taxonomic order selectivity (10Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Wing K.D. Slawecki R.A. Carlson G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These compounds act selectively on the Lepidoptera and certain Coleoptera (10Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) but are ineffective against insects of the hemipteran order and therefore cannot be used to control certain insect pests. A study (12Elzen G.W. J. Econ. Entomol. 2001; 94: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) of two hemipteran insect predators (Geocoris punctipes and Orius insidiosus) showed that these beneficial (predatory) hemipterans are relatively insensitive to the bisacylhydrazine tebufenozide, whereas lepidopteran insect pests are susceptible. An improved understanding of variation in the structure of the ligand-binding pockets of ecdysone receptors and the basis of the specificity of these compounds at the atomic level of detail of their interaction with the receptor may aid the discovery of novel insecticidal ligands with new defined spectra of activity. Structural studies across the NR family have shown that its members share a common modular structure (13Krust A. Green S. Argos P. Kumar V. Walter P. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 14Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar, 15Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) with the most highly conserved C and E domains being associated with DNA binding and ligand binding, respectively. The NR ligand-binding domains (LBDs) share a fold characterized by 12 α-helices (H1–H12) arranged as an antiparallel three-layer sandwich with a β-hairpin in the loop between helices H5 and H6. The ligand-binding pocket lies in a topologically conserved region within the canonical α-helical sandwich and is formed by side chains of residues from helices H3, H5, H7, H11, and H12 and the β-hairpin. The ecdysone receptor itself is a heterodimer of two partner nuclear receptor proteins, EcR (which contains the binding pocket for ecdysteroids) and the ultraspiracle protein (USP), a homologue of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (5Oro A.E. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6Henrich V.C. Sliter T.J. Lubahn D.B. MacIntyre A. Gilbert L.I.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of the lepidopteran Heliothis virescens ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimer (HvEcR/HvUSP-LBD) have been described recently (16Billas I.M. Iwema T. Garnier J.M. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Moras D. Nature. 2003; 426: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in complex with the ecdysteroid ponasterone A (PonA, 25-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone) and with the non-steroidal bisacylhydrazine agonist BYI06830. PonA is identical to the native ligand (20-hydroxyecdysone) except that it lacks a hydroxyl group at the C-25 position so its mode of binding to the EcR-LBD likely mimics that of 20-hydroxyecdysone. The BYI06830-bound structure demonstrates that the ecdysteroid-binding pocket of the HvEcR-LBD distorts to allow the binding of this compound. In particular, accommodation of the 1,4-dioxan ring of the compound requires the opening up of a cleft between helices H7 and H10 at one end of the pocket as well as side chain and backbone rearrangements of residues at the opposite end of the pocket to fill in the otherwise unoccupied volume of the ecdysteroid-binding pocket. This mode of binding was entirely unanticipated and demonstrated that the ecdysteroid-binding pocket of this EcR-LBD has a level of flexibility not normally seen in nuclear receptor LBDs. It was proposed (16Billas I.M. Iwema T. Garnier J.M. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Moras D. Nature. 2003; 426: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that the relative specificity of BYI06830 for the lepidopteran EcR relates to amino acid variation at a site corresponding to Val-384 in HvEcR that is substituted by methionine in other insect orders (including the hemipterans). The presence of a larger methionine side chain at this position in the latter orders was argued to have the potential to interfere either directly or indirectly with the binding of bisacylhydrazine compounds such as BYI06830. The structure of HvUSP-LBD in its heterodimeric form is essentially identical to that of the HvUSP-LBD monomer (17Clayton G.M. Peak-Chew S.Y. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Billas I.M. Moulinier L. Rochel N. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7465-7474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that of the D. melanogaster USP-LBD monomer (17Clayton G.M. Peak-Chew S.Y. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (DmUSP-LBD). In all of these USP-LBD structures, lipid occupies volume that coincides in part with that of the canonical NR-LBD binding pocket with the lipid head group protruding from the protein surface. We report here that much of the selectivity of the bisacylhydrazine insecticides can be observed at the level of binding to purified recombinant LBD heterodimers of the ecdysone receptor derived via a baculovirus expression system. In this regard our results showed that the bisacylhydrazine compound tebufenozide has a much lower affinity for the ecdysone receptor of the hemipteran insect Bemisia tabaci (sweet potato whitefly) than it does for the corresponding receptor of the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera, thereby reflecting results obtained in vivo and in the field (10Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Wing K.D. Slawecki R.A. Carlson G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 12Elzen G.W. J. Econ. Entomol. 2001; 94: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also determined the three-dimensional structure of the ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimer of B. tabaci in complex with PonA. Comparison of our structure with those of the H. virescens ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimer revealed that regions of the ligand-binding pocket not in contact with the hormone vary significantly between the two structures. We tentatively propose that these differences at the atomic level of detail underlie the selectivity of the bisacylhydrazine insecticides. This first three-dimensional structure of a hemipteran ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimer is of potential value for the molecular design of new insecticides with selective toxicity for plant-sucking bugs. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Ecdysone Receptor LBDs— The cloning, baculovirus-driven expression, and purification of the recombinant ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimer and the corresponding heterodimers from the cloned ecdysone receptors of Lucilia cuprina (Diptera), Myzus persicae (Hemiptera), and H. armigera (Lepidoptera) will be described in detail elsewhere but are in part based on the methods used for the L. cuprina receptor (19Hannan G.N. Hill R.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Hannan G.N. Hill R.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of the B. tabaci receptor, cDNAs encoding BtEcR-LBD and BtUSP-LBD were screened out of a high quality B. tabaci cDNA library in Lambda ZapII (Stratagene) using the corresponding homologous C domain probes PCR-amplified from B. tabaci genomic DNA. Segments encoding the D and E domains of BtEcR (residues from Pro-120 to Ser-416) and BtUSP (residues Lys-246 to Ser-496) were subcloned into pFastBac Dual (Invitrogen) with a hexahistidine-encoding tag incorporated N-terminal to the BtEcR segment and a FLAG-encoding tag N-terminal to the BtUSP segment. Analogous constructs were prepared for expression of the ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimers from the other insects. The segments were transposed into a bacmid for baculovirus construction and expression in Hi-5 insect cells. Expressed recombinant ecdysteroid-binding protein was saturated with PonA (a gift from Denis Horn) and purified in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and PonA by nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography followed by high performance gel filtration (with >60% yield for each step). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of freshly purified ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimers showed bands corresponding to the full-length recombinant polypeptides. Competitive Inhibition of Ligand Binding—The binding of 1.3 nm [3H]ponasterone A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to purified recombinant receptor LBD heterodimer was measured in the presence of different concentrations of non-radioactive bisacylhydrazine insecticide RH5992 (tebufenozide, N-tert-butyl-N′-(4-ethylbenzoyl)-3,5-dimethylbenzohydrazide). After 4 h at 21 °C, bound tracer was measured using a modification of a standard method (4Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and expressed relative to that in RH5992-free assays. The resulting activity values were corrected for any effects of the dimethyl sulfoxide used as solvent for RH5992 (<1% (v/v) final concentration). IC50 values were obtained from smooth curves drawn through the data points, and from these Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (21Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals of the PonA-complexed B. tabaci ecdysone receptor LBD were grown by vapor diffusion (22McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. Wiley, New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar) using as well solution 1.0 m NH4H2PO4, 4.5% (w/v) d-(+)-trehalose dihydrate, 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1 m NaHEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Hanging drops contained 1 μl of well solution plus 1 μl of protein solution at 40 mg/ml in 0.23 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm NaN3, 3 μm PonA, and 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Crystallization trays were maintained at room temperature in a nitrogen environment. Crystals appeared after 3 months and had a maximum dimension of 0.5 mm. SDS-PAGE analysis of crystals and of stored protein revealed polypeptides of somewhat lower molecular weight than expected, presumably the result of progressive proteolysis. N-terminal sequencing of major bands extracted from the gel (data not shown) succeeded in identifying one band as corresponding to a sequence starting at BtUSP residue Leu-285, i.e. midway through helix H1. Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—A single crystal of the PonA-complexed B. tabaci ecdysone receptor LBD was transferred to a solution identical in composition to the well solution but with 30% (v/v) glycerol incorporated as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were then collected at –160 °C using an R-AXIS IV image plate detector (Rigaku-MSC) mounted on a rotating anode M18XHF-SRA x-ray generator (Siemens). All data processing was conducted with HKL (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The relevant statistics are shown in Table I. The crystal belonged to space group P43212 with a = b = 143.01 Å, c = 84.01 Å and diffracted to ∼3.0-Å resolution.Table IX-ray data collection and crystallographic refinement statisticsNo. of frames302Oscillation increment (°)0.5No. of measurements191,046No. of reflections16,756Measurement multiplicity11.4 (10.5)aNumbers in parentheses refer to statistics in the highest resolution shell (3.11-3.07 Å).Resolution range (Å)30.0-3.07Completeness (%)99.9 (100.0)I/σ(I)19.3 (5.6)RsymbRsym = ΣhΣi|Iih - 〈Ih〉|/ΣhΣi|Iih|.0.13 (0.51)RcrystcRcryst = Σh|Fhobs - kFhcalc|/Σh|Fhobs|.0.203Rfree (5% of total reflections)0.275r.m.s.d.dRoot mean square deviation. from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.012Bond angles (°)1.6No. of protein atoms3,475No. of ligand + solvent atoms53a Numbers in parentheses refer to statistics in the highest resolution shell (3.11-3.07 Å).b Rsym = ΣhΣi|Iih - 〈Ih〉|/ΣhΣi|Iih|.c Rcryst = Σh|Fhobs - kFhcalc|/Σh|Fhobs|.d Root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The initial structure was determined using molecular replacement. As this task was performed prior to the structure of the H. virescens ecdysone receptor LBD becoming available, molecular replacement used as search object a homology model of the B. tabaci ecdysone receptor LBD built from the structure of the RAR/RXR-LBD heterodimer (24Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was performed using the program MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) within CCP4 (26Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12934) Google Scholar), respectively, and yielded a model encompassing residues Pro-179 to Val-415 of BtEcR and Val-300 to Ser-492 of BtUSP (i.e. encompassing helices H1–H12 of the BtEcR-LBD and helices H3–H12 of the BtUSP-LBD). The ligand PonA was clearly visible within the BtEcR-LBD, and the orientation and location of the four-member ring complex and the alkyl chain could be modeled unambiguously. Also included in the model were three phosphate ions, presumably arising from the solution used for crystallization of the heterodimer. The final crystallographic refinement statistics (Table I) are acceptable given the resolution limit of the data. PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) revealed that only two residues (BtEcR Ile-180 and BtUSP Thr-363) lay in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code 1Z5X. Structural Analysis—Protein cavity analysis and cavity volume computation were conducted with VOIDOO (30Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) and O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) using a 1.4-Å probe radius unless otherwise stated. A 1.2-Å probe radius was used to detect features not detected by the larger probe radius cavity calculations (32Hubbard S.J. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1011-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Particular care was taken in detecting cavities connected to the surface using the “atom fattening” van der Waals growth factor parameter within VOIDOO. Protein structural overlays were computed using LSQMAN (33Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar) or O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), molecular surface areas were computed using the program MS (33Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar), surface hydrophobicity analysis was carried out using AREAIMOL (26Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), atom contact analysis was done using CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Binding of the RH5992 to Cloned Ecdysone Receptor LBDs—Fig. 1 shows a direct comparison of the ability of the bisacylhydrazine insecticide RH5992 to compete with tritiated PonA in vitro for binding to the purified recombinant ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimers from lepidopteran, dipteran, and hemipteran ecdysone receptors. The competition curves showed that the compound RH5992 has highest affinity for the heterodimer of the lepidopteran insect H. armigera (Ki ∼ 4nm), intermediate affinity for the dipteran insect L. cuprina (Ki ∼ 240 nm), and minimal affinity for the hemipteran insects B. tabaci (Ki ≥ 480 μm) and M. persicae (Ki ≥ 140 μm). The Ki values we obtained with the recombinant L. cuprina and H. armigera heterodimers are close to the dissociation constants reported for RH5992 with cellular extracts from other dipteran (192 nm) and lepidopteran insects (3–13 nm), respectively (10Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Thus the ranking of the affinities we obtained for each taxonomic order mimics that observed in vivo (10Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Wing K.D. Slawecki R.A. Carlson G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Tertiary Structure of the B. tabaci Ecdysone Receptor LBD Heterodimer—Our atomic model of the B. tabaci ecdysone receptor LBD heterodimer encompasses residues Pro-179 to Val-415 of the BtEcR polypeptide and residues Val-300 to Ser-492 of the BtUSP polypeptide (Figs. 2 and 3) and has been crystallographically refined to a resolution of 3.1 Å with an R-factor of 0.203 (Rfree = 0.275 (35Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar)). Both the BtEcR-LBD and the BtUSP-LBD have the anticipated canonical NR fold. The β-sheet of the BtEcR-LBD is, like that of HvEcR-LBD, elaborated by a short, additional β-strand (denoted s0) N-terminal to the first canonical β-strand. Helix H12 of BtEcR-LBD is in the canonical agonist conformation (15Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and PonA is bound in a totally enclosed pocket within the α-helical sandwich of the BtEcR-LBD. The BtEcR-LBD pocket exhibits a J-shaped architecture (Fig. 4) composed of an elongated portion containing the ligand PonA (the “major pocket”) and an additional curved portion (which we term the “ancillary pocket”). The average temperature factor for the PonA atoms is 34 Å2 compared with 42 Å2 for the 19 BtEcR atoms within 3.5 Å of the ligand, implying that PonA is well ordered within the protein environment. The interactions between BtEcR-LBD and PonA include seven potential hydrogen bonds as well as a large number of hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4). These interactions are listed in Table II and will be discussed in more detail in the following section. The contribution of the various residues to the ancillary pocket is listed in Table III.Fig. 3Stereoviews of overlaid Cα backbone traces of the B. tabaci and H. virescens ecdysone receptor LBDs.a, BtEcR-LBD (black lines) and HvEcR-LBD (gray lines). The location of the ligand PonA is effectively identical in both LBD structures and is shown in ball-and-stick representation. b, BtUSP-LBD (black lines) and HvUSP-LBD (gray lines). Also shown is the location of the bound phospholipid in the HvUSP-LBD structure (ball-and-stick representation). The absence of helix H1 and the helix H1 to helix H3 connection is apparent in the BtUSP-LBD as well as the movement of the helix H6 to helix H7 loop and the helix H10 to helix H12 loop into the volume occupied by lipid in the HvUSP-LBD structure. The canonical α-helices H1–H12 are labeled in both a and b as are the observed N and C termini. The figure was produced using MOLSCRIPT (54Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

https://openalex.org/W2032942231,"Human chromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage in being the product of a head-to-head fusion of two intermediate-sized ancestral chromosomes. Chromosome 4 has received attention primarily related to the search for the Huntington's disease gene, but also for genes associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and a form of muscular dystrophy. Here we present approximately 237 million base pairs of sequence for chromosome 2, and 186 million base pairs for chromosome 4, representing more than 99.6% of their euchromatic sequences. Our initial analyses have identified 1,346 protein-coding genes and 1,239 pseudogenes on chromosome 2, and 796 protein-coding genes and 778 pseudogenes on chromosome 4. Extensive analyses confirm the underlying construction of the sequence, and expand our understanding of the structure and evolution of mammalian chromosomes, including gene deserts, segmental duplications and highly variant regions."
https://openalex.org/W2003287029,"In mammals, rapid mRNA turnover directed by AU-rich elements (AREs) is mediated by selective association of cellular ARE-binding proteins. These trans-acting factors display overlapping RNA substrate specificities and may act to either stabilize or destabilize targeted transcripts; however, the mechanistic features of AREs that promote preferential binding of one trans-factor over another are not well understood. Here, we describe a hairpin-like structure adopted by the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA that modulates its affinity for selected ARE-binding proteins. In particular, association of the mRNA-destabilizing factor p37AUF1 was strongly inhibited by adoption of the higher order ARE structure, whereas binding of the inducible heat shock protein Hsp70 was less severely compromised. By contrast, association of the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR was only minimally affected by changes in ARE folding. Consistent with the inverse relationship between p37AUF1 binding affinity and the stability of ARE folding, mutations that stabilized the ARE hairpin also inhibited its ability to direct rapid mRNA turnover in transfected cells. Finally, phylogenetic analyses and structural modeling indicate that TNFα mRNA sequences flanking the ARE are highly conserved and may stabilize the hairpin fold in vivo.

The rate of mRNA turnover is highly variable among the cytoplasmic mRNA population and thus plays a significant role in regulating the steady-state concentrations of individual mRNA species available to program protein synthesis. In mammalian cells, different transcripts exhibit a range of decay kinetics spanning over 2 orders of magnitude, largely due to the presence of discrete cis-acting elements contained within each mRNA (1Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 2Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Most mRNAs encoding cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and proto-oncogenes are inherently unstable, often exhibiting cytoplasmic half-lives of 1 h or less. Rapid turnover of these transcripts is principally due to the activity of AU-rich elements (AREs), 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; Cy3, cyanine-3; Dox, doxycycline; Fl, fluorescein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TTP, tristetraprolin; UTR, untranslated region. 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; Cy3, cyanine-3; Dox, doxycycline; Fl, fluorescein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TTP, tristetraprolin; UTR, untranslated region. a broad family of mRNA-destabilizing sequences localized to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of many labile mRNAs (3Chen C-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). The intrinsic lability of ARE-containing mRNAs enables their cytoplasmic concentrations to be rapidly modulated following acute changes in their synthetic rates (4Ross J. Microbiol.

Additionally, modulation of ARE-directed mRNA decay pathways by selected signal transduction systems can regulate the cytoplasmic levels of some mRNAs independent of, or in concert with, changes in the synthetic rate (6Frevel M.A.E.

Recent studies, however, have indicated that different AREs or subdomains thereof may be targeted by distinct populations of ARE-binding proteins. For example, whereas Hu proteins bind relatively promiscuously to RNA substrates in vitro, with little selectivity beyond a general preference for sequences rich in uridylate residues (21Wang X.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7268-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). By contrast, TTP binding to RNA is highly discriminatory, requiring an AUUUA or AUUUUA motif within a U-rich tract for high affinity interactions (26Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M.

The mRNA-destabilizing factor AUF1 exists as a family of four protein isoforms generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing and are named according to their apparent molecular weights (28Wagner B.J.

The p45AUF1 and p42AUF1 isoforms are principally nuclear, whereas p40AUF1 and p37AUF1 are generally present in both nuclei and cytoplasm (29Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T.

To date, the p40AUF1 and p37AUF1 isoforms have been most closely associated with the regulation of ARE-directed mRNA turnover (12Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); however, the specific features of RNA substrates that discriminate high from low affinity AUF1 targets remain unclear. p37AUF1 binds U-rich RNA substrates by sequential association of protein dimers (37Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and induces local changes in RNA conformation upon binding (38Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Moutafis M. Sinha S. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, p37AUF1 binding to the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA is inhibited by the presence of Mg2+in vitro, concomitant with the adoption of a condensed but undefined RNA structure (33Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Moutafis M. Sinha S. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both inhibition of AUF1 binding and RNA structural condensation resulting from Mg2+ treatment were specific for the ARE sequence, since the cation did not significantly alter the affinity of p37AUF1 binding to polyuridylate substrates, nor did Mg2+ induce substantial conformational changes in these RNA ligands (33Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggested that one or more higher order RNA structures involving the TNFα ARE could inhibit association of AUF1 and, by extension, that local higher order RNA structures involving AREs may serve as significant determinants directing their binding preferences for different trans-acting factors. In this study, we have used structural modeling, nuclease mapping, and fluorescence-based approaches to define a candidate folded structure for the TNFα ARE in solution. Quantitative assessment of the thermodynamic consequences of selected site-directed mutations within the TNFα ARE further supports the proposed folded model. Stabilization of the folded ARE structure potently inhibited binding of p37AUF1 to this element in vitro. However, trans-factor binding was not universally responsive to the folded state of the TNFα ARE. The 70-kDa inducible heat shock protein, Hsp70, also associates with U-rich RNA substrates (39Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but its ARE-binding activity was significantly less sensitive to the stability of RNA folding. More dramatically, binding of the mRNA-stabilizing factor HuR to the ARE substrate was virtually independent of ARE folding. The preference of folded ARE substrates for HuR over p37AUF1 was consistent with the results of transfected cell studies, where ARE-directed mRNA turnover was inhibited by a mutation that stabilized ARE folding. Taken together, these data indicated that the potential of an ARE to form higher order structures can significantly influence its selectivity for trans-acting factors, thus contributing to modulation of mRNA decay kinetics in cells. Finally, phylogenetic sequence- and structure-based analyses indicate that TNFα mRNA 3′-UTR sequences flanking the ARE may serve to stabilize an extended folded structure in vivo and that this regulatory element probably exists in similarly folded RNA conformations throughout mammals. From these data, we propose that folded RNA structures involving the TNFα ARE constitute important determinants of RNA-binding activity for selected ARE-binding proteins, in some cases possibly as significant in magnitude and scope as RNA primary structural information. RNA Substrates—Synthesis, deprotection of 2′-hydroxyl groups, and purification of RNA substrates were performed by Dharmacon Research or Integrated DNA Technologies. The oligoribonucleotide ARE(38) includes the core ARE sequence from TNFα mRNA (5′-GUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAG-3′). Selected site-directed mutants are identified where applicable. 5′-linked cyanine-3 (Cy3) and 3′-linked fluorescein (Fl) groups are indicated by relevant prefixes and suffixes, respectively, where applicable. Lyophilized RNA pellets were reconstituted in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8). RNA yields and fluorophore labeling efficiencies were quantified by absorbance spectroscopy, incorporating fractional contributions of fluorescent dyes to A260 for RNA substrates containing Fl and/or Cy3 moieties as previously described (38Wilson G.M.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For fluorescence experiments, RNA substrate concentrations were based on the abundance of Fl-conjugated RNA, which typically exceeded 90% of the total synthesis. For experiments requiring 5′-32P-labeled RNA, 5′-hydroxyl RNA substrates were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP to specific activities of 3-5 × 103 cpm/fmol as described (37Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Standard DNA subcloning techniques were used to modify the bacterial expression plasmid pBAD/HisB (Invitrogen) to permit expression of fusion proteins containing the N-terminal peptide sequence MSHHHHHHGT. The resulting plasmid was termed pBAD/HT. A cDNA encoding human p37AUF1 was subcloned immediately downstream of this sequence tag to yield plasmid pB/HT-p37AUF1. All constructs were verified by restriction digests and automated DNA sequencing. The pB/HT-p37AUF1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells, and expression of the encoded His6-p37AUF1 recombinant protein was induced by arabinose. The His6-p37AUF1 protein was purified from lysed cells using Ni2+-affinity chromatography as described (33Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The His6-Hsp70 protein was similarly expressed from plasmid pBAD/HisC-hsp70 and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described (39Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the open reading frame of HuR was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA purified from the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and then subcloned into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). Following sequence verification, a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HuR chimeric protein was expressed in E. coli TOP10 cells by induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography using a GSTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. GST lacking the HuR moiety was similarly expressed from unmodified pGEX-3X and purified. All recombinant proteins were quantified using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels against a titration of bovine serum albumin. Bioinformatics, RNA Structural Modeling, and Nuclease Mapping— Sequence alignments were prepared using the ClustalW program at the San Diego Supercomputer Center Biology Workbench (available on the World Wide Web at www.workbench.sdsc.edu). Candidate local RNA secondary structures were identified using mFold version 2.3 (available on the World Wide Web at www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/~zukerm) (41Zuker M.

Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Nuclease mapping experiments were performed using a modification of the RNase V1 endonuclease protocol provided by Ambion. Briefly, 5′-32P-labeled RNA substrates (25 fmol) were incubated in a final volume of 10 μl containing 25 mm HEPES·HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 4 μg of yeast tRNA. Where indicated, MgCl2 was included to 5 mm. In reactions lacking Mg2+, 0.5 mm EDTA was added to scavenge residual divalent cations. After equilibration at 25 °C, RNase A (0.045 Kunitz U; Sigma) was added, and incubation continued for 5 min. Reactions were stopped, and RNA fragments were precipitated using the inactivation/precipitation buffer (Ambion). Reaction products were fractionated on a 12% denaturing acrylamide gel, which was then dried and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Single base RNA ladders were prepared by hydroxide ion-mediated cleavage following protocols provided by Ambion. FRET-based Assays of RNA Folding—Folding events involving RNA substrates were monitored by changes in the distance between 3′-linked Fl donor and 5′-linked Cy3 acceptor moieties using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The efficiency of FRET (EFRET) is inversely related to the sixth power of the scalar distance (r) between a fluorescent donor and acceptor (Equation 1). R0 is the Förster distance, defined as the distance between a donor-acceptor pair where FRET efficiency is 50% (43Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 44Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed.

EFRET=R06/(R06+r6)(Eq. 1) R0 for the Fl-Cy3 donor-acceptor pair linked to single-stranded nucleic acids has been calculated as 55.7 Å (45Norman D.G. Grainger R.J. Uhrín D. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6317-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). EFRET between donor and acceptor fluorophores may be resolved using Equation 2 (44Lakowicz J.R.

EFRET=1−(FDA/FD)(Eq. 2) However, without quantitative acceptor labeling, EFRET will be under-estimated due to the presence of RNA molecules labeled only with Fl within the (Cy3 + Fl)-labeled RNA substrate population. To correct for this, donor emission from (Cy3 + Fl)-labeled RNA substrates (FCy-Fl) was interpreted by Equation 3, where fDA is the efficiency of acceptor labeling, in this case Cy3 (typically 75-90%). FCy−F1=FDA·fDA+FD(1−fDA)(Eq. 3) Incorporating this function into Equation 2 and substituting FD = FFl yields Equation 4. EFRET=1−[FCy−F1−FF1(1−fDA)FF1·fDA](Eq. 4) The ability of Mg2+ to stabilize folding of RNA substrates was quantified by measuring EFRET as a function of Mg2+ concentration at constant temperature essentially as described (38Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Moutafis M. Sinha S. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with EFRET calculated using Equation 4. Considering the conformation of the RNA substrate to be in equilibrium between an open, cation-free state and a folded, cation-associated state across a titration of Mg2+ concentrations allows these data to be resolved by Equation 5, derived from a variant of the Hill model (47Heilman-Miller S.L. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). EFRET=Eu+(Ef−Eu)×[([Mg2+]/[Mg2+]1/2)h1+([Mg2+]/[Mg2+]1/2)h](Eq. 5) Here, Eu and Ef represent the intrinsic EFRET values for the open and folded RNA states, respectively, [Mg2+]1/2 is the concentration of cation that yields 50% folded RNA, and h is the Hill coefficient. The thermodynamic stability of RNA folding was evaluated by thermal denaturation in paired experiments containing either (Cy3 + Fl) double-labeled (for FCy-Fl) or Fl single-labeled (for FFl) oligoribonucleotides. Samples contained 20 nm RNA in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8), 50 mm KCl, 1 μg/μl heparin, and 0.1 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, Mg2+ was added as MgCl2, whereas samples lacking Mg2+ contained 0.5 mm EDTA. Samples were equilibrated in solution for 5 min at 10 °C, and then fluorescence was measured (λex = 490 nm, λem = 518 nm, 5-nm band pass) in 0.5 °C intervals as the temperature increased from 10 to 70 °C at 1 °C/min using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments) with a Peltier temperature controller and in-cell temperature probe. Thermodynamic parameters describing the folding of RNA substrates were extracted from the partial derivative of EFRET (ΔT = 4 °C) as a function of temperature. For a given structural transition, the reaction temperature yielding a local maximum in the derivative plot was defined as the apparent melting temperature (Tm), whereas the temperature above Tm yielding half-maximal derivative height was defined as T2. Using these parameters, the change in the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHVH) for a unimolecular RNA structural transition is given by Equation 6 (48Breslauer K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 221-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ΔHVH=−3.5(1/Tm)−(1/T2)(Eq. 6) Taking ΔHVH together with the experimentally derived Tm thus allows the transition free energy (ΔGfold) to be calculated as a function of reaction temperature (T) using Equation 7 (48Breslauer K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 221-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ΔGfold=ΔHVH[1−TTm](Eq. 7) Protein-RNA Binding Assays—Qualitative assessment of binding events between 32P-labeled RNA substrates and recombinant proteins was performed using gel mobility shift assays essentially as described (49Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that Mg2+ was not included in binding reactions. Protein-RNA binding affinity was quantitatively measured by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-conjugated RNA substrates across a titration of protein essentially as described (33Wilson G.M.

Concomitant measurement of total fluorescence emission for each reaction demonstrated that association of either His6-p37AUF1, His6-Hsp70, or GST-HuR with Fl-labeled RNA substrates did not significantly affect their fluorescence quantum yield (data not shown). AUF1 proteins interact with the TNFα ARE by sequential association of protein dimers yielding a tetrameric protein complex on the RNA substrate (P4R). Assembly of this complex as a function of protein dimer concentration ([P2]) is thus resolved by tandem association equilibrium constants (33Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); K1 describes the initial interaction between the RNA substrate and a protein dimer, whereas K2 describes the interaction between the RNA·protein dimer complex (P2R) and a subsequent protein dimer. Under conditions of constant quantum yield and limiting RNA substrate (i.e. [RNA-Fl]total < 1/K1), K1 and K2 are derived from the total measured anisotropy of the Fl-conjugated RNA substrate (At) as a function of protein concentration by Equation 8, At=AR+AP2RK1[P2]+AP4RK1K2[P2]21+K1[P2]+K1K2[P2]2(Eq. 8) where AR, AP2R, and AP4R represent the intrinsic anisotropy values of the free RNA, the RNA·protein dimer complex, and the RNA·protein tetramer complex, respectively. AR is measured directly from binding reactions lacking protein (n ≥ 4), whereas all other constants are resolved by nonlinear regression using PRISM version 3.03 software (GraphPad). The formation of equimolar complexes between His6-Hsp70 and Fl-labeled TNFα ARE substrates was resolved using a binary association function (Equation 9) as described previously (39Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At=AR+APRK[P]1+K[P](Eq. 9) Quantitative assessment of binding between GST-HuR and Fl-labeled RNA substrates was similarly preformed using fluorescence anisotropy, but with two significant variations. First, preliminary on-rate analyses indicated significantly slower association kinetics for GST-HuR versus His6-p37AUF1 or His6-Hsp70 binding to ARE substrates (data not shown). Accordingly, RNA-binding reactions containing GST-HuR were incubated for a minimum of 1 h prior to measurement of fluorescence anisotropy. Second, the cooperative nature of GST-HuR binding to ARE substrates (detailed u"

A high molecular weight fraction of hop bract extract (HBT) also inhibited CT ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. We report here the effect of those polyphenols on the binding and entry of CT into Vero cells. Binding of CT to Vero cells or to ganglioside GM1, a CT receptor, was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by HBT and applephenon but not RG-tannin. These observations were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using Cy3-labeled CT. Following toxin binding to cells, applephenon, HBT, and RG-tannin suppressed its internalization. HBT or applephenon precipitated CT, CTA, and CTB from solution, creating aggregates larger than 250 kDa. In contrast, RG-tannin precipitated CT poorly; it formed complexes with CT, CTA, or CTB, which were demonstrated with sucrose density gradient centrifugation and molecular weight exclusion filters. In agreement, CTA blocked the inhibition of CT internalization by RG-tannin. These data suggest that some plant polyphenols, similar to applephenon and HBT, bind CT, forming large aggregates in solution or, perhaps, on the cell surface and thereby suppress CT binding and internalization. In contrast, RG-tannin binding to CT did not interfere with its binding to Vero cells or GM1, but it did inhibit internalization.

Natural products, like herbal medications, have long been used to treat diarrheal disease and are useful therapeutic agents. Recently, inhibition of the action of bacterial toxins by plant polyphenols, composed of highly condensed tannins, has been reported (14Saito T. Miyake M. Toba M. Okamatsu H. Shimizu S. Noda M. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Oi H. Matsuura D. Miyake M. Ueno M. Takai I. Yamamoto T. Kubo M. Moss J. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Department of Health and Human Disease, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). These include applephenon, HBT, and RG-tannin, derived from apple, hop bract, and Daio (Rhei rhizoma), respectively. RG-tannin and applephenon suppress CT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and CT-induced fluid accumulation in rabbit or mouse ileal loops (14Saito T. Miyake M. Toba M. Okamatsu H. Shimizu S. Noda M. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Oi H. Matsuura D. Miyake M. Ueno M. Takai I. Yamamoto T. Kubo M. Moss J. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RG-tannin is most likely a procyanidine polymer (mainly 8-mer) containing galloyl groups. Applephenon is composed of chlorogenic acid, catechins, and condensed catechins and procyanidins. Its anti-CT activity was attributed to the highly condensed tannin fraction (14Saito T. Miyake M. Toba M. Okamatsu H. Shimizu S. Noda M. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), apple-condensed tannin (ACT), which contains procyanidine polymers (less than 15-mer and mostly 3–6-mer) (17Yanagida A. Kanda T. Takahashi T. Kamimura A. Hamazono T. Honda S. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 890: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HBT was extracted from hop bract polyphenols, which contain procyanidine polymers (about 10–30-mers) with molecular weights around 6,000. HBT inhibited Shiga toxin 1 (Stx-1), which is produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (16Tagashira, M., Yahiro, K., Morinaga, N., Moss, J., and Noda, M. (2003) US-Japan Cholera and Other Bacterial Enteric Infections, 38th Joint Panel Meeting, pp. 45-48, U. S. Department of Health and Human Disease, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). Stx-1 is another AB5 toxin with B subunits that bind to Gb3 globotriaosyl ceramide on the cell surface (18Lindberg A.A. Brown J.E. Stromberg N. Westling-Ryd M. Schultz J.E. Karlsson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lingwood C.A. Law H. Richardson S. Petric M. Brunton J.L. De Grandis S. Karmali M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to its endocytosis. The A subunit of Stx-1 is a 33-kDa protein with RNA N-glycosidase activity that blocks protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. HBT interfered with Stx-1-induced inhibition of protein synthesis and lethal toxicity in a mouse inoculated with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli producing Stx-1. HBT also suppressed CT ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. It is not clear, however, whether inhibition of fluid accumulation by RG-tannin or applephenon is, in fact, the result of suppression of CT enzymatic activity. Because polyphenols are generally believed to precipitate proteins (20Haslam E. J. Nat. Prod. 1996; 59: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 21Charlton A.J. Baxter N.J. Khan M.L. Moir A.J. Haslam E. Davies A.P. Williamson M.P. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 1593-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), we thought that RG-tannin, applephenon, and/or HBT might act by preventing CT binding to or internalization by cells. We report here that RG-tannin did not inhibit CT binding to cells but formed complexes with CT and thereby suppressed internalization from the cell surface. On the other hand, HBT or applephenon formed large aggregates with CT that interfered with its binding to and internalization by cells, indicating that the mechanism of RG-tannin action was different from those used by HBT or applephenon. Reagents—CT and CTA were purchased from List Biological Laboratories, and CTB was from Calbiochem. Applephenon 50 and ACT were kindly provided by Dr. Yanagida (Nikka Whisky Distilling Co., Ltd.). HBT was prepared by Asahi Beer Co., and RG-tannnin was prepared by Tsumura & Co. Applephenon, RG-tannin, and HBT were dissolved in PBS, and HBT was passed through a 0.22-μm membrane filter. 2-Mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, HRP-conjugated streptavidin, and BM blue substrate for peroxidase were purchased from Aldrich, Amersham Biosciences, and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Cell Viability—The number of viable cells was determined using a cell counting kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), and viability of cells was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion. The cell counting kit is based on the same principle as the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (22Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 16: 55-63Crossref Scopus (46516) Google Scholar). Cells, grown on a 96-well plate, were incubated with 10 μl of cell counting reagent (company-supplied) at 37 °C for 1 h before color was quantified at 450 nm. Absorbance at 450 nm as a measure of cell number correlated well with the number counted directly using a hemacytometer. For Trypan blue dye exclusion assays, cells were detached from the plate by incubation with 0.25% of trypsin plus 0.02% EDTA. Equal volumes of cell suspension and 0.3% trypan blue in PBS were mixed before total and stained (dead) cells (at least 100 cells) were counted. Cell Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Vero cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum in 96-well plates overnight. Biotin-labeled CT was prepared according to the supplier's instructions using EZ-Link Sulfo-N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Approximately 84% of the label was incorporated into CTA. Cells were washed with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.1% of BSA (HBSS-BSA) three times before the addition of 100 μl of 20 nm CT in HBSS-BSA, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, washed three times with cold HBSS, and fixed for 20 min with 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h, and HRP was detected with BM blue substrate. After a 20-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4, and color was measured at 450 nm. Background absorbance was subtracted. Between each step, cells were washed with PBS three times. Internalization of toxin was quantified as follows. After binding of biotin-labeled CT and washing to remove unbound toxin, HBSS-BSA, warmed to 37 °C, was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time before washing immediately with cold HBSS, fixation, and addition of 0.5 m 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, which does not enter cells, to reduce disulfide bonds and release biotin from CT bound to the cell surface. After additional incubation at room temperature for 30 min, cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and treated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin as described above to quantify internalized toxin. GM1 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—25 μl of GM1 ganglioside (10 μg/ml in ethanol) were added to each well of a 96-well plate, which was incubated at 37 °C until the ethanol had evaporated, and thereafter, the assay was performed at room temperature. The plate was washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) and blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in TPBS. Then 100 μl of biotin-labeled CT (5 nm) without or with polyphenols as indicated were added, and after incubation for 1 h, the plate was washed to remove unbound toxin before the addition of HRP-streptavidin and incubation for 1 h. HRP was detected using BM blue. Between each step, the plate was washed three times. Fluorescein-labeled CT Binding and Internalization—CT was labeled with Cy3 using a Fluorolink-Ab Cy3 labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded in 6-well plates containing coverslips and incubated at 37 °C overnight. After washing, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in HBSS-BSA containing Cy3-labeled CT with or without polyphenols (200 μg/ml). Then cells were washed to remove unbound toxin, before fixation or incubation at 37 °C for 10 min with HBSS-BSA containing polyphenols. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and inspected by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus GX-FLA). Precipitation of CT—Polyphenols as indicated were incubated with 20 nm biotin-labeled CT in PBS at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation (14,700 × g, 15 min). Supernatant was discarded, and pellet was dissolved in 80 μl of SDS-sample buffer (0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). After boiling for 5 min, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 14% gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. At the same time, standard samples of biotin-labeled CT (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 μg) were treated in parallel and used to quantify recovery. Biotin was detected using HRP-conjugated streptavidin followed by ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Bioscience). Chemiluminescence was detected by LAS-1000, and the density of each sample was quantified using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). The amount of CT precipitated was calculated as CTA, because most of the label was found in CTA. Data were expressed as a percentage of the total CT applied. Precipitation of CTA or CTB was determined similarly using biotin-labeled CTA or CTB. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Polyphenols (100 μg) and biotin-labeled CT (10 μg) in PBS (500 μl) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before transfer to the top of a linear gradient of 8∼30% sucrose in PBS solution (4.3 ml) and ultracentrifugation (Hitachi rotor P55ST2; 200,000 × g, 4 °C, 16 h). Eight 600-μl fractions were then collected (from the top). Samples of each were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 14% gel (nonreducing conditions), and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Biotin-labeled CT was detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and ECL reagent. CT in each fraction was quantified as CTA using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm) and calculated as follows: percentage of total = intensity of fraction/sum of intensities of eight fractions × 100. Similar experiments were performed using biotin-labeled CTA and CTB. Assay of Complexes Using a Molecular Weight Exclusion Membrane Filter (Centricon)—Amicon Centricon YM-50 and YM-100 are molecular weight exclusion membranes. According to a company-supplied user guide, 90% of a ∼100-kDa protein is recovered in retentate of YM-100, and 85% of a ∼50-kDa protein is recovered in retentate using a YM-50 membrane. Biotin-labeled CT, CTA, or CTB (10 μg) was incubated with polyphenols (100 μg) in 500 μl of PBS at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then applied to YM-50 and YM-100, which were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5–10 min until the retentate volume was ∼20 μl. Retentate was diluted to 500 μl with PBS before samples were taken for separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE in 14% gels (nonreducing conditions) and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Biotin-labeled toxin was detected and quantified as described above. cAMP Assay—cAMP was quantified using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.). Polyphenols (200 μg/ml) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) were added to Vero cells (7 × 105 cells/well) grown in 6-well plates and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times, and 20 nm CT was added in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylzanthine (500 μm), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Medium was then aspirated and 0.3 ml of 0.1 m HCl added in enzyme immunoassay buffer (company-supplied). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, cells were scraped and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for an assay following the manufacturer's instructions. Applephenon, ACT, and HBT, but Not RG-tannin, Suppressed CT Binding to Vero Cells—Binding and internalization of biotin-labeled CT by Vero cells was dependent on CT concentration, reaching a maximum at ∼20 nm (data not shown). When 20 nm CT and the indicated concentrations of applephenon, ACT (highly condensed tannin fraction of applephenon), or HBT were incubated with cells at 4 °C for 30 min, toxin binding to cells was inhibited (Fig. 1A). HBT and ACT were more potent than applephenon; HBT at 50 μg/ml, a concentration at which applephenon was ineffective, suppressed binding of CT by 80%. In contrast, RG-tannin, at concentrations up to 200 μg/ml, did not affect CT binding. Treatment of Vero cells with polyphenols did not alter cell number (Fig. 1B) or microscopic appearance (data not shown), suggesting a lack of cytotoxicity in these experiments. Further, incubation of cells with polyphenols did not decrease subsequent binding of CT (Fig. 1C) or decrease the cAMP response to CT (Fig. 1D). The amount of CT, bound to cells, did not decrease following incubation with polyphenols, compared with the control without polyphenols (Fig. 1E). These data suggested that the inhibitory effects of polyphenols did not result from nonspecific binding to the cells with masking of CT binding sites or competition by polyphenols with bound CT, leading to its displacement from the cells. Inhibitory effects of polyphenol were more robust when CT was incubated with it before addition to the cells (data not shown). The suppressive effects of HBT, applephenon, and ACT on CT binding to cells were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using Cy3-labeled CT (Fig. 2). CT bound to Vero cells in the absence of polyphenols (control) and in the presence of RG-tannin; in the presence of applephenon or ACT, however, CT binding was much lower. CT bound very poorly to HBT-treated cells. After incubation of these cells at 37 °C for 10 min, toxin was internalized and accumulated in the perinuclear region in control and RG-tannin-treated cells but not in applephenon-, ACT-, or HBT-treated cells. To determine whether these cells were viable, cells treated with 200 μg/ml polyphenols were detached from the plate with trypsin, and total cell number and trypan blue exclusion were investigated. Treatment with polyphenols did not decrease the cell number (Fig. 2B) or cell viability by trypan blue dye exclusion (Fig. 2C) compared with control cells not exposed to polyphenol. HBT and Applephenon Suppress CT Internalization into Vero Cells—To examine whether HBT and applephenon suppress internalization of CT, cells were treated with biotin-labeled CT at 4 °C for 30 min and then washed with HBSS to remove unbound CT before incubation at 37 °C with each polyphenol. CT internalization was quantified after removing biotin from the cell surface with 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid. CT internalization was suppressed by applephenon (Fig. 3A) or HBT (Fig. 3B) in a dose-dependent manner. Weak suppression was observed with RG-tannin (Fig. 3C). No morphological changes were observed under the microscope (data not shown), and there were no changes in viable cell number following incubation with polyphenol (Fig. 3D). RG-tannin Suppresses Internalization of CT—RG-tannin did not suppress binding of CT to Vero cells but weakly suppressed CT internalization. We determined whether preincubation of CT and RG-tannin would further suppress internalization. CT and RG-tannin were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min before the addition to cells and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding of CT was not prevented by preincubation with RG-tannin (Fig. 4B). Cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. As shown in Fig. 4A, RG-tannin suppressed internalization of CT in a dose-dependent manner. HBT and Applephenon Suppress CT Binding to Immobilized GM1—CT binds to surface ganglioside GM1. We examined whether polyphenols suppress CT binding to immobilized GM1. Preincubation of polyphenols with immobilized GM1 did not decrease CT binding (Fig. 5B). CT binding, however, was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by applephenon and HBT; some, but not significant suppression, was observed with RG-tannin (200 μg/ml) (Fig. 5A). Polyphenols Precipitate CT—To clarify how to the polyphenols suppress CT binding or internalization, we examined whether polyphenols aggregate CT. Biotin-labeled CT was incubated with the indicated concentrations of polyphenols for 30 min at room temperature, after which the samples were centrifuged, and the resulting precipitate was resolved on gels (Fig. 6A). As evident from these data, polyphenols precipitated CT in a concentration-dependent manner. At 50 μg/ml, HBT, ACT, and applephenon reached a plateau and precipitated the maximum amount of CT. RG-tannin was less effective. Similar results were obtained with biotin-labeled CTA (Fig. 6B). Again, RG-tannin was less effective and ACT was more effective than applephenon. When CTB was used instead of CTA (Fig. 6C), again, RG-tannin precipitated less CTB than other polyphenols. RG-tannin Complexes with CT—Interaction with RG-tannin and CT was further examined using sucrose density gradients (Fig. 7A). As biotin was mostly incorporated in CTA as described under “Materials and Methods,” only the CTA blot is shown. The primary peak was found in fraction 4 with both untreated CT and RG-tannin-treated CT. When the intensities of fraction 5 of untreated CT and RG-tannin-treated CT were compared, a statistically significant difference was observed (Fig. 7A, bottom), suggesting that RG-tannin-treated CT was recovered in a denser fraction than CT. All of the HBT-treated CT was recovered in the bottom fraction (Fig. 7A, top). Applephenon- and ACT-treated CT were also found in the bottom fraction (data not shown). These data suggested that HBT, ACT, and applephenon made large aggregates of more than 250 kDa with CT from the calibration using standard molecular weight markers, and RG-tannin complexed with CT. Since RG-tannin did not inhibit CT binding to Vero cells, we hypothesized that RG-tannin formed a complex with CTA but not to CTB. As expected, CTA incubated with RG-tannin was recovered in a more dense fraction than CTA alone (Fig. 7B). However, shift of RG-tannin-treated CTB to a denser fraction was also observed (Fig. 7C), suggesting that RG-tannin might interact with both CTA and CTB and complexes with CT. CTA or CTB incubated with HBT was recovered in the bottom fraction, consistent with formation of a large aggregate of more than 250 kDa (Fig. 7, B and C). ACT- or applephenon-treated CTA or CTB was also recovered in the bottom fraction (data not shown). To confirm that RG-tannin complexes with CT, molecular weight exclusion membranes (Centricon) were used (Fig. 8 and Table I). Since 97% of CT (84 kDa) was recovered in retentate with a YM-50 molecular weight exclusion membrane (data not shown), we used a YM-100 membrane in which 10% of CT was recovered in retentate (YM-100 membrane excludes ∼100,000 molecular weight protein). With YM-100, 76% of CT incubated with RG-tannin was recovered in retentate, and all of the HBT·CT and ACT·CT complexes were recovered in retentate. Similar experiments were performed using biotin-labeled CTA or CTB. Most of the CTA or CTB was recovered in the filtrate using a YM-100 membrane; however, RG-tannin-treated CTA or CTB was recovered 32 and 58%, respectively, in retentate. Almost all CTA or CTB was recovered in the retentate of a YM-100 membrane when treated with HBT or ACT. These data confirmed that RG-tannin interacts with both CTA and CTB and complexed with CT.Table IAnalysis of CT-, CTA-, or CTB-polyphenol complex using molecular weight exclusion membranes Toxin amounts in Fig. 8 were quantified using Image Gauge software, and the percentage of toxin recovered in retentate of a YM-100, ∼100,000 molecular weight exclusion membrane, is shown.

Therefore, CTA might interfere with the suppressive effect of RG-tannin on CT internalization. To test this hypothesis, CT was incubated with various concentrations of RG-tannin in the presence or absence of 500 nm CTA before the addition to cells and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C to quantify CT internalization. As shown in Fig. 9, CTA abrogated the suppressive effect of RG-tannin on CT internalization. RG-tannin and condensed tannin fraction of apple polyphenol (applephenon) named ACT were reported to suppress CT-induced ADP-ribosylation of Gαs or agmatine and fluid accumulation in mouse or rabbit ileal loops (14Saito T. Miyake M. Toba M. Okamatsu H. Shimizu S. Noda M. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Oi H. Matsuura D. Miyake M. Ueno M. Takai I. Yamamoto T. Kubo M. Moss J. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, their precise mechanism of action was not determined. In this report, we focused on the effect of RG-tannin, applephenon, and ACT, on the binding and internalization of CT. We also used HBT, which is fractioned from hop bract and contains components similar to those in ACT. It suppressed ADP-ribosylation by CT and was recently found to be a potent inhibitor of Stx1 produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 (16Tagashira, M., Yahiro, K., Morinaga, N., Moss, J., and Noda, M. (2003) US-Japan Cholera and Other Bacterial Enteric Infections, 38th Joint Panel Meeting, pp. 45-48, U. S. Department of Health and Human Disease, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). HBT, ACT, and applephenon, but not RG-tannin, inhibited the binding of CT to Vero cells; all of the polyphenols inhibited CT internalization. The polyphenols used in this report were not cytotoxic at the concentrations studied; incubation of cells with polyphenols did not inhibit subsequent binding of toxin, and cell function was apparently not impaired. Further, inhibition of internalization of bound CT was not due to the release of bound toxin by the polyphenols. These data suggested that the inhibitory effects of the polyphenols were not due to their nonspecific binding to cells or to cell damage but resulted from their interaction with CT in solution and on the cell surface, thereby preventing CT binding and internalization. HBT, ACT, and applephenon bound CT, resulting in large aggregates, which were sedimented by high speed centrifugation. These CT aggregates did not bind to GM1 or to Vero cells. RG-tannin, on the other hand, did not form large aggregates with CT similar to applephenon or HBT, but it did associate with CT as demonstrated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and filtration through molecular weight exclusion membranes. RG-tannin did not inhibit CT binding to cells or to GM1 immobilized on plates. It did, however, complex with CTB as well as CTA. It appears that the GM1-binding site of CTB was not masked by interaction with RG-tannin, although complex formation did affect CT internalization. ACT was more potent than applephenon for both inhibition of CT binding and precipitation of CT, which may explain why ACT was more effective than applephenon in inhibiting of CT ADP-ribosyl transferase activity (14Saito T. Miyake M. Toba M. Okamatsu H. Shimizu S. Noda M. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The different interactions of RG-tannin and other polyphenols with CT may reflect the presence in RG-tannin, but not in applephenon and HBT, of galloyl moieties. Oi et al. (15Oi H. Matsuura D. Miyake M. Ueno M. Takai I. Yamamoto T. Kubo M. Moss J. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that RG-tannin (15 μg/ml) prevented completely the induction by CT (1.3 μg) of fluid accumulation. In our studies, however, RG-tannin at 10 or 50 μg/ml suppressed at 20 min CT internalization by Vero cells only 12 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 4). Mechanisms in addition to reduced internalization of the RG-tannin-CT complex, including inhibition of ADP-ribosylation, might be responsible for the suppression by RG-tannin of CT-induced fluid accumulation. It is also not clear whether the toxin-polyphenol complex is taken up by cells and delivered intact from Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum and then cytosol or whether polyphenols like RG-tannin, applephenon, or HBT are internalized and interfere intracellularly with toxin activity. Polyphenols are known to bind to proteins; however, the interaction depends on structure of the polyphenol and the protein surface structure (20Haslam E. J. Nat. Prod. 1996; 59: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 21Charlton A.J. Baxter N.J. Khan M.L. Moir A.J. Haslam E. Davies A.P. Williamson M.P. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 1593-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). RG-tannin was reported to interfere with CT activity but not with that of heat-stable enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (15Oi H. Matsuura D. Miyake M. Ueno M. Takai I. Yamamoto T. Kubo M. Moss J. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that RG-tannin differed from HBT and applephenon in its interaction with CT. Thus, polyphenols show specificity in their interactions with bacterial toxins. Specificity is thus observed at the level of the polypheonol and the toxin. CT is thought to be endocytosed after binding to GM1 and localization to detergent-insoluble microdomains, lipid rafts, or caveolae (23Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M.

These polyphenols may interfere with an early step in endocytosis. How RG-tannin suppresses internalization of CT from the cell surface by complex formation or how internalization of CT already bound to the cell surface was suppressed by HBT and applephenon needs to be better understood. HBT may be another potential therapeutic agent along with applephenon and RG-tannin to protect against CT-mediated disease. Further, based on the present report, it may also be effective on CT that had already bound to cells. We thank Y. Kaihou and T. Ogata for skillful technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W1996457599,"RIC-3 has been identified as a molecule essential for the recruitment of functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors composed of α7, but it exhibits inhibitory effects on α4β2 or α3β4 receptors. In this study, we investigated the role of RIC-3 in the recruitment of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT3A) receptors to the cell surface. Although RIC-3 is not essential for the surface transport of 5-HT3A receptors, we found that its presence enhances both receptor transport and function in a concentration-dependent manner. RIC-3 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, as evidenced by co-localization with the chaperone molecule, binding protein (BiP). RIC-3 is not detected at significant levels on the cell surface when expressed alone or in the presence of 5-HT3A. RIC-3 and 5-HT3A show a low level interaction that is transient (<4 h). That RIC-3 can interact with an endoplasmic reticulum-retained 5-HT3A construct, combined with the transient interaction observed and lack of significant surface-expressed RIC-3, suggests that RIC-3 may play a role in 5-HT3A receptor folding, assembly, or transport to the cell surface.

The most remarkable morphological feature of the brain is not the highly complex, interconnected neuronal pathways but the enormous number (∼1015) of potentially distinct synaptic connections involved in information transfer between neurons. Moreover, synapses are not static and passive translators of information but can change their efficiency of synaptic transmission (1Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T Wang Y.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). This process is termed “synaptic plasticity” and is thought to lie at the heart of the capacity of the brain for learning and memory. Synaptic plasticity may reside pre- or postsynaptically (or both), modulating neurotransmitter release or neurotransmitter receptor responses, respectively.A fundamental question in neurobiology is how receptor biogenesis is orchestrated. A vast array of receptor-interacting proteins have been identified as participating in ligand-gated ion channel trafficking and localization (1Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T Wang Y.T. Nat. Rev.

Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The predominant localization of RIC-3 to the ER and not at synapses, combined with the observation that AChRs failed to exit the neuronal cell body in the absence of RIC-3 (19Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is highly suggestive of a role in AChR transport from the ER to the surface. However, a contradictory study (34Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) reports that RIC-3 is not involved in the transport of AChR α7 receptors to the cell surface. Instead, the function of RIC-3 appears to be at the level of protein folding and is essential for the generation of the α7 ligand (α-bungarotoxin) binding site. Furthermore, RIC-3 was found at the cell surface associated with α7 (34Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), raising the question regarding the location of RIC-3 chaperone activity.We investigated the role of RIC-3 on the trafficking of 5-HT3A receptors and discovered a significant role in the enhancement of receptor recruitment to the cell surface. The interaction of RIC-3 with 5-HT3A occurs within the ER and is transient, and RIC-3 is not detected at the cell surface. We propose that RIC-3 plays a role in the transport of 5-HT3A receptors, possibly by enhancing protein folding and/or stabilization.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—Simian COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells were transfected by electroporation (400 V, infinity resistance, 125 farads, Bio-Rad Gene Electropulser II). 10 μg of DNA was used for each transfection (2 × 106 cells) with equimolar ratios of expression constructs. Cells were analyzed 12-48 h after transfection.DNA Constructs—Human 5-HT3A subunit cDNAs were expressed from the mammalian expression vector pGW1 (8Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Ward M. Vardy A.W. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 5-HT3A-Myc and 5-HT3A-HA were tagged with the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) or the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) between amino acids 5 and 6 (Thr29-tag-Thr30 in 5-HT3A) by site-directed mutagenesis as reported previously (8Boyd G.W.

Millar N.S. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27681-27687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Human RIC-3 was a kind gift from M. Treinin (Hebrew University) and was subcloned into pGW1 by PCR (HindIII/XbaI sites).Antibodies—Anti-HA and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies were used directly as supernatant (20 μg/ml) or purified on immobilized protein A. Antiserum to RIC-3 was raised in sheep using either an extracellular/luminal (depending on whether RIC-3 is expressed on the cell surface) epitope (RIC-3b, SDGQTPGARFQRSHL) or an intracellular epitope (RIC-3a, KAYTGSMLRKRNP) as the antigen. RIC-3b was used for immunofluorescence/ELISA, and RIC-3a was used for immunoprecipitations. Neither RIC-3 antibody produced a significant signal by immunofluorescence on rat neurons (hippocampal). The secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488/568 and donkey anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 488, were purchased from Molecular probes and used at 1 μg/ml. The secondary antibody, sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP), was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and used at 1/1000.Immunofluorescence—COS7 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS), washed twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS), and blocked (10% FBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min. Subsequent washes and antibody dilutions were performed in PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Following surface immunofluorescence, cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 (10 min), and the immunofluorescence protocol was repeated from the NH4Cl step. Where applicable, the fluorophores, Alexa 488 and Alexa 568, were used to detect surface or total receptor populations, respectively. Cells were examined using a wide-field imaging system (Improvision).Quantification of Cell Surface Expression—HEK293 cells were plated into 96-well dishes. Eight transfections (2 μg of 5-HT3A-HA and 0-8 μg of RIC-3, total DNA maintained at 10 μg using GABAA receptor α-1 cDNA) were used in each dish (with each condition in sextuplet). Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS). Cell surface detection was performed in the absence of detergent, and total expression levels were determined following Triton X-100 treatment (0.5% for 15 min). Cells were washed twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS) and blocked (10% FBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. Subsequent washes were performed in block. Receptor expression was determined using an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and assayed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) as the substrate, with detection at 450 nm after 30 min following the addition of 0.5 m H2SO4. The reaction rate was determined to remain linear for up to 1 h.Membrane Potential Assay—HEK293 cells were plated into 96-well dishes (Molecular Devices). Eight transfections (as above) were used for each dish. After 24 h, cells were incubated in Red Membrane Potential® assay solution diluted 1:10 (Molecular Devices) for 1 h at room temperature. A range of concentrations of 5-HT (in Hanks' solution) was added automatically by the Flexstation II® apparatus and responses recorded over 90 s using SoftMax Pro 4.6 to analyze the results and plot dose-response curves according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each point is the average of at least 6 wells monitored over a total area of ∼6 mm2.Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were l-methionine-starved for 30 min before being labeled with [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi/6-cm dish, Translabel ICN/Flow) for 4 h. Where appropriate, cells were chased in DMEM/FBS in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for time indicated. Cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 nm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml antipain, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (8Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Ward M. Vardy A.W. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography.Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells were washed three times in cold PBS, and cell surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice followed by quenching in cold PBS containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and biotinylated proteins were isolated overnight using NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce) at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times and bound protein eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.RESULTSTo examine the subcellular distribution of 5-HT3A receptors and RIC-3, heterologous expression in COS-7 cells was utilized. COS-7 cells were chosen because of their flattened phenotype, offering higher morphological resolutions of intracellular structures. To facilitate biochemical and morphological analyses, the 5-HT3A subunit was tagged using the epitopes of HA or Myc. These epitope tags were added to the amino terminus of 5-HT3A between amino acids 5 and 6 of the mature polypeptide (downstream from the predicted signal sequence cleavage site) to create 5-HT3A-HA or 5-HT3A-Myc. No functional effects of these tags were evident (8Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Ward M. Vardy A.W. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).It has been reported previously (8Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Ward M. Vardy A.W. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that 5-HT3A-HA can access the cell surface and function as a homomeric 5-HT3 receptor. In support of this assertion, surface immunofluorescence of the HA epitope can be detected in the absence of detergent, where it is evenly distributed in a punctate pattern (Fig. 1B). Intracellular staining is also evident (Fig. 1A). In higher expressing cells (not shown), receptors often exhibited localization to filopodial structures, as observed elsewhere (32Everitt A.B. Luu T. Cromer B. Tierney M.L. Birnir B. Olsen R.W. Gage P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21701-21706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon permeabilization, the majority of intracellular receptors are observed in an ER-like pattern (8Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Ward M. Vardy A.W. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, small punctate spots are observed, indicative of their presence in transport vesicles (36Ilegems E. Pick H.M. Deluz C. Kellenberger S. Vogel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53346-53352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon the co-expression of 5-HT3A-HA and RIC-3, a more robust cell surface expression of 5-HT3A-HA is observed (Fig. 1D). Moreover, a striking localization to filopodia is observed, similar to that reported previously (32Everitt A.B. Luu T. Cromer B. Tierney M.L. Birnir B. Olsen R.W. Gage P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21701-21706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The more dramatic localization to filopodia upon co-expression is most likely a result of increased expression rather than a distinct targeting mechanism. In addition to increased surface staining, a significant increase in immunofluorescence is observed in permeabilized cells (Fig. 1C).Given the apparent increase in cell surface levels of 5-HT3A, we endeavored to explore the subcellular localization of recombinantly expressed RIC-3 using the antibody raised against the extracellular/luminal (depending on localization to the surface/intracellular compartments, respectively) region. It should be noted that although earlier analysis programs predicted two transmembrane domains (18Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), more recent data bases such as those for SignalP 2.0 (34Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and SignalP 3.0 suggest that the first transmembrane region is a signal sequence. Regardless, the epitope used in this study is predicted to be extracellular/luminal in either model. In the presence of detergent, a high level of RIC-3 is detected, showing a highly clustered distribution as well as an ER-like pattern (Fig. 1E). No peripheral staining, which would indicate surface expression, was observed. In support of this observation, only very low levels of surface staining, similar to background levels in untransfected cells, were evident (Fig. 1F). To confirm RIC-3 localization to the ER, co-staining for BiP, an ER marker (7Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), was performed. Both RIC-3 and BiP staining show similar but not identical patterns (Fig. 1, G and H). It has been reported that RIC-3 is significantly localized to the plasma membrane in a cell line expressing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) α7 subunit (34Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We investigated, therefore, whether RIC-3 was similarly localized when 5-HT3A was present. Upon the co-expression of RIC-3 with 5-HT3A-HA, significant surface staining (not shown) or the presence of surface biotinylated protein (see Fig. 4D) for RIC-3 was still not evident, suggesting that RIC-3 may be functioning within the ER in the folding, assembly, or transport of 5-HT3A receptors rather than as a plasma membrane clustering/anchoring molecule. However, we cannot rule out a transient presence of RIC-3 at the cell surface.Fig. 4Determination of interactions between 5-HT3A and RIC-3 by co-immunoprecipitation.A, HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT3A-HA and/or RIC-3 (as indicated) were [35S]methionine-labeled (4 h), and cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) using antibodies against the HA epitope of 5-HT3A (3A) or RIC-3 as indicated using protein G-agarose. B, HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT3A′CRAR′-HA (3A*) and/or RIC-3 were analyzed as above. C, HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT3A-HA and RIC-3 were [35S]methionine-labeled (3 h) and chased for the times indicated in DMEM/10% FBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. 5-HT3A-HA receptors were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against HA. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. D, HEK293 cells expressing RIC-3 (lanes 1 and 2) or RIC-3 and 5-HT3A-HA (lane 3). Total RIC-3 expression was determined by Western blotting 3% of the sample (one dish). Surface RIC-3 was analyzed following surface biotinylation, purification of biotinylated proteins using NeutrAvidin-agarose, and probing of 30% of sample (one dish) with anti-RIC-3 antibodies by Western blotting. The arrow indicates the location of the RIC-3 band (A-D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To quantify the apparent increased cell surface expression observed by immunofluorescence, we used the whole cell ELISA approach to quantify cell surface and total receptor expression. This approach is similar to immunofluorescence, except that an HRP-conjugated antibody is used to provide quantitative results. It is not possible to equate these values with an actual percentage distribution of a receptor, as the estimation of total receptors is consistently underestimated in the presence of detergent. In HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT3A-HA, positive signals are apparent for cell surface receptors (mock-transfected cell values have been subtracted) (Fig. 2). Increasing amounts of RIC-3 cDNA (2-8 μg) were co-transfected with 2 μg of 5-HT3A-HA. In support of a role in the recruitment of 5-HT3A receptors to the cell surface by RIC-3, cell surface levels of 5-HT3A-HA were enhanced as RIC-3 was increased. The most significant enhancement occurred at equimolar or 1:2 ratios, with diminishing additional effects at higher ratios. An examination of the ratio between surface and total receptor levels supported this observation and suggests that the transport pathway may become limiting for some other factor. Interestingly, a small increase in total receptor expression was observed, becoming significant when higher amounts of RIC-3 were co-transfected. This result suggests that RIC-3 may be exerting a stabilizing effect on 5-HT3A.Fig. 2Quantification of 5-HT3A-Myc expression levels in the presence of increasing amounts of RIC-3. HEK293 cells transfected with 2 μg of cDNA encoding 5-HT3A-Myc and varying (0-8 μg) amounts of RIC-3 are shown. GABAA receptor α-1 cDNA was included to ensure that equal amounts of cDNA (10 μg) were used in all transfections. Surface receptor levels were detected using antibodies to Myc followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP in the absence of detergent. Total receptor levels were determined as above, in the presence of dete"

The required components of the fission machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae include Dnm1, Fis1, and Mdv1. In the present study, we determined the protein structure of yeast Fis1 using NMR spectroscopy. Although the six α-helices, as well as their folding, in the yeast Fis1 structure are similar to those of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of the human Fis1 structure, the two structures differ in their N termini. The N-terminal tail of human Fis1 is flexible and unstructured, whereas a major segment of the longer N terminus of yeast Fis1 is fixed to the concave face formed by the six α-helices in the TPR domains. To investigate the role of the fixed N terminus, exogenous Fis1 was expressed in yeast lacking the endogenous protein. Expression of yeast Fis1 protein rescued mitochondrial fission in Δfis1 yeast only when the N-terminal TPR binding segment was left intact. The presence of this segment is also correlated to the recruitment of Mdv1 to mitochondria. The conformation of the N-terminal segment embedded in the TPR pocket indicates an intra-molecular regulation of Fis1 bioactivity.

Although the TPR-like helix bundle of Fis1 mediates the interaction with Dnm1 and Mdv1, the N terminus of Fis1 is a prerequisite to recruit Mdv1 to facilitate mitochondrial fission. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that change their morphology by fusion and fission. Such processes, apparently counteracting each other, are facilitated by two independent molecular machineries. Mitochondrial outer membrane fusion is regulated by the integral membrane proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2 in the case of mammals (1Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Fzo1 in the case of yeast (2Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J.

These proteins span the mitochondrial outer membranes twice, exposing an N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain to the cytosol. A recent study of mouse Mfn1 revealed that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain points outward from mitochondrial membranes to form homodimers in an antiparallel fashion, which is implicated in tethering of two mitochondria together at a distance of about 10 nm (4Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Subsequent inner membrane fusion is mediated by a protein called OPA1 in the case of mammals (5Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J.

Mitochondrial fission is mediated by a dynamin-related protein, Drp1, identified as Dnm1 in yeast (9Otsuga D. Keegan B.R. Brisch E. Thatcher J.W. Hermann G.J. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. J.

Drp1 and Dnm1 localize in the cytosol as well as in foci at the dividing site of the mitochondrial outer membrane surface during mitochondrial fission (9Otsuga D. Keegan B.R. Brisch E. Thatcher J.W.

Drp1- and Dnm1-mediated mitochondrial fission is achieved with other accompanying proteins. Genetic studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified Mdv1 and Fis1 as proteins involved in the Dnm1-dependent fission process (13Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J.

Mdv1 is a peripheral membrane protein that localizes with Dnm1 at punctate structures along the mitochondrial outer membranes to regulate Dnm1. Fis1 is an integral membrane protein that is uniformly distributed along the mitochondrial outer membranes that is required for immobilization of Dnm1 and Mdv1. A high molecular weight complex of Dnm1, Mdv1, and Fis1 constructs the punctate structures at the dividing site and facilitates constriction and division of mitochondrial membrane (13Mozdy A.D.

Mdv1 orthologs have not been identified in nematode, fruit fly, or vertebrates, and it is not known whether another protein takes its place or whether the molecular machinery of mitochondrial fission in the various species is different. In contrast, human and mouse orthologs of Fis1 have been identified, suggesting that the role of Fis1 in mitochondrial fission is conserved among lower and higher eukaryotes.

Proteins. 2004; 54: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it was reported that human Fis1 assembles into a novel tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 1The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effects; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; PDB, Protein Data Bank.1The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effects; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; PDB, Protein Data Bank.-like helix bundle, and it was suggested, based on similarity to other TPR domain proteins, that its concave surface may provide a means to recruit other proteins such as Drp1. Here we present the three-dimensional protein structure of yeast Fis1 and show that, in contrast to human Fis1, an extended N-terminal domain binds to the concave surface of the TPR motif. We also show that this self-interacting region of the N terminus that is absent in human Fis1 is required for yeast Fis1 bioactivity. Recombinant Protein—The protein corresponding to residues 1–138 of yeast Fis1 was prepared for NMR studies. The residues 139–152, half of the membrane-spanning domain and residues that face the mitochondrial intermembrane space, were excluded to solubilize the recombinant protein. The cDNA of Fis1 was cloned from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA library (American Type Culture Collection). NdeI and XhoI sites were introduced next to the initiation and stop codons of the cDNA, respectively, and inserted into pET-17b (Novagen Inc.). Then, the fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1–413 was excised using NdeI and RsaI. pET21b was treated with XhoI followed by Mung bean nuclease and then with NdeI. The excised DNA and the digested pET21b vector were ligated. The resulting plasmid encodes residues Met1–Val138 of Fis1 linked to the C-terminal hexa histidine tag and thus was termed pET21-yFis1-His6. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen Inc.) harboring the plasmid was cultured in Martek-9N or Martek-9CN (Spectra Stable Isotope) to produce uniformly 15N-labeled and uniformly 15N-, 13C-labeled protein, respectively. The recombinant protein was isolated from the cytosol by metal chelate affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-resin column (Novagen Inc.) using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0 or 100 mm EDTA and then further purified by collecting the flow-through from an ion-exchange chromatography on a mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, without NaCl. No detergents were used in any step of the protein purification. All NMR samples contained 0.5–1.0 mm protein in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O. The recombinant protein of human Fis1 for the study of backbone dynamics was prepared as described previously (19Suzuki M. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were acquired at 32 °C on Bruker 600 or 800 MHz NMR spectrometers. The spectra were processed using the NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and analyzed with PIPP (23Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The following experiments were used for assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances: CBCA(CO)NH (24Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY (28Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar). For stereospecific assignment for methyls of leucines and valines, a 1H-13C CT-HSQC experiment (29Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-435Google Scholar) was carried out using the protein obtained from a bacterial culture using a minimal medium containing 10% [U-13C]glucose-90% [U-12C]glucose (30Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Proton homonuclear nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were obtained using three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY (26Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar), four-dimensional 15N/13C-edited NOESY (31Kay L.E. Clore G.M. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1990; 249: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and four-dimensional 13C/13C-edited NOESY (32Clore G.M. Kay L.E. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) experiments. Residual dipolar couplings for N-H and Cα-Hα were calculated from the difference in corresponding scalar couplings measured in the presence and absence of Pf1 phage (11 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl) (33Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional IPAP 15N-1H HSQC experiment (34Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) was used to obtain the one-bond N-H scalar couplings. A CT-(H)CA(CO)NH experiment (35Tjandra N. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 9576-9577Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was used to obtain the one-bond Cα-Hα scalar couplings. Relaxation values (15N T1 and 15N T1ρ) for backbone amides were calculated from the peak intensities measured using conventional pulse programs (36Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Steady state heteronuclear NOE for the backbone amides was derived from the ratio of peak intensities of experiments performed with and without 1H-presaturation using a reported pulse program and corrected to compensate for errors caused by incomplete 1H magnetization recovery (37Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The measurements were repeated twice. Structure Calculation—Peak intensities from NOESY experiments were translated into a continuous distribution of proton-proton distances. Generic hydrogen bond distance restraints were employed for α-helical regions that were determined based on secondary 13Cα chemical shifts and medium range NOE patterns. The TALOS program (38Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar) predicted the backbone dihedral angles (φ, Ψ) from 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 1Hα, and 15NH chemical shifts. Statistically significant angles were used as structural restraints with at least 20° margins. Residual dipolar coupling restraints were separated into mobile and rigid regions determined based on the backbone dynamic data. Structures of yeast Fis1 were calculated by a distance geometry and simulated annealing protocol (39Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Brunger A.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 33-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with the incorporation of dipolar coupling restraints (40Tjandra N. Omichinski J.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) using the program XPLOR-NIH (41Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Structure calculations employed 2235 inter-residue and 803 intra-residue proton-proton distance restraints, 124 hydrogen bond distance restraints, 92 φ and 92 Ψ angle restraints, and 90 N-H and 41 Cα-Hα dipolar couplings. Fis1 Function in Yeast—Yeast vector pH62 was kindly provided by Dr. Reed B. Wickner (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). pH62 is a derivative of pRS315 and contains CEN replicon, LEU2 marker, and ADH1 promoter. The DNA fragment containing Fis1 cDNA was excised from the pET17-yFis1 plasmid using XbaI and XhoI and then inserted into pH62 at XbaI and XhoI sites (pH62-FIS1). Plasmids for deletion mutants were constructed in the same way. The deletion mutant DM1 lacks the N-terminal 14 residues, DM2 lacks the N-terminal 5 residues, and DM3 lacks Phe6–Tyr14 (see Fig. 7A). All yeast strains are derived from strain yAN001 (met15 leu2 his3 ura3). Cells were transformed using the lithium acetate method (42Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar) and were grown in synthetic glucose medium missing the appropriate nutrients to select for the plasmids. Mitochondria were visualized using a mitochondria-targeted GFP (pVT100U-mitoGFP; kindly provided by Dr. Benedikt Westermann, Universität Bayreuth, Germany). Exponentially growing cells of strains yAN008, yAN009, yAN010, yAN011, yAN012, and yAN013 (Table I) were embedded in 0.2% agarose, and confocal pictures were taken using a LSM 510 Meta (Zeiss). Mitochondria were classified in two different phenotypes. More than 200 cells were counted to obtain the percentage of the phenotypes.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeyAN002fis1::G418yAN003fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1yAN004fis1::G418 pH62yAN005fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM1yAN006fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM2yAN007fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM3yAN008fis1::G418 pVT100U-mitoGFPyAN009fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1 pVT100U-mitoGFPyAN010fis1::G418 pH62 pVT100U-mitoGFPyAN011fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM1 pVT100U-mitoGFPyAN012fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM2 pVT100U-mitoGFPyAN013fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM3 pVT100U-mitoGFPyAN014fis1::G418 pGALL-GFP-MDV1yAN015fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1 pGALL-GFP-MDV1yAN016fis1::G418 pH62 pGALL-GFP-MDV1yAN017fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM1 pGALL-GFP-MDV1yAN018fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM2 pGALL-GFP-MDV1yAN019fis1::G418 pH62-FIS1-DM3 pGALL-GFP-MDV1 Open table in a new tab Detection of Exogenous Fis1 Expression in Δfis1 Yeast—Cells of strains yAN003, yAN004, yAN005, yAN006, and yAN007 (Table I) were grown overnight in synthetic medium (SD-Leu) to logarithmic phase and harvested by centrifugation. After washing once with ice-cold water, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and mixed with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). The cells were broken by shaking in a mixer mill (Retsch) for 5 min, and then debris was removed by 3 min of centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein lysates were analyzed by Western blot using rabbit anti-Fis1 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Jodi Nunnari, University of California, Davis), mouse anti-porin antibody (Molecular Probes), and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Localization of Mdv1—The Δfis1 yeast harboring pH62-FIS1 constructs was transformed with pGALL-GFP-MDV1 (kindly provided by Dr. Jodi Nunnari, University of California, Davis). The strains yAN015, yAN016, yAN017, yAN018, and yAN019 (Table I) were grown overnight in synthetic medium (SRaf-Leu-URA) containing 2% raffinose to allow galactose induction and lacking leucine and uracil to select for plasmids. Production of GFP-Mdv1 was induced by treatment with 2% galactose for 2 h. Cells were fixed and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Location of GFP-Mdv1 was classified in two categories: diffuse in cytosol or localized to mitochondria. More than 200 cells were analyzed to score the localization of GFP-Mdv1. Structure Description of Yeast Fis1—The NMR derived structures of yeast Fis1 are presented in Fig. 1. The core domain of Fis1 consists of six α-helices. The six α-helices are determined based on a combination of NMR data (Fig. 2), including midrange NOE patterns and secondary chemical shifts. We define helix α1 for residues Pro19–Ser31, α2 for Ile39–Lys51, α3 for Val55–Lys70, α4 for Arg76–Lys89, α5 for Tyr93–Glu105, and α6 for Lys111–Glu127. The first 6 residues of the N-terminal tail do not adopt an ordered conformation. Their 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts are close to their random coil values, and no 1H-1H NOE of midrange or long range can be observed. The region corresponding to residues Leu10–Tyr14 shows characteristics of an α-helix, such as positive 13Cα secondary chemical shifts and NOEs between Hα(i) and HN(i + 3) and between Hα(i) and Hβ(i + 3). However, as NOEs between Hα(i) and HN(i + 4) are absent, this region is not defined to be an α-helix. The C-terminal 17 residues of the recombinant protein, which include the hydrophobic region and the artificial His tag, show a disordered conformation in solution. Their secondary chemical shifts for 13Cα and 13Cβ are close to zero, and no long range 1H-1H NOE are observed.Fig. 2Data obtained using NMR spectroscopy to establish the secondary structure of yeast Fis1. Sequential and medium range NOE connectivities characteristic of α-helices as well as 13Cα and 13Cβ secondary shifts are presented along with the protein sequence. The height of bars for the NOE connectivities presentation indicates the NOE intensity. The absence of typical NOEs within the α-helical regions mostly means that data were not included due to the difficulty of picking overlapped peaks. The height of the bars for the secondary shifts presentation are the difference from the random coil values. The location of the α-helices defined from the NMR data is indicated at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As seen in the ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures (Fig. 1A), the region corresponding to residues Thr9–Glu127 converged into a well defined conformation. The atomic root mean square deviation about the mean of coordinates for six α-helices of the 20 structures was 0.4 ± 0.1 Å for backbone heavy atoms and 1.0 ± 0.1 Å for all heavy atoms. A data base search performed using the DALI program for structural similarities (43Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) revealed, at the top of the list, 1IYG, the structure of mouse Fis1 as a representative structure of Fis1 orthologs. Currently, there are three PDB depositions for Fis1 orthologs: 1PC2 is the solution structure of human Fis1 (19Suzuki M. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), 1NZN is the crystal structure of human Fis1 (21Dohm J.A. Lee S.J. Hardwick J.M. Hill R.B. Gittis A.G. Proteins. 2004; 54: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and 1IYG is the solution structure of mouse Fis1. The core domain of human, mouse, and yeast Fis1 contains six α-helices with the same folds. Due to the high degree of structural similarity between yeast and mouse Fis1, the rest of the list from the DALI search is the same as the list that we obtained previously using the human Fis1 structure, 1PC2, as a query (19Suzuki M. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Namely, the overall fold of the six α-helices in yeast Fis1 is similar to the fold of helices composed of the TPR motif, although, like other Fis1 sequences, no significant sequence similarity to the typical TPR motif is found within the TPR-like core domain of yeast Fis1. The typical TPR motif contains degenerate 34-amino-acid sequences with 8 loosely conserved consensus residues (X3(WLF)X2(LIM)(GAS)X2(YLF)X8(ASE)X3(FYL)X2(ASL)X4(PKE)X2) and usually presents in a tandem array of multiple copies (44Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The TPR motif is found in a number of functionally different proteins. The TPR-containing domains facilitate specific protein-protein interactions at the concave surfaces, although the common features of the interaction partners have not been defined. The structural analogy of yeast Fis1 to the typical TPR-containing proteins, although the protein sequences are discrete, suggests that yeast Fis1 may bind to other proteins at its concave protein surface. Structural Comparison between Yeast and Human Fis1—To evaluate the structural conservation between yeast and human Fis1, we compared these two structures (Fig. 3). The core domain of both yeast and human Fis1 consists of six α-helices. The length of the α1-helix in yeast Fis1 is shorter than that in human Fis1 (Fig. 3A). For the other five α-helices, the lengths of corresponding helices in yeast and human Fis1 are the same. Moreover, the folds of six α-helices are similar (Fig. 3, B and C), as indicated by the data base search described in the previous section. The pairwise root mean square difference, calculated using the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C′, and O) of the corresponding six helices for yeast and human Fis1, is 1.8 Å. Among the six α-helices from the two structures, the α1-helix shows a major difference in its location; it is shifted along its axis and results in the largest deviation in the pairwise comparison. We previously found that human Fis1 contains two TPR-like motifs, where the α2-loop-α3 hairpin forms one TPR-like motif and the α4-loop-α5 hairpin forms the other. The two loops in the yeast Fis1 structure (one between α2 and α3 and the other between α4 and α5) show the same conformation as those in the human Fis1 structure. The pairwise comparison of overall folds between yeast and human Fis1 using DALI results in the Z-score of 12. A major difference between the yeast and human Fis1 structures is the N terminus prior to the α1-helix. The N-terminal tail of yeast Fis1 is located at the concave side of the helix bundle (Fig. 1), whereas that of human Fis1 is not. A difference can also be seen in the backbone dynamics of the region (Fig. 4). In the human Fis1 structure, the entire N-terminal tail is flexible (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the N terminus of the yeast Fis1, which is longer than that of human Fis1 by 8 residues (Fig. 3A), is made of two parts with different characteristics (Fig. 4B). The first portion from the N-terminal end (Met1–Phe6) is flexible, and the second portion (Trp7–Tyr18) is rigid. It is not clear where the boundary between the flexible and rigid regions is. The backbone dynamics of Trp7 cannot be measured because the cross-peak for the amide 15N and 1H chemical shifts of Trp7 overlaps with those of Val133 and Val134. However, the aromatic side chain of Trp7 appears to be stabilized by hydrophobic interaction as 1H-1H NOEs to Tyr81 within α4, Leu103 within α5, and Val113 within α6 are observed. The rigid portion (residues Trp7–Tyr18) is bound to the concave side that is composed of the six helices. Hydrophobic interactions between Trp7, Pro8, Leu10, Ala13 within this loop and hydrophobic residues at the concave surface of the TPR-like domain stabilize the loop (Fig. 5). In addition, two negatively charged residues, Asp12 and Glu15, are proximate of positively charged Lys51 (Fig. 5), indicating that electrostatic interactions assist in the stabilization of the loop. Lack of these interactions in human Fis1 relegates its N-terminal tail out of the concave surface of the TPR-like domain (Fig. 6A).Fig. 5The position of the N-terminal rigid loop region of yeast Fis1. A close-up view of the N-terminal loop and the concave surface of the TPR-like domain is shown. The protein is viewed from an orientation similar to that in Fig. 1. The electrostatic potential surface of the TPR-like domain is color-coded in red and blue to denote negative and positive residues, respectively. The side chains of the residues Trp7–Leu17 are represented by balls and sticks. The region in yellow is highly mobile.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6N termini of the recombinant proteins.

Here we report that phospholipase C-δ1 accumulates in the nucleus at the G1/S boundary and in G0 phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, as wild-type protein accumulated in the nucleus, nuclear phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels were elevated 3–5-fold, whereas total levels were decreased compared with asynchronous cultures. To test whether phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding is important during this process, we introduced a R40D point mutation within the pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase C-δ1, which disables high affinity phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding, and found that nuclear translocation was significantly reduced at G1/S and in G0. These results demonstrate a cell cycle-dependent compartmentalization of phospholipase C-δ1 and support the idea that relative levels of phosphoinositides modulate the portioning of phosphoinositide-binding proteins between the nucleus and other compartments.

Upon activation, PLCδ1 binds the inositol head group of PIP2 with high affinity and specificity through its non-catalytic PH domain (17Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S.

This interaction facilitates association with the plasma membrane, particularly with ruffles, where PIP2 is enriched (20Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When a point mutation in the PH domain (R40D) is introduced, however, the ability of PLCδ1 to target the plasma membrane is greatly reduced, resulting in a higher cytosolic concentration (18Yagisawa H. Sakuma K. Paterson H.F. Cheung R. Allen V. Hirata H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol.

Clarke J.H. Divecha N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PLCδ1, however, is the only isoform that has been demonstrated to continuously cycle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (22Yamaga M. Fujii M. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. J. Biol.

When Madin-Darby canine kidney cells are treated with leptomycin B (LMB), which inhibits CRM1-dependent nuclear export, transiently expressed GFP-PLCδ1 accumulates in the nucleus, consistent with nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (22Yamaga M. Fujii M. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28537-28541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PLCδ1 is also detected in nuclei of rat hepatoma cells (24Asano M. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Homma Y. Takenawa T. Nimura Y. Kojima K. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12360-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and astrocytes (25Shimohama S. Sumida Y. Fujimoto S. Matsuoka Y. Taniguchi T. Takenawa T. Kimura J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, what regulates the steady-state distribution of this enzyme between the nuclear and extranuclear compartments.Yamaga et al. (22Yamaga M. Fujii M. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28537-28541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have indicated that the R40A point mutation within the pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ1 results in faster and greater nuclear accumulation under conditions in which nuclear export is blocked, possibly due to a greater fraction available to engage the import apparatus. Although mechanisms that regulate nuclear import, such as dimerization and phosphorylation, have not been ruled out, it is likely that a PIP2-mediated sequestration at the plasma membrane influences the steady-state distribution of PLCδ1 between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.The idea that phospholipids influence compartmentalization of PI-binding proteins is growing and evident in the recent work with Tub, which binds PIP2 through its tubby domain (26Santagata S. Boggon T.J. Baird C.L. Gomez C.A. Zhao J. Shan W.S. Myszka D.G. Shapiro L. Science. 2001; 292: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and ING2, which binds PI(5)P through its plant homeodomain finger (27Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N.

Upon G-protein-linked hydrolysis of PIP2, Tub translocates to the nucleus (26Santagata S. Boggon T.J. Baird C.L. Gomez C.A. Zhao J. Shan W.S. Myszka D.G. Shapiro L. Science. 2001; 292: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas ING2 accumulates in the nucleus as the levels of nuclear PI(5)P increase (27Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G.

We set out to test whether high affinity PIP2 binding plays a role in targeting PLCδ1 to the nuclear compartment and whether this could be related to the cell cycle.Here we establish that PLCδ1 accumulates in the nucleus in G0 and at the G1/S-phase boundary and that its accumulation is significantly decreased by the R40D point mutation in its PH domain, which abrogates high affinity PIP2-binding. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of PLCδ1 correlates with increased total nuclear levels of PIP2, consistent with a general mechanism by which phosphoinositides can influence the nuclear accumulation of proteins that bind these lipids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynchrony, Flow Cytometry, and Cell Cycle Analysis—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm penicillin and streptomycin, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all supplements were from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator. To synchronize cells to G0, adherent cells were washed three times and maintained in a medium with reduced serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 30 h, a technique that causes many cell types to exit the cell cycle and become quiescent (28Percival J.M. Thomas G. Cock T.A. Gardiner E.M. Jeffrey P.L. Lin J.J. Weinberger R.P. Gunning P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Pagon Z. Volker J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To synchronize cells to the G1/S boundary, adherent fibroblasts were twice blocked with 2 mm thymidine (6York J.D. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7847-7850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Flygare J. Falt S. Ottervald J. Castro J. Dackland A.L. Hellgren D. Wennborg A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures growing at an exponential rate were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in growth medium supplemented with 2 mm thymidine for 12–15 h, washed three times with growth medium, and incubated for an additional 8–10 h without thymidine. Cells were then treated again with growth medium supplemented with 2 mm thymidine for an additional 12–15 h. To release them from thymidine block, cells were washed three times in growth medium. To analyze DNA content, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen), harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed again, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde with 0.1% BSA in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed with PBS, and incubated in 50 mm citrate buffer with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing the cells again, cell cycle analysis was immediately performed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FAC-Scan; BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using SyncWizard.myo-[3H]Inositol Labeling, Lipid Extraction, and Thin Layer Chromatography—Cells were cultured in growth media supplemented with 2–8 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 60-mm dishes for 48–72 h to reach isotopic steady state. Cultures were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and taken through the above synchronization procedures in the presence of radiolabel. Whole cell levels of phosphoinositides were measured essentially as described previously (32Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 159-166Google Scholar). Briefly, synchronized cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS with 1 mm calcium chloride and 0.5 mm magnesium chloride (PBS-Ca), followed by ice-cold PBS. Monolayers were scraped into 750 μl of methanol:0.1 m HCl (v/v, 1:1), placed in silianized borosilicate glass tubes, and mixed vigorously for 30 s. 500 μl of chloroform was then added to each sample, which was mixed for 30 s, and then placed on a rocker at room temperature for 15 min. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g. The upper aqueous phase was removed and saved for inositol polyphosphate analysis. The lower phase was back extracted twice with 500 μl each of methanol:0.1 m EDTA (v/v, 1:0.9) and then dried under nitrogen and dissolved in chloroform:methanol (v/v, 1:1). Lipid extracts were applied to pre-scored Linear KD silica plates (Whatman) that were treated with 40% methanol, 1% potassium oxalate, and 1 mm EGTA in water and heat-activated. Purified PI, PI(4)P, and PIP2 (10 μg of each) were used as standards. The solvent system used to separate the lipids was chloroform:methanol:water:concentrated ammonium hydroxide (v/v/v/v, 60:47:11.3:2), similar to that described in Ref. 33Rebecchi M.J. Basic Medical Sciences Program (Pharmacology) of the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences of the School of Medicine. New York University, New York1984: 168Google Scholar. Areas corresponding to migration of PI, PI(4)P, and PIP2 standards were scraped into vials containing 100 μl of methanol:10% Nonidet P-40 (v/v, 1:1). 4 ml of scintillation fluid (EcoLite) was added to each vial and counted the following day in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The cpm values were normalized to total lipid phase-extractable phosphorus and specific activity of the radiolabeled medium.Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were lysed by osmotic swelling, similar to a previously described protocol (7Clarke J.H. Letcher A.J. D'Santos C.S. Halstead J.R. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In 60-mm dishes, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were briefly washed with ice-cold PBS-Ca. Cells were then treated briefly with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and promptly resuspended in 500 μl of pre-chilled resuspension buffer (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) on ice for 7 min. The degree of cytoplasmic swelling was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. The swollen cells were then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and lysed by 20 strokes of the glass pestle. Separated nuclei were then layered onto a sucrose cushion (320 mm sucrose, 7.7 mm MgCl2, 2.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and nuclei were washed twice with 1 ml of resuspension buffer. 750 μl of methanol:0.1 m HCl was added to the nuclear pellet and taken through the lipid extraction procedure described above. The degree of contamination was assessed using standard compartmental markers for the cytoplasm (lactate dehydrogenase) and endoplasmic reticulum (cytochrome-c oxidase) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma).DNA Constructs and Cell Transfection—Full-length human PLCδ1 cDNA was inserted into pEGFP-N1, a cytomegalovirus-driven mammalian expression vector that carries the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP; Clontech). This catalytically active chimera, designated PLC-δ1-EGFP, served as a template for the production of various mutant PLC-δ1-EGFP fusion proteins, as described previously (34Tall E.G. Physiology and Biophysics. Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY2002: 224Google Scholar). Briefly, a catalytically inactive (H356A) form and a double mutant (R40D/H356A) that fails to bind PIP2 with high affinity were constructed using a Pfu mutagenesis approach (Stratagene). The mutants were designated PLCδ1H356AEGFP and PLCδ1R40DH356AEGFP, respectively. We also utilized PH(δ1)EGFP (residues 1–126 of full-length PLCδ1 fused to EGFP) and its corresponding R40D point mutant (20Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Point mutations have been verified via DNA sequencing, in vitro binding, and enzymatic activity assays (35Tall E. Dorman G. Garcia P. Runnels L. Shah S. Chen J. Profit A. Gu Q.M. Chaudhary A. Prestwich G.D. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For transient expression of all PLCδ1EGFP chimeric proteins, NIH-3T3 cells were plated on #1.0 borosilicate chambered glass coverslips (Nalge Nunc International) coated with fibronectin (50 μg/ml; Sigma) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent according to manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science).Epifluorescence Microscopy and Image Deconvolution—Living cells transiently expressing fusion proteins were viewed in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% or 0.5% serum, 1 mm penicillin and streptomycin, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2.25 mm CaCl2, with an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss). In some experiments, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min and incubated in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 5 μg/ml) for 5 min to clearly identify the nuclear compartment. Images were captured with an AxioCam 330mA 12-bit charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss) and viewed with Carl Zeiss Axovision 3.1 software. To avoid bias, samples were coded, and the investigator was blinded to the experimental conditions. Captured Z-stacks were deconvolved using a constrained iterative point spread function according to recommended Niquest criteria and analyzed. Images were further analyzed in Life Science Resources software. The degree of nuclear accumulation was determined by analysis of intensity profiles in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The formula used to determine the average nuclear to cytoplasmic (N:Cavg) pixel intensity ratio is ∑[(Navg – Bavg)/(Cavg – Bavg)]/n, where Navg = average nuclear pixel intensity excluding nucleoli, Cavg = average cytoplasmic pixel intensity excluding perinuclear regions and vacuoles, Bavg = average background pixel intensity, and n = the number of cells sampled. A comparable method was used to determine the ratio of plasma membrane (Pavg) to cytoplasm pixel intensity for analysis of PH(δ1)EGFP compartmentalization in deconvolved images. The Pavg, however, was determined by sampling a stretch of plasma membrane no less than 10 μm in length. The method provides an average of plasma membrane intensities, which vary significantly along the membrane surface.Fixation and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Monolayers were rinsed once in PBS-Ca and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution (Fisher-Scientific) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed three times in PBS for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Rohm & Haas Co.) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The detergent was replaced with blocking solution (PBS, 5% BSA (Sigma), 5% goat serum (Pierce)) for 30 min at room temperature. The blocking solution was then replaced with primary antibody solution (1:200 dilution of anti-PLCδ1 clone S-11-2 (05-343; Upstate) or 1:200 dilution of anti-PIP2 (Assay Design) in PBS with 1% BSA and 1% goat serum) and placed in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. In some experiments, anti-PIP2 was pre-incubated with vesicles containing 20 μm PI(4)P or PIP2 (vesicles prepared as a 70% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine, 10% phosphatidylinositol mix) for 1 h. Samples were washed three times in 1 ml of PBS for 7 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) or goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate Texas Red (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:3000 in PBS with 1% BSA and 1% goat serum. Each well was then washed three times in PBS for 7 min. Fixed cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope with 100-watt Mercury arc lamp), and images were taken with Nikon Plan Fluor ×40 oil objective (numerical aperture, 1.3) and Olympix AstroCam (Life Science Resources). Images were processed and analyzed with Esprit imaging software (Life Science Resources). Alternatively, Z-stacks were obtained and deconvolved on the Zeiss microscope as described above.Western Blot Analysis—C6 glioma cells were grown to 50% confluence and fed normal growth media or blocked to the G1/S boundary as described above. After synchronization was complete and verified by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, an equal number of cells were harvested and washed in PBS-Ca. Nuclei were isolated as described above, without the use of a sucrose cushion. After several washes, the nuclear pellets were lysed with a high-salt extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 450 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% mammalian protease inhibitor) on ice for 15 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g; the supernatant was removed and designated the nuclear fraction. Total volume of nuclear fraction (∼1 × 106 cells) was loaded into each lane and compared with 10% of the cytoplasmic fraction. Lysates were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), probed with the antibody described above (1:200 in PBS with 3% dried, fat-free milk), and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Statistical Analysis—All statistical analysis was preformed in GraphPad Prism. Nuclear to cytoplasm ratios were pooled from duplicate wells from multiple experiments. To determine whether the distribution of pooled data passed normality, we used the Kolomogorov-Smirnov test. To determine significance of the differences among mean values, we used a one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Kuels post test.RESULTSPLCδ1, fused to EGFP, was expressed in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. These large cells have a relatively flat morphology that facilitates localization studies of this type. To prevent hydrolysis of cellular phosphoinositides, the enzyme was inactivated by H356A mutation. In our initial work, we observed that 6% of cells transiently expressing PLCδ1H356AEGFP had a greater degree of fluorescence associated with the nuclear compartment than the cytoplasmic compartment. Because PLCδ1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, we reasoned that nuclear accumulation could be attributed to a brief stage of the cell cycle, in which the steady-state distribution has shifted toward the nuclear compartment. Because this protein is well known to bind strongly to PIP2, we also hypothesized that a change in nuclear or extranuclear PIP2 could influence this redistribution. We first set out to determine whether and how nuclear PLCδ1 levels fluctuate during the cell cycle of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and to measure, in parallel, changes in total cellular and nuclear PIP2 concentrations.Cell Cycle Synchrony and NIH-3T3 Cells—Subconfluent NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were synchronized by serum withdrawal or double thymidine block. When asynchronous cultures growing at logarithmic rates are withdrawn from serum, they exit the cell cycle at G1 and become quiescent (G0) (28Percival J.M. Thomas G. Cock T.A. Gardiner E.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 fibroblasts have asynchronous distributions of DNA content (Fig. 1A) that indicate distinct G1 (54.2%), S (34.7%), and G2/M (11.2%) populations. Reducing the serum to 0.5% for 30 h (Fig. 1B) resulted in cells with more G1 DNA content (81.7%) and fewer cells in S (14.8%) or G2/M (3.6%). Because G0 and G1 DNA content are equivalent with fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, we assayed cell proliferation under logarithmic growth conditions (doubling time of 17 h; Fig. 1E) and compared that to growth in low-serum medium (doubling time of 29 h). These data show that reduced serum (0.5%) for 30 h enriched the number of quiescent NIH-3T3 cells in these cultures. 2 mm double thymidine block (Fig. 1C) was used to synchronize cultures to the G1/S checkpoint (6York J.D. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7847-7850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 97.2% of cells had S-phase DNA content after a 2 mm double thymidine block (G1, 1.7%; G2/M, 1.1%). As others have shown, washing out the thymidine releases cells from G1/S block (31Flygare J. Falt S. Ottervald J. Castro J. Dackland A.L. Hellgren D. Wennborg A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); as early as 3 h after release, 93.2% of cells were in G2/M as indicated by increased DNA content (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that these treatments synchronize NIH-3T3 cultures to a predicted DNA content, blocking them at well-defined points in the cell cycle.Nuclear Accumulation of PLCδ1 is Cell Cycle-dependent, Occurring at the G0 and the G1/S Checkpoint in NIH-3T3 Fibroblasts and at the G1/S Checkpoint in C6 Glioma Cells—To explain the degree of variance in nuclear PLCδ1 levels in asynchronous cell populations, we hypothesized that the enzyme accumulated in the nucleus in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We found that when cells were blocked at G0 or G1/S, the ratios of nuclear to cytoplasmic PLCδ1H356AEGFP intensity were enhanced by 1.4- and 2.0-fold, respectively, indicating that PLCδ1 accumulated in the nucleus during these stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 2, B and C) as a result of translocation, when compared with asynchronous cultures. Treatment with leptomycin B, a toxin used to block CRM1-driven nuclear export (Fig. 2, A and D), showed similar results (36Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M.

https://openalex.org/W1979634154,"Nitric oxide (NO) that is produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in glial cells is thought to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocytes can be stimulated to express iNOS by inflammatory cytokines, which are known to accumulate in the multiple sclerotic brain. The potentially pathological levels of NO produced under these circumstances can target a wide spectrum of intracellular components. We hypothesized that one of the critical targets for damage that leads to disease is mtDNA. In this study, we found that cytokines, in particular a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (50 ng/ml) and Ifnγ (25 ng/ml), cause elevated NO production in primary cultures of rat oligodendrocytes. Western blot analysis revealed a strong enhancement of iNOS expression 48 h after cytokine treatment. Within the same time period, NO-mediated mtDNA damage was shown by Southern blot analysis and by ligation-mediated PCR. Targeting the DNA repair enzyme human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) to the mitochondria of oligodendrocytes had a protective effect against this cytokine-mediated mtDNA damage. Moreover, it was shown that mitochondrial transport sequence hOGG1-transfected oligodendrocytes had fewer apoptotic cells compared with cells containing vector only following treatment with the cytokines. Subsequent experiments revealed that targeting hOGG1 to mitochondria reduces the activation of caspase-9, showing that this recombinant protein works to reduce apoptosis that is occurring through a mitochondria-based pathway.

Oligodendrocytes, one of the primary types of glial cells, produce the unique lipid-rich myelin membrane that forms multilamellar spirally wrapped sheaths around neuronal axons in the central nervous system (CNS). 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; MS, multiple sclerosis; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; MTS, mitochondrial transport signal; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic PAPA/NO, 3-(2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazino)-1-propanamine.1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; MS, multiple sclerosis; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; MTS, mitochondrial transport signal; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic PAPA/NO, 3-(2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazino)-1-propanamine. Alterations in oligodendrocyte function lead to disruption of myelinogenesis and can cause severe neurological deficits, such as those found in multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the extensive white matter degeneration observed after an ischemic insult to the CNS (1Raine C.S. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In demyelinating diseases, such as MS, oligodendrocytes are under immune attack, both cell-mediated and humoral (1Raine C.S. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Lucchinetti C.F. Rodriguez M. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1997; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that oligodendrocytes, besides being targets, may also be sources of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO), under inflammatory conditions (3Merrill J.E. Murphy S.P. Mitrovic A.

Taddei M.L. D'Angelo R. Santi S. Constantino-Ceccarini E. Melli M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 259-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines are important mediators in the inflammatory demyelination observed in human MS, as well as in animal models of MS, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis or Theiler virus infection. In these pathologies, proinflammatory cytokines released by endogenous cells or infiltrated macrophages and CD4 + Th1 cells accumulate and exert pleiotropic effects on oligodendrocytes (5Merrill J.E. Benveniste E.N. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 6Begolka W.S. Vanderlugt C.L. Rahbe S.M. Miller S.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4437-4446PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that two proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interferon-γ (Ifnγ), accumulate in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients (7Raine C.S. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Popko B. Corbin J.G. Baerwald K.D. Dupree J. Garcia A.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 14: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Separate studies using transgenic mice have revealed the development of a spontaneous inflammatory disease with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like symptoms and demyelination as a direct consequence of CNS-specific expression of TNFα (9Probert L. Akassoglou K. Pasparakis M. Kontogeorgos G. Kollias G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11294-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and Ifnγ (10Horwitz M.S. Evans C.F. McGavern D.B. Rodriguez M. Oldstone M.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Among the cytotoxic effector molecules evoked by proinflammatory stimuli mentioned above, increasing evidence supports a role for NO in the tissue damage observed in demyelinating diseases. In agreement with this notion is the finding that there is significant inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in these pathologies (11Bagasra O. Michaels F.H. Zheng Y.M. Bobroski L.E. Spitsin S. Fu Z.F. Tawadros R. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12041-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 12Zhao W. Tilton R.G. Corbett J.A. McDaniel M. Misko T.P. Williamson J.R. Cross A.H. Hickey W.F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 64: 123-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additionally, several reports have shown that oligodendroglial cells could be induced to express iNOS by proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide and release micromolar concentrations of NO (3Merrill J.E. Murphy S.P. Mitrovic A. Mackenzie-Graham A. Dopp J.C. Ding M. Griscavage J. Ignarro L.J. Lowenstein C.J. J. Neurosci.

Res. 1999; 56: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).NO is a potentially toxic molecule that has been implicated in a wide range of diverse (patho)physiological processes in the CNS. It is known that the production of NO from l-arginine is important for intercellular signaling, nonspecific host defense, and in helping to kill tumors and invading pathogens. Massive NO formation, under certain conditions, can be cytotoxic and initiate apoptosis. In vitro studies have shown a direct toxicity of NO on oligodendrocytes, suggesting a role for NO in cell injury (16Mitrovic B. Ignarro L.J. Montestruque S. Smoll A. Merrill J.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 61: 575-585Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Boullerne A.I. Nedelkoska L. Benjamins J.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1050-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). NO cytotoxicity may result in the production of peroxynitrite, a highly reactive product of the reaction between NO and superoxide. Nitrosylation of proteins, peroxidation of lipids, S-nitrosylation of thiol groups, and inhibition of mitochondrial activity are among the cytotoxic effects resulting from exposure to NO/peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species. Because NO is a highly reactive molecule that can interact with a variety of cellular components, it appears likely that damage to several key cellular constituents may lead to the final demise of the cell. One likely critical site for injury is DNA. NO can react with DNA via multiple pathways. Once produced, subsequent conversion of nitric oxide to nitrous anhydride can lead to the nitrosative deamination of DNA bases, such as guanine and cytosine. Complex oxidation chemistry can also occur causing DNA base and sugar-oxidative modifications (18Burney S. Caulfield J.L. Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In a previous study from our laboratory (19Wilson G.L. Patton N.J. LeDoux S.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was shown that, in pancreatic β-cell cultures, NO damages mtDNA to a greater extent than nuclear DNA. Additionally, Ballinger et al. (20Ballinger S.W. Patterson C. Yan Ch-N. Doan R. Burow D.L. Young C.G. Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Ballinger C.A. Freeman B.A. Runge M.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) showed that, following exposure to NO and peroxynitrite in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, mtDNA was preferentially damaged relative to the nuclear β-globin gene, resulting in decreased cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial redox function. Mutations and deletions in mtDNA, which could arise from unrepaired DNA damage, have been linked to a variety of diseases and aging. Moreover, alterations in the mitochondrial genome, which influence electron transport, could affect cells through the initiation of progressive cell death. Neurodegenerative diseases, including MS, are associated with a progressive loss of cells (21Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Previously, we found a correlation between the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress and repair of mtDNA in oligodendrocytes (22Druzhyna N.M. Hollensworth S.B. Kelley M.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. Glia. 2003; 42: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the mtDNA damage caused by reactive nitrogen species produced after iNOS induction by proinflammatory cytokines in rat oligodendrocytes. The results showed that there was significant mtDNA damage following exposure to cytokines. Additionally, we targeted the DNA repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) with intrinsic AP lyase activity, which may be crucial for the repair of damage to the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, to mitochondria of oligodendrocytes. Overexpression of hOGG1 in mitochondria of oligodendrocytes had a protective effect against NO-mediated mtDNA damage and increased cellular survival following treatment with cytokines.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment—Rat oligodendrocytes were harvested and cultured as previously described (23LeDoux S.P. Shen C. Grishko V. Gard A. Wilson G. Glia. 1998; 24: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Differentiation of oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, using antibodies to surface antigens (A2B5, O4, O1), in which sequential and partially overlapping expression defines early precursor, late precursor, and terminally differentiated oligodendrocyte stages, as described previously in detail (22Druzhyna N.M. Hollensworth S.B. Kelley M.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. Glia. 2003; 42: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For several experiments, a vector containing a mitochondrial transport sequence (MTS) upstream of the sequence for hOGG1 was transfected into the cells. The construct has been described previously (22Druzhyna N.M. Hollensworth S.B. Kelley M.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. Glia. 2003; 42: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a combination of 2 μg of DNA/6 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the specification of the manufacturer. The highest levels of recombinant protein expression were observed 24–72 h after transient transfection. The efficiency of transfection and the localization of the recombinant protein were determined as described previously (21Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Transfected or untransfected cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml TNFα (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 25 ng/ml Ifnγ (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) individually or in combination for 24, 48, or 72 h.NO Determination—The intracellular production of NO was determined as the accumulation of nitrite (a stable oxidation product of NO) in the culture medium using the Griess method (24Green K.C. Wagner D.A. Glowgowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10674) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 100 μl of culture medium were mixed with an equal volume of the Griess reagent (0.1% (1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 1% sulfanilamide, and 2.5% phosphoric acid). The absorbance at 550 nm was determined in a microplate reader, using sodium nitrite solutions (10–100 μm/l) as standards.Assay for DNA Damage Detection by Southern Blot—As described in our previous publications (19Wilson G.L. Patton N.J. LeDoux S.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Druzhyna N.M. Hollensworth S.B. Kelley M.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DNA damage was detected using a quantitative Southern blot technique in conjunction with either a mitochondrial-specific or an IgE-specific PCR-generated probe. The probe used to hybridize to mtDNA was generated via PCR from the mouse mtDNA sequence using the following primers: 5′-GCAGGAACAGGATGAACAGTCT-3′ from the sense strand and 5′-GTATCGTGAAGCACGATGTCAAGGGATGAG-3′ from the antisense strand. The 745-bp PCR product recognizes a 10.8-kb restriction fragment when hybridized to rat DNA digested with BamHI. To detect the nuclear IgE gene, primers were selected as follows: 5′-ACATCACCAAGCCCACTGTAGATCTACTCC-3′ from the sense strand and 5′-CACGGTGATATTCTCCTCACTTTCCAGGTC-3′ from the antisense strand. The 516-bp PCR product recognizes an 8-kb restriction fragment when hybridized to rat DNA digested with BamHI. Autoradiographic bands were densitometrically scanned. The break frequency was determined, as previously described (25Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the Poisson expression s = -ln P0, where s is the number of breaks/fragment and P0 is the fraction of fragments, free of breaks.Assay for mtDNA Damage at the Nucleotide Level by Ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR)—DNA extraction and LM-PCR conditions have been previously described in detail (28Grishko V.I. Druzhyna N. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated and alkali-treated DNA from each sample was subjected to ligation-mediated PCR. Primer extension and ligation were all performed using the procedure initially described by Pfeifer et al. (26Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with certain modifications (28Grishko V.I. Druzhyna N. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After ligation, the reaction products were precipitated and then resuspended in H2O. PCR amplification was performed as previously described (26Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the only exception being the use of 5 pmol/μl primer and a longer oligonucleotide for the asymmetric linker. The increase in the amount of primer used in the LM-PCR was designed to compensate for the increased number of mtDNA templates present in cells compared with single-copy nuclear genes. After PCR, all samples were precipitated by cold ethanol. Pellets were air-dried and resuspended in a formamide dye solution. Samples were electrophoresed using a regular sequencing gel, blotted, and then UV light was cross-linked to the membrane, as previously described (28Grishko V.I. Druzhyna N. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with a single-strand PCR-generated probe using a primer for the appropriate strand. After exposure of the membrane to Kodak XAR film, the density of individual hybridization bands corresponding to nucleotide bases of interest was evaluated by densitometric scanning of the radioautographs.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell protein lysates, nuclear, mitochondrial, or cytosolic protein fractions, obtained as described previously (22Druzhyna N.M. Hollensworth S.B. Kelley M.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. Glia. 2003; 42: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), were used for Western blot assays. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye microassay according to the manufacturer's recommendation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer of separated proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride-membrane were performed by standard procedures. Blocking and antibody immunoblotting were performed in 6% nonfat dry milk, Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). TBS-T and TBS were used for washing. The monoclonal anti-iNOS/NOS type II antibodies were from BD Biosciences; the polyclonal anti-hOGG1antibodies were from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO); anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody was purchased from Pharmingen; the anti-lamin B1 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the antiserum to caspase-9 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and the anti-actin antibody was from Sigma. The immune complexes formed by these antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) using chemiluminescent reagents (SuperSignal; Pierce, Rockford, IL).TUNEL Assay—The presence of DNA breaks were evaluated by a TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nickend labeling) procedure as described previously (29Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9119) Google Scholar). For detection and quantitation of apoptotic cells, the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system from Promega was used. It measures the fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells by catalytically incorporating fluorescein-12-dUTP at 3′-OH DNA ends using the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's procedure. Briefly, cells were grown on slides, fixed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Thereafter, DNA strand breaks were labeled with fluorescein-12-dUTP by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. The number of apoptotic cells with green fluorescence (fluorescein-12-dUTP)/100 blue DAPI-stained nuclei was calculated by fluorescence microscopy.Caspase-8 and -9 Activity Assay—After cytokine treatment, cells were rinsed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and collected via centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. Caspase-8 and -9 activities were measured using colorimetric assay kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, cells were lysed on ice for 10 min, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and 200 μg of supernatant proteins were incubated with caspase-8-specific or caspase-9-specific substrates. The assay was read on a microplate reader using a 405-nm wavelength of light.Data Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test to compare individual means with significant differences at a confidence level of p < 0.05.RESULTSSeveral studies have reported that rat oligodendrocytes produce nitric oxide as a result of the induction of the type II iNOS gene (5Merrill J.E. Benveniste E.N. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 13Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In agreement with these reports, our experiments utilizing the combination of TNFα (50 ng/ml) and Ifnγ (25 ng/ml) stimulated NO production in oligodendrocytes. As shown at Fig. 1A, NO production was determined as nitrite (a stable oxidation product of NO) released into the culture medium using a colorimetric method (see “Experimental Procedures”). To evaluate the expression of iNOS in cytokine-treated cultures, we carried out immunoblot analyses using antibodies specific for iNOS. The data illustrated in Fig. 1B confirm the induction of iNOS synthesis in response to the combination of TNFα and Ifnγ. iNOS expression reached maximum levels 48 h after treatment. The cultures treated with TNFα and Ifnγ individually did not produce NO nor did they contain detectable immunoreactive iNOS protein (Fig. 1).Previously, our laboratory has shown that endogenously produced NO can damage mtDNA in pancreatic β-cells (19Wilson G.L. Patton N.J. LeDoux S.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we examined the relationship between cytokine-induced NO production and mtDNA damage in oligodendrocytes. Quantitative Southern blot analysis revealed damage to mtDNA in oligodendrocytes 48 h after TNFα and Ifnγ treatment (Fig. 2). mtDNA damage in oligodendrocytes 72 h after the introduction of the cytokines was less pronounced, suggesting the activation of mtDNA repair mechanisms in the remaining viable cells. Treatment with cytokines and the inhibitor of iNOS, aminoguanidine, significantly reduced mtDNA damage in the cells (Fig. 2). The number of DNA breaks in similarly sized fragments of nuclear DNA containing the IgE gene was ∼10-fold less than that detected in mitochondrial DNA and falls in the range of background noise for quantitative Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3).Fig. 2TNFα + Ifnγ treatment of oligodendrocytes induced NO-mediated mtDNA damage. The cultures were treated with TNFα (50 ng/ml) and Ifnγ (25 ng/ml) for 48 and 72 h with or without 0.5 mm aminoguanidine. High molecular weight DNA was isolated and digested to completion with BamHI.

This sequence contained one of the break points for the 5-kb “common deletion” that accumulates in mtDNA with aging (30Piko L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Cortopassi G.A. Arnheim N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that NO can modify DNA by causing the deamination of purines, whereas reactive oxygen species generated by the enzymatic reaction of xanthine oxidase and substrate hypoxanthine cause modifications in both purines and pyrimidines (28Grishko V.I. Druzhyna N. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pattern of cytokine-induced mtDNA damage was compared with the pattern of damage produced by PAPA/NO, xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine, and peroxynitrite (Fig. 4). Using a Maxim-Gilbert sequencing ladder to identify bases, it appeared that most of the damage caused by PAPA/NO involved guanines, with some adenines also being affected (Figs. 4 and 5). In comparison, peroxynitrite and cytokines preferentially modified guanine and adenine; however, some thymine and cytosine residues also were modified. Thymine and guanine were the preferred targets of xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine. It is readily apparent from the lesion map in Fig. 5 that the pattern of damage was virtually identical for cytokines and peroxynitrite, suggesting that peroxynitrite is the oxidizing agent responsible for most of the cytokine-mediated mtDNA damage.Fig. 4Effect of various genotoxins on the pattern of mitochondrial DNA damage. Oligodendrocytes were treated with XO (50 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase + 0.5 mm hypoxanthine) for 1 h, NO (50 mm PAPA/NO) for 20 min, ONOO (200 μm peroxynitrite) for 5 min, and TI (50 ng/ml TNFα + 25 ng/ml Ifnγ) for 48 h. C, untreated control. After treatment, cells were lysed, DNA was isolated, digested, and subjected to ligation-mediated PCR.

https://openalex.org/W2129576311,"Glutaredoxin (Grx) and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) are members of the thioredoxin superfamily of thiol/disulfide exchange catalysts. Thermodynamically, rat PDI is a 600-fold better oxidizing agent than Grx1 from Escherichia coli. Despite that, Grx1 is a surprisingly good protein oxidase. It catalyzes protein disulfide formation in a redox buffer with an initial velocity that is 30-fold faster than PDI. Catalysis of protein and peptide oxidation by the individual catalytic domains of PDI and by a Grx1-PDI chimera show that differences in active site chemistry are fundamental to their oxidase activity. Mutations in the active site cysteines reveal that Grx1 needs only one cysteine to catalyze rapid substrate oxidation, whereas PDI requires both cysteines. Grx1 is a good oxidase because of the high reactivity of a Grx1-glutathione mixed disulfide, and PDI is a good oxidase because of the high reactivity of the disulfide between the two active site cysteines. As a protein disulfide reductase, Grx1 is also superior to PDI. It catalyzes the reduction of nonnative disulfides in scrambled ribonuclease and protein-glutathione mixed disulfides 30–180 times faster than PDI. A multidomain structure is necessary for PDI to catalyze effective protein reduction; however, placing Grx1 into the PDI multidomain structure does not enhance its already high reductase activity. Grx1 and PDI have both found mechanisms to enhance active site reactivity toward proteins, particularly in the kinetically difficult direction: Grx1 by providing a reactive glutathione mixed disulfide to supplement its oxidase activity and PDI by utilizing its multidomain structure to supplement its reductase activity. Glutaredoxin (Grx) and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) are members of the thioredoxin superfamily of thiol/disulfide exchange catalysts. Thermodynamically, rat PDI is a 600-fold better oxidizing agent than Grx1 from Escherichia coli. Despite that, Grx1 is a surprisingly good protein oxidase. It catalyzes protein disulfide formation in a redox buffer with an initial velocity that is 30-fold faster than PDI. Catalysis of protein and peptide oxidation by the individual catalytic domains of PDI and by a Grx1-PDI chimera show that differences in active site chemistry are fundamental to their oxidase activity. Mutations in the active site cysteines reveal that Grx1 needs only one cysteine to catalyze rapid substrate oxidation, whereas PDI requires both cysteines. Grx1 is a good oxidase because of the high reactivity of a Grx1-glutathione mixed disulfide, and PDI is a good oxidase because of the high reactivity of the disulfide between the two active site cysteines. As a protein disulfide reductase, Grx1 is also superior to PDI. It catalyzes the reduction of nonnative disulfides in scrambled ribonuclease and protein-glutathione mixed disulfides 30–180 times faster than PDI. A multidomain structure is necessary for PDI to catalyze effective protein reduction; however, placing Grx1 into the PDI multidomain structure does not enhance its already high reductase activity. Grx1 and PDI have both found mechanisms to enhance active site reactivity toward proteins, particularly in the kinetically difficult direction: Grx1 by providing a reactive glutathione mixed disulfide to supplement its oxidase activity and PDI by utilizing its multidomain structure to supplement its reductase activity. Members of the thioredoxin superfamily of redox proteins transfer reducing and oxidizing equivalents between proteins through thiol-disulfide exchange. With overall structural similarity, the classical thioredoxin and glutaredoxin members of the family all have an active site with the sequence CXXC (1Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The two active site cysteines are able to cycle between dithiol and disulfide redox states. Despite the similarities in the active sites and a general mechanism involving thiol-disulfide exchange, thioredoxin family proteins serve a diverse set of biological functions. The family patriarch is thioredoxin, the principal function of which is to provide reducing equivalents for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by reducing the active site disulfide of ribonucleotide reductase (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins (Grx), 1The abbreviations used are: Grx, glutaredoxin; Grx1, glutaredoxin 1 from E. coli; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SG-RNase, RNase with its cysteines in mixed disulfides with glutathione. which have a GSH binding site (3Bushweller J.H. Billeter M. Holmgren A. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), serve as reductants of protein-SG mixed disulfides and also provide reducing equivalents to ribonucleotide reductase apart from their many other functions (4Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and its prokaryotic counterpart, DsbA, function primarily to introduce disulfides into protein substrates during oxidative protein folding (5Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 6Solovyov A. Xiao R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34095-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In thioredoxin and PDI, the more N-terminal cysteine, CXXC, of the active site is exposed to solution (7Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and acts as a nucleophile to attack substrate disulfides (8Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The second active cysteine, CXXC, is buried and constrained to react with only the N-terminal active site cysteine (7Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The reduction potentials of the active site disulfides of the thioredoxin family span an extremely large range, depending, in part, on the identity of the two XX residues and the protein context in which the CXXC sequence occurs. The reduction potential of the best oxidant, DsbA (–124 mV) differs from the reduction potential of the worst oxidant, thioredoxin (–270 mV) by more than 146 mV, corresponding to a ratio of nearly 105 in thermodynamic stability during the disulfide/dithiol equilibrium (9Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Within the family, there is a strong correlation between the identity of the two intervening residues and the redox potentials (10Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Fold Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 11Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Both Raines and co-workers (12Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2659-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Creighton and co-workers (13Kortemme T. Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14503-14511Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have argued that much of the difference in reduction potential can be attributed to factors that stabilize the thiolate anion of the reduced active site. The active site cysteines have been suggested to form a thiol-thiolate hydrogen bond network, which stabilizes the more N-terminal active site thiolate in the reduced form of the proteins (14Nordstrand K. Aslund F. Meunier S. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Jeng M.F. Holmgren A. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10101-10105Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In general, the kinetic properties of the thioredoxin family proteins parallel their thermodynamic ones. In its reduced state, thioredoxin and glutaredoxin are exceptional reductants of both protein and nonprotein disulfides (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the poorest reductants thermodynamically, PDI and DsbA, are also poor reductants kinetically. When comparing the kinetics of substrate disulfide formation using the oxidized (disulfide) active site, DsbA and protein-disulfide isomerase are the best oxidants kinetically. A link between thermodynamics and kinetic reactivity is not unexpected, given the overall mechanism of thiol-disulfide exchange, where the fundamental chemical process is the same among all the family members. For thiol/disulfide exchange, the transition state is symmetrical (18Wilson J.M. Bayer R.J. Hupe D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 7922-7926Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors affecting the stabilities of either the thiolate or disulfide will also be reflected in the transition state for thiol-disulfide exchange. Glutaredoxins, also known as thioltransferases, are predominately localized to the cytoplasm but also have been detected in the nucleus and mitochondria (19Sahlin L. Wang H. Stjernholm Y. Lundberg M. Ekman G. Holmgren A. Eriksson H. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 6: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins catalyze the reduction of protein-SG mixed disulfides, preventing their accumulation in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm (4Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, PDI and DsbA are localized in the more oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum and periplasm, respectively, in keeping with their function as oxidases. Escherichia coli Grx1 is a single domain protein, but mammalian PDI is a multidomain catalyst (22Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PDI is composed of four structural domains, all of which adopt a thioredoxin fold. The two catalytic domains of PDI (a and a′) are separated by two intervening structural domains (b and b′). The multidomain structure is important in the catalysis of disulfide isomerization during protein folding, but it is not essential for PDI oxidase activity. PDI catalyzes disulfide isomerization in vivo, but its principal function in yeast is to serve as an oxidase for disulfide formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Solovyov A. Xiao R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34095-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In light of the expected linkage of kinetics and thermodynamics in the thioredoxin family, we were struck by the observation that Grx1 is a much better oxidase for protein dithiols than PDI despite the fact that PDI is a 600-fold better oxidant, thermodynamically (9Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To investigate the basis of the unusual versatility of glutaredoxin as a protein oxidase and reductase, we have compared the kinetics of disulfide formation and reduction catalyzed by Grx1 and PDI. We also constructed a chimerical protein with the Grx1 structure in place of one of the active site domains in PDI. Mutation of the more C-terminal active site cysteines of Grx1 and PDI shows that Grx1, but not PDI, can utilize a single active site cysteine to catalyze protein oxidation through the formation of a Grx-SG mixed disulfide. As an oxidase, Grx1 provides oxidizing equivalents to its substrates through a reactive mixed disulfide with glutathione. As protein-disulfide reductases, both Grx1 and PDI require two active site cysteines. For PDI, its multidomain structure is needed to catalyze protein disulfide reduction, whereas multiple domains are not needed to catalyze substrate oxidation. It is suggested that both Grx1 and PDI have developed specialized mechanisms to enhance catalysis of reactions that would normally be difficult because of the thermodynamic stability of the active site thiols and disulfides. Materials—Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase), GSH, GSSG, NADPH, cCMP, and glutathione reductase were from Sigma. The peptide substrate used in this study was purchased from Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). It has the sequence NRCSQGSCWN, with the N- and C-terminal groups acetylated and amidated, respectively. Peptide concentrations in solution were determined using the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 5690 m–1 cm–1 calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Mutagenesis—PDI mutants with a single active site cysteine were produced previously (8Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cys14 of E. coli Grx1 was mutated to Ser using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene to create Grx1C14S. The method of Xiao et al. (24Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was employed to create the Grx1-PDI chimera, Grx-b-b′-a′(SGHS)c. The vector combined an N-terminal Grx1 domain with the b-b′-a′c domains of PDI using a GlySer linker. The cysteines in the C-terminal, a′, catalytic domain of PDI were both mutated to serine so that the only catalytic contribution must come from the Grx1 domain. For PDI, Grx1, and their mutants, proteins were expressed from pET15rx with an N-terminal His6 tag (24Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using a HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) as described (24Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and were greater than 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of RNase Variants—Fully reduced RNase was prepared by reduction of the native protein in urea as described (25Ruoppolo M. Lundstrom-Ljung J. Talamo F. Pucci P. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12259-12267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mixed disulfide of RNase and glutathione (SG-RNase) was prepared as described in Ref. 26Lundstrom-Ljung J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, but without HPLC purification. Scrambled RNase A was prepared as described in Ref. 27Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar. Peptide Oxidase Activity—Thiol-disulfide exchange reactions between peptide, Grx1, and PDI or its domains were carried out in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GSSG, and 2 mm GSH at 25 °C with a peptide concentration of 20 μm and at an enzyme concentration of 1 μm. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed after different reaction times, and thiol-disulfide exchange was quenched by the addition of HCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m. Oxidized and reduced peptide species in the quenched reaction mixture were separated and analyzed on Sephasil C18 SC 2.1/1.0 column (SMART system; Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 5–25% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 25 min at a flow rate of 100 μl min–1. At the end of this gradient, the acetonitrile concentration was increased to 75% (v/v) to elute the absorbed enzyme. Peptides were detected and quantified by their absorbance at 215 nm. The initial velocity of the peptide oxidation was determined from the initial rate of formation of the oxidized peptide. Oxidase Activity toward Reduced RNase—In 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the renaturation of RNase activity was followed by the concurrent hydrolysis of cCMP due to the gain of RNase activity as described by Lyles and Gilbert (28Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A glutathione redox buffer (1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm GSSG) was used to maintain the optimum redox state. The final concentration of reduced RNase was 8 μm. Plots of the concentration of active RNase against time show a characteristic lag, during which time the reduced RNase is oxidized to a mixture of nearly random disulfides (25Ruoppolo M. Lundstrom-Ljung J. Talamo F. Pucci P. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12259-12267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The lag time was determined by extrapolating the linear gain in RNase activity after the lag back to zero active RNase formed. The initial velocity of dithiol oxidation was estimated from the lag time by assuming that lag represents approximately three half-lives for the oxidation of the four disulfides of RNase. Whereas this is a rough approximation of the initial velocity, the rate is proportional to the concentration of the oxidase (8Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the lag can be measured reproducibly. The background rate in the absence of catalyst was subtracted. For catalysts such as Grx1 that do not display any isomerase activity, a small amount of wild type PDI or an oxidase-deficient mutant with only a single cysteine active site (PDI NCGHS:CSGHS) was included at a concentration of 1 μm. In this case, the background velocity was that observed in the absence of Grx1. Reduction of Scrambled RNase and SG-RNase—The reduction of SG-RNase was followed by coupling the formation of GSSG to the oxidation of NADPH using glutathione reductase. Reaction mixtures contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm NADPH, yeast glutathione reductase (0.14 units/ml), and 5 μm SG-RNase. The reactions were started by adding PDI or Grx1. Rates were corrected for the slow uncatalyzed reduction that occurs in the absence of PDI or Grx1. The reduction of 25 μm scrambled RNase was carried out in the presence of 3 mm GSH in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 mm NADPH, and 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase. The oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm in the presence of 0–10 μm Grx1 or PDI, Grx1C14S, or PDI NCGHS:CCGHS. The specific activity was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of 6300 m–1 cm–1 for NADPH. Reduction of Grx1—The stoichiometric reduction of Grx1 by GSH was observed by coupling the formation of GSSG to the oxidation of NADPH with glutathione reductase. The reaction was monitored by the change in fluorescence of NADPH using a cut-off filter of 395 nm (excitation 340 nm). The reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of oxidized Grx1 (3 μm final concentration) with a solution of NADPH (5 μm final concentration), GSH (0–1 mm), and glutathione reductase (10 units/ml), all in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. Data were acquired using a SF-2004 stopped-flow instrument (KinTek Corp.). At each GSH concentration, the first-order rate constant for the disappearance of NADPH fluorescence was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting to a monoexponential decrease followed by a slow, linear change in absorbance with time due to a slow oxidation of NADPH. This linear correction was significant only at concentrations of GSH below 0.2 mm, and, even then, the correction was small compared with the total change in fluorescence. To monitor the competence of the trapping reaction for GSSG, 3 μm GSSG was reduced by NADPH and glutathione reductase at the same concentrations used to follow Grx1 reduction. The rate constant for the disappearance of GSSG (0.85 s–1) was at least 4 times the maximum observed rate constant for Grx1 reduction. The rate constants for Grx1 reduction as a function of GSH concentration were determined by nonlinear least squares fitting to Equation 2 as described under “Results” (30Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7298-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Catalysis of Peptide Oxidation—Protein substrates are complex, with multiple disulfides, both native and nonnative. To observe the intrinsic reactivity of the various active sites on a well defined substrate, and to determine whether protein substrates are unique substrates for PDI and/or Grx1, the catalyzed oxidation of a small peptide (NRCSQGSCWN) was examined. Typical data are shown in Fig. 1, and the results for a more extensive series of catalysts are summarized in Table I. With this peptide substrate, native PDI and Grx1 are both efficient oxidases. PDI requires both active site cysteines to catalyze peptide oxidation, consistent with a dithiol mechanism of disulfide formation as with protein substrates. The individual catalytic domains of PDI are also effective oxidases, comparable with the full-length molecule. The other domains of PDI (Table I) and the potential substrate interactions they may provide are not important to peptide oxidase activity. However, Grx1 is still a superior oxidase (5-fold based on active site concentrations) when compared with PDI. A CXXS mutation in Grx1(Grx1C14S) has no significant effect on the peptide oxidase activity, suggesting that Grx1 catalyzes the peptide oxidation through a monothiol mechanism that requires only the nucleophilic cysteine (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table ICatalysis of peptide oxidation by Grx1, PDI, and mutants with a single cysteine in the active siteProteinPeptide oxidase activityμm/min/μm proteinWild type Grx68 ± 4Grx1C14S46 ± 1Wild type PDI20 ± 1PDI-a27 ± 1Mutant PDI-a (CGHS)0.8 ± 0.4PDI-a′10 ± 1Mutant PDI-a′ (CGHS)1 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Catalysis of Protein Oxidation—During the catalysis of the oxidative refolding of reduced RNase, the initial phase of disulfide formation rarely produces native RNase (32Marino G. Pucci P. Ruoppolo M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 160: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, there is a significant lag time before the appearance of the enzymatically active, native RNase. This lag is associated with the formation of RNase disulfides that must be broken and reformed to produce native RNase, and it can be used as an indicator of the rate of protein oxidation (8Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the addition of the catalyst of oxidative folding, PDI, significantly decreases the lag compared with the uncatalyzed reaction as well as catalyzing the isomerization of incorrect disulfides leading to native RNase formation. A small amount of Grx1, in addition to the PDI that is present, greatly decreases the lag (accelerates the oxidation) without substantially contributing to the subsequent isomerase activity, consistent with the results reported by Lundström-Ljung and Holmgren (33Lundström-Ljung J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PDI is a 600-fold better oxidant than Grx1 thermodynamicaly (9Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), but enzymatically, the active site of Grx1 is a 30-fold better oxidase than PDI in a redox buffer consisting of 1 mm GSH and 0.2 mm GSSG (Table II).Table IICatalysis of the oxidation of reduced RNase by Grx1, PDI, and mutants with a single cysteine in the active siteProteinProtein oxidase activityμm/min/μm proteinWild type Grx47 ± 6Grx1C14S72 ± 12Wild type PDI1.6 ± 0.1Mutant PDI (NCGHS:CCGHS)0.3 ± 0.02Mutant PDI(NCGHS:CSGHS)aData from Ref. 8.0.05 ± 0.01Mutant PDI(NSGHS:CCGHS)aData from Ref. 8.0.07 ± 0.01Grx-b-b′-a′(SGHS)-c43 ± 3a Data from Ref. 8Walker K.W.

Open table in a new tab During the oxidation of protein substrates, PDI catalyzes direct transfer of its active site disulfide into the substrate; both PDI active site cysteines are essential for effective catalysis of protein oxidation. PDI mutants with only the nucleophilic (N-terminal) cysteine (CGHS) are not active oxidases and do not decrease the lag during the oxidative folding of reduced RNase (Table II). However, mutation of the active site of Grx1 to remove the C-terminal cysteine has no significant effect on the ability of Grx1 to decrease the lag in RNase refolding. The observation that wild type Grx1 and Grx1C14S display comparable oxidase activities even at very low concentrations (50 nm) indicates that Grx1 can catalyze protein oxidation with only one of its active site cysteines and that the transfer of oxidizing equivalents from the redox buffer (GSSG) to the substrate most likely occurs through a Grx-SG mixed disulfide. In dealing with protein substrates, significant interactions between the catalyst (Grx1 or PDI) and the substrate protein (RNase) might contribute to their effectiveness as an oxidase. However, the catalytic domains of PDI are, by themselves, just as effective an oxidant as the intact molecule (34Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether Grx1 might utilize a protein interaction domain in making protein oxidation even more effective, the N-terminal catalytic domain of PDI was replaced by Grx1 to create a Grx1-PDI chimera, Grx-b-b′-a′(SGHS)c. The two cysteines of the C-terminal catalytic domain of PDI were also mutated to Ser so that the activity of Grx1 in the context of the rest of the PDI molecule might be observed. As with PDI, the addition of the protein interaction domains of PDI had no significant effect on the ability of Grx1 to function as an oxidant (Table II). Whereas we cannot be sure that the orientation of the catalytic site in the chimeric protein would allow Grx1 to take advantage of a peptide/protein biding site from the b-b′-a′-c domains of PDI, the ability of Grx1 and PDI to serve as oxidases relies almost exclusively on the high reactivity of an active site disulfide to introduce disulfides into protein substrates. In the case of Grx1, this active site disulfide is most likely a disulfide with glutathione, whereas for PDI, it represents an intramolecular disulfide between the two active site cysteines. Catalysis of Reduction—Because Grx1 is such a superior oxidase compared with PDI, we were also interested in directly comparing the ability of the two proteins to catalyze reduction. In line with its very negative reduction potential, Grx1 is a more effective reductase than PDI (16-fold on a molar basis) in catalyzing the reduction of the protein disulfides in scrambled RNase. However, Grx1 now requires both active site cysteines to be an effective reductant. Mutation of the more C-terminal cysteine in the Grx1 active site decreases the reductase activity by 15-fold, indicating that like PDI, both active site cysteines make a significant contribution to catalyzing protein disulfide reduction (Table III). Bushweller et al. (35Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have found that Grx1 reduction of ribonucleotide reductase requires both active site cysteines, consistent with our observation that catalysis of protein disulfide reduction by Grx1, in general, needs both active site cysteines.Table IIICatalysis of the reduction of scrambled RNase by PDI, Grx1, and mutants of PDI and Grx1 with single cysteines at the active siteProteinReductase activityμm/min/μm proteinWild type Grx390 ± 35Grx1C14S25 ± 3Wild type PDI13.0 ± 1.3Mutant PDI (NCGHS:CCGHS)8.0 ± 0.5Grx-b-b′-a′(SGHS)-c110 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Given that the active site thermodynamics suggest that Grx1 is a 600-fold better reductant (redox potential 83 mV more negative) than PDI, the 15-fold difference observed in reductase activities (Table III) is surprisingly low. Darby et al. showed that the individual domains of PDI (a or a′) by themselves are very poor reductases (2–3% of wild type PDI activity) (22Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the multidomain structure of PDI enhances the reductase activity considerably (30–50-fold); the catalytic domains are very poor reductases in the absence of the catalyst-substrate interactions that are available from its multiple domains.

https://openalex.org/W1993109262,"Modification of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide by the addition of the sugar 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) is a strategy adopted by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria to evade cationic antimicrobial peptides produced by the innate immune system. l-Ara4N biosynthesis is therefore a potential anti-infective target, because inhibiting its synthesis would render certain pathogens more sensitive to the immune system. The bifunctional enzyme ArnA, which is required for l-Ara4N biosynthesis, catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid to generate a UDP-4′-keto-pentose sugar and also catalyzes transfer of a formyl group from N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate to the 4′-amine of UDP-l-Ara4N. We now report the crystal structure of the N-terminal formyltransferase domain in a complex with uridine monophosphate and N-5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Using this structure, we identify the active site of formyltransfer in ArnA, including the key catalytic residues Asn102, His104, and Asp140. Additionally, we have shown that residues Ser433 and Glu434 of the decarboxylase domain are required for the oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-GlcUA. An E434Q mutant is inactive, suggesting that chemical rather than steric properties of this residue are crucial in the decarboxylation reaction. Our data suggest that the decarboxylase domain catalyzes both hydride abstraction (oxidation) from the C-4′ position and the subsequent decarboxylation.

The outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria predominantly consists of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CAMP, cationic antimicrobial peptide; FMT, N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate:l-methionyl-tRNA N-formyltransferase; GART, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; l-Ara4N, 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose; N-5-fTHF, N-5-formyltetrahydrofolate; N-10-fTHF, N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate; RmlB, dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase; SDR, short chain dehydrogenase; Se-Met, selenomethionine; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. molecule. This immunogenic glycolipid is anchored to the membrane by lipid A, which is the active moiety causing many of the pathophysiological effects associated with Gram-negative sepsis (1Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The innate immune response activated by lipid A includes production of cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), cytokines, clotting factors, and other immunostimulatory molecules (2Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar, 3Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1991; 77: 1627-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu.

Severe sepsis can lead to a shock syndrome, which is brought on by high levels of cytokines and procoagulants and in some cases causes organ failure and even death (6Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). CAMPs are small, positively charged peptides, and their antimicrobial properties arise through their interactions with the lipid A moiety (7Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6794) Google Scholar, 8Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

These peptides interact electrostatically with the negative groups of the LPS and then traverse the outer membrane, forming pores that result in permeabilization and cell death (10Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 11Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Many Gram-negative bacteria have evolved resistance to CAMPs by modifying the negative groups of LPS to reduce the net negative charge, thus reducing the attraction to CAMPs (12Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S.

These modifications include acetylation of the O antigen and the addition of phosphoethanolamine and/or 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) to the 1′- and 4′-phosphates of lipid A (13Gunn J.S. J.

Modification of lipid A by l-Ara4N in Salmonella typhimurium can be abolished through mutations in the pmrE/ugd gene or the pmrF operon, rendering these cells sensitive to polymyxin B (a CAMP type antibiotic) (12Gunn J.S.

Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The pmrF operon encodes seven genes, which are co-transcribed under PmrA control, that are required for polymyxin resistance, with the exception of pmrM (12Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C.

The pmrF operon and pmrE gene are also conserved in many other pathogenic bacteria that are known to modify their lipid A with l-Ara4N, including Escherichia coli K-12, Yersinia pestis, and the major cystic fibrosis pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12Gunn J.S.

Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity of the enzymes encoded by the pmrE and -F loci to enzymes of known function led to a proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of the l-Ara4N moiety and its attachment to lipid A (Fig. 1) (14Zhou Z.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which has since been largely validated by Raetz and co-workers (21Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The first step is the conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), catalyzed by the well characterized enzyme UDP-Glc dehydrogenase. UDP-GlcUA is then oxidatively decarboxylated by ArnA in the first unique step of the pathway, giving a UDP-4′-keto-pentose (21Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This 4′-keto sugar is subsequently converted to a 4′-amino sugar, UDP-l-Ara4N, by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme ArnB (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24731-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Noland B.W. Newman J.M. Hendle J. Badger J. Christopher J.A. Tresser J. Buchanan M.D. Wright T.A.

ArnA then catalyzes a second reaction, the transfer of a formyl group from N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate (N-10-fTHF) to the 4′-amine of UDP-l-Ara4N, yielding UDP-l-Ara4FN. The membrane-bound protein ArnC catalyzes the transfer of the l-Ara4FN moiety from UDP to undecaprenyl-phosphate, generating Und-P-l-Ara4FN (25Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. McClerren A.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14154-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The ArnC enzymatic product is then deformylated by ArnD and transported to the outer surface of the inner membrane by a process that is not yet fully understood. The deformylated l-Ara4N moiety is then transferred from undecaprenyl-phosphate to lipid A by ArnT (23Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of ArnA reveals two discrete catalytic domains. The N-terminal formyltransferase domain is homologous to N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate, l-methionyl-tRNA N-formyltransferase (FMT), and glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART). The mechanism of transfer of the formyl group to a free amine group, catalyzed by the FMT and GART enzymes, is quite well understood (26Almassy R.J. Janson C.A. Kan C.C. Hostomska Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6114-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, details of the active site structure of the ArnA formyltransferase domain are unknown. The C-terminal domain of ArnA is homologous to UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (RmlB), and other short chain dehydrogenase (SDR) enzymes that oxidize the C4′ position of sugar nucleotides. The structure of the decarboxylase domain has recently been reported, and it confirms that the enzyme belongs to the SDR class of enzymes, although no biochemical characterization was reported (27Gatzeva-Topalova P.Z. May A.P. Sousa M.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13370-13379Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A key question about the ArnA C-terminal decarboxylase domain is the mechanism of decarboxylation. The formation of the keto sugar is well understood from studies of RmlB enzyme. However, whether the decarboxylation is spontaneous or catalyzed by ArnA is not known. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of l-Ara4N are all potential therapeutic targets for the production of new anti-infectives. ArnA is a good target because of its involvement in two steps of this pathway. The well known inhibitory effects of deaza analogues of folic acid on GART activity make the formyltransferase domain particularly interesting (26Almassy R.J. Janson C.A. Kan C.C. Hostomska Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6114-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Beardsley G.P. Moroson B.A. Taylor E.C. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 328-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore an understanding of the mechanism of action and the structure of these two domains will be useful for inhibitor design. Here we report the structure of the N-terminal formyltransferase domain as a complex with UMP and a substrate analog, N-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (N-5-fTHF), allowing identification of the active site. We have also determined the structure of the C-terminal decarboxylase domain and present biochemical evidence for the involvement of Ser433 and Glu434 in the decarboxylation reaction. Overexpression of Native and Selenomethionine Decarboxylase and Formyltransferase Domains of ArnA—Full-length protein was cloned and expressed but failed to yield satisfactory crystals. As a result, we chose to work on the separate domains. The N-terminal domain of ArnA from E. coli (residues Met1 to Asn305) and the C-terminal domain (T316M to Ser660) were cloned into pET24b to produce the pET-FT and pET-DH plasmids, respectively. E. coli BL21DE3 cells were transformed with either the pET-DH or pET-FT plasmids for overexpression of the decarboxylase and formyltransferase domains, respectively. Single colonies were grown in 10 ml of LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin overnight. Overnight incubations were used to inoculate 500 ml of the same LB or 250 ml of M9 medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, in 2-liter flasks for growth of native or selenomethionine-modified (Se-Met) protein, respectively. For overexpression of native protein, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. The purification protocols of the two native proteins were very similar; supernatant containing target protein was applied to an HQ anion exchange affinity column (Applied Biosystems), and bound proteins were eluted with an increasing concentration of NaCl (0.05–1 m). NaCl was added to a final concentration of 4.5 m to fractions containing the target protein and then applied to an HP hydrophobic column (Applied Biosystems). The target protein was eluted with a decreasing NaCl gradient, dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, and further purified by S200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Each step of purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After the gel filtration step, both proteins were judged, by Coomassie-stained gels, to be pure. The decarboxylase and formyltransferase proteins were concentrated to 5 mg ml–1 and 8 mg ml–1, respectively, and dialyzed into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol for crystallization trials. Standard protocols were employed for Se-Met expression (29Doublie S. Macromol. Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Purification of the Se-Met protein is identical to that of the native protein, but all buffers also contained 7 mm dithiothreitol. Mutants of the decarboxylase domain were purified identically to the native protein. Association of Domains with Each Other and with ArnB Association of Domains with Each Other and with ArnB—To investigate whether the isolated domains interact with each other, the purified domains, at ∼3 mg ml–1 (∼0.075 mm), were mixed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl. The mixture was applied to an S200 gel filtration column, and the elution of proteins was followed by A280. No material eluted at the same point as the full-length protein that was used as a standard. We repeated the experiment adding 5 mm UDP-GlcUA, 5 mm NAD+, and N-5-fTHF (Sigma) to the buffer, but again no peak corresponding to a complex was observed. We also performed the same analysis with purified ArnB (2 mg ml–1) incubating individually with both isolated domains and full-length ArnA in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl. We repeated the full-length ArnA ArnB experiment with 5 mm glutamic acid (Sigma) and 5 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (Sigma) added to buffer. We did not observe any complex formation. To detect formation of a complex between His-tagged ArnB and ArnA, a pull-down experiment using the penta-His antibody (Qiagen) was done as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, purified ArnB-N6H (450 ng) (22Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24731-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was incubated with a cell-free extract overexpressing ArnA (750 ng) (21Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 90 min with shaking in 400 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol. Nontagged proteins were precipitated with 40 μl of Protein G-agarose (Sigma) before the 2 μg of penta-His antibody was added. Fresh Protein G-agarose was then added to precipitate ArnB-N6H. The precipitated Protein G-agarose was washed twice with 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Protein samples from each step were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining. Crystallization and Data Collection of Native and Se-Met Formyltransferase Protein—Protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 5 mmN-5-fTHF and 5 mm UDP (Sigma) before crystal screens were set up. Crystallization of the native protein was tested against commercially available screens (screens 1 and 2, index, peg/ion, and Wizard 1 and 2; Hampton), using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Drops contained 1 μl of protein with 1 μl of precipitant, against a well of 100 μl of precipitant. Good quality crystals were obtained in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m Bistris, pH 5.5, 17% PEG 10000, using a drop containing 4.5 μl of protein and 4.5 μl of precipitant against a reservoir of 100 μl of precipitant. Se-Met protein was screened against sparse matrix screens from Hampton at 20 and 4 °C. Good quality crystals formed at 4 °C in 0.22 m ammonium fluoride and 22% PEG 3350, with drops containing 3 μl of protein and 3 μl of precipitant against a well of 100 μl of mother liquor. Crystals were cryocooled to 100 K using a cryoprotectant of mother liquor containing 20% glycerol. Data to 1.2 Å was collected on native crystals at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14–2; 240 0.5° oscillation images were collected, using an exposure time of 3 s and a crystal to detector distance of 91 mm. A Se-Met crystal was used to collect MAD data to 1.6 Å on a MAR-CCD detector, at three wavelengths, on the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14–4. Data were indexed and integrated in MOSFLM (30Leslie A.G.W. Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26: 1-10Google Scholar) and scaled in SCALA (31Evans P.R. Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar). Merging of the data and analysis of the systematic absences identified the space group as P212121, with cell dimensions a = 67.2 Å, b = 90.0 Å, c = 97.9 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. Crystallization and Data Collection of Native and Se-Met Decarboxylase Protein—Good quality crystals were obtained with a precipitant solution of 3.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Bistris, pH 5.2, using a drop containing 4 μl of protein and 4 μl of precipitant equilibrated against a reservoir of 100 μl of precipitant. Se-Met protein crystallized in similar conditions. The crystals were cryocooled to 100 K using a cryoprotectant of 4 m sodium formate. Data to 2.3 Å were collected on native crystals on beamline ID14–2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility using an exposure time of 2 s and crystal to detector distance of 217 mm. Se-Met crystals were used to collect data to 3.35 Å on a MAR-CCD detector, at three wavelengths around the selenium absorption edge, on beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Data were treated similarly to the formyltransferase domain data. Merging of the data and analysis of systematic absences determined the space group as P4132, with cell dimensions a = b = c = 149.4 Å, α = β = γ = 90°.

Automatic electron density interpretation by ARP/WARP (36Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

Electron density showed the presence of UMP and N-5-fTHF in the formyltransferase structure. These compounds were fitted to the density, and libraries were made using PRODRG (40Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis and Assay of the Decarboxylase Domain—Site-specific mutations S433A, E434A, and E434Q were introduced into the decarboxylase domain. These mutants were made according to the QuikChange® protocol, using the ArnA-DH plasmid, Pfu DNA polymerase, and the following oligonucleotides: S433A, 3′-CGTCAACTGCAGAAGTTTATGGG-5′ and 3′-CCCATAAACTTCTGCAGTTGACG-5′; E434A, 3′-CGTCAACTTCAGCAGTTTATGGG-5′ and 3′-CCCATAAACTGCTGAAGTTGACG-5′; E434Q, 3′-CCCGTCAACTTCACAGGTTTATGGG-5′ and 3′-CCCATAAACCTGTGAAGTTGACGGG-5′. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the proteins were overexpressed and purified in the same way as wild type protein. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra analysis were identical for wild type and mutant proteins. Wild type and mutant ArnA decarboxylase enzyme activities were assayed by monitoring the rate of NADH production at A340. The assays contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg ml–1 bovine serum albumin, 8 mm NAD+, 4.5 mm UDP-GlcUA, and either 0.5 μm wild type or 2.5 μm mutant protein. Protein concentration was judged by BCA assays, and all reactions were carried out at 30 °C. Km values were determined by varying the amount of the initial UDP-GlcUA or NAD+ from ⅕ × Km to 5 × Km. The results for these assays are shown in Table II.

Open table in a new tab Association of Domains with Each Other and with ArnB— The full-length ArnA protein contains two discrete catalytic domains that are both required for the l-Ara4N modification of lipid A. As shown in Fig. 1 the C-terminal decarboxylase domain of ArnA catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-GlcUA to yield UDP-Ara4O, which is then converted to UDP-l-Ara4N by a separate enzyme, ArnB. To synthesize UDP-l-Ara4FN, the N-terminal formyltransferase domain of ArnA then catalyzes the transfer of a formyl group from N-10-fTHF to the 4′ -amine of UDP-l-Ara4N. Although fusion proteins are common in biology, it is unusual for a bifunctional enzyme to require an intervening enzymatic step. We therefore investigated whether the purified discrete domains of ArnA form a complex by themselves or together with ArnB. To this end, the ArnA domains were combined and passed over an S200 gel filtration column in the presence and absence of cofactors. Only the individual domains were observed, heterodimer formation was not seen. We conservatively estimate that the lower level of detection was about 0.06 mg/ml (1 μm), correlating to a lower limit of the Kd as 5 mm. A similar analysis was performed by incubating purified ArnB with the N-terminal formyltransferase domain and the C-terminal decarboxylase domain of ArnA or the full-length ArnA protein. Again, formation of a complex between ArnB and ArnA (discrete domains or full-length protein) was not observed, suggesting that under these conditions the Kd for a complex would be in the millimolar range if not considerably higher. Furthermore, we were not able to detect formation of a complex by co-precipitation experiments with His-tagged ArnB and ArnA, using the penta-His antibody in combination with Protein G-agarose. Overall Structure of the Formyltransferase Domain—The crystal structure of the formyltransferase domain of ArnA has been solved to 1.2 Å in complex with N-5-fTHF and UMP. Crystals were grown in the presence of UDP, but only UMP was observed in the active site. The formyltransferase domain of ArnA crystallizes as a dimer, and the overall structure, shown in Fig. 2a, is similar to that of FMT. The ArnA formyltransferase domain structure consists of two subdomains; an N-terminal subdomain (residues Met1–Lys181) and a C-terminal subdomain (residues Phe207–Asn305), which are linked by a loop (residues His182–Ser206). The N-terminal subdomain is folded into a seven-stranded β-sheet with five parallel sheets (β1–5) and two antiparallel sheets (β"
https://openalex.org/W2061747034,"Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) hydrolyzes 3′-phosphotyrosyl bonds to generate 3′-phosphate DNA and tyrosine in vitro. Tdp1 is involved in the repair of DNA lesions created by topoisomerase I, although the in vivo substrate is not known. Here we study the kinetic and binding properties of human Tdp1 (hTdp1) to identify appropriate 3′-phosphotyrosyl DNA substrates. Genetic studies argue that Tdp1 is involved in double and single strand break repair pathways; however, x-ray crystal structures suggest that Tdp1 can only bind single strand DNA. Separate kinetic and binding experiments show that hTdp1 has a preference for single-stranded and blunt-ended duplex substrates over nicked and tailed duplex substrate conformations. Based on these results, we present a new model to explain Tdp1/DNA binding properties. These results suggest that Tdp1 only acts upon double strand breaks in vivo, and the roles of Tdp1 in yeast and mammalian cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2028097766,"Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an abnormal expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is of particular interest in HD because it strongly inhibits polyQ-huntingtin-induced neurotoxicity. This neuroprotective effect involves the phosphorylation of huntingtin at Ser421 by the prosurvival kinase Akt (Humbert, S., Bryson, E. A., Cordelières, F. P., Connors, N. C., Datta, S. R., Finkbeiner, S., Greenberg, M. E., and Saudou, F. (2002) Dev. Cell 2, 831–837). Here, we report that Akt inhibits polyQ-huntingtin-induced toxicity in the absence of phosphorylation of huntingtin at Ser421, suggesting that Akt also acts on other downstream effector(s) to prevent neuronal death in HD. We show that this survival effect involves the ADP-ribosylation factor-interacting protein arfaptin 2, the levels of which are increased in HD patients. Akt phosphorylated arfaptin 2 at Ser260. Lack of phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 at this site substantially modified its subcellular distribution and increased neuronal death and intranuclear inclusions caused by polyQ-huntingtin. In contrast, arfaptin 2 had a neuroprotective effect on striatal neurons when phosphorylated by Akt. This effect is mediated through the proteasome, as phosphorylated arfaptin 2 inhibited the blockade of the proteasome induced by polyQ-huntingtin. This study points out a new mechanism by which Akt promotes neuroprotection in HD, emphasizing the potential therapeutic interest of this pathway in the disease.

J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The dominantly inherited causal gene encodes the huntingtin protein, which contains an abnormal polyglutamine expansion (polyQ) in HD patients. HD develops when this expansion exceeds 35 glutamine residues. There is a strong inverse correlation between the number of glutamines and the age at onset of the disease. HD leads to the selective dysfunction and death of striatal neurons in the brain. The presence of neuritic and intranuclear inclusions in neurons is also characteristic of the disease. There is currently no effective treatment to prevent or to delay disease progression, and death usually occurs 10–20 years after the appearance of the first clinical symptoms. We recently reported that the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/Akt signaling pathway could have a beneficial effect in HD (2Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelières F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In striatal neurons, the most vulnerable neurons in HD, IGF-1 completely blocks polyQ-huntingtin-induced toxicity (2Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelières F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which directly phosphorylates polyQ-huntingtin at Ser421, inhibiting the toxic properties of polyQ-huntingtin. These findings reveal that the IGF-1/Akt signaling pathway is of particular interest in HD, as it directly affects the protein that causes the disease. We observed that Akt is altered in the brains of HD patients and particularly in the striatum, showing that this kinase plays an important role in HD (2Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelières F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Akt is a potent prosurvival kinase that exerts its effects by phosphorylating key substrates such as components of the cell death machinery (3Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Akt could be particularly important in HD, as it abrogates the toxicity of polyQ-huntingtin by phosphorylating Ser421. It also acts on other substrates that promote survival by general mechanisms or by mechanisms relevant to HD. The phosphorylation by Akt of substrates other than huntingtin may be important in the latter stages of the disease. During the pathological process in HD, huntingtin is cleaved by several proteases, including caspases, calpains, and other unidentified proteases (4Wellington C.L. Singaraja R. Ellerby L. Savill J.

This cleavage generates short N-terminal amino acid fragments that contain the pathological polyglutamine expansion and that are more toxic to neurons than full-length huntingtin (4Wellington C.L. Singaraja R. Ellerby L. Savill J. Roy S. Leavitt B. Cattaneo E. Hackam A. Sharp A. Thornberry N. Nicholson D.W. Bredesen D.E. Hayden M.R. J. Biol.

Some of these short N-terminal fragments do not contain the Ser421 phosphorylation site, suggesting that the direct neuroprotective effect of Akt on huntingtin is lost during proteolysis (10Li S.H. Li X.J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 146-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We report here that Akt blocks the polyglutamine-dependent neuronal death and inclusion formation that are induced by an N-terminal fragment of huntingtin that does not contain Ser421. We demonstrate that this Ser421 huntingtin-independent mechanism involves the ADP-ribosylation factor-interacting protein arfaptin 2. Phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 at Ser260 by Akt promoted neuronal survival and decreased intranuclear inclusion formation in a neuronal model of HD. This demonstrates that arfaptin 2 is neuroprotective in HD. Finally, we show that phosphorylated arfaptin 2 inhibits the polyQ-huntingtin-induced blockade of the proteasome.

A mammalian expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/GS) encoding full-length human arfaptin 2 fused to a His6 tag was purchased from Invitrogen (GeneStorm). The arfaptin 2 mutants for Akt phosphorylation sites were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the mammalian or bacterial plasmid of arfaptin 2 as a non-mutated parental template and complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation for S260A arfaptin 2 (5′-CGTCGACTTGAGGCTGCCCAGGCCACTTTC-3′) and for S260D arfaptin 2 (5′-CGTGGTCGACTTGAGGATGCCCAGGCCACTTTC-3′). Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of striatal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 Sprague-Dawley rats and transfected at 4 days in vitro by a modified calcium phosphate technique (12Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). The mouse neuroblastoma NG108-15, human embryonic kidney 293, and the monkey fibroblast-like kidney COS-7 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Invitrogen) (or serum-starved when indicated) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and transfected by the calcium phosphate technique. Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed as described (2Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelières F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev.

Recombinant SGK (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used. GST-fused proteins were produced in BL21 competent strains and purified with glutathione-Sepharose-coupled beads. Kinases and substrates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, and 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—After in vitro phosphorylation by Akt in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of wild-type or S260A arfaptin 2 was performed as described previously (15Girault J-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-fused wild-type and S620A arfaptin 2 were incubated with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions to remove the GST tag. After in vitro phosphorylation by Akt, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of wild-type or S260A arfaptin 2 was performed (15Girault J-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

Arfaptin 2 was then digested with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (75 μg/ml; Worthington) in 25 mm ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 8) at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Samples were dried, and peptides were collected in 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (10% glacial acetic acid and 1% pyridine (pH 3.5)). Samples were spotted 4 cm from the bottom and 5 cm from the right side of a thin-layer chromatography sheet (Analtech Inc.) together with basic fuschin dye. First-dimension electrophoresis was carried out at pH 3.5 for 3 h at 350 V, and second-dimension chromatography was performed on dried sheets in chromatography buffer (37.5% pyridine, 25% butanol, and 7.5% acetic acid) for 4 h. Phosphopeptides were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Storm 820, Amersham Biosciences). Antibody against Arfaptin 2 Phosphorylated at Ser260—Phosphopeptide CRDAGTRGRLEpSAQA was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Neosystem), and injected into rabbits. Polyclonal antibody to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide was obtained and affinity-purified by two chromatography steps (Neosystem). Briefly, the serum was filtered (0.22-μm filter), and following an addition of 1 m Tris (pH 8.0) up to a final concentration of 100 mm, it was applied to a SulfoLink column (Pierce) coupled to the non-phosphorylated peptide. The flow-through was collected, concentrated, and applied to the phosphopeptide column. Elution was performed with 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.7). Cell and Tissue Extracts—Cells were lysed 2 days post-transfection with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium inorganic pyrophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble and insoluble Nonidet P-40 fractions were separated after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Human tissues were from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (Belmont, MA). Brain samples were homogenized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 50 μg of homogenates were subjected to Western blot analysis. Samples 1–5 correspond to brain numbers 4741, 4744, 4751, 4797, and 4740, respectively, as numbered by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center. Quantification of Western blots was performed and is expressed relative to actin levels. Human biopsies were procured following the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. Proteins were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE; transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; and immunoblotted with anti-arfaptin 2 (1:1000) (13Peters P.J. Ning K. Palacios F. Boshans R.L. Kazantsev A.

Pictures of fixed cells were captured with a three-dimensional deconvolution imaging system. Analysis of Arfaptin 2 Effect on Proteasome Activity in Cells—GFPu-1 cells (16Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) were transfected with constructs of interest. DsRed2-C1 DNA (Clontech) was included in the transfection mixture at a 1:5 ratio. After 72 h, cells were trypsinized and analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACS-Calibur flow cytometer. A minimum of 104 Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein-transfected cells were analyzed for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence under each condition using CellQuest software. The levels of fluorescence were standardized to the exon 1-17 condition. The results from three independent experiments are presented as median values of green fluorescence histogram plots. Measurement of Neuronal Survival and Intranuclear Inclusions— Four days post-plating, primary cultures of striatal neurons were transfected with wild-type huntingtin or polyQ-huntingtin and GFP to identify the transfected cells. To be certain that each neuron synthesizing GFP also expressed the huntingtin construct, transfections were performed by the modified calcium phosphate technique with a high ratio of DNA to GFP DNA (10:1) (2Humbert S.

Under these circumstances, >95% of the GFP-positive neurons also expressed the huntingtin construct (data not shown). GFP-positive neurons were scored by fluorescence microscopy in a blinded manner 16 and 36 h post-transfection. Cell death occurring within the GFP-positive cells was determined as the difference in the number of surviving neurons between the two time points and is expressed as a percentage of cell survival. For intranuclear inclusion scoring, striatal neurons were transfected with vectors of interest and a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (10:1 ratio). Neurons were fixed 5 days post-transfection, immunostained, and analyzed for the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions (anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:300), 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.; and anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:100), Dako Corp.). Each graph represents at least two to three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Each bar in a given graph corresponds to the scoring of ∼2000 neurons in neuronal survival experiments and to 500 neurons for inclusion scoring. Data were submitted to complete statistical analyses (see figure legends). Akt Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect Independently of Ser421 Phosphorylation in Huntingtin—We tested whether Akt could promote neuroprotection independently of Ser421 phosphorylation. We used an in vitro neuronal model of HD to determine whether Akt could block the neuronal toxicity induced by an N-terminal fragment of huntingtin not containing Ser421. In primary cultures of striatal neurons, fragments of huntingtin containing the abnormal polyglutamine expansion induce neuronal death and the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (12Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). We transfected striatal neurons with constructs encoding the first 171 amino acids of huntingtin containing 17 glutamine residues (wild-type, construct 171-17) or 68 glutamine residues (mutant, construct 171-68) and with a construct encoding Akt-ca and analyzed neuronal survival (Fig. 1A). As expected, construct 171-68 induced a statistically significant decrease in neuronal survival compared with construct 171-17. However, Akt completely inhibited neuronal death induced by huntingtin fragment 171-68 (Fig. 1A). We then analyzed the effect of Akt on the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). We found that Akt significantly decreased the percentage of neurons containing NIIs (Fig. 1B). In vitro phosphorylation assays showed that neither fragment 171-17 nor fragment 171-68 was phosphorylated by Akt-ca (data not shown). This suggests that the protective effects of Akt are probably not due to phosphorylation between amino acids 1 and 171 of huntingtin. We have previously demonstrated that part of the neuroprotective effect of IGF-1 is mediated through the phosphorylation of huntingtin at Ser421 (2Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelières F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We show here that Akt protected striatal neurons from polyQ-huntingtin-induced toxicity not only by directly phosphorylating huntingtin, but also by phosphorylating other substrates that in turn modulate polyQ-huntingtin-induced toxicity. This indirect effect of Akt led to inhibition of both the death of striatal neurons and the formation of intranuclear inclusions (Fig. 1). Therefore, Akt may act on a substrate that directly controls polyQ-huntingtin-induced toxicity. To identify such an Akt substrate, we screened data bases for proteins containing an Akt consensus phosphorylation site (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). We found, among many others, arfaptin 2, which has been shown to regulate polyQ-huntingtin aggregation (13Peters P.J. Ning K. Palacios F. Boshans R.L. Kazantsev A. Thompson L.M. Woodman B. Bates G.P. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Arfaptin 2 Is Up-regulated in HD—The striatum is the most affected region in HD. To determine whether arfaptin 2 is modified in the pathological situation, we analyzed the levels of arfaptin 2 in human striatal samples from control (CT), grade 3 HD (HD3), and grade 4 HD (HD4) patients (Fig. 2A). Brain extracts were analyzed using anti-arfaptin 2/POR1 antibody (upper panel) and anti-β-actin antibody as a control for protein levels (lower panel). Arfaptin 2 levels were higher in brain extracts from HD patients than in those from control individuals (Fig. 2B). This agrees with previous work on HD transgenic mouse brains showing up-regulation of arfaptin 2 (13Peters P.J. Ning K. Palacios F. Boshans R.L. Kazantsev A. Thompson L.M. Woodman B. Bates G.P. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and further suggests its involvement in HD. Arfaptin 2 Is a Substrate of Akt—Arfaptin 2 has a putative Akt phosphorylation site at Ser260 (Fig. 3A). To test whether Akt phosphorylates arfaptin 2 in vitro, we incubated GST-fused arfaptin 2 with Akt-ca or inactivated Akt in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Akt-ca phosphorylated arfaptin 2, whereas inactivated Akt did not (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate that Ser260 is phosphorylated by Akt-ca, we generated a GST-fused C-terminal fragment of arfaptin 2 (amino acids 249–341) with either Ser260 or a Ser-to-Ala mutation at this position (S260A). The C-terminal fragment of arfaptin 2 was no longer phosphorylated by Akt-ca when Ser260 was replaced with Ala (Fig. 3B), even though the amount of the GST-fused protein was similar. We carried out two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of full-length wild-type and S260A arfaptin 2 to confirm Ser260 as a site of phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 (Fig. 3C). The major phosphopeptide observed in wild-type arfaptin 2 (see arrows) was not seen when Ser260 was mutated to Ala, suggesting Ser260 as the main site of phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 by Akt. To unequivocally identify Ser260 as an Akt phosphorylation site, we raised a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes arfaptin 2 phosphorylated at Ser260. As shown in Fig. 3D, the antibody against arfaptin 2 phosphorylated at Ser260 recognized arfaptin 2 only when coexpressed with Akt-ca, but failed to recognize the same protein with the S260A mutation. These results show that Akt phosphorylates arfaptin 2 at Ser260 in cells and that arfaptin 2 is a substrate of Akt. We investigated whether SGK phosphorylates arfaptin 2 because this kinase has a protective effect by phosphorylating huntingtin at Ser421 after IGF-1 activation (14Rangone H. Poizat G. Troncoso J. Ross C.A. MacDonald M.E. Saudou F. Humbert S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike huntingtin, arfaptin 2 was not phosphorylated by SGK, indicating that Akt specifically phosphorylates arfaptin 2 at Ser260 (Fig. 3E). Phosphorylation of Arfaptin 2 Modifies Its Cellular Distribution—Arfaptin 2 is located mainly in the perinuclear region of Chinese hamster ovary cells, in particular around the microtubule (MT)-organizing center and in cytoplasmic vesicular structures (13Peters P.J. Ning K. Palacios F. Boshans R.L. Kazantsev A. Thompson L.M. Woodman B. Bates G.P. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylation alters the distribution of arfaptin 2, we transfected NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells with His-tagged wild-type or S260A arfaptin 2. We used immunofluorescence to compare the distribution of arfaptin 2 and the Golgi marker protein GM130 (Fig. 4A). The transfected wild-type and endogenous arfaptin 2 proteins appeared in the cytoplasm as diffuse punctate staining and partially co-localized with GM130 in the perinuclear region. However, the distribution of S260A arfaptin 2 was very different. The protein was redistributed to bundle structures in the cytoplasm and was no longer detected in Golgi bodies or vesicles. To ensure that this effect was due to loss of phosphorylation at Ser260, we assessed the effect of constitutive phosphorylation of Ser260 by replacing it with Asp (S260D). S260D arfaptin 2 had the same subcellular localization as arfaptin 2 in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 4A) and in striatal neurons (data not shown). S260A arfaptin 2 also re-localized into bundle structures in neuritic extensions of striatal neurons (Fig. 4B). Quantification of bundle formation in neuroblastoma cells and neurons demonstrated that it was specifically associated with loss of phosphorylation at Ser260, as wild-type and S260D arfaptin 2 never formed bundles. In contrast, bundles were observed in 35–45% of NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells and neurons expressing S260A arfaptin 2 (Fig. 4C). Arfaptin 2 Subcellular Localization Depends on the MT Network—Proteins that associate with MTs often induce bundles when overexpressed in cells (18Ligon L.A. Shelly S.S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1405-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Bundle formation induced by loss of phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 at Ser260 together with the localization of arfaptin 2 around the MT-organizing center led us to investigate the effect of phosphorylation on the distribution of arfaptin 2 in relation to the MT network (Fig. 5A). Unfortunately, the paraformaldehyde fixation step, which is essential for the detection of the anti-histidine antibody that localizes transfected arfaptin 2, slightly disrupted the MT network. Nevertheless, wild-type arfaptin 2 was located mainly around the MT-organizing center in a punctate staining pattern as described previously (13Peters P.J. Ning K. Palacios F. Boshans R.L. Kazantsev A. Thompson L.M. Woodman B. Bates G.P. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas in cells expressing S260A arfaptin 2, the MT network was disrupted (Fig. 5A). To ensure that the localization of arfaptin 2 and its regulation by phosphorylation depend on MTs, we treated cells with nocodazole, an MT-depolymerizing agent. We found that both wild-type and S260A arfaptin 2 distributions were disrupted, with the proteins being concentrated in dense clusters throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). These results show that arfaptin 2 localization depends on the integrity of the MT network and that loss of phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 leads to an alteration of the MT organization. We next studied the effect of phosphorylation on arfaptin 2 distribution in cells. We analyzed arfaptin 2 in whole cell extracts and in soluble and insoluble Nonidet P-40 fractions from COS-7 cells transfected with various arfaptin 2 constructs (Fig. 5C). Wild-type and S260D arfaptin 2 were concentrated in the soluble Nonidet P-40 protein fraction, whereas S260A arfaptin 2 was strongly enriched in the insoluble Nonidet P-40 protein fraction. Thus, we have demonstrated by immunostaining and biochemical experiments that loss of phosphorylation of arfaptin 2 at Ser260 dramatically alters the cellular distribution of arfaptin 2. This results in its accumulation into insoluble bundle structures and to the partial disruption of the MT network.

It has two nucleotide binding domains (NBD(s)) 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide binding domain; MOPS, 3-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ABD-F, 7-fluorobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide; TCEP, tris-(2-carboxyetyl)phosphine hydrochloride; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide binding domain; MOPS, 3-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ABD-F, 7-fluorobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide; TCEP, tris-(2-carboxyetyl)phosphine hydrochloride; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). in a single polypeptide, NBD1 and NBD2, each containing a set of Walker A and B motifs and having a RecA-like fold in which the nucleotide binding cleft exists between the P-loop subdomain and helical subdomain. In addition, ClpB has a unique inserted 120-amino-acid sequence between two NBDs, and this insertion has been inferred to contribute to the disaggregation activity of ClpB (15Mogk A. Schlieker C.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ClpB from T. thermophilus revealed an unusual structure of the inserted region, an 85-Å-long, straight coiled-coil extending on the outside of the hexamer (17Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil is tethered to the main body of ClpB at its middle point, resembling in structure the shape of a two-wing propeller, one wing (wing-1) leaning to NBD1 and another wing (wing-2) away from any other domains (see Fig. 1). This “leaning position” of the coiled-coil seems to be stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions between the wing-1 and the α-helical subdomain of NBD1. The coiled-coil structure by itself is stabilized by the leucine zipper-like interaction between two helices. The importance of the position and movement of the coiled-coil on the chaperone activity was demonstrated previously (17Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To know further the movement of the coiled-coil in the chaperone function, we examined reactivity and fluorescence change of a fluorescent label and cross-linking of NBD1 and the wing-1 of T. thermophilus ClpB. The contribution of nucleotide occupancy and hydrolysis of the two NBDs to the movement of the coiled-coil was assessed from the results of defective mutants of NBDs. The results suggest that the coiled-coil is in the more parallel position than in the crystal structure relative to the main body of ClpB when NBD1 is empty, but it takes the leaning position when NBD1 is filled with ATP. This arrangement of the coiled-coil would stabilize the hexamer and promote ATP hydrolysis in NBD2. Proteins—The recombinant plasmid pMCB1 (2Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) containing a ClpB gene of T. thermophilus was used for a mutagenesis template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension PCR method (18Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar, 19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) using Ex-taq DNA polymerase (Takara). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. ClpB and its mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described (2Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) except that a 30-min heat treatment at 80 °C was added after cell disruption. Fluorescence Measurement—7-fluorobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide (ABD-F) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Tris-(2-carboxyetyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) was purchased from Sigma. ClpB mutants (2–6 mg/ml) were incubated with 1 mm ABD-F in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm TCEP at 55 °C for 1–2 h. In the case of triple mutant (G167C/R475C/A419C), TCEP was omitted. Unreacted probes and TCEP were removed by the HPLC G3000SWXL gel-filtration column. The amount of Cys-ABD was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients, ϵ384 nm = 7800m–1 cm–1 (20Toyo'oka T. Imai K. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ABD-labeled ClpB mutants (0.1 mg/ml) in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or the absence of nucleotide were preincubated for 3 min in a sealed cuvette at 55 °C, and fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi F4500 fluorometer (excitation 390 nm, emission spectra 400–650 nm). In the case of the reducing condition, the fluorescence spectrum was measured in the presence of 20 mm TCEP, and the preincubation time was 10 min. The emission spectra were normalized by the amount of Cys-ABD. In the experiment of time-course monitoring of the ABD labeling, ClpB mutants (0.15 mg/ml) were preincubated with 5 mm TCEP in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, in the presence or the absence of nucleotide at 55 °C for 2 min, and the reaction was started by adding ABD-F (final concentration of 0.5 mm). The fluorescence spectra (400–650 nm) were measured at appropriate time intervals. The percentages of the labeled Cys residues against total Cys residues at each nucleotide condition and mutants were independently calculated from the fluorescence intensity at 500 nm and absorption of Cys-ABD. Gel-filtration Analysis—Purified wild-type or mutant ClpB (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 with or without 2 mm ATP, 20 mm TCEP was preincubated for 1 min at 55 °C. Then the mixture was centrifuged for 1 min (no obvious precipitation). An aliquot (100 μl) of the solution was loaded on a HPLC gel-filtration column, TSK G-3000SWXL (Tosoh). The column was pre-equilibrated and eluted at 55 °C at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min with the same buffer used for preincubation. The elution of proteins was monitored by absorbance at 290 nm. The molecular size standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), TDnaKJ complex from T. thermophilus (330 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (212 kDa), and aldorase (158 kDa). Elution profiles of the heat stable standard proteins (TDnaKJ complex, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) at 55 °C were the same as those at 20 °C, ensuring the column properties were not changed at high temperature. ATPase Activity—ATPase activities of ClpB were measured spectrophotometrically with an ATP-regenerating system at 50 °C (21Stiggall D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 3 mm ATP and 0.1 mg/ml casein when indicated. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ClpB, and the changes in the absorbance at 340 nm were monitored. ATP-induced Fluorescence Change of ABD-labeled ClpB— We introduced a fluorescence probe ABD to the Cys residue of an ClpB (A419C) mutant of T. thermophilus that is located at the edge of the wing-2 (Fig. 1A) with labeling yield 92%. Labeling specificity was ensured by the fact that authentic T. thermophilus ClpB does not contain a cysteine residue. At 55 °C, where T. thermophilus ClpB is fully active, fluorescence intensity of ABD-labeled A419C (hereafter, the term ClpB is omitted from the mutant names) was drastically decreased to 35% by the addition of 3 mm ATP (Fig. 1B). A small red shift of the fluorescence peak was also observed. Almost the same changes were observed by the addition of ADP or ATPγS (Fig. 1E). It has been known that the fluorescence of Cys-ABD is very sensitive to the environment, and a decrease in intensity and red shift occur in the hydrophilic environment (22Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24742-24750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the observation implies that nucleotide binding to ClpB induces the movement of the wing-2 to the direction by which the wing-2 loses hydrophobic interactions with other domains and becomes more isolated. Next, we tested which NBD would be responsible for this nucleotide binding-induced change. Mutants were generated by substitution of Lys-Thr sequence in the Walker A sequence with Ala-Ala for each NBD. These mutants, termed as 1KT/AA for NBD1 and 2KT/AA for NBD2, lost the ability of nucleotide binding to NBD1 and NBD2, respectively (14Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The A419C mutation was further introduced into these mutants. Labeling yields of these mutants, 1KT/AA-A419C and 2KT/AA-A419C, by ABD-F were 79 and 77%, respectively. The fluorescence intensities of ABD-labeled 1KT/AA-A419C and 2KT/AA-A419C, normalized by labeling yields, were 127 and 118%, respectively, of that of ABD-labeled A419C, and the emission spectra of these two mutants were almost the same as ABD-labeled A419C. The fluorescence intensity of ABD-labeled 1KT/AA-A419C was decreased by the addition of ATP (Fig. 1C), but the extent of decrease (to 73%) was much less significant as compared with the case of ABD-labeled A419C. In contrast, a large decrease of fluorescence down to 35% by ATP addition was observed for of ABD-labeled 2KT/AA-A419C (Fig. 1D). A similar large decrease in fluorescence was observed when ATPγS and ADP were added to ABD-labeled 2KT/AA-A419C (Fig. 1E). Because the 2KT/AA (and 2KT/AA-A419C) mutant retains nucleotide binding ability to NBD1 but not to NBD2, these results indicated that the shift of the wing-2 to a relatively more hydrophilic environment is induced by nucleotide binding mainly to NBD1. ATP-induced Change of Accessibility of the Wing-1/NBD1 Interface—The G167C/R475C mutant of ClpB was designed to make a disulfide cross-link between the wing-1 (R475C) and NBD1 (G167C) (Fig. 2A) (17Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the mutant was loaded on SDS-PAGE in the non-reducing condition, the band was shifted to the upper position (Fig. 2B). The mutant lost its chaperone activity almost completely under the non-reducing condition. In the presence of a reducing reagent, TCEP, the mutant retained 70% of the chaperone activity of that of the wild-type, and Cys residues were labeled by ABD-F with an efficiency dependent on the nucleotide. Because free ABD-F has no fluorescence by itself, we could monitor the progress of the labeling reaction as the increase of fluorescence (Fig. 2C). From the fluorescence intensity at 500 nm and absorption spectrum of Cys-ABD, yields of the labeled Cys residues against total Cys at each time point were obtained and plotted (Fig. 2D). In the absence of nucleotide, 42% of total Cys of the G167C/R475C mutant was labeled with ABD after a 39-min incubation at 55 °C. The progress of the labeling was slower when ATP was present; 17% of total Cys were labeled after a 39-min incubation. To test which NBD is responsible for the ATP-induced change of the accessibility of ABD-F to the interface between the wing-1 and NBD1, we combined mutations 1KT/AA and 2KT/AA with G167C/R475C. The yield of labeled Cys in 1KT/AA-G167C/R475C was not much affected by ATP; 49 and 41% in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively (Fig. 2E). For 2KT/AA-G167C/R475C, labeling yield in the absence of ATP, 30%, was significantly decreased to 18% by the addition of ATP (Fig. 2E). Almost the same results were obtained in the cases of ADP or ATPγS (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the binding of nucleotide to NBD1 has major responsibility to limit the accessibility of ABD-F to G167C/R475C. Therefore, we speculate that the interface between the wing-1 and NBD1 becomes more closed when nucleotide binds to NBD1. To clarify the correlation between the fluorescence change of ABD-labeled A419C and the accessibility of the wing-1/NBD1 interface, a triple mutant (A419C/G167C/R475C) was made. Approximately 95% of this mutant showed the same mobility as that of G167C/R475C mutant on the non-reducing SDS-PAGE (not shown), indicating that the disulfide bridge between G167C and R475C was formed in the majority of this mutant. In the absence of reducing regent, the Cys residue at the position A419C of this triple mutant was specifically labeled with ABD-F with the efficiency of 94%. In the non-reducing condition and the absence of nucleotide, fluorescence intensity of this labeled mutant was almost the same as that of ABD-labeled A419C with 3 mm ATP (Fig. 3A). After incubation with a reducing reagent, TCEP, the fluorescence intensity was increased to 170% (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity was decreased to 70% by ATP addition, and it was not changed by the further incubation with TCEP in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3B). Almost the same results were obtained in the cases of ADP or ATPγS (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that the nucleotide-dependent fluorescence changes of ABD-labeled A419C coupled with the enclosure movement of the wing-1/NBD1 interface. In this experiment, the fluorescence intensity of the triple mutant (G167C/R475C/A419-ABD) in the reduced and no nucleotide conditions was significantly low relative to that of the nucleotide-free form of ABD-labeled A419C. There might be some interaction between G167C and R475C even in the reducing condition. Stabilization of Hexamer Structure of ClpB by Fixing the Wing-1 to NBD1—The oligomer states of ClpB mutants were analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography. As reported previously, the wild-type ClpB can form a stable hexamer in the presence of 2 mm ATP at 55 °C. For the stable hexamer formation, ATP binding to NBD1, but not ATP hydrolysis, is required. Therefore, the 1KT/AA mutant did not form a stable hexamer even in the presence of ATP and was eluted at positions corresponding to a molecular weight lower than the hexamer with a long tailing (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, 1KT/AA-G167C/R475C was eluted at the position of the hexamer under a non-reducing condition (Fig. 4A). However, in the presence of a reducing reagent in the elution buffer, the hexamer of 1KT/AA-G167C/R475C was destabilized and eluted in a similar chromatographic pattern to that of 1KT/AA (Fig. 4B). 2KT/AA-G167C/R475C was eluted as a hexamer either in non-reducing or reducing conditions (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that oxidized G167C/R475C with the wing-1 being fixed to NBD1 mimics the structure in which NBD1 is filled by ATP and stabilizes the hexamer form. Indeed, even in the absence of ATP, the majority of G167C/R475C was eluted at the position of the hexamer with a significant peak, whereas wild-type was eluted as a broad peak (Fig. 4C). Activation of ATPase Activity of NBD2 by Fixing the Wing-1 to NBD1—Because 1KT/AA is unable to bind nucleotide at NBD1, ATPase activity of this mutant is solely attributed to that of the intact NBD2. Similarly, ATPase activity of 2KT/AA is solely attributed to the intact NBD1. The sum of the ATPase activities of the two mutants is far smaller than the activity of the wild type. Thus, each of NBD1 and NBD2 has a basic ATPase activity, represented by the activities of 2KT/AA and 1KT/AA, respectively, and cooperative stimulation is assumed between two NBDs. Then we examined the effect of cross-linking between G167C and R475C on the ATPase activity of ClpB (Fig. 5). Under the reducing condition, ATPase activity and its casein-stimulation of G167C/R475C were almost the same as those of the wild-type ClpB (columns 1 and 2). The cross-linking of G167C/R475C resulted in enhancement of the ATPase activity 2-fold, whereas the casein-stimulation was marginal (columns 3). Under the reducing condition, the ATPase activities of 1KT/AA-G167C/R475C and 2KT/AA-G167C/R475C were almost the same as those of 1KT/AA and 2KT/AA, respectively (columns 4 and 5, 7 and 8). When oxidized, the ATPase activity of 2KT/AA-G167C/R475C was not changed (columns 8 and 9) but that of 1KT/AA-G167C/R475C was remarkably activated, nearly 30 times as compared with that in the reducing condition (columns 5 and 6). Marginal casein stimulation of column 6 was the same as observed for column 3. Thus, when the wing-1 is fixed to NBD1, ATPase activity of NBD2 is greatly activated. Based on the crystal structure of ClpB, the results of fluorescence change reported here are explained by the motion of the coiled-coil induced by the ATP binding to NBD1 (Fig. 6). The fluorescence of the dye attached at the edge of the wing-2 changed by the addition of ATP in such a way that indicated the shift of the wing-2 into a more hydrophilic environment, that is, a more isolated position from other domains (Fig. 1B). The wing-1 appears to move to the opposite direction with the addition of ATP; it moves and leans to NBD1, and the interface between the wing-1 and NBD1 becomes less accessible for a water-soluble labeling reagent (Fig. 2D). In addition, the edge of wing-2 shifted to the hydrophilic environment when the disulfide bridge between wing-1 and NBD1 was formed (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the changes of fluorescence and dye accessibility reflect the same structural change. The changes of fluorescence and dye accessibility were obtained for ClpB with the intact NBDs. The mutant ClpB in which only NBD1 is intact also showed the similar response on addition of ATP (Figs. 1D and 2E), whereas the mutant that has defective NBD1 (and intact NBD2) did not exhibit such typical response (Figs. 1C and 2E). Therefore, it appears that ATP-binding to NBD1 induces the partial rotary motion of the coiled-coil around the center of the coiled-coil from a position relatively parallel to the main body of ClpB to a position leaning to NBD1 as seen in the crystal structure. Because the disulfide bridge between G167C and R475C is formed even in the absence of a nucleotide, the parallel conformation might not be rigid and might allow some thermal random movement in which an occasional leaning conformation is trapped slowly but irreversibly by a covalent linkage. Referring the close examination of the crystal structure with two NBDs filled by AMPPNP, we can assume the sequence of events as follows. (i) ATP comes into the nucleotide binding cleft of NBD1, (ii) several residues in the helical subdomain of NBD1 are recruited to buttress the bound ATP, (iii) this accompanies closure of the cleft, and (iv) the cleft-closure movement brings the coiled-coil from a relatively parallel position into the leaning position. To be cautious, two reservations should be made. Although ATP hydrolysis is needed for chaperone function of ClpB (14Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), differences between ADP and ATP or ATPγS are not clear in this study. ATP hydrolysis might be needed for turning over the cycle of the structural changes induced by the binding and release of nucleotide. The leaning conformation is seen in a crystal structure, but the parallel conformation should be demonstrated by a more direct method. Another finding is that ClpB can make a stable hexamer without ATP when the leaning position of the coiled-coil is fixed by cross-linking between the wing-1 and NBD1 (Fig. 4). In the native ClpB, ATP binding to NBD1 is necessary to stabilize the hexamer (14Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The conformation fixed by the cross-linking likely mimics that of ClpB with NBD1 being filled by ATP (Fig. 6). The crystal structure of ClpB most likely represents the conformation that we mentioned here, although the ClpB protomers in the crystal are packed in helical arrangement rather than the ring hexamer (17Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The third message of this report concerns the origin of cooperative stimulation of ATPase activity between two NBDs. Cooperative kinetics of ATP hydrolysis have been reported for several members of the AAA+ superfamily with two NBDs, but the molecular bases are yet unclear (12Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L.

Cell. 2002; 9: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found that the ATPase activity of NBD2 is activated when the coiled-coil is fixed to the leaning position by a cross-link between the wing-1 and NBD1 (Fig. 5). The stimulation is large enough to explain most fractions of the cooperative stimulation between NBD1 and NBD2 of the native ClpB. It is obvious now that ATP binding to NBD1 brings about activation of ATPase activity of NBD2 through the motion of the coiled-coil. Recently, a strong support for the threading model of ClpB was reported and the importance of the central pore of the ClpB hexamer was proposed (26Schlieker C. Weibezahn J. Patzelt H. Tessarz P.

We speculate that the coiled-coil might play in the stage before threading, such as recognition of the aggregate, disassembling large aggregates into small aggregates, and/or organization of other partner chaperones.

PDIP38 was also found to interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which suggested that it might play a role in vivo in the processes of DNA replication and DNA repair in the nucleus. In order to characterize further this novel protein, we have examined its subcellular localization by the use of immunochemical and cellular fractionation techniques. These studies show that PDIP38 is a novel mitochondrial protein and is localized mainly to the mitochondria. PDIP38 was shown to possess a functional mitochondrial targeting sequence that is located within the first 35 N-terminal amino acid residues. The mature PDIP38 protein is about 50 amino acid residues smaller than the full-length precursor PDIP38 protein, consistent with it being processed by cleavage of the mitochondrial targeting sequence during entry into the mitochondria. His-tagged mature PDIP38 inhibited pol δ activity in vitro and interacted with human papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein, suggesting that PDIP38 might play a role in the pol δ-mediated viral DNA replication. Although the localization of PDIP38 to the mitochondria suggests that it serves functions within the mitochondria, we cannot eliminate the possibility that it may be involved in pol δ-mediated DNA replication or DNA repair under certain conditions such as viral infection.

Chromosomal DNA replication is a tightly regulated process, which requires multiple protein complexes working in a highly coordinated manner. In eukaryotic cells, three major DNA polymerases, DNA polymerases α, δ, and ϵ, are involved in DNA replication (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

A mutant without the catalytic domain of the large subunit of pol ϵ in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was found to be viable (4Feng W. D'Urso G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4495-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and pol δ and pol α were sufficient to replicate both the leading and lagging strands of double-stranded DNA in an SV40 DNA replication system (5Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These earlier studies pointed to the fact that pol δ was likely to be the major polymerase for the elongation of both leading and lagging strands of chromosomal DNA in eukaryotic cells. This was supported by recent studies that showed that there was inefficient elongation of both leading and lagging DNA strands in Xenopus egg extracts depleted of pol δ (6Fukui T. Yamauchi K. Muroya T. Akiyama M. Maki H. Sugino A. Waga S. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). pol ϵ was suggested to play a role mainly in leading strand DNA synthesis (6Fukui T. Yamauchi K. Muroya T. Akiyama M. Maki H.

The ability of pol δ to participate in multiple aspects of DNA replication/repair raises the question of how it is regulated.

To understand better the physiological function of PDIP38, we examined its cellular localization in detail. In this study, we demonstrate by both optical and biochemical methods that PDIP38 is a mitochondrial protein. We further identified a bona fide mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) located at the N-terminal region of PDIP38. The first N-terminal 35 amino acids of PDIP38 are necessary and sufficient for its targeting to the mitochondria. By using a series of N-terminal deleted PDIP38 fusion proteins, we also demonstrated that the cleavage site is most likely located 50 amino acid residues from the N terminus of the PDIP38 precursor protein. We found that PDIP38 could inhibit the PCNA-dependent pol δ activity and could interact with HPV 16 E7 oncoprotein. These results indicated that PDIP38 might play a role in the pol δ-mediated viral DNA replication. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except as otherwise indicated.

Construction of PDIP38 Fusion Constructs and His-p21—Standard low cycle PCR techniques were used to generate the C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged PDIP38 full-length and deletion mutants using pEGFPN3 expression vector (Clontech). The PCR products were digested with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the pEGFPN3 (Clontech) expression vector between the HindIII and BamHI sites to generate fusion proteins with EGFP attached to the C termini of the inserted sequences. To generate PDIP38 tagged at its C terminus with the FLAG peptide sequence (PDIP38-C-FLAG), we annealed two oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCGGCGGGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGTAAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCCCGCCG-3′), and we inserted these between the BamHI and NotI sites of PDIP38-C-EGFP. The EGFP tag was replaced by FLAG peptide (DYKDDDK) to generate the PDIP38-C-FLAG. The series of C-terminal FLAG-tagged PDIP38 deletion mutants was obtained by inserting HindIII and BamHI fragments of the respective PDIP38-C-EGFP deletion mutants into the HindIII and BamHI sites of PDIP38-C-FLAG. Low cycle PCR was used to generate the N-terminal EGFP-tagged PDIP38-(EGFP-N-PDIP38) full-length fusion protein by using pEGFPC1 expression vector (Clontech).

The primer pairs for pQE70-PDIP38-(51–368), PDIP38-(51–368)-C-His were 5′-ATGCAGCATGCTCTCGTCCCGAAACCGACC-3′ and 5′-ACGTAGGATCCCCAGTGAAGGCCTGAGGGTGGTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with SphI and BamHI and subcloned in-frame into the PQE70 (Qiagen, CA) expression vector between the SphI and BamHI sites to create PDIP-38-(51–368)-C-His. In vitro translation constructs were generated by using pCDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). Low cycle PCR was used to generate the untagged wild type PDIP38 in pCDNA3.1(+) using pQE32 PDIP38 full-length as the template. The oligonucleotide pairs were 5′-ATGCGAGGATCCGCCACCATGGCAGCCTGTACAGCCCGG-3′ and 5′-GTTCTGAGGTCATTACTGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pCDNA3.1(+) to create pCDNA3.1(+) PDIP38. To generate the vector expressing FLAG-tagged at its N terminus (pCDNA3.1(+) N-FLAG-PDIP38), we first inserted a DNA sequence encoding FLAG peptide (M-DYKDDDDKGG) between the HindIII and BamHI sites by annealing 5′-AGCTTGCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGGCGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGCCCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCATGGTGGCA-3′ to create pCDNA3.1(+)FLAG. The pQE32 PDIP38 full-length was digested with BamHI and PvuII, and the DNA fragment containing full-length PDIP38 was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pCDNA3.1(+)FLAG to create pCDNA3.1(+)N-FLAG-PDIP38. To generate the pCDNA3.1(+)PDIP38-C-FLAG tag construct, the HindIII/NotI fragment containing PDIP38 from the PDIP38-C-FLAG construct was inserted into the HindIII/NotI sites of pCDNA3.1(+). Low cycle PCR was used to generate the N-terminal His6-tagged P21 full-length fusion protein. The primer pairs for pQE32-P21-(2–164), His-p21 were 5′-AGCTGGATCCCCTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGATG-3′ and 5′-TACGTAAGCTTTTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned in-frame into the pQE32 (Qiagen) expression vector between BamHI and HindIII sites. All constructs were sequenced (Davis Sequencing). Protein Purifications—GST fusion or His-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3 (pLys) and purified by using either glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) or Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). His-p21 and PDIP38-(51–368)-C-His were further purified using Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—293T, MCF7, and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of PDIP38-EGFP constructs and PDIP38-FLAG constructs were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using the supplied protocols. Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were grown in 4-well slides and fixed with 100% methanol and further treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Endogenous PDIP38 was immunostained with an anti-PDIP38 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 20 amino acid residues of PDIP38 (H2N-PPFSLESNKDEKTPPSGLHW-COOH) at 1:100 dilution in 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. Endogenous human mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mhsp70) was immunostained with anti-mhsp70 (Affinity Bioreagents) mouse monoclonal antibody at 1:200 dilution, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate (green)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. For ectopically expressed EGFP fusion proteins, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated pEGFP-N3 or pEGFP-C1 constructs, and 24 h after transfection, Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) was added at 10 μm and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (M-7512, Molecular Probes) at 20 nm for an additional hour, and the cells were fixed using 100% methanol. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon microscope, and images were captured with a digital camera (Optronics) using Optronics MagFire, Image-ProPlus software. Subcellular Fractionation—Mitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells using a mitochondria isolation kit from Sigma. The cells were also fractionated with the NE-PER kit (Pierce). The proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody anti-p50 (17D2 and 13D5) (26Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-p68 (26Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-p12 (26Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-PDIP38-(22); and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-mhsp70 (Affinity Biore-agents, Golden, CO). The following antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: mouse monoclonal antibody anti-PCNA (PC10); mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GFP (B-2); goat polyclonal antibody anti-lamin B (C-20); goat polyclonal antibody anti-IκBα (C-21); and rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-Tom20 (FL-145). In Vitro Translation—pCDNA3.1(+)N-FLAG-PDIP38, pCDNA3.1-(+)PDIP38-C-FLAG, and pCDNA3.1(+)PDIP38 were used to generate their respective 35S-labeled proteins using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation kit (Promega, NJ). GST Pull Down Assay—GST pull down assays using purified proteins or total HeLa cell lysate were performed as described previously (22Liu L. Belmonte E.M. Mazloum N. Xie B. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10041-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA Polymerase Assay—Sparsely primed poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay was performed as described previously (17Lee M.Y. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The standard reactions for the poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay contained 0.25 OD units/ml poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (20:1), 200 μg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 100 cpm/pmol [3H]TTP, and 2 ng of HeLa pol δ in the absence of PCNA or the presence of 100 ng (138 nm monomer) of PCNA in a total volume of 25 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and were terminated by spotting onto DE81 papers, which were then washed four times with 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 7.8, once with 95% ethanol, and counted. For the inhibition assay using His-p21 or PDIP38-(51–368)-C-His, the indicated amount of His-p21 or PDIP38-(51–368)-C-His was preincubated with either 100 ng of PCNA or TGEED buffer and 2 ng of HeLa pol δ on ice for 30 min before the assay mixtures were added. Human PDIP38 Localizes Mainly to the Cytoplasm—We have identified previously a novel protein, PDIP38, that interacts with p50, the small subunit of human pol δ (22Liu L. Belmonte E.M. Mazloum N. Xie B. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10041-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The interaction of PDIP38 with pol δ was confirmed by a number of experimental approaches, including pull down and overlay experiments. This interaction suggested that PDIP38 might be a nuclear protein that participated in some aspect of DNA replication or repair. To understand better the likely physiological role(s) of PDIP38, we investigated its intracellular localization in cultured cells. The anti-PDIP38 antibody that was used (22Liu L. Belmonte E.M. Mazloum N. Xie B. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10041-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) specifically recognized one major band migrating with apparent molecular size slightly larger than 32.5 kDa when total cell lysates of HeLa, 293T, MCF7, or 3T3 cells were immunoblotted (Fig. 1A). When immunofluorescence microscopy was performed by staining the HeLa cells with anti-PDIP38 antibody, the results were unexpected in that a cytoplasmic localization of PDIP38 (Fig. 1B, a) was observed, with a near-complete exclusion from the nuclear region stained with Hoechst (Fig. 1B, b and c). Similar staining patterns were observed when 293T or MCF7 cells were used (data not shown). More importantly, the punctated cytosolic staining pattern that was observed is similar to that typically obtained when mitochondria are immunostained (32Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Presence of a Functional Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence at the N Terminus of PDIP38 —Nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins contain an MTS at their N termini. Analysis of human PDIP38 by MITOPROTII (ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html, see Ref. 33Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) predicted an almost 100% (99.98%) probability of an MTS at the N terminus. A mitochondrial localization of human PDIP38 was also predicted by the Program TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/, see Refs. 34Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar and 35Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of human PDIP38 is rich in positively charged amino acids and is predicted to form an α-helix, characteristics that are typical of MTS sequences. The co-localization of PDIP38 with a mitochondrial marker, as well as the examination of the N terminus for the presence of a MTS, was therefore investigated by examining the localization of PDIP38-EGFP fusion proteins. We constructed plasmids expressing full-length PDIP38 fusion proteins with EGFP fused to its C terminus (PDIP38-C-EGFP) or to its N terminus (EGFP-N-PDIP38). HeLa cells were transfected with these plasmids as well as the parent pEGFPN3 plasmid, and the live fluorescence images were captured by microscopy. In HeLa cells overexpressing PDIP38-C-EGFP (Fig. 2A, a), the PDIP38 fusion protein exhibited a punctated intracellular localization, whereas EGFP alone (Fig. 2A, b) as well as EGFP-N-PDIP38 (Fig. 2A, c) exhibited a diffused localization. HeLa cells were then transfected with PDIP38-C-EGFP or pEGFPN3 plasmids; the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 and the mitochondria with MitoTracker Red CMXRos. PDIP38 with EGFP fused to its C terminus was clearly co-localized with MitoTracker (Fig. 2C, a–d), whereas EGFP alone was not (Fig. 2D, a–d). The observation is consistent with the presence of an MTS at the N terminus, because an EGFP tag attached to the N terminus of PDIP38 would mask the MTS, which has to be localized at the N terminus in order to function. Examination of the sizes of the PDIP38 EGFP fusion proteins by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 2B) showed that PDIP38 tagged at its C terminus is smaller than the N-terminally tagged PDIP38 on SDS-PAGE, a finding that is consistent with the expected cleavage of an N-terminal MTS after entry into the mitochondria (Fig. 2B). The First N-terminal 35 Amino Acids Are Sufficient to Mediate the Mitochondrial Localization of PDIP38 —In order to dissect the contribution of the N-terminal region of PDIP38 to mitochondrial localization, we constructed a series of N-terminal or C-terminal deletions of PDIP38 with C-terminal EGFP tags. The localization patterns of some of these EGFP fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table I. Deletion of the first N-terminal 30 amino acids abolished the mitochondrial localization of the EGFP fusion protein (Fig. 3A), showing that the first 30 amino acids are necessary for mitochondrial localization of PDIP38. All C-terminal deletions of PDIP38 with a C-terminal EGFP tag exhibited a mitochondrial localization (Fig. 3, B and C, and Table I). The presence of a functional MTS in the N terminus of PDIP38 was confirmed by fusion of the first 35 amino acids of human PDIP38 to the N terminus of EGFP. This fusion resulted in the localization of EGFP to the mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Thus, the first N-terminal 35 amino acids of PDIP38 are unequivocally shown to function as an MTS.Table ILocalization of PDIP38-EGFP fusion proteins HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated constructs, and 24 h after transfection, Hoechst (Sigma) was added at 10 μm and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (M-7512, Molecular Probes, OR) at 20 nm for an additional hour.

In our original studies, PDIP38 behaved as a protein of 38 kDa when Western-blotted in cell extracts, whereas the predicted molecular mass based on the sequence encoded by its cDNA was 42 kDa (22Liu L. Belmonte E.M. Mazloum N. Xie B. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10041-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These conflicting observations can now be explained as the likely consequence of mitochondrial processing. Analysis of the protein sequence by MITOPROTII (ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html, see Ref. 33Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) predicted a cleavage site between residues 58 and 59, whereas Program TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) (34Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar, 35Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) predicted a cleavage site between residues 50 and 51. Both predictions may be correct as many mitochondrial proteins are processed in a two-step process by MPP, followed by a second cleavage of eight residues by the MIP. In order to obtain more information on the location of the cleavage site, we examined the sizes of full-length EGFP-tagged PDIP38 and a series of either N-terminal or C-terminal deletion mutants of PDIP38 with a C-terminally tagged EGFP when expressed in HeLa cells. As already shown (Fig. 2A), full-length PDIP38 tagged at its N terminus is blocked from entry into th"

We hypothesized that decorin binding to collagen inhibits phagocytosis of collagen fibrils. To determine the effects of decorin on collagen degradation, we analyzed phagocytosis of collagen and collagen/decorin-coated fluorescent beads by Rat-2 and gingival fibroblasts. Collagen beads bound to gingival cells by α2β1 integrins. Binding and internalization of decorin/collagen-coated beads decreased dose-dependently with increasing decorin concentration (p < 0.001). Inhibition of binding was sustained over 5 h (p < 0.001) and was attributed to interactions between decorin and collagen and not to decorin-collagen receptor interactions. Both the non-glycosylated decorin core protein and the thermally denatured decorin significantly inhibited collagen bead binding (∼50 and 89%, respectively; p < 0.05). Mimetic peptides corresponding to leucine-rich repeats 1–3, encompassed by a collagen-binding ∼11-kDa cyanogen bromide fragment of decorin and leucine-rich repeats 4 and 5, previously shown to bind to collagen, were tested for their ability to inhibit collagen bead binding. Although the synthetic peptide 3 alone exhibited saturable binding to collagen, neither peptides 3 nor 1 and 2 markedly inhibited phagocytosis. Leucine-rich repeat 3 bound to a triple helical peptide containing the α2 integrin-binding site of collagen. When collagen beads were co-incubated with peptides 3 and 4, inhibition of collagen phagocytosis (55%) was equivalent to intact native/recombinant core protein. Thus a novel collagen binding domain in decorin acts cooperatively with leucine-rich repeat 4 to mask the α2β1 integrin-binding site on collagen, an important sequence for the phagocytosis of collagen fibrils.

The intracellular phagocytic pathway in fibroblasts contributes to the physiological remodeling of collagen by lysosomal degradation of internalized collagen fibrils (1Ten Cate A.R. Deporter D.A.

Previous morphological studies have shown that collagen fibrils are “decorated” by proteoglycans (5Hakkinen L. Oksala O. Salo T. Rahemtulla F. Larjava H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1689-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); consequently, decorin may affect the binding step of collagen phagocytosis (6Segal G. Lee W. Arora P.D. McKee M. Downey G.

Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The mature form of DCN (∼100 kDa) consists of an ∼45-kDa core protein, a single dermatan or chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain, cysteine loops near the N and C terminus, and either two or three asparagine-bound oligosaccharides. The central part of the core protein consists of 10 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences in tandem array (8Hausser H. Schonherr E. Muller M. Liszio C. Bin Z. Fisher L.W. Kresse H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rotary shadowing-electron microscopy and molecular modeling studies suggest that the DCN core protein is horseshoe-shaped (9Scott J.E.

DCN binding to collagen molecules is thought to influence collagen fibrillogenesis and the final diameter of fibrils. The DCN core protein may mediate these interactions (16Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), but the impact of DCN-collagen binding interactions on collagen phagocytosis is not known. Triple helical collagen type I possesses a specific DCN core protein-binding site at the d-band in each D-period (15Hedbom E. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and a second DCN core protein-binding site located in a narrow region ∼25 nm from the C terminus of type I collagen in a zone that coincides with the c1 band of the collagen fibril D-period (18Keene D.R.

However, the structural elements of DCN that mediate binding to collagen type I are not completely defined. Although analyses of the DCN core protein show that neither the N-terminal half nor the central LRR repeats can, by themselves, bind tightly to fibrillar collagen (19Pogany G. Vogel K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), more recent work indicates that LRRs 4–6 may contain putative high affinity binding site(s) for collagen type I (20Schonherr E.

Despite these reports describing putative structural determinants that determine the interactions between DCN and collagen type I, there is no consensus model for binding. Furthermore, previous studies describe interactions between DCN and collagen in the context of regulation of fibrillogenesis. Currently, there are no reports describing a role for DCN as a modulator of collagen degradation by phagocytosis. Here we examined the effect of DCN on the collagen binding and internalization steps of phagocytosis by using quantitative flow cytometry (23Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Based on the data obtained with DCN digestions and DCN mimetic peptides, we have identified putative collagen-binding sites in DCN that may be involved in the regulation of collagen phagocytosis.

Mouse antibovine DCN monoclonal antibody (DS-1) was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). FITC-streptavidin was from Cedarlane (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Antibody to β1 integrin (4B4) was from Beckman Instruments (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Type I collagen-derived triple helical peptides from type I collagen residues α1(I)-(496–507) were obtained from Gregg Fields (Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL). Ligand binding to the α2 integrin subunit has a KD = 1.1 × 10–6m. A second collagen-derived triple helical peptide from type I collagen residues α1(I)-(772–786) was also obtained from Gregg Fields as a second DCN-binding region within collagen. Cell Culture—Rat-2 cells (CRL 1764, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (0.017% penicillin G; 0.01% gentamycin sulfate). Rat-2 cells exhibit several phenotypic traits in common with gingival fibroblasts, including rapid collagen phagocytosis (3Melcher A.H. Chan J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1981; 77: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and were used to model collagen binding and internalization processes. In some experiments, human gingival fibroblasts (HGF; passages 5–12) cultured in minimal essential medium with antibiotics and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum were used in bead binding experiments with cells grown to confluence. All bead incubations were conducted for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free conditions. Collagen and DCN Bead Coatings—Carboxylate-modified, yellow-green polystyrene beads (2 μm diameter; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were coated with collagen, and fibril formation was induced as described previously (24Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Tang L-H. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Webber C. Reiner A. Poole A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6304-6313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, monomeric collagen was bound to beads by using nonpolymerizing conditions during the bead preparations. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.1% (w/v) BSA. For preparation of DCN/collagen beads, collagen beads were prepared, but instead of resuspending the bead pellet in PBS, the pellet was resuspended in varying concentrations of DCN (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 μm), sonicated, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the DCN solution, and counted. For calculation of molar concentrations, the total molecular weight of either recombinant DCN (38 kDa) or of bovine articular cartilage DCN (100 kDa from manufacturer's specifications and our own estimates) or the various peptides (molecular weights provided by the supplier) were used to obtain the appropriate concentrations. For bead binding assays, cells were incubated at a ratio of 4 or 6 beads:cell (6Segal G. Lee W. Arora P.D. McKee M. Downey G. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free conditions. For triple helical collagen peptide beads, carboxylate-modified, nonfluorescent beads were coupled by Arg residues using carbodiimide with coupling efficiencies of ∼2–3%. Immunostaining of DCN/collagen-coated beads and immunoblotting of bead-associated proteins were done to estimate binding of DCN to the collagen beads and quantified by flow cytometry and densitometry. Briefly, DCN/collagen-coated, nonfluorescent polystyrene beads were stained with mouse anti-bovine decorin antibody (1:10) at 37 °C for 1 h, washed, counterstained with FITC-goat anti-mouse antibody (1:10 dilution; 1 h at 37 °C), and analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify DCN on the collagen bead. Bead-associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting and quantified by comparison with standards. Collagen Bead Binding—We optimized concentrations of DCN that affected collagen bead binding by dorsally loading cells with either collagen or DCN/collagen-coated beads for 1 h at 37 °C. Bead binding to cells was quantified by flow cytometry (6Segal G. Lee W. Arora P.D. McKee M. Downey G. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee W. Sodek J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14100-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In some experiments, two-color flow cytometry was used to analyze simultaneously the binding of collagen- and DCN/collagen-coated beads to cells. Red and blue fluorescence beads (2.0 μm; Molecular Probes; red beads, Exmax = 580 nm and Emmax = 605 nm; blue beads, Exmax = 365 nm and Emmax = 415 nm) were coated with collagen (COL-RED and COLBLUE) or collagen and DCN (DCN/COL-RED and DCN/COL-BLUE) as described above. Cell Attachment and Spreading—Fibrillar collagen substrates were created on 35-mm non-tissue culture dishes (0.3 mg collagen/ml; pH 7.4) and blocked with 0.1% BSA. In some experiments, collagen surfaces were further coated with DCN (1 μm; 500 μl) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in serum-free medium, allowed to attach and spread for 1 or 3 h, washed, fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.03% Triton X, and stained with rhodamine phalloidin to visualize actin filaments. Cell attachment and spreading of individual cells was imaged at the substrate-cell interface by confocal microscopy. To determine whether DCN affects cell attachment to collagen, 8-well tissue culture surfaces were prepared with DCN coating as described above. Cells (4 × 104 cells/well) were allowed to attach for 1 or 3 h in serum-free medium. At each time point, the medium was removed, and the cells were gently jet-washed in PBS to remove any loosely bound cells. Adherent cells were trypsinized, suspended in isotonic solution, and counted. Cell-surface DCN—HGFs were incubated with DCN (10 μm solution) for 15 min at 4 °C, washed, incubated at 4 °C for 1, 10, and 60 min in medium, and washed, trypsinized, and neutralized with growth medium. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in normal goat and mouse sera (1:1000 each), incubated on ice for 10 min, washed, sedimented, resuspended in 1:50 solution of mouse anti-DCN antibody in PBS, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed, counterstained with FITC-goat anti-mouse antibody, incubated on ice for 1 h, washed, sedimented, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess cell surface staining of DCN. DCN Cleavage—For preparation of DCN core protein (cpDCN), DCN was digested with chondroitinase ABC (0.2 units/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) at 37 °C for 1 h. Digestion was confirmed by Coomassie Blue-stained 10% SDS-PAGE. The effect of cpDCN on inhibition of binding was examined using collagen beads coated with the cpDCN (as described above) at equimolar concentrations as used for intact DCN. Cells were incubated with these beads for 1 h at 37 °C, and bead binding was assessed by flow cytometry. For CNBr cleavage, DCN was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid; CNBr was added, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at room temperature. Distilled water was added to each tube and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was rehydrated. Control samples confirmed that the cleavage occurred as a result of CNBr digestion and not as a consequence of acid hydrolysis. Collagen beads were prepared and coated with 30 μl of the CNBr digestion mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. The beads were washed with PBS, and bound DCN fragments were eluted with SDS sample buffer or acetic acid. The eluates were separated on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gels and silver-stained, and the relevant bands were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Preparation of Gel Samples for Mass Spectrometry—In-gel tryptic digests were used to prepare eluate bands for mass spectrometry. Briefly, each silver-stained gel band was minced, destained, reduced, and alkylated prior to trypsin digestion. The gel pieces were vacuumdried and then digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C. After quenching with trifluoroacetic acid, the supernatant was retained, and the gel was twice extracted with acetonitrile. The combined supernatant and extracts were vacuumdried prior to MALDI-mass spectrometry protein identification and sequencing. Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometry (Mass Spectrometry Facility, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto) to identify putative collagen-binding sequences within the DCN core protein, saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix solution. Protein enzymatic digestion mixtures (1 μl) were spotted on the sample target, and saturated matrix solution (1 μl) was added. After crystal formation, the sample target was analyzed by MALDI-mass spectrometry in linear mode on an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometer (337 nm laser). Acceleration voltage was 20 kV; grid voltage was 94%; guide wire was 0.05%; delay time was 175 ns, and low mass gate was 800 Da. The mass spectra were externally calibrated from molecular weights of a mixture of standard peptides. Masses of fragments from experimental samples that did not appear in the mass spectrometry analysis of controls were analyzed by MALDI-mass spectrometry to provide predicted sequences that were then probability matched for DCN using standard proteomics data bases and search engines. Mimetic Peptides—Peptides were synthesized based on the LRR sequences 1–5 of DCN. Control peptides contained the same amino acids but with scrambled sequences (Advanced Protein Technology Centre Peptide Synthesis Facility, University of Toronto). The sequences for the LRR 1 and scrambled peptides were LGLEKVPKDLPPDTALLDLQNNKI and GEVKLLDPTLKPNIQKLDDNLAPL, respectively. The sequences for the LRR 2 and scrambled peptides were TEIKDGDFKNLHTLILINNK and GFELNIKLLNIDIITKHNDTK. The sequences for the LRR 3 and scrambled peptides were SKISPGAFAPLVKLERLYLSKNQL and LKIAPALSGFPVRSELKYSNKLLQ. A portion of each of these LRR 1–3 peptides was biotinylated at the N terminus for use in matrix protein binding and competitive inhibition studies. The sequences for the LRR 4 and scrambled peptides were LQELRVHENEI and VNQIERLHELE, respectively. The sequences for the LRR 5 and scrambled peptides were VELGTNPLK and LTPGNKLVE. The amino acid sequences of the peptides were based on the sequencing results obtained from mass spectrometry indicating binding to LRR 1–3 and other studies, which suggest that putative collagen-binding motifs are located within the LRR 4 and LRR 5 of the DCN molecule (20Schonherr E. Hausser H. Beavan L. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8877-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Nonfluorescent (2.0 μm diameter) collagen beads were blocked with 0.1% BSA, washed in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in a 0.1 or 1 mm solution of each of the biotinylated LRR peptides and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The beads were stained with FITC-streptavidin (1:500) and washed, and peptide binding was analyzed by flow cytometry. Competitive Inhibition of Peptide Binding and Collagen Bead Binding—Collagen beads prepared as described above were incubated with increasing concentrations of biotinylated LRR 3 peptide (1–1000 μm) and stained with FITC-streptavidin as described above. Bead fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. In competitive inhibition assays, collagen beads were prepared and blocked with BSA, coated with biotinylated DCN peptides for 1 h at 37 °C, pelleted, resuspended in a solution of 100× excess of unlabeled peptides for 1 h at 37 °C, stained with FITC-streptavidin, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Positive control beads were prepared in the same manner as the experimental beads but were not subjected to incubation with unlabeled peptides. For examination of the effects of peptides on collagen bead binding, collagen beads were incubated with either single peptides (0.1 or 1.0 mm solution; 30 min) or all possible peptide pair combinations of LRR 1–5 and then added to cells for flow cytometry analysis of bead binding as described above. Circular Dichroism—For assessment of the efficacy of thermal denaturation, CD spectra for bovine articular cartilage decorin were collected on an AVIV circular dichroism spectrometer (model 62A DS) at a concentration of 0.20 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). For each sample, five scans were collected from 200 to 260 nm in 1-nm increments in a 1-mm cuvette and averaged. The temperature of the sample was recorded at 25 and 70 °C. The loss of ellipticity at 205 nm was recorded at each temperature as a measure of thermal stability as described earlier (27Kleovitch O. Edelstein C. Zhu L. Scanu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23856-23865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—For all comparisons utilizing continuous variables, Student's t tests were performed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Experiments with multiple groups were analyzed by ANOVA. Post hoc comparisons were done by Tukey's test. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Effect of DCN on the Binding Step of Collagen Phagocytosis— Quantification of collagen binding to beads (2 μm diameter) by using biotinylated bovine type I collagen, detection with streptavidin, blotting and comparison with standards showed that when beads were incubated in a collagen solution (3 μm; 500 μl), there was 0.026 pg of collagen/bead. Binding to collagen or bare beads was proportional to DCN concentration in the incubation solution (200 μl; Table I). The moles of DCN bound/bead and the number of moles of collagen bound/bead were similar for DCN incubation solutions (Table I). We also used immunostaining and flow cytometry to assess DCN binding to collagen beads. These experiments showed progressive increases of fluorescence with increasing DCN concentrations (∼20–30-fold compared with uncoated bead controls; p < 0.01; Fig. 1A). Immunostaining of DCN on collagen-coated beads was specific as beads without DCN coating showed very low levels of fluorescence.Table IDecorin binding to beadsDCN solutionDCN bound to bare beadsDCN bound to collagen beadsμmpg / bead; n = 3pg / bead; n = 10.010.003 ± 0.0010.0030.10.006 ± 0.0020.0061.00.025 ± 0.010.023 Open table in a new tab We assessed differences between collagen and DCN/collagen bead binding in HGF and Rat-2 cells to determine whether DCN affected collagen bead binding and to assess the degree of equivalence between the two cell types. Collagen beads coated with DCN (1 μm) significantly inhibited collagen bead binding in both HGFs and Rat-2 cells compared with cells incubated with collagen beads (Table II; comparison of inhibition between HGF-Rat 2 cells, p > 0.2). There was also no significant difference in the inhibitory effect between recombinant human DCN and bovine DCN in HGFs (Table II; p > 0.2), thereby validating the use of both Rat-2 cells and bovine DCN as surrogates for HGFs and recombinant human DCN, respectively.Table IIDecorin inhibition of collagen bindingCell typeDCN preparation% reduction of binding to collagen (n = 3)Rat-2 cellsBovine cartilage (1 μm)88 ± 3HGFBovine cartilage (1 μm)82 ± 3HGFHuman recombinant (1 μm)80 ± 4HGFHuman recombinant (0.1 μm)60 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Dose-response experiments using Rat-2 cells showed an inverse relationship between increasing DCN concentration and the percentage of cells that bound collagen beads (Fig. 1B, p < 0.001). Even very low concentrations of DCN in the incubation solution (0.001 μm) inhibited collagen bead binding (by 35%; Fig. 1B). DCN also inhibited the ability of cells to bind one or more beads per cell (Fig. 1, C–H). The inhibitory effect was not likely due to the ability of DCN to bind to cells directly as DCN-coated beads showed very little attachment to cells (Fig. 1, E and F). Generally, the percentage of cells binding DCN/collagen-coated beads was slightly higher than DCN-coated beads alone. Indeed, we found it difficult to obtain images of DCN-coated beads bound to individual cells because the beads bound in such low numbers and were so loosely attached that they were easily dislodged by gentle washing. Time course experiments were performed to assess the effect of DCN on collagen bead binding (1, 3, 5 h; Fig. 1I). There was a time-dependent increase in the percentage of cells binding collagen beads over time (ANOVA, p < 0.001). In contrast, the near 10-fold inhibition of collagen bead binding by DCN was sustained over a 5-h period (p < 0.001, comparison of collagen with DCN/collagen at each time point). In some experiments we compared fibrillar collagen beads with monomeric collagen beads. With biotinylated bovine type I collagen and streptavidin-peroxidase assay, we found similar amounts of collagen binding if the collagen was polymerized by incubation at pH 7.4 prior to incubation with cells or in monomeric form (0.026 pg of collagen/bead). The degree of DCN-induced inhibition of binding was sharply reduced using monomeric collagen (only 20% inhibition at 0.1 μm DCN on collagen beads compared with 90% inhibition with fibrillar collagen). The α2β1 integrin is the major collagen receptor on human gingival fibroblasts and mediates collagen phagocytosis by these cells; the other β1 integrins do not make a major contribution to phagocytosis of fibrillar collagen (24Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Tang L-H. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Webber C. Reiner A. Poole A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6304-6313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the impact of blocking collagen bead binding in HGF with the use of an antibody to the β1 integrin (clone 4B4; 1 μg/ml) followed by incubation with collagen beads, a protocol that abrogates collagen binding to the α2β1 integrin in these cells. Collagen bead binding was reduced by >4-fold with antibody, but binding of DCN-collagen beads was not reduced any additional amount with antibody treatment (Table III).Table IIIIntegrin blocking of collagen bead bindingTreatment% cells with bound beads (n = 4)Collagen beads + vehicle38 ± 2Collagen beads + 4B4 antibody9 ± 3DCN-collagen beads + 4B4 antibody8 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Internalization of Collagen—As DCN significantly inhibited collagen binding, we assessed whether this effect would impact on the subsequent internalization step (28Arora P.D.

https://openalex.org/W1502737496,"Damage after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is observed in both cortical and subcortical regions. In this study, we employed a ""Levine"" rat model of HI (left carotid ligation + 1 h global hypoxia on PND-26) and used histological and electrophysiological paradigms to assess the long-term neuroprotective properties of clomethiazole (CMZ; a GABA(A) receptor modulator). Key enzymes involved in inflammation, namely nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase, were also examined to assess potential CMZ mechanisms not involving GABA-R activation. Assessments were carried out 3 and 90 days post-HI. Extensive CNS lesions were evident after HI ipsilaterally at both short- and long-term intervals. CMZ significantly decreased the lesion size at 3 and 90 days (P<0.01; P<0.05). Evoked field potential analyses were used to assess hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity ex vivo. Electrophysiological measurements contralateral to the occlusion revealed impaired neuronal function after HI relative to short- and long-term controls (P<0.001, 3 and 14 days; P<0.01, 90 days), with CMZ treatment providing near complete protection (P<0.001 at 3 and 14 days; P<0.01 at 90 days). Both NOS and arginase activities were significantly increased at 3 days (P<0.01), with arginase remaining elevated at 90 days post-HI (P<0.05) ipsilaterally. CMZ suppressed the HI-induced increase in iNOS and arginase activities (P<0.001; P<0.05). These data provide evidence of long-term functional neuroprotection by CMZ in a model of HI. We further conclude that under conditions of HI, functional deficits are not restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere and are due, at least in part, to changes in the activity of NOS and arginase."
https://openalex.org/W2055250905,"Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) account for a substantial percentage of familial breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 is thought to function within the nucleus, it has also been located in the cytoplasm. In addition, BRCA1 accumulates in the nucleus of cells treated with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of chromosome region maintenance 1-mediated nuclear export, indicative of its active nuclear export via this pathway. The nuclear export signal in BRCA1 has been described as consisting of amino acid residues 81-99. However, a number of other tumor suppressors have multiple nuclear export sequences, and we sought to determine whether BRCA1 did also. Here, we report that BRCA1 contains a second nuclear export sequence that comprises amino acid residues 22-30. By use of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Rev complementation assay, this sequence was shown to confer export capability to an export-defective Rev fusion protein. The level of export activity was comparable with that of residues 81-99 comprising the previously reported nuclear export sequence in BRCA1. Mutation of leucine 28 to an alanine reduced nuclear export by approximately 75%. In MCF-7 cells stably transfected with a BRCA1 cDNA containing mutations in this novel sequence or the previously reported export sequence, BRCA1 accumulated in the nucleus. These data imply that BRCA1 contains at least two leucine-dependent nuclear export sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2105364078,"Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are widely distributed in human airways. They couple to G- proteins and are activated after proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus of the receptor. Evidence is growing that PAR subtype 2 plays a pivotal role in inflammatory airway diseases, such as allergic asthma or bronchitis. However, nothing is known about the effects of PAR-2 on electrolyte transport in the native airways. PAR-2 is expressed in airway epithelial cells, where they are activated by mast cell tryptase, neutrophil proteinase 3, or trypsin. Recent studies produced conflicting results about the functional consequence of PAR-2 stimulation. Here we report that stimulation of PAR-2 receptors in mouse and human airways leads to a change in electrolyte transport and a shift from absorption to secretion. Although PAR-2 appears to be expressed on both sides of the epithelium, only basolateral stimulation results in inhibition of amiloride sensitive Na+ conductance and stimulation of both luminal Cl- channels and basolateral K+ channels. The present data indicate that these changes occur through activation of phospholipase C and increase in intracellular Ca2+, which activates basolateral SK4 K+ channels and luminal Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels. In addition, the present data suggest a PAR-2 mediated release of prostaglandin E2, which may contribute to the secretory response. In conclusion, these results provide further evidence for a role of PAR-2 in inflammatory airway disease: stimulation of these receptors may cause accumulation of airway surface liquid, which, however, may help to flush noxious stimuli away from the affected airways."
https://openalex.org/W2165198231,"Smad7 is overexpressed in 50% of human pancreatic cancers. COLO-357 pancreatic cancer cells engineered to overexpress Smad7 are resistant to the actions of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) with respect to growth inhibition and cisplatin-induced apoptosis but not with respect to modulation of gene expression. To delineate the mechanisms underlying these divergent consequences of Smad7 overexpression, we studied the effects of Smad7 on TGF-β1-dependent signaling pathways and cell cycle regulating proteins. TGF-β1 induced the phosphorylation of MAPK, p38 MAPK, and AKT2 irrespective of the levels of Smad7, and inhibitors of these pathways did not alter TGF-β1 actions on cell growth. By contrast, Smad7 overexpression interfered with TGF-β1-mediated attenuation of cyclin A and B levels, inhibition of cdc2 dephosphorylation and CDK2 inactivation, up-regulation of p27, and the maintenance of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) in a hypophosphorylated state. Smad7 also suppressed TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of E2F activity but did not alter TGF-β1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2, the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3/4, or DNA binding of the Smad2/3/4 complex. Although Smad7 did not associate with the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI), SB-431542, an inhibitor of the kinase activity of this receptor, blocked TGF-β1-mediated effects on Smad-2 phosphorylation. These findings point toward a novel paradigm whereby Smad7 acts to functionally inactivate RB and de-repress E2F without blocking the activation of TβRI and the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, thereby allowing for TGF-β1 to exert effects in a cancer cell that is resistant to TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition.

TGF-βs regulate cell growth by enhancing the proliferation of cells that are of mesenchymal origin while inhibiting the proliferation of epithelial cell types.

TGF-β1 inhibits the growth of cells of epithelial origin by down-regulating components of the cell cycle and up-regulating cell cycle inhibitors. In most epithelial cell types TGF-β1 acts in late G1 phase and prevents further progression to the G1/S phase transition (10Derynck R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 548-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin complexes phosphorylate specific target molecules, such as the retinoblastoma proteins pRB, p107, and p130 (11Claudio P.P. Tonini T. Giordano A.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 inhibitory actions in late G1 phase are mediated in part by the inhibition of cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression which prevents CDK kinase activity resulting in RB hypophosphorylation (13Ko T.C.

Hypophosphorylated RB binds to and represses E2F by recruiting histone deacetylases and forming a repressor complex at E2F-responsive promoters to block transcription of cyclins necessary for cell cycle progression (18Brehm A.

In addition to inhibiting TGF-β1 signaling, Smad7 may function as a TGF-β1-independent transcriptional modulator. When Smad7 is complexed to the DNA binding domain of GAL4, there is increased transcription of a minimal retinoid acid receptor-β2 GAL4-TGTA luciferase construct (20Pulaski L. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Souchelnytskyi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14344-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Smad7 also associates with the transcriptional coactivator p300 (21Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP65) (22Ferrigno O. Lallemand F. Verrecchia F.

Thus, Smad7 may exert a distinct TGF-β1-independent function by acting as a co-activator/co-repressor, which is dependent upon the cellular context in which it is expressed. Human pancreatic cancer cells are generally resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1. This resistance is the consequence of a number of genetic alterations, including decreased expression of the receptors (TβRI and TβRII) (24Goggins M. Offerhaus G.J. Hilgers W. Griffin C.A. Shekher M.

To elucidate the mechanisms whereby TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition is abolished by Smad7 in the face of its persistent ability to modulate gene expression, in the present study we examined the effects of Smad7 overexpression on the cell cycle machinery and on the nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. We now report that Smad7 attenuates TGF-β1 inhibitory actions on cyclin A and cyclin B levels, cdc2 phosphorylation at Thr161, and RB hypophosphorylation without interfering with TGF-β1-mediated nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. These findings point to a novel mechanism for the functional inactivation of RB and for attenuating the growth inhibitory actions of TGF-β1 without blocking Smad2/3 activation or modulation of gene expression by TGF-β1. Cell Culture—COLO-357 human pancreatic cancer cells (29Kornmann M. Ishiwata T. Beger H.G. Korc M.

Sham and myc epitope-tagged Smad7-transfected cells were grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). For FACS analysis and Western blotting, cells (70% confluent) were incubated in serum-free medium (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite and antibiotics) for 24 h before TGF-β1 (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) addition. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Irvine Scientific) in 5% CO2. Sham and myc epitope-tagged Smad7 transfected cells were grown in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Immunoblotting—Cells were washed and lysed in complete lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, and 10 mm NaPO4) in the presence of a protease inhibitor solution consisting of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (PALP). Lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (25 μg/lane), and incubated with the indicated antibodies. Anti-cyclins A, B1, and E, phospho-Smad2, and myc tag antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnologies (Waltham, MA). Anti-cyclins D1, D2, and D3 were from Lab Vision-Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Anti-Smad2/3 and Grb2 were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). Anti-Smad4, p27, p21, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Erk2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-cdc2, phospho-RB, and phospho-AKT2 were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Phospho-specific antibodies for p38 MAPK and MAPK were from Promega (Madison, WI). The TβRI kinase inhibitor SB-431542 was from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Bound antibody was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence from Pierce. The membranes were then stripped and probed with an anti-ERK2 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology to normalize for protein loading (29Kornmann M. Ishiwata T. Beger H.G. Korc M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CDK2 Kinase Assay—Sham- and Smad7-overexpressing cells un-treated or treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaVO4, 10% glycerol, and PALP protease inhibitors). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and protein A/G-agarose added for 1 h. The complex was washed extensively with kinase lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm B-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction mixture (50 ul) contained kinase assay buffer, 1 μg of purified RB protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was dried and phosphorylated RB detected by radiography. Cell Fractionation—Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated according to the protocol of Wong et al. (30Wong C.

Cells (150-mm culture dishes) were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaVO3, and a protease inhibitors (PALP), washed twice with PBS containing PALP, and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and PALP). Following lysis at 4 °C and removal of the supernatants (cytosolic component), the nuclear pellets were washed in hypotonic lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl to extract all nuclear proteins. The nuclear lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and cell fractions were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunocytofluorescence—Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment with 500 pm TGF-β1 for 1 h. Slides were then fixed for 30 min in 4% formaldehyde, washed extensively with PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% goat serum). Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-Smad2/Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or anti-myc tag (Upstate Biotechnologies) antibodies. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated for 1 h with Cy3 or AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the nuclei were counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 3358 dye for 10 min at room temperature. Immunocytofluorescence was detected using a Nikon Eclipse T200 microscope and the MetaFluor program. Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Transfections with the PAI-1 luciferase (Dan Rifkin, New York University), or the pE2F-TAluciferase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) constructs (1.0 μg), along with the cytomegalovirus-β galactosidase plasmid (0.25 μg) were performed at 25 °C (30 min) using 0.75 μg of Nupherin Neuron (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The resulting complexes were incubated with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then transfected for 12 h and allowed to recover overnight in complete medium before treatments. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing the luciferase values by the beta galactosidase values. FACS Analysis—Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment with 500 pm TGF-β1 for an additional 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with propidium iodide in PBS, and subjected to FACS analysis. Growth Assay—The 3-(4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) growth assay (31Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar), which in pancreatic cancer cells correlates well with results obtained by cell counting with a hemocytometer and by monitoring [3H]thymidine incorporation (32Raitano A.B.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2704-2707PubMed Google Scholar), was used to monitor cell growth. Cells were plated at a density of 8,000 cells/well, using 96-well microtiter plates (Costar), and allowed to adhere overnight prior to TGF-β1 addition for the indicated times. Colorimetric changes were measured using on a Microtiter plate reader with a 570 nm filter. The MEK inhibitor U0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were purchased from Alexis Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). EMSA—Cells were scraped in PBS containing protease inhibitors (PALP) and 1 mm NaVO3, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell for 10 min on ice. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and cells were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatants were removed and nuclei resuspended in high salt buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and PALP) and incubated with gentle shaking for 15 min on ice before centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 min (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). EMSA reactions were performed with 5 μg of nuclear extracts and 50,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled SBE consensus oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Binding reactions were carried out at 23 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed for protein-DNA complex formation on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide, and gels were exposed to Kodak Biomax film. Smad7 Immunoprecipitation—Smad7-overexpressing COLO-357 cells were washed in PBS and lysed in complete lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates (0.5 mg) were incubated with 2 μgofan anti-myc tag, and the resulting complexes were bound with protein AG-agarose beads, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-TβRI antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibody was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence from Pierce. COLO-357 cells express wild type Smad4 and are known to be growth-inhibited by TGF-β1 (27Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Maruyama H. Friess H. Truong P. Buchler M.W. Falb D. Korc M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the present study, TGF-β1 inhibited the growth of Sham-transfected COLO-357 cells in a dose-dependent manner, maximal inhibition occurring at a concentration of 1.0 nm (Fig. 1A). This inhibition was completely abolished in Smad7-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1A) and occurred in conjunction with an increased percentage of cells in G1 and a decreased percentage of cells in G2 (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have shown Smad-independent pathways, including the MAPK, p38 MAPK, and PI3K are activated by TGF-β1 in certain cell types (6Ellenrieder V. Hendler S.F. Boeck W. Seufferlein T. Menke A. Ruhland C. Adler G. Gress T.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4222-4228PubMed Google Scholar, 7Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 8Bakin A.V. Tomlinson A.K. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36803-36810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar,35Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether TGF-β1 activated these alternate pathways in COLO-357 cells, Sham- and Smad7-overexpressing cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 500 pm TGF-β1 for up to one hour and blotted with anti-phospho-specific p42/44, p38 MAPK, and ATK2. Phosphorylation of AKT2, a downstream target of PI3K, was used as a marker for PI3K activity (36Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In both Sham- and Smad7-overexpressing COLO-357 cells, p38 MAPK, MAPK, and AKT2 phosphorylation occurred within 15 min of TGF-β1 addition and then slowly declined after 1 h (Fig. 2A), indicating that all three pathways are activated by TGF-β1 in COLO-357 cells, even in the presence of high levels of Smad7. Moreover, the MEK inhibitor U0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not alter TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition in Sham cells, and did not attenuate the ability of Smad7 to prevent TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition (Fig. 2B). Thus, these pathways do not contribute to the growth suppressive ability of TGF-β1 in COLO-357 cells and do not modulate the actions of Smad7 on cell growth. TGF-β1 acts in late G1 phase and prevents further progression to the G1/S phase transition through inhibiting the expression of S/G2 cyclins (10Derynck R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 548-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and the D-type cyclins in response to TGF-β1 were examined next. In Sham cells, TGF-β1 (500 nm) markedly decreased cyclin A and B levels and slightly decreased cyclin D3 levels, whereas in Smad7-overexpressing cells TGF-β1 did not alter the levels of these cyclins (Fig. 2A). In both cell types, TGF-β1 increased cyclin D1 expression, as reported previously (37Kornmann M. Tangvoranuntakul P. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), without altering cyclin D2, cyclin E, Cdk2, or Cdk4 levels (Fig. 3A). Thus, in the presence of high levels of Smad7, TGF-β1 is incapable of suppressing cyclin A and B levels. TGF-β1 induces cell cycle arrest through the cooperative actions of the cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21 (15Robson C.N. Gnanapragasam V. Byrne R.L. Collins A.T. Neal D.E. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 160: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar); therefore we next sought to determine the effects of Smad7 on p21 and p27 protein levels. In the absence of TGF-β1, p21 protein levels were decreased in Smad7-overexpressing cells by comparison with Sham, whereas p27 levels were similar in the two groups of cells (Fig. 3B). By contrast, TGF-β1 (500 pm) increased p21 levels in both Sham- and Smad7-overexpressing cells and increased p27 levels in Sham-transfected, but not in Smad7-overexpressing, cells. Thus, Smad7 does not block TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition in COLO-357 cells by altering p21 levels, but may act in part by preventing the up-regulation of p27. Although TGF-β1 can induce the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7 in certain cells (38Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), monitoring the expression of myc-tagged Smad7 by Western blotting revealed that Smad7 expression persisted in transfected cells for at least 24 h following TGF-β1 addition (Fig. 3D). Thus, TGF-β1 does not induce Smad7 degradation in COLO-357 cells. The activity of CDK2 is necessary for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In both Sham- and Smad7-overexpressing cells the protein levels of cyclin E and CDK2 remained elevated in the presence of TGF-β1. However, the levels of the CDK2 inhibitor p27 were increased by TGF-β1 in the Sham cells, suggesting that in the presence of high levels of cyclin E and CDK2, the kinase activity of CDK2 is decreased due to association with p27. Therefore the activity of CDK2 was analyzed next in an in vitro kinase assay. CDK2 activity decreased in Sham cells treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h but remained elevated in the Smad7-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, the elevated level of p27 in the Sham cells was sufficient to inhibit CDK2 activity in the presence of cyclin E. The activity of cdc2 is crucial for the entry of cells into mitosis, and phosphorylation of cdc2 on Thr161 is required for this activation for cdc2 to associate with cyclins A and B (39Smits V.A. Medema R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of cdc2 was analyzed next using an antibody that recognizes cdc2 phosphorylated on Thr161. After 24 h, 500 pm TGF-β1 caused a decrease in the levels of phosphorylated cdc2 in Sham but not in Smad7-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, Smad7 prevents the TGF-β1-mediated decrease in cdc2 phosphorylation on Thr161, thereby impeding its inactivation and possibly its dissociation from cyclin A and cyclin B. RB is phosphorylated in G1 by the Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk2/cyclin E complexes (11Claudio P.P. Tonini T. Giordano A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of RB abolishes its inhibitory activity, thereby releasing the transcription factor E2F and allowing for induction of S and G2 phase genes such as cyclins A and B (17Cam H. Dynlacht B.D. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Because cdc2 inactivation was attenuated in Smad7-overexpressing cells, and cyclin A and cyclin B levels remained elevated, the phosphorylation state of RB was analyzed next using anti-RB antibodies recognizing either Ser795 or Ser807/811. After 24 h, 500 pm TGF-β1 caused a marked decrease in the levels of phosphorylated RB in Sham cells. By contrast, phosphorylated RB levels remained elevated in the Smad7-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3C). RB protein levels remained constant over the 24-h time period in both cell types, indicating that the increased phosphorylation observed in the Smad7-overexpressing cells was not due to increased RB protein levels in these cells. E2F-1 transcriptional activity is primarily repressed by binding to hypophosphorylated RB and RB (41Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Since RB remained highl"
https://openalex.org/W2018076341,"A unique feature of the Toxoplasma gondii purine salvage pathway is the expression of two isoforms of the hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosophoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) of the parasite encoded by a single genetic locus. These isoforms differ in the presence or absence of a 49-amino acid insertion (which is specified by a single differentially spliced exon) but exhibit similar substrate specificity, kinetic characteristics, and temporal expression patterns. To examine possible functional differences between the two HXGPRT isoforms, fluorescent protein fusions were expressed in parasites lacking the endogenous hxgprt gene. Immunoblot analysis of fractionated cell extracts and fluorescence microscopy indicated that HXGPRT-I (which lacks the 49-amino acid insertion) is found in the cytosol, whereas HXGPRT-II (which contains the insertion) localizes to the inner membrane complex (IMC) of the parasite. Simultaneous expression of both isoforms resulted in the formation of hetero-oligomers, which distributed between the cytosol and IMC. Chimeric constructs expressing N-terminal peptides from either isoform I (11 amino acids) or isoform II (60 amino acids) fused to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of isoform II is both necessary and sufficient for membrane association. Metabolic labeling experiments with transgenic parasites showed that isoform II or an isoform II-CAT fusion protein (but not isoform I or isoform I-CAT) incorporate [3H]palmitate. Mutation of three adjacent cysteine residues within the isoform II-targeting domain to serines blocked both palmitate incorporation and IMC attachment without affecting enzyme activity, demonstrating that acylation of N-terminal isoform II cysteine residues is responsible for the association of HXGPRT-II with the IMC. A unique feature of the Toxoplasma gondii purine salvage pathway is the expression of two isoforms of the hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosophoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) of the parasite encoded by a single genetic locus. These isoforms differ in the presence or absence of a 49-amino acid insertion (which is specified by a single differentially spliced exon) but exhibit similar substrate specificity, kinetic characteristics, and temporal expression patterns. To examine possible functional differences between the two HXGPRT isoforms, fluorescent protein fusions were expressed in parasites lacking the endogenous hxgprt gene. Immunoblot analysis of fractionated cell extracts and fluorescence microscopy indicated that HXGPRT-I (which lacks the 49-amino acid insertion) is found in the cytosol, whereas HXGPRT-II (which contains the insertion) localizes to the inner membrane complex (IMC) of the parasite. Simultaneous expression of both isoforms resulted in the formation of hetero-oligomers, which distributed between the cytosol and IMC. Chimeric constructs expressing N-terminal peptides from either isoform I (11 amino acids) or isoform II (60 amino acids) fused to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of isoform II is both necessary and sufficient for membrane association.

Mutation of three adjacent cysteine residues within the isoform II-targeting domain to serines blocked both palmitate incorporation and IMC attachment without affecting enzyme activity, demonstrating that acylation of N-terminal isoform II cysteine residues is responsible for the association of HXGPRT-II with the IMC. The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a leading cause of congenital birth defects in children and opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients, such as those afflicted with AIDS (1Wilson C.B.

Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). This protozoan pathogen belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes many other parasites of medical and veterinary importance. Like many intracellular pathogens, apicomplexans are incapable of de novo purine synthesis, making salvage enzymes essential for survival and therefore an attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention (3Ullman B. Carter D. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 29-40PubMed Google Scholar). Different pathogens, however, employ distinct complements of enzymes to scavenge purines from their host environment (4Carter N.S. Rager N. Ullman B. Marr J.J. Nilsen T.W. Komuniecki R.W. Molecular Medical Parasitology. Academic Press, London2003: 197-224Crossref Google Scholar). T. gondii possesses two redundant purine salvage pathways involving the enzymes hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) 1The abbreviations used are: HXGPRT, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; HFF, human foreskin fibroblast(s); CAT, chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IMC, inner membrane complex; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. and adenosine kinase, both of which have been studied in detail (5Donald R.G.

An integrated genetic, biochemical, and genomic approach has shown that these two enzymes are the only physiologically relevant routes of purine acquisition by the parasite, and fitness defects associated with gene knock-outs at either locus demonstrate that both enzymes play important roles in parasite metabolism (9Chaudhary K. Darling J.A. Fohl L.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Donald R.G. Pfefferkorn E.R. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31221-31227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to its chemotherapeutic potential, T. gondii HXGPRT has also been exploited as a versatile selectable marker for molecular genetic analysis (10Bohne W. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Knoll L.J. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 807-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms of T. gondii HXGPRT have been identified as the predicted translation products of differentially spliced mRNAs transcribed from a single gene (5Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of HXGPRT-II is identical to that of HXGPRT-I, except for the addition of a 147-nucleotide exon encoding 49 amino acids that is inserted seven amino acids downstream of the N terminus (Fig. 1). The presence of this extra exon in HXGPRT-II is also associated with failure to excise an intron in the 5′-untranslated region. Each isoform is able to complement Escherichia coli hpt or gpt mutants and a T. gondii hxgprt knock-out mutant, and they are kinetically similar in vitro (although HXGPRT-II is slightly less efficient in phosphoribosylating guanine) (5Donald R.G.

The crystal structure of HXGPRT-I is tetrameric (6Schumacher M.A. Carter D. Ross D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Heroux A. White E.L. Ross L.J. Borhani D.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14485-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the two isozymes form heterotetramers when co-expressed in E. coli (13White E.L.

To understand the functional significance of these two isoforms, we have determined their subcellular location, temporal expression patterns, and oligomerization status in vivo. The two isoforms form hetero-oligomers in vivo and are differentially localized within the parasite because of acylation of the N-terminal domain unique to isoform II, resulting in targeting to the inner membrane complex (IMC) that forms the structural scaffolding of the parasite. Parasites, Host Cells, Chemicals, and Reagents—RH strain T. gondii tachyzoites and RHΔHXGPRT knock-out mutants (5Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol.

Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Tachyzoite to bradyzoite differentiation was induced in vitro as described previously (10Bohne W. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ME49 strain T. gondii were obtained from the National Institutes of Health Research and Reference Reagent Program (catalog no. 2858), and unsporulated oocysts and Veg strain tachyzoites were kindly provided by Dr. Michael S. White (Montana State University, Bozeman). DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly MA), unlabeled substrates of purine salvage enzymes from Sigma, and radiolabeled compounds from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA; nucleotides), PerkinElmer Life Sciences (chloramphenicol, amino acids), and Amersham Biosciences (fatty acids). Procedures for transient and stable transformation of T. gondii have been described in detail (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 16Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T. gondii HXGPRT and E. coli CAT genes were used both as enzyme reporters and as selectable markers to obtain stable transgenic parasites. Selections for HXGPRT+ parasites following transfection with HXGPRT-I or HXGPRT-II expression vectors were carried out in 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid supplemented with 50 μg/ml xanthine, as described previously (5Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Parasites expressing chimeric HXGPRT-CAT enzymes were selected in 20 μm chloramphenicol, and drug-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution in 96-well plates (16Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of several independent drug-resistant parasite clones obtained from transfections with HXGPRT or HXGPRT-CAT expression plasmids indicated 1–3 copies of the transgene in each clone (not shown). No differences in drug resistance were observed among transgenic parasite clones expressing membrane-associated versus cytosolic forms of HXGPRT or CAT reporter enzymes. Molecular Methods—HXGPRT-I or HXGPRT-II expression vectors and plasmids pdhfrCAT and ptubIMC1-YFP have been described previously (5Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.

Cell. 2002; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For fluorescent protein fusions, the open reading frames of HXGPRT-I and HXGPRT-II were PCR-amplified using sense primer HXBglF, 5′-GAagatctATGGCGTCCAAACCCATTG-3′, and antisense primer HXAvrR, 5′-GGCcctaggCTTCTCGAACTTTTTGCGAG-3′ (restriction sites indicated in lowercase). The amplified fragments were digested with BglII and AvrII and ligated into appropriately digested ptub-YFP or ptub-mRFP vectors, 2M. Nishi and D. S. Roos, manuscript in preparation. generating plasmids encoding an HXGPRT-I-yellow fluorescent protein (HXGPRT-I-YFP) fusion and an HXGPRT-II-monomeric red fluorescent protein fusion (HXGPRT-II-mRFP), respectively. To change cysteines 23–25 to serines in the HXGPRT-II expression vector, we used antisense primer 5′-CTTCATTAGGAGTGCTACTACTGAAGATGTCT-3′ (altered residues underlined) in a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis reaction to generate vector pdhfrHXGPRT-II-C(23–25)S. Chimeric HXGPRT-CAT fusion constructs were prepared by swapping DNA fragments from HXGPRT and CAT expression vectors that were modified by the introduction of restriction sites using site-directed mutagenesis to facilitate cloning. Antisense primer 5′-GGGCTCAATACGGCCgtcgacCTTGCCGTAGTC-3′ was used to introduce a SalI site in HXGPRT expression vectors at amino acids 12 and 13 of HXGPRT-I (in pdhfrHXGPRT-I) and 61 and 62 of HXGPRT-II (in pdhfrHXGPRT-II and pdhfrHXGPRT-II-C(23–25)S. Antisense primer 5′-CCAGTGATTTTTTTctcgagTTTAGATCTGAC-3′ was used to introduce an XhoI site at CAT translational start in vector pdhfrCAT. The dhfr promoter of pdhfrCAT (XhoI derivative) was excised by digestion with XhoI and KpnI (blunted) and replaced with dhfr promoter-HXGPRT N-terminal fragments from pdhfrHXGPRT vectors digested with SalI and HindIII (blunted). The resulting vectors expressed chimeric HXGPRT-CAT fusion proteins with the first 11 amino acids of HXGPRT-I (pdH1CAT) or the first 60 amino acids of HXGPRT-II (pdH2CAT and pdH2-C(23–25)S-CAT). HXGPRT-His6 fusions were generated by PCR amplification of the HXGPRT-I and HXGPRT-II open reading frames using sense primer HXBglF (above) and antisense primer HX6HisAflR, 5′-CGcttaagCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTTCTCGAATGCG-3′, digestion with BglII and AflII, and ligation into BglII/AflII-digested ptubACP-YFP-HA, 2M. Nishi and D. S. Roos, manuscript in preparation. replacing the ACP-YFP-HA open reading frames with HXGPRT-I-His6 or HXGPRT-II-His6. Total RNA was harvested from parasites using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 3 μg of denatured RNA was loaded onto a formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted onto Nytran membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with a PCR-amplified HXGPRT cDNA fragment derived from pdhfrHXGPRT-II using HXBglF and HXAvrR. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide before transfer to confirm equal RNA loading. Subcellular Fractionation and Enzyme Assays—5 × 108 parasites that had recently lysed out of a monolayer of human foreskin fibroblast cells were purified by filtration through 3-micron Nucleopore membranes (Corning, Corning, NY), washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 0.5 ml of sonication buffer (400 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Following sonication, crude extracts were fractionated by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to an additional sedimentation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The 30,000 × g pellet was washed and resuspended in 50 μl of sonication buffer by vigorous pipetting, and both the supernatant and the pellet fractions were assayed for HXGPRT or CAT enzymatic activity or loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western blot analysis. The concentration of protein in the pellet fraction was ∼10-fold higher than an equivalent volume of supernatant. HXGPRT activities were assayed in transgenic parasites expressing either HXGPRT-I or HXGPRT-II using [8-3H]xanthine as substrate because host HFF cells cannot phosphoribosylate xanthine (19Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Crude parasite lysates were prepared by sonication and incubated with [8-3H]xanthine (10 Ci/mmol) and 1.0 mm 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, and the reaction products were quantified by ascending paper chromatography. CAT activity in the membrane and pellet fractions of parasites expressing either CAT or chimeric HXGPRT-CAT was assayed as described elsewhere (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), by phosphorimaging analysis of thin-layer chromatograms on which acetylated reaction products were separated from the [1,2-14C]chloramphenicol substrate (>50 mCi/mmol). Immunological Reagents, Immunofluorescence, and Immunoprecipitation—HXGPRT antisera were generated in New Zealand White rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA) using conventional protocols. The initial inoculation was performed with 100 μg of purified recombinant purified HXGPRT-I (5Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) in complete Freund's adjuvant. Subsequent boosts with 50 μg of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were carried out on days 14, 21, 49, 70, and 121. Test bleeds were performed on days 35, 56, and 77, and the rabbits were exsanguinated at day 135. Antibody titer was ascertained by Western blot analysis against whole T. gondii cell lysates. The antisera exhibited good cross-reactivity against recombinant HXGPRT-II, as expected from the high degree of sequence identity between the two isoforms. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against CAT was obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO), and monoclonal mouse Tetra-His antibody was purchased from Qiagen. Antisera against TgMLC1 and TgGAP45 were generously provided by Dr. Con Beckers (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). For fluorescence microscopy, confluent monolayers of HFF cells grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates were infected with 5 × 105 parasites and examined after 18–24 h. Infected monolayers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS), permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and treated with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 5% fetal calf serum in PBS) before staining. CAT protein was detected using a specific polyclonal rabbit antisera (diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma; diluted 1:160). Nuclear DNA was stained with 2.8 μm 4′,6′diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). YFP, mRFP, DAPI, and secondary fluorescent reagents were detected using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a 100-watt mercury vapor lamp with appropriate barrier emission filters (DeltaVision). Images were captured using a Photometrics CoolSNAP Hi Res charge-coupled device camera and DeltaVision softWorx software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). For metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, confluent cultures of HFF cells grown in 175-cm2 T flasks were inoculated with ∼5 × 107 parasites and incubated for 36 h (parasites spontaneously lyse the host cell monolayer at ∼44 h). Monolayers were then rinsed with labeling medium (serum/methionine/cysteine/pyruvate-free minimal essential medium supplemented with glutamine, Invitrogen) before the addition of radiolabel. For [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling, 150 μCi of 35S-Express (1,200 Ci/mmol) was added to each flask in 25 ml of labeling medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. For fatty acid labeling, 0.5 mCi of a [3H]palmitate (5 mCi/ml, 35 Ci/mmol)/BSA suspension (the suspension consisted of 10% ethanol and 6.25 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA) was added to each flask in 25 ml of serum-free labeling medium. Labeled parasites were harvested upon lysis by filtration through 3-micron Nucleopore membranes and washed in PBS. For immunoprecipitation, parasites were lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. All subsequent incubation and washing steps were performed at 4 °C. Lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g, and antiserum was added to the supernatant (4 μl of anti-T. gondii HXGPRT or 20 μl of anti-CAT antisera for radiolabeling experiments; 4 μl of anti-Tetra His for co-immunoprecipitation). After a 10-min incubation, 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) was added and incubated for an additional 60 min with mixing. The beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and boiled in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. [35S]Methionine/cysteine-labeled gels were dried and analyzed using phosphorimaging, and [3H]palmitate-labeled gels were impregnated with Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) before drying and exposure to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR) for 10–12 days. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and processed for immunoblot analysis with anti-T. gondii HXGPRT antibody. HXGPRT Isoforms Are Differentially Distributed in Transgenic Parasites—The predicted amino acid sequences of the two HXGPRT transcripts expressed in T. gondii parasites (Fig. 1A) differ by the presence or absence of a 49-residue insertion (Fig. 1B). Northern blots of total parasite RNA probed with HXGPRT-I cDNA show the presence of two distinct mRNA transcripts in RH (wild-type) parasites that are missing in ΔHXGPRT knock-out mutants (Fig. 1C). Diffuse hybridization in the ΔHXGPRT lane is presumed to result from probe binding to aberrant transcripts from the disrupted hxgprt gene. Western blotting of total cell lysates from RH and ΔHXGPRT parasites with polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant T. gondii HXGPRT-I confirms the presence of two HXGPRT isoforms of the size predicted for the two differentially spliced transcripts and the absence of any reactive protein in the knock-out mutant (Fig. 1D). The possibility that the expression of these two isoforms might be developmentally regulated was tested by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of various developmental stages throughout the life cycle of the parasite. Similar relative levels of HXGPRT-I and HXGPRT-II expression were observed in the acutely lytic tachyzoite form cultivated in vitro, the latent bradyzoite tissue cyst form (induced in vitro (10Bohne W. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), and the unsporulated oocyst form obtained from a sexual cross in cats (data not shown). Similar levels of both HXGPRT isoforms were also observed in wild-type strains representing all three of the major parasite lineages known from population genetic studies (21Howe D.K. Sibley L.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 172: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar): RH (type I), ME49 (type II), and Veg (type III). These results indicate that the expression of differentially spliced isoforms is conserved in all T. gondii parasites but is not stage- or strain-specific. To further characterize these two isoforms, we examined their distribution within parasite tachyzoites by subcellular fractionation and fluorescence microscopy as shown in Fig. 2. Differential centrifugation was used to isolate a high speed membrane pellet (Fig. 2A, P) and the cytosolic supernatant (S), which were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti-HXGPRT antisera (Fig. 2A) and enzyme activity assays (Fig. 2B). As expected, neither immunoreactive material nor enzyme activity was observed in the ΔHXGPRT knock-out background. Only isoform I was observed in the HXGPRT-I transgenics and only in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). Similarly, activity was observed in the cytosol only (Fig. 2B), and ΔHXGPRT parasites expressing a recombinant transgene in which the entire HXGPRT-I protein was fused to a fluorescent protein reporter showed cytosolic localization (Fig. 2C, left panels). Only isoform II was observed in the HXGPRT-II transgenics, and this protein was predominantly associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 9). Much of the HXGPRT-II enzyme activity was also associated with the pellet (Fig. 2B), and a recombinant fluorescent protein fusion highlighted the surface membranes of the parasite (Fig. 2C, right panels). HXGPRT-II remained associated with the pellet fraction following washes in either 1 m KCl or 6 m urea (data not shown), indicating that membrane association is not simply a consequence of superficial electrostatic interactions. Significant HXGPRT-II protein and enzyme activity was also observed in the cytosol, but cytosolic localization was more prominent in transgenics employing the (relatively strong) pdhfr promoter as compared with the native phpt promoter (compare lanes 8 and 10 in Fig. 2A), suggesting mistargeting due to overexpression. In wild-type parasites both isoforms were observed in both fractions (compare Fig. 2A, lanes 11 and 12; see “Discussion”). HXGPRT-II Associates with the Inner Membrane Complex— The association of HXGPRT-II with the membrane fraction in T. gondii prompted efforts to more precisely define its subcellular location. The pellicle of Apicomplexan parasites is composed of three membranes, including the plasma membrane, and a patchwork of underlying flattened vesicles associated with cytoskeletal components (designated the “inner membrane complex”) (22Morrissette N.S. Murray J.M. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morrissette N.S. Sibley L.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition to providing structural stability, the IMC also serves as a scaffold for daughter parasite assembly during cell division; daughters eventually acquire their plasma membrane by budding out of the mother cell (18Hu K. Mann T. Striepen B. Beckers C.J. Roos D.S. Murray J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The IMC1 protein is a component of the subpellicular network, a membrane skeleton associated with the IMC in both the mother and developing daughter parasites (24Mann T. Beckers C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the HXGPRT-II-mRFP fusion associates with the pellicle of both the mother and developing daughter parasites during mitotic division, even before the daughters acquire their plasma membrane. HXGPRT-II-mRFP co-localizes with an IMC1-YFP transgene, confirming association with the IMC rather than the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Treatment of these parasites with oryzalin, which disrupts the assembly of new subpellicular microtubules and IMC formation in mother and daughter cells (25Stokkermans T.J. Schwartzman J.D. Keenan K. Morrissette N.S. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), disrupts the localization of both IMC1 and HXGPRT-II (Fig. 3C). Further confirmation for association of HXGPRT-II with the IMC comes from mass spectrometric analysis of proteins co-precipitated with HXGPRT following cross-linking. Preliminary studies have identified both IMC1 and myosin A in these samples (not shown). Both of these proteins are known to be associated with the IMC (26Opitz C. Soldati D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hetero-oligomers of HXGPRT Isoforms Form in Vivo—The crystal structure of T. gondii HXGPRT-I is tetrameric (6Schumacher M.A. Carter D. Ross D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Nat. Struct.

To investigate whether such hetero-oligomers also form in vivo, we transfected parasites stably expressing HXGPRT-I in a ΔHXGPRT background with HXGPRT-II-His6 fusion constructs. Conversely, parasites stably expressing HXGPRT-II were transfected with HXGPRT-I-His6. As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-His antibody followed by probing with anti-T. gondii HXGPRT antisera demonstrates that untagged HXGPRT-I co-precipitated with HXGPRT-II-His6 (lane 4) and untagged HXGPRT-II co-precipitated with HXGPRT-I-His6 (lane 8). Control immunoprecipitations from parasites expressing only HXGPRT-I or HXGPRT-II verify the specificity of the anti-His antibody (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 6). These results provide evidence that the two HXGPRT isoforms form hetero-oligomers in"

We have identified CVAK104 (a coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa) using a mass spectroscopic analysis of adaptor protein preparations. CVAK104 is a novel serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the SCY1-like family of protein kinases, previously thought to be catalytically inactive. We found that CVAK104 co-fractionates with adaptor protein preparations extracted from clathrin-coated vesicles and directly binds to both clathrin and the plasma membrane adaptor, AP2. CVAK104 binds ATP, and kinase assays indicate that it functions in vitro as a poly-l-lysine-stimulated kinase that is capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylating the β2-adaptin subunit of AP2.

Endocytosis involves the invagination of specialized regions of the plasma membrane, which pinch off to form cargo-containing vesicles that are transported into the cell. Although several diverse endocytic pathways are present in eukaryotic cells, the clathrin-mediated pathway is ubiquitous and the most efficient mechanism. This internalization pathway is key to a variety of biological processes that range from the down-regulation of activated signaling receptors to synaptic vesicle recycling (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a dynamic process that is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally and involves the coordinated effort of a host of cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins (2Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 3Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Central to endocytic vesicle formation are two protein complexes, clathrin and AP2, 1The abbreviations used are: AP, adaptor protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBST, PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20; FSBA, fluorosulphonylbenzoyladenosine; AAK1, adaptor associated kinase I. which make up the major coat constituents. The formation of progressively curved clathrin lattices on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane is believed to be a driving force in the generation of coated pits and coated vesicles. However, clathrin, being incapable of directly binding to the plasma membrane or to cargo, requires the action of AP2. AP2 is a multifunctional complex consisting of two large peptide chains (α and β2), a medium (μ2), and a small chain (σ2) that coordinates the recruitment and assembly of clathrin and links it to cargo that is marked for internalization. AP2 also acts as a platform to recruit other functionally relevant endocytic factors, such as amphiphysin, eps15, epsin, AP180, AAK1, etc. (4Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc.

Although the mechanisms involved in regulating the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway are not fully understood, accumulating evidence suggests that phosphorylation cycles may be a key step (7Turner K.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to be important to the clathrin-mediated internalization of growth factors and nutrients, respectively. However, the phosphorylation of endocytic factors is not limited to the major coat constituents. Many other components of the endocytic machinery (e.g. dynamin 1, amphiphysin 1 and 2, synaptojanin, AP180, epsin, and eps15), collectively known as the dephosphins, are phosphorylated in resting neurons and then coordinately dephosphorylated following nerve terminal stimulation (14Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 659-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that phosphorylation plays an important role in clathrin-dependent internalization, a more detailed understanding of the endocytic regulatory mechanisms will require the identification of the respective kinases that target endocytic components. Multiple kinases have been defined that target the major constituents of clathrin-coated vesicles. Although Src kinase (10Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P.

We have taken a directed proteomic approach to identify novel kinases associated with adaptor protein preparations. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of a novel serine/threonine kinase that we have named CVAK104 (coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa). Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies against the clathrin heavy chain (TD.1) and adaptins (100/1, 100/2, and 100/3) were generous gifts from Dr. F. Brodsky (University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) and Dr. E. Ungewickell (Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany), respectively. Dr. Matthias Jost, in the Schmid laboratory, generated polyclonal antibodies against a brain-specific splice variant of α-adaptin (amino acids 706–727, rabbit, number 3492) fused to GST as described previously (18Ball C.L. Hunt S.P. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain was fractionated as previously described (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins and clathrin triskelia were isolated essentially as described previously (19Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Smythe E. Carter L.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Kinase inhibitors included H89, staurosporine, roscovitine, and olomoucine (Calbiochem), protein kinase C/calmodulin kinase inhibitor mixture, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), heparin (average molecular mass, 15 kDa) and genistein (Sigma). Poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) peptides (molecular mass, 20–50 kDa) were also from Sigma. CVAK104 Cloning—To generate the full-length CVAK104 cDNA, a commercially available cDNA, CSODC028YM07 in pCMV-sport6 (Invitrogen) (Genbank™ accession number CR621893), containing the 5′ initiating methionine and additional CVAK104 coding sequence, was digested with KpnI. The isolated insert was ligated into the KpnI site of KIAA1360 (Kazusa Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). The resulting full-length cDNA was then used as a template for PCR reactions to integrate an N-terminal Myc tag and 5′- and 3′-EcoRI restriction sites for subcloning into a pVL1393-GST fusion vector (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and baculovirus production (see “CVAK Antibody & Protein Production”). PCR primers included: 5′-GAATTCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGATGGAGTCCATGCTTAATAAATTG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCCCCAAAAAGATCTTTTAAATCATTGCTAGCTGAACTGC-3′. CVAK104 Antibody and Protein Production—For antibody production, the KIAA1360 cDNA insert (encoding amino acids 145–933 of CVAK104) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T3 and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the cell cultures for 3 h at 25 °C. Bacterial cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction containing the expressed fusion protein was isolated using glutathione-agarose beads. The bound protein was eluted from beads using 20 mm reduced glutathione in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), which was subsequently used as an immunogen for antibody production in rabbit (number 6369) using established protocols (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Antibody specificity was tested by immunoblot analysis with preimmune sera showing no immunoreactivity to bovine brain coat constituents (data not shown). The CVAK104-GST fusion construct in pVL1393-GST (see “CVAK104 Cloning”) was used for insect cell-mediated protein expression using the BaculoGold expression system following the manufacturer's protocols (Pharmingen). After 48 h of infection with recombinant baculovirus and expression in TN5 cells, the cells were pelleted, processed, and fusion protein was isolated following the identical procedures as those followed for bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins, with one exception. Following GST fusion protein binding to glutathione beads, bound protein was washed three times with 20 bead volumes of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 0.5 m NaCl before elution with the reduced glutathione. Nucleotide Binding Assays—To assay nucleotide binding, 2 μg of isolated CVAK- or AAK1-GST fusion protein was incubated in kinase buffer (see “Kinase Assays”) and 50 μm AB11 (Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc., Lexington, KY), a biotinylated, UV light, cross-linkable ATP analogue, in the absence or presence of unlabeled ATP at various concentrations. Following AB11 addition, samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then exposed to UV light at 254 nm using a handheld UV lamp for 2.5 min. The binding assay was terminated by the addition of protein sample buffer and boiling. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed for bound biotin using alkaline-phosphatase conjugated to avidin, and developed as described previously (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), with minor modification. Briefly, isolated baculovirus-expressed CVAK104-GST was incubated in kinase buffer (150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm [γ32P]ATP) in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (30–70 kDa, Sigma) with isolated adaptor proteins for 45 min at room temperature. The kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of protein sample buffer and boiled for 2 min at 100 °C. The proteins were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose, exposed to a phosphorimaging plate, and analyzed using the ImageQuant Software package (Amersham Biosciences). The endogenous kinase activities of adaptor and other protein preparations were inactivated by pre-incubation with 1 mm FSBA (fluorosulphonylbenzoyladenosine, Sigma), for 1 h on ice. Unbound FSBA was removed from protein preparations by gel filtration using a G25 mini-spin column (Amersham Biosciences) before use in the kinase assays. Adaptor Protein and Clathrin Interaction Tests—Isolated CVAK104-GST fusion protein was incubated with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 20 bead volumes of PBST. CVAK104-GST-beads (10 μl at ∼0.5 μg/μl) were incubated with either 5 μg of isolated AP1, AP2, or clathrin triskelia in 250 μl of PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 20 bead volumes of PBST and then analyzed for adaptor protein and clathrin binding by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed using established protocols (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analysis of adaptor proteins incorporating urea/SDS followed by SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (23Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For immunoblots, CVAK104 polyclonal antibody was diluted 1:2,000. Preimmune sera and secondary antibody controls showed no immunoreactivity to bovine brain samples (data not shown). CVAK104 Isolation and Cloning—Isolated adaptor protein preparations co-fractionate with endogenous kinase activities that target various subunits of the AP2 complex. We previously identified AAK1, a μ2 kinase present in these preparations, using a phage display protein interaction screen (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To identify other endogenous kinase activities, isolated adaptor protein preparations derived from bovine brain (19Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed using mass spectroscopy. This analysis revealed the presence of AAK1, as expected, and led to the identification of a previously uncharacterized kinase encoded by human cDNA KIAA1360 (GenBank™ accession number AB037781). Sequence analysis indicated that KIAA1360 lacks an initiating methionine, whereas domain analysis using SMART (24Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar) suggested the presence of a kinase domain. To identify the full-length cDNA, the 5′ nucleotide sequence of KIAA1360 was used to search the human expressed sequence tag data base (NCBI). This resulted in the identification of the initiating methionine and full-length cDNA (other full-length sequences have now been identified, see accession number NP_060458) that encodes a kinase we now call CVAK104. CVAK104 has a predicted molecular mass of ∼104 kDa and belongs to a class of phosphotransferases, whose specificity for serine/threonine or tyrosine is ambiguous (Fig. 1). Interestingly, although CVAK104 has other kinase signature motifs, it lacks the highly conserved aspartic acid residue used for nucleotide catalysis in other kinases. Thus, CVAK104 belongs to the SCY1-like family of protein kinases (referred to as SCYL2) (25Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6312) Google Scholar) that are thought to be catalytically inactive. CVAK104 contains two weak clathrin binding motifs, DLL (26Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an NPF motif shown to support interaction with EPS15 homology domain-containing proteins, such as eps15 and intersectin (27Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Phylogenic analysis indicates that CVAK104 is highly conserved in mammals, sharing >93% identity with the full-length amino acid sequences of rat (GenBank™ accession number XM_2350507) and mouse (accession number NM_198021) and 98% identity within their predicted kinase domains (not shown). CVAK104 Co-fractionates with Adaptor Protein Preparations— To analyze the distribution of CVAK104, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). In crude bovine brain lysates, CVAK antisera specifically recognized three protein species (104-, 116-, and 118-kDa) (Fig. 2A). Of these, the 104-kDa species had a size consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the full-length cDNA. This species was predominantly membrane-associated and co-fractionated with isolated clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 2A). The larger two CVAK species are found in both cytosolic and membrane fractions, but neither is enriched along with clathrin-coated vesicles. Whether they represent alternate splice forms of CVAK104, as we have observed for AAK1 (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), or another antigenically related protein remains to be determined. Further fractionation of Tris-extracted clathrin coat proteins, resolved by gel filtration and hydroxyapatite chromatography (19Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Smythe E. Carter L.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), revealed that CVAK104 elutes from the hydroxyapatite column at low salt in fractions enriched with AP1, as detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-γ-adaptin antibody (Fig. 2B). However, we do not believe that this co-fractionation reflects a direct interaction between AP1 and CVAK104 (see next paragraph). Together, these results confirm our mass spectroscopy data and those of others (28Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of CVAK104 in AP preparations, and suggest that CVAK104 may directly interact with clathrin coat constituents to regulate their function. CVAK104 Specifically Interacts with Endocytic Vesicle Coat Components—We postulated that, because CVAK104 co-fractionates with clathrin-coated vesicles, CVAK104 might also directly interact with at least one of the major coat proteins. To explore this possibility, baculovirus-expressed CVAK104-GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with the major coat proteins, AP1, AP2, and clathrin. CVAK104-GST specifically bound clathrin triskelia and isolated AP2 complexes (Fig. 3), whereas no interaction was observed following incubation of these coat protein complexes with immobilized GST. In contrast, we were unable to detect interaction between CVAK104 and AP1 under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3), although minor contaminating amounts of AP2 in our AP1 preparations were detected and found to interact with CVAK104. These data would suggest that CVAK104 might be preferentially associated with clathrincoated vesicles derived from the plasma membrane rather than from the trans-Golgi network or endosomes. However, we were unable to test this prediction, because our antibodies were not effective reagents for immunofluorescence localization studies. The C-terminal ear domains of α- and β2-adaptin are regions of the AP2 complex known to support interaction with a variety of endocytic accessory factors. However, binding studies (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) indicate that the AP2-CVAK104 interaction is not supported through the ear domain of α-adaptin; interaction between the isolated α-adaptin ear domain and CVAK104-GST fusion protein was not detectable under conditions known to support binding to other factors, such as AAK1 (data not shown). Attempts to directly test a potential interaction between the ear domain of β2-adaptin and CVAK104 proved inconclusive, as both proteins were found to nonspecifically bind to agarose beads (data not shown). These results suggest that CVAK104 binds specifically to AP2 at a site distinct from the appendage domain and by a means distinct from other AP2-interacting proteins. This is consistent with the lack of AP2-interacting motifs in its sequence. These AP2-CVAK104 interactions are likely disrupted by the 0.5 m Tris used to extract coated vesicles, and the co-elution of CVAK104 with AP1 during hydroxyapatite chromatography most likely reflects its interactions with hydroxyapatite medium rather than direct interactions with AP1. CVAK104 Is a Serine/Threonine Kinase That Phosphorylates the β2-Adaptin Subunit of AP2—We have shown that CVAK104 encodes a putative kinase that is present in AP preparations, which contain endogenous kinase activities. Therefore, we tested the ability of CVAK104 to function as a kinase. Initially, we analyzed the ability of baculovirus-expressed CVAK104-GST fusion protein to bind ATP. As a positive control, we used the AAK1-GST fusion protein that, as expected, was capable of binding a UV light cross-linkable, biotinylated ATP analogue. This binding was effectively competed by incubation with unmodified ATP (Fig. 4). Similarly, we found that CVAK104 bound the ATP analogue, which also could be competed with unlabeled ATP. The identity of the nucleotide binding species was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Basic polypeptide chains, such as poly-l-lysine, stimulate endogenous kinases associated with clathrin-coated vesicles; therefore, we tested their effect on CVAK104 nucleotide binding. However, the presence or absence of poly-l-lysine did not alter the ability of CVAK104 to bind nucleotide (Fig. 4). CVAK104 directly interacts with AP2, is present in enriched adaptor protein preparations, and binds nucleotide. Thus, we tested its ability to function as a phosphotransferase and to target adaptor proteins. The activity of endogenous kinases that co-fractionate with adaptor proteins from bovine brain was readily visualized following the incubation of samples with [γ32P]ATP (Fig. 5A, lanes labeled APs). The major phosphorylated product, which results from the action of AAK1 (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), was the μ2-subunit of AP2. The addition of poly-l-lysine to these kinase reactions resulted in the stimulation of an endogenous kinase(s) leading to an increase in the phosphorylation of the large adaptor protein subunits, the adaptins. When isolated CVAK104 was incubated with [γ32P]ATP, we did not observe any significant kinase activity. However, when reactions were supplemented with poly-l-lysine, CVAK104 was capable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lanes labeled CVAK). To assay the ability of CVAK104 to target adaptor proteins, we inactivated endogenous kinases by pre-incubation with the ATP analogue FSBA, which irreversibly binds the active site and inhibits kinase activity (5Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Olusanya O. Andrews P.D. Swedlow J.R. Smythe E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 896-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The addition of baculovirus-expressed CVAK104-GST fusion protein and poly-l-lysine to FSBA-inactivated AP1 samples did not reveal any significant CVAK104-mediated phosphorylation beyond CVAK104 autophosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lanes labeled FSBA-AP1), consistent with the inability of CVAK104 to directly interact with AP1 (Fig. 3). In contrast, incubation of CVAK104 and poly-l-lysine with AP2 resulted in the phosphorylation of proteins at a molecular weight consistent with that of the large adaptin subunits (Fig. 5A, lanes labeled FSBA-AP2). As was observed for autophosphorylation, CVAK104-mediated phosphorylation of the AP2-associated adaptins required the presence of poly-l-lysine. To determine which adaptin subunit was being phosphorylated following CVAK104 addition, the subunits were resolved using two-dimensional electrophoresis employing a urea-SDS system in the first dimension, followed by standard SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. This approach, developed by Ahle et al. (23Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), separates the large adaptin subunits, as these proteins fail to resolve under isoelectric focusing conditions (23Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 29Keen J.H. Black M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When kinase reactions containing CVAK104, poly-l-lysine, and AP2 were resolved under this system, immunoblot analysis indicated that the β2-subunit of AP2 was selectively phosphorylated (Fig. 5, D and E) with no detectable phosphorylation of the α-adaptin subunit (Fig. 5, F and G). In addition to assessing CVAK104 activity toward isolated adaptor proteins, other potential substrates were tested. Poly-l-lysine-stimulated CVAK104 was also found to phosphorylate an ∼60-kDa protein from FSBA-inactivated cytosol (Fig. 6). Interestingly, when CVAK104 is incubated with Tris-extracted proteins from isolated microsomes that contain clathrin coat proteins, we observed a phosphorylated band at ∼90 kDa and no detectable phosphorylation of the β2-subunit of AP2. Additionally, we tested CVAK104 activity toward poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) peptides, a general substrate for protein tyrosine kinases. However, the only phosphorylated product detected was CVAK autophosphorylation (Fig. 6). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that CVAK104, like many kinases, has multiple targets in different cellular locations. To further characterize CVAK104 activity, we analyzed its sensitivity to an array of kinase inhibitors. Kinase reactions incorporating staurosporine (2.7 nm), a broad-spectrum serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, showed a marked reduction in CVAK104 autophosphorylation and activity toward the β2-subunit of AP2. In contrast, CVAK104 was relatively insensitive to the cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor H89 (100 μm), heparin (5 μg/ml), a casein kinase II inhibitor, cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptides (600 nm), or protein kinase C/calmodulin kinase inhibitor mixtures (Fig. 7A; see “Experimental Procedures”). Moreover, CVAK104 activity was not perturbed by incubation with genistein (10 μm) at concentrations known to inhibit a range of protein tyrosine kinases, consistent with its lack of activity toward tyrosine kinase substrates (poly(Glu:Tyr) peptides) (Fig. 6). Treatment of synaptosomes with reagents that inhibit cdk5 activity alters clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling, although with differentially reported effects (30Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J.

Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Given that CVAK104 targets the β2-subunit of AP2, a core component of the endocytic machinery, we examined CVAK104 sensitivity to the cdk5 inhibitors olomoucine and roscovitine. Olomoucine treatment had little effect on CVAK104 activity toward β2-adaptin (Fig. 7B), whereas roscovitine showed an inhibitory effect at 10 μm, a concentration 10-fold greater than that required to inhibit cdk5. The differential activities of roscovitine versus olomoucine may, in part, account for their differential effects on synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons (30Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that CVAK104 is a poly-l-lysine-stimulated serine/threonine kinase whose activity is responsible for the phosphorylation of the β2-adaptin subunit of AP2 in isolated adaptor protein preparations. We have identified a novel coated vesicle-associated kinase, CVAK104, which belongs to the SCY1-like family of protein kinases, previously thought to be catalytically inactive, as they lack the highly conserved catalytic aspartic acid (25Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6312) Google Scholar). Although we do not currently understand the mechanism of catalysis, here we provide evidence that CVAK104 is a poly-l-lysine-stimulated serine/threonine kinase that has autocatalytic activity and targets the large β2-subunit AP2. The isolated CVAK104-GST fusion protein used in our studies derives from insect cell overexpression; thus, we cannot eliminate the possibility that our protein samples are contaminated with trace amounts of another tightly associated kinase. However, we do not favor this scenario for several reasons. 1) It is unlikely that a contaminating baculovirus-derived kinase would share the same properties as that of the endogenous activity found in adaptor protein preparations. CVAK104 is not only present in adaptor protein preparations, its activity, similar to that of the observed endogenous activity, is stimulated by the presence of basic polypeptides and appears to be specific for the β2-subunit. 2) Only a single population of nucleotide-binding protein, corresponding to that of isolated CVAK104, was observed in our ATP binding studies. 3) During the course of this study, KIAA1360 (CVAK104) was also found in an extensive mass spectroscopic analysis of highly purified clathrin-coated vesicles along with AAK1 and GAK, μ2-adaptin kinases, and phosphofructokinase (28Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 32Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M. Hussain N.K. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Roy L. Boismenu D. Kearney R.E. Bell A.W. Bergeron J.J. McPherson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3833-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in neither our analysis nor that of others were any other kinases identified. Thus, it is likely that CVAK104 corresponds to the previously unidentified poly-l-lysine-stimulated β-adaptin kinase associated with clathrin-coated vesicles and coat protein preparations. A second poly-l-lysine-stimulated, casein kinase II-like activity also associates with clathrin-coated vesicles, and following stimulation, it phosphorylates a broad range of coat protein constituents, including the clathrin light chain (16Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The activity we observed following CVAK104 addition to kinase assays cannot result from casein kinase II contamination, because unlike casein kinase II, which is potently inhibited by heparin (33Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), CVAK104 activity is heparin-insensitive. Therefore, we believe that CVAK104 is indeed a catalytically active kinase, although future studies incorporating site-directed mutagenesis will be needed to definitively demonstrate its activity and define the catalytic mechanism. Although β2-adaptin appears to be the only substrate targeted in coated vesicle extracts, CVAK104 can phosphorylate a 60-kDa protein in cytosolic fractions and a 90-kDa protein extracted from microsomal membranes. The identity of these other substrates remains to be determined, but these data suggest that CVAK104, similar to other kinases, may control multiple protein activities in vivo. Whether these other substrates are also involved in vesicular trafficking or function in other biological processes also remains to be determined. What is the functional consequence of CVAK104-mediated phosphorylation of β2-adaptin? The β2-subunit is known to support interaction with AP180, eps15, epsin, amphiphysin, and clathrin (6Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hao W. Luo Z. Zheng L. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22785-22794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These protein interactions occur over a relatively small region of the protein, and thus it is unlikely that β2 can support the simultaneous interaction with each protein. Thus, it is feasible that phosphorylation may regulate the ability of β2 to interact with other endocytic factors. Previous observations suggest that the poly-l-lysine-dependent phosphorylation of β2, at multiple locations, prevents its recruitment to and sedimentation with preassembled clathrin cages (13Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, our attempts to repeat this observation were unsuccessful; the addition of poly-l-lysine, which is required for β2-adaptin kinase activity, cross-links clathrin coat constituents (35Georgieva-Hanson V. Schook W.J. Puszkin S. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hence, in our hands, β2-adaptin was consistently found associated with clathrin cages, following the addition of poly-l-lysine and high speed centrifugation, independent of its phosphorylation state (not shown). β2-adaptin phosphorylation may also influence AP2 localization. Previous studies (11Lauritsen J.P. Menne C. Kastrup J. Dietrich J. Odum N. Geisler C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1497: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have established that β2 is phosphorylated in vivo by a staurosporine-sensitive kinase whose function is balanced by the constitutive activity of protein phosphatase 2A. Lauritsen et al. (11Lauritsen J.P. Menne C. Kastrup J. Dietrich J. Odum N. Geisler C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1497: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) observed that treatment of Jurkat cells with agents that block protein phosphatase 2A function perturb AP2 localization at the plasma membrane and disrupt transferrin internalization. Whether CVAK104 is responsible for this phosphorylation reaction in vivo or whether β2-adaptins are also substrates for other kinases, remains to be determined. In summary, we have identified CVAK104 as an endogenous poly-l-lysine-stimulated kinase that phosphorylates the β2-subunit of the AP2 complex. To gain a better understanding of CVAK104 function, it will be important to identify other interacting partners and isolate and characterize its other substrates.

Cdt1 activity is inhibited by geminin, which also participates in neural development and embryonic differentiation in many eukaryotes. Although Cdt1 homologues have been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to human, geminin homologues had not been described for Caenorhabditis elegans and fungi. Here, we identify the C. elegans geminin, GMN-1. Biochemical analysis reveals that GMN-1 associates with C. elegans CDT-1, the Hox protein NOB-1, and the Six protein CEH-32. GMN-1 inhibits not only the interaction between mouse Cdt1 and Mcm6 but also licensing activity in Xenopus egg extracts. RNA interference-mediated reduction of GMN-1 is associated with enlarged germ nuclei with aberrant nucleolar morphology, severely impaired gametogenesis, and chromosome bridging in intestinal cells. We conclude that the Cdt1-geminin system is conserved throughout metazoans and that geminin has evolved in these taxa to regulate proliferation and differentiation by directly interacting with Cdt1 and homeobox proteins.

Eukaryotic DNA replication is controlled by the stepwise assembly of a prereplicative complex (pre-RC) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; pre-IC, pre-initiation complex; ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance protein complex; EST, expressed sequence tag; RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; pre-IC, pre-initiation complex; ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance protein complex; EST, expressed sequence tag; RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and the replication apparatus. The pre-RC includes the origin recognition complex (ORC), the minichromosome maintenance protein complex (MCM), as well as the Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins. After activation of S phase-promoting kinases, pre-RC converts to the pre-initiation complex (pre-IC). This step includes the loading of Cdc45 and Gins complex, which allows DNA polymerases to assemble with the replication apparatus. Each step in the assembly of pre-RC, pre-IC, and replication apparatus is regulated by checkpoint mechanisms thus maintaining genome integrity and ploidy and avoiding disposition to carcinogensesis (1Bell S.P.

Geminin was first identified in Xenopus egg extract as degradable protein by anaphase-promoting complex and later characterized as the licensing inhibitor through direct interaction with Cdt1 (7Wohlschlegel J.A.

Furthermore, geminin has been found in various multicellular eukaryotes including human, Xenopus, and Drosophila,to participate in neural development and embryonic differentiation (19Kroll K.L.

In contrast, geminin homologue has not been found in C. elegans as well as monocellular eukaryotes including S. cerevisiae and S. pombe yet. To better understand the relevance of the geminin-Cdt1 system in higher eukaryotes, we described the domain organization of mouse Cdt1 (8Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The less conserved amino-terminal region is responsible for binding DNA, whereas the central region has geminin binding activity and is conserved among multicellular eukaryotes including C. elegans. The carboxyl-terminal region, also conserved, functions as an Mcm6-binding domain. Because C. elegans CDT-1 has a geminin-binding domain, we undertook to find a C. elegans geminin homologue. Cloning of C. elegans cdt-1, mcm-6, and gmn-1 cDNAs—The amino acid sequence of Drosophila geminin was used to screen the NCBI data base for C. elegans geminin, which yielded a sequence with the accession number Y75B8A.17.

Licensing Activity Assay Using Xenopus Egg Extracts—Xenopus egg extract and demembranated sperm nuclei were prepared as reported (17Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cdt1-depleted extract was prepared starting with an interphase Xenopus egg extract supplemented with 25 mm phosphocreatine, 15 μg ml-1 creatine phosphokinase, and 0.25 mg ml-1 cycloheximide using anti-Xenopus Cdt1 antiserum following a previously described method (17Tada S.

Sperm chromatin competent for the licensing reaction was prepared by incubation of demembranated sperm nuclei (10,000 nuclei μl-1) with the Cdt1-depleted extract for 20 min to allow assembly with ORC and Cdc6, and the resulting chromatin was isolated. The licensing reaction was carried out by a 15-min incubation of a reaction mixture (4 μl) containing competent chromatin, partially purified Mcm2–7 fraction, and GST-fused Xenopus Cdt1 in the absence or presence of 50 ng μl-1 Xenopus geminin or C. elegans GMN-1. After the addition of 10 μl of interphase Xenopus egg extract supplemented with [α-32P]dATP (20 kBq) and an excess of Xenopus geminin (100 ng μl-1), licensing activity was assessed by measuring radioactivity incorporated into newly synthesized DNA during a further 3-h incubation. To measure the association of Mcm4 with chromatin, sperm chromatin was incubated with Mcm2–7 as described above and pelleted from the replication assay, and the amount of Mcm4 bound to the chromatin was determined by Western blot analysis. RNA Interference Assay—Templates for RNAi were prepared by amplification of a genomic fragment of gmn-1/Y75B8A.17 using the exon 1 forward primer and the exon 2 reverse primer, and this fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pBluescript. RNAi was performed using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from the gmn-1 genomic clone. The cloned gmn-1 DNA fragment was amplified with primers containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, and dsRNA was synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. Delivery of dsRNA into worms was performed by soaking (26Maeda I. Kohara Y. Yamamoto M. Sugimoto A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 171-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) or microinjection (27Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N.

Initial screens of the C. elegans genome data base using cDNAs for human geminin as queries to search for homologous EST clones was not successful. However, when Drosophila geminin was used as a query, a PSI-BLAST search yielded a single homologous gene, Y75B8A.17. Previous large scale RNAi analyses reported no detectable phenotypes for inactivation of this gene (27Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S.

The COILS program predicted that residues 119–150 have a coiled-coil probability >0.9 and form five hepted repeats, and residues 114–171 have a probability >0.5 and form eight hepted repeats. The coiled-coil structure is conserved in human, mouse, Xenopus, and Drosophila geminin (18McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 20Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2741-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), indicating that the protein encoded by Y75B8A.17 is the C. elegans geminin homologue. We named the gene gmn-1 according to the nomenclature of Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. The open reading frame predicted by EST sequences and by the genome sequence encodes a putative protein of 180 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 20.2 kDa, which shares 19% identity and 52% similarity with the central coiled-coil region of Drosophila geminin (Fig. 1B). We also identified a single gmn-1 ortholog (CBG23049) in Caenorhabditis briggsae, a related nematode that diverged from C. elegans roughly 100 million years ago (29Stein L.D. Bao Z. Blasiar D. Blumenthal T. Brent M.R. Chen N. Chinwalla A. Clarke L. Clee C. Coghlan A. Coulson A. D'Eustachio P. Fitch D.H. Fulton L.A. Fulton R.E. Griffiths-Jones S. Harris T.W. Hillier L.W. Kamath R.

PloS Biol. 2003; 1: E45Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). C. elegans gmn-1 and the C. briggsae orthologue share the same exon-intron structure, and their predicted protein products share 56% identity (69% similarity), with higher conservation in the coiled-coil region (73% identity and 84% similarity). To determine whether C. elegans contains a geminin-Cdt1 system similar to that of other multicellular eukaryotes, we further characterized the putative protein, GMN-1. We first carried out a yeast two-hybrid analysis using cDNAs encoding Cdt1 and Mcm6 from both mouse and C. elegans and the geminin candidate GMN-1. GMN-1 was found to associate with C. elegans CDT-1 and mouse Cdt1 and, conversely, mouse geminin associated with C. elegans CDT-1 (Fig. 1C). Similarly, both C. elegans and mouse Mcm6 interacted with both C. elegans and mouse Cdt1. In contrast, C. elegans CDT-1 does not associate with ORC-2, suggesting that the Cdt1-Orc2 interaction is not conserved among metazoans. To confirm the protein-protein interactions suggested by yeast two-hybrid analysis, biochemical characterization was carried out using recombinant proteins. Purified CDT-1, mouse Cdt1, and mouse Mcm6 were mixed with mouse geminin or GMN-1, and bound proteins were precipitated by a FLAG-tag inserted at the amino termini of Cdt1 and Mcm6. Both mouse geminin and GMN-1 were detected in bound fractions (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the presence of mouse Mcm6, neither protein was co-precipitated. The amount of GMN-1 precipitated in a complex with Cdt1 was less than that of mouse geminin, indicating that the affinity of GMN-1 for CDT-1 is lower than that of mouse geminin. Taken together, we conclude that GMN-1 can bind both mouse and C. elegans Cdt1 proteins and that the Cdt1-geminin interaction is conserved in C. elegans and the mouse. Next, we examined the effect of GMN-1 on the interaction between Mcm6 and Cdt1. In the presence of GMN-1, the amount of mouse Mcm6 co-precipitated with Cdt1 was severely reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Thus, like mouse geminin, GMN-1 interferes with the interaction between Cdt1 and Mcm6. During purification procedures, we found that gel filtration of gmn-1 showed it eluting with a molecular mass of about 100 kDa (Fig. 2B). Glycerol gradient centrifugation showed it migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa (Fig. 2B). Combining these values in the equation of Siegel and Monty (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) with calculation as described by Saxena et al. (25Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) gives a value of 35 kDa for the native molecular mass of gmn-1, suggesting that it exists as a highly elongated, nonglobular dimer, which is consistent with a number of recent reports (25Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since geminin was reported to be a negative regulator for DNA replication, in that it inhibits Cdt1 activity in a licensing assay system using Xenopus egg extracts (7Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 17Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), we next asked whether GMN-1 also represses Cdt1 activity in this assay. Licensing activity was assayed with increasing amounts of Xenopus Cdt1 in the presence or absence of Xenopus geminin or GMN-1. GMN-1 has a weak but detectable inhibitory effect on licensing activity (Fig. 3A). In addition, the inhibitory effect was overcome by adding more Cdt1, indicating that GMN-1 affects Cdt1 activity. To further understand how GMN-1 inhibits licensing activity, we precipitated chromatin from the licensing system and measured the amount of MCM complex bound to chromatin by Western analysis. GMN-1 reduced the amount of Mcm4 that associates with chromatin (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results strongly suggest that GMN-1 is a functional counterpart of Xenopus geminin. We speculate that its weakly inhibitory effect reflects its lower affinity for mouse and C. elegans Cdt1 proteins. Recently, Zhong et al. (11Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) reported that an RNAi-mediated decrease in the expression of C. elegans cul-4, a subunit of the ubiquitin ligase complex, results in CDT-1 accumulation and extensive re-replication. Since geminin is thought to prevent re-replication by controlling Cdt1 function, RNAi experiments to inhibit the expression of gmn-1 were carried out. Although gmn-1 dsRNA delivered by the feeding method did not result in a detectable phenotype, consistent with a previous report (27Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M.

Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar) caused sterility in ∼20% of animals of the F1 generation (Table I). Further observation of sterile F1 worms by Nomarski microscopy indicated aberrant germ line development. Oogenesis was severely affected, and partially differentiated germ cells accumulated in the proximal arm of the gonad (Fig. 4A). In most of sterile worms, some germ nuclei in the distal region of the gonad (where germ cells undergo mitosis) were enlarged, and their nucleoli were misshapen (Fig. 4B).Table IRNAi phenotype of gmn-1Sterile F1 animalsNumber of P0 animalsSoaking methodControl (H2O)0/252(0%)7gmn-1(RNAi)107/376(28.5%)12MicroinjectionControl (H2O)0/206(0%)6gmn-1(RNAi)112/552(20.3%)9 Open table in a new tab In addition to these germ line defects, mitotic defects were also detected. Intestinal cells of C. elegans become binucleate and polyploid during larval development (32Hedgecock E.M. White J.G. Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the late L1 stage, most intestinal nuclei divide without accompanying cell division, giving rise to 20 intestinal cells with a total of 30–34 nuclei. In addition, intestinal nuclei go through one round of endoreduplication per molt, so that the ploidy of each nucleus is 32C by the final molt. We found that some RNAi-induced sterile gmn-1 adults (17/99 = 17%) showed one to three pairs of chromosome bridging in a total of 30–34 intestinal nuclei, indicative of a defect in coordination between endoreduplication and the nuclear division cycle (Fig. 4C). Recently, geminin was shown to bind various nuclear proteins including homeodomain proteins of the Hox family, the Six/sine oculis class protein Six3, and polycomb group proteins (21Del Bene F. Tessmar-Raible K. Wittbrodt J. Nature. 2004; 427: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 22Luo L. Yang X. Takihara Y. Knoetgen H. Kessel M. Nature. 2004; 427: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To determine whether GMN-1 has an affinity for homeobox transcription factors, physical interactions between GMN-1 and the C. elegans Hox and Six3 proteins were examined. We cloned cDNAs for nob-1 and ceh-32. The nob-1 gene encodes one of three C. elegans posterior group homeodomain transcription factors orthologous to vertebrate Hox9–13 proteins (33Aboobaker A. Blaxter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ceh-32 gene encodes a Six/sine oculis-type homeodomain transcription factors most closely related to Six3/6 subfamily (34Dozier C. Kagoshima H. Niklaus G. Cassata G. Burglin T.R. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both homeobox proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified. GMN-1 is co-precipitated with NOB-1 as well as with CEH-32 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). Although the physiological relationship of GMN-1, NOB-1, and CEH-32 is not yet clear, we conclude that GMN-1 can bind homeobox proteins in vitro, at least NOB-1 and CEH-32, implicating it in the control of development or differentiation through direct interactions with homeobox proteins, as has been found in fish and mice. Previous experiments showed that inhibition of Human, Drosophila, and Xenopus geminin confers different phenotypes. Geminin (-/-) Drosophila exhibits a variety of defects including anaphase chromosome bridges, an increase in the proportion of S phase cells in some tissues including the midgut and the ovaries, and a malformed peripheral nervous system (20Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2741-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, geminin-depleted Xenopus embryos have a unique early embryonic lethal phenotype, in which cells arrest in G2 phase immediately after the midblastula transition (36McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, RNAi of geminin led to overreplication and the formation of giant nuclei (37Melixetian M. Ballabeni A. Masiero L. Gasparini P. Zamponi R. Bartek J. Lukas J. Helin K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 38Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is unclear why the geminin-depleted phenotype differs between these species. Our findings that inhibition of gmn-1 confers defects in germ line development and in intestinal cells point to a primary role for geminin as a regulator of development and proliferation in metazoans. Interestingly, RNAi-mediated inhibition of the cul-4 gene to allow accumulation of CDT-1 caused blast cells, but not germ cells, to enlarge due to DNA re-replication (11Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that gmn-1 is mainly expressed in the germ line and in oocytes 2Y. Kohara, personal communication. (39Kim S.K. Lund J. Kiraly M. Duke K. Jiang M. Stuart J.M. Eizinger A. Wylie B.N. Davidson G.S. Science. 2001; 293: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the accumulation of CDT-1 in germ line provoked by cul-4 depletion is controlled by the GMN-1-mediated inhibition of re-replication. The structural domain organization of geminin has been studied recently (25Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Lee C. Hong B. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S. Cho Y. Nature. 2004; 430: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analyses revealed that geminin adopts a dimerized coiled-coil structure. The amino-terminal region of the coiled-coil dimer is essential for interaction with Cdt1, while the carboxyl-terminal region prevents access of the MCM complex to Cdt1 through steric hindrance (40Lee C. Hong B. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S. Cho Y. Nature. 2004; 430: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, charged residues in the coiled-coil region are also essential for interaction with Cdt1 (25Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An amino acid alignment of GMN-1 with other geminin homologues suggests that amino-terminal residues and charged residues in the coiled-coil regions crucial for interaction with Cdt1 are well conserved (Fig. 1A, open and closed circles). Moreover, GMN-1 also contains coiled-coil domains in its carboxyl-terminal region, potentially enabling it to disturb interactions between Cdt1 and Mcm6. Therefore, GMN-1 shares structural properties with its mammalian counterparts. Indeed, estimation of native molecular mass of GMN-1 by combining the results of gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation suggests a value of 35 kDa for the native molecular mass of GMN-1, indicative of existence as a highly elongated dimer. However, the affinity of GMN-1 for CDT-1 is rather weak compared with Xenopus or mouse geminin, so its inhibitory effect may be limited. The interaction between GMN-1 and CDT-1 might require another component or may involve post-transcriptional modification, which would be a unique feature of the C. elegans system. In conclusion, we propose that the affinity of Cdt1 for geminin has increased during evolution, with the result that geminin has become a key regulator that prevents re-replication, in addition to its original roles in cell cycle progression, cell growth, and differentiation.

Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), and anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 (24Granville D.J. Ruehlmann D.O. Choy J.C. Cassidy B.A. Hunt D.W. van Breemen C. McManus B.M. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) may exert their actions by modulating ER calcium release. It was recently reported that activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors regulates NF-κB activity (25Glazner G.W. Camandola S. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22461-22467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for NF-κB in modulation of cell survival/death decisions under conditions in which ER calcium release plays a role. Here we identify suppression of calcium release through IP3 receptors as a key mechanism whereby NF-κB prevents apoptosis. Materials—Bradykinin, ATP, caffeine, ryanodine, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (APB), ISP-1, and dantrolene were purchased from Sigma. Xestospongin C was purchased from Calbiochem. TNFα was purchased from Pepro-Tech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Fura-2/AM, Fura-2FF/AM, and thapsigargin were purchased from Molecular Probes. 45Ca2+ was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The RelA (p65EGFP) expression plasmid was a generous gift from E. De Smaele and G. Franzoso. The Bcl-2 expression plasmid was a gift from A. Cheng. Decoy DNA and Antisense Treatments—NF-κB decoy DNA was synthesized and prepared as described previously (5Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). IκBα antisense and scrambled control DNA oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized and prepared as described previously (26Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Decoy and antisense were added to neuronal cultures in Neurobasal medium. The cell uptake was evaluated by using fluorescence-tagged decoy DNA and confocal microscopy analysis. The efficacy of the decoy DNA and antisense approaches to decrease and increase NF-κB binding activity, respectively, was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell Cultures and Experimental Treatments—RelA-/- and wild-type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were a gift from H. Nakshatri, D. Baltimore, and A. Hoffmann. Primary MEFs were prepared from E16 WT and p50 knock-out mouse embryos according to standard procedures (27Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture. Stable cell lines expressing p65EGFP and overexpressing Bcl-2 were generated by transfecting RelA-/- MEFs with 1–2 μg of cDNAs using CLONfectin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Selection was carried out for 4 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either G418 (pEGFP and p65EGFP) or puromycin (pBabe and pBabe-Bcl2). Dissociated cell cultures of primary rat cerebral cortical neurons were prepared using methods similar to those described previously (28Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cerebral cortices were removed from embryonic day 18 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). Cells were dissociated by mild trypsinization and trituration and seeded on 22-mm coverslips or 60-mm polyethyleneimine-coated culture dishes containing Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 26 mm NaHCO3, 40 mm glucose, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 0.001% gentamycin sulfate. After a 3–5-h incubation period to allow for cell attachment, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen). Experimental treatments were performed on 7–9-day-old neuronal cultures in which ∼95% of the cells were neurons, and the remaining cells were astrocytes. Fluorometric Measurements of [Ca2+]c—Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured by ratiometric (F340/F380) imaging of Fura-2 fluorescence as described previously (29Leissring M.A. Akbari Y Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs were loaded for 45 min with 2 μm Fura-2/AM in the presence of 0.3% pluronic acid in HBCS (120 mm NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 15 mm glucose, 0.5% phenol red, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3). [Ca2+]c measurements were obtained using a Zeiss AttoFluor system with a ×40 oil objective. The system was calibrated using stock solutions containing either no calcium or a saturating concentration of calcium (1 mm) using the formula [Ca2+]i = Kd [(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R0] (F0/Fs). The experiments in the absence of calcium were performed using HBCS lacking CaCl2 and supplemented with 1 mm EGTA; the ATP solution was also prepared in Ca2+-free medium. Analysis of [Ca2+]er was performed as described previously (30Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fura-2FF/AM-loaded fibroblasts were washed with Ca2+-free buffer and permeabilized using a protocol that preserves the functional integrity of the ER Ca2+ stores by incubation for 3 min with 15 ng/ml digitonin in intracellular medium (120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.2, and 2 mm ATP). The specificity of compartmentalization of Fura-2FF/AM within the ER was assessed in pilot studies by addition of 10 μm IP3 to the permeabilized cells and detection of a decrement of the Fura-2FF/AM ratio. Preparation of Microsomal Fractions—Microsomes from WT and RelA-/- cells were prepared as described previously (25Glazner G.W. Camandola S. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22461-22467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on 150-mm plates were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, detached, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with type A pestle. The cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to pellet intact mitochondria and nuclei. The supernatant was then transferred to a polycarbonate tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the microsomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in ice-cold buffer, and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein concentration was adjusted to 2 μg/μl, and aliquots were prepared for Western blot analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity determination. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Western Blots—Preparation of cell extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as reported previously (31Camandola S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, solubilized proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel for whole cell extracts (50 μg) and on a 4% Tris-glycine gel for microsomes (20 μg). After transfer to a nitrocellulose sheet, the membrane was blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and immunoreacted overnight at 4 °C with the different primary antibodies. The immunoreacted bands were visualized by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-NF-κB p65 (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-SERCA2b (a gift from S. Chan), rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), mouse monoclonal anti-IP3R3 (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R1 (Affinity BioReagents), and rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Measurements of SERCA Activity—SERCA activity was measured using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay in which hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with the oxidation of NADH (32Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The depletion of NADH was detected by a decrease in absorption at 340 nm using a Beckman DU7500 spectrophotometer. The assay buffer contained 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.45 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, 0.32 mm NADH, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 11 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 μm of the calcium ionophore 4-bromo-A23187. The reaction was started with the addition of 10 μg of microsomal membranes and monitored at 30-s intervals for 10 min. Treatment with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin was used as negative control. Analysis of mRNA Encoding IP3R1 and GAPDH by Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers with SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). PCR amplification of cDNA encoding for IP3R1 and GAPDH was performed for 38 and 28 cycles, respectively, of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. Gel electrophoresis with PCR products was performed using ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gels, and PCR products were identified via UV transillumination at their predicted size by using a 100-bp DNA ladder as a molecular weight marker. Images of UV-transilluminated gels were acquired with a FLA 3000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The primer sequences used in this study were as follows: IP3R1 forward, GTGGACGTTTCATCTGCAAGC; IP3R1 reverse, GCTTTCGTGGAATACTCGGTC; GAPDH forward, CCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTCC; and GAPDH reverse, GTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCA. Quantification of Cell Survival—Fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well plates, allowed to adhere for 24 h, and then treated with 50 or 100 ng/ml hTNFα at 37 °C for 24 h. Experiments were also performed in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of IP3R (xestospongin C, 1 μm), ryanodine receptors (dantrolene, 50 μm) and serine-palmitoyltransferase (ISP-1, 1 μm). The inhibitors were added 1 h prior to the addition of hTNFα. At the end of the incubation period, cell survival was assessed using CellTiter 96® Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The assay measures the conversion of a tetrazolium compound (MTS) by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. The quantity of soluble formazan product, as measured by the amount of 490 nm absorbance, is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. Results were expressed as a percentage compared with control. Assessment of apoptotic cell death was performed by staining fixed MEFs or neurons with the fluorescent DNA binding dye bisbenzamide (Hoechst stain). Nuclei were visualized and photographed under epifluorescence illumination (340 nm excitation and 510-nm barrier filter) using a ×20 oil immersion objective. Cells in which nuclear staining was diffuse were considered viable, and cells in which nuclear staining was condensed and fragmented were considered apoptotic. Immunocytochemistry—Following experimental treatments, cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then permeabilized by incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cultures were then incubated for 1 h in 5% normal goat serum and stained for indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R1 antibody (Affinity BioReagents) and a biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Nonspecific labeling was determined by omission of the primary antibody. Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss 510 CSLM microscope. All images were acquired using the same laser intensity and photodetector gain to allow quantitative comparisons of relative levels of immunoreactivity among cells. The average pixel intensity per cell body was determined using the software provided by the manufacturer (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Lipid Extraction and Ceramide Measurements—Lipid extraction from WT and RelA-/- cells and electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry analyses were performed using methods described previously (33Cutler R.G. Pedersen W.A. Camandola S. Rothstein J.D. Mattson M.P. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of cell pellets were homogenized in deionized water, and lipids were extracted by sequential addition of methanol: ammonium acetate and chloroform. After centrifugation, the chloroform phase was collected and used for the lipid analysis. Samples were injected using a Harvard Apparatus pump at 15 μl/min into an electrospray ionization Sciex API 3,000 triple stage quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer from Sciex Inc. (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) operated in a positive mode. Precursor ion scanning or neutral loss scanning of purified standards of C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C24:0, C24:1 ceramides and C16:0-C18:1 phosphatidylethanolamine were used to identify each species. Quantification of ceramides in the samples was accomplished by summing the total mass counts accumulated under each peak after a 3-min injection period. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as means ± S.D. (or S.E., where indicated). One-way analysis of variance combined with Fisher's protected least significant difference post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons. Lack of RelA Results in Increased Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Release—To investigate the role of NF-κB in calcium homeostasis, we monitored cytosolic free calcium levels ([Ca2+]c) in WT MEFs and in MEFs lacking the transactivating subunit of NF-κB RelA/p65 (RelA-/-) during exposure to different agonists that alter [Ca2+]c (Fig. 1A). To activate the IP3 calcium signaling pathway, cells were stimulated with the surface receptor agonists bradykinin (34Byron K.L. Babrigg G. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) and ATP (35Gonzales F.A. Rozengurt E. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4530-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C-E). A dramatic enhancement of calcium release from IP3-sensitive stores was documented in RelA-/- MEFs compared with WT cells. In both WT and RelA-/- MEFs we were unable to detect responses elicited by caffeine or ryanodine (data not shown), suggesting a lack of functional ryanodine receptors in these cells. The calcium response to ATP was also significantly enhanced in WT MEFs in which NF-κB activity was suppressed by a 24-h pretreatment of the cells with κB decoy DNA (Fig. 1C). Treatment with APB, a specific inhibitor of IP3 receptor-mediated calcium release from the ER (36Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), completely abolished the [Ca2+]c response to ATP in both WT and RelA-/- cells (Fig. 1E). Stable transfection of RelA-/- MEFs with a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and RelA (p65EGFP) significantly attenuated the calcium response to ATP, whereas the expression of EGFP alone did not (Fig. 1F), confirming a specific effect of NF-κB on calcium signaling. NF-κB Modulates IP3-gated, Thapsigargin-sensitive Calcium Stores—To determine whether the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]c resulted from calcium influx across the plasma membrane or release from intracellular calcium stores, we stimulated the cells with ATP in calcium-deficient medium. Removal of extracellular calcium resulted in a transient calcium response to ATP, a response that was dramatically enhanced in RelA-/- MEFs (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the enhanced calcium response in cells lacking RelA can be attributed to an effect of NF-κB on calcium release from intracellular stores rather than calcium influx. In most cell types IP3-gated Ca2+ stores overlap with thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (37Zacchetti D. Clementi E. Fasolato C. Lorenzon P. Zottini M. Grohovaz F. Fumagalli G. Pozzan T. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20152-20158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether an increased ER Ca2+ pool storage capacity was responsible for the enhanced [Ca2+]c responses of RelA-deficient cells to agonists that trigger calcium release from IP3-sensitive stores. We monitored [Ca2+]c in WT and RelA-/- cells before and during exposure to thapsigargin, an inhibitor of ER Ca2+-ATPases, in Ca2+-free medium. Cells lacking RelA displayed a significantly greater rise in [Ca2+]c than did WT MEFs (Fig. 2B), suggesting that constitutive NF-κB activity reduces the total pool of ER calcium available for release. Notably, the magnitude of the capacitative Ca2+ entry, analyzed by the addition of 3 mm Ca2+ following the return of [Ca2+]c to basal levels, was essentially indistinguishable in WT and RelA-/- cells (Fig. 2B). This experiment demonstrated that the activity of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels is not altered in RelA-/- cells. The Ca2+ content of the intracellular stores, as assessed by equilibrium loading experiments with 45Ca2+, also demonstrated an increased ER calcium pool in cells lacking RelA (data not shown). We further assessed the ER luminal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]er) by monitoring the fluorescence of compartmentalized Fura-2FF/AM in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2, C and D). In agreement with a previous report (30Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the basal ER Ca2+ concentration was estimated to be ∼790 nm in normal cells. In contrast, RelA-/- fibroblasts exhibited a higher [Ca2+]er of ∼1700 nm (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, when 10 μm IP3 was added to the Fura-2FF/AM permeabilized cells, a greater decrease in [Ca2+]er was observed in the RelA-/- cells (data not shown). Considering the significant [Ca2+]er difference observed in WT as compared with RelA-/- MEFs, we measured the SERCA activity in isolated microsomes. SERCA activity was higher in RelA-/- cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the constitutive ER calcium overload observed in RelA-/- cells is linked to increased active uptake. We then analyzed the levels of proteins that reside in the ER that are involved in cellular calcium homeostasis. The steady-state levels of SERCA type 2b, as well as the expression of the calcium-binding protein calreticulin and of IP3R type 2, were comparable in the two cell types (Fig. 2F). However, IP3R1 and IP3R3 levels were 3.2 and 2 times higher, respectively, in RelA-/- MEFs compared with WT cells (Fig. 2F). Because Bcl-2 has been reported to be a gene controlled by NF-κB (38Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T. Yohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and because it was previously shown that overexpression of Bcl-2 reduces the [Ca2+]er and that this action of Bcl-2 is part of its anti-apoptotic mechanism (39Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we also measured the levels of Bcl-2. Levels of Bcl-2 were similar in WT and RelA-/- cells (Fig. 2F), consistent with the previous observation that the levels of bcl-2 mRNA in B cells generated from WT and RelA-/- mice are similar (6Grossmann M. O'Reilly L.A. Gugasyan R. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Gerondakis S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6351-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, overexpression of Bcl-2 did counteract the [Ca2+]c destabilizing effect of RelA deficiency. Indeed, the RelA-/- MEF clones overexpressing Bcl-2 exhibited a markedly decreased [Ca2+]c response to ATP compared with cells transfected with the empty vector, such that the magnitude of the calcium response in RelA-/- MEFs overexpressing Bcl-2 was comparable to the response observed in WT MEFs (Fig. 2F). These data indicate that the lack of NF-κB activity as the result of RelA deletion causes a profound alteration of ER calcium signaling that involves increased SERCA activity, ER calcium uptake, and IP3-mediated calcium release and that this alteration can be counteracted by Bcl-2. Inhibition of IP3-induced Calcium Release Protects RelA-/-Cells from TNFα-induced Cytotoxicity—In order to link the abnormal ER calcium homeostasis in cells lacking RelA to the cell survival-promoting function of NF-κB, we quantified cell death induced by TNFα. As expected, RelA-/- MEFs exhibited increased vulnerability to killing by TNFα compared with WT cells (Fig. 3, A and B). When RelA-/- MEFs were pretreated for 8 h with TNFα, their [Ca2+]c response to ATP was greatly enhanced compared with RelA-/- MEFs not treated with TNFα (Fig. 3C). In contrast, pretreatment of WT cells with TNFα did not result in an incre"

We report that p107 and p130 formed transcriptional complexes with E2F4 on the FGFR1 promoter and repressed FGFR1 gene transcription in myogenic cells. However, in Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells, only p107 was able to repress Sp1-mediated transactivation of the FGFR1 promoter. Gel shift assays using transfected myoblast nuclear extracts showed that ectopic p107 reduced Sp1 occupancy of the proximal Sp binding site of the FGFR1 promoter, and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that Sp1 interacts with p107 but not with p130. Gel shift assays also demonstrated that Sp1 interacted with p107 in E2F4-p107 transcriptional complexes in myoblasts. The nature of the repressor transcriptional complex was altered in differentiated muscle fibers by the relative loss of the E2F4-p107-Sp1 transcription complex and replacement by the repressor E2F4-p130 complex. These findings demonstrate that activation and repression of FGFR1 gene transcription is governed by interplay between Sp1, p107, p130, and E2F4 in distinct transcriptional complexes during skeletal muscle development. Developmentally controlled transcriptional regulation of myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation via expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene is positively regulated by Sp1 and negatively regulated by E2F4-based transcriptional complexes.

Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS, blocking solution; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.1The abbreviations used are: FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS, blocking solution; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. have diverse functional roles in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, cell migration, differentiation, mesoderm induction, bone growth and limb development (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, FGFR1 mediates the mitogenic activity initiated by FGF1 and FGF2. During skeletal myogenesis, FGFR1 gene expression is positively regulated in proliferating myoblasts and negatively regulated in differentiated muscle fibers. The functional significance of regulated expression of the FGFR1 gene during myogenesis is demonstrated by overexpression in vivo. Chick embryos overexpressing wild-type FGFR1 displayed delayed myoblast differentiation and muscle fiber formation. On the contrary, chick embryos overexpressing a dominant-negative form of FGFR1 displayed premature muscle fiber formation with decreased muscle mass (2Itoh N. Mima T. Mikawa T. Development. 1996; 122: 291-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Flanagan-Steet H. Hannon K. McAvoy M.J. Hullinger R. Olwin B.B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Although regulation of FGFR1 gene expression is important for normal growth and development of skeletal muscles, the molecular mechanism governing its transcription is poorly understood. Positive regulation of FGFR1 gene expression in proliferating myoblasts is governed by the Sp1 transcription factor. The chicken FGFR1 promoter contains two functional, distal Sp1 binding sites, and the proximal region contains three Sp1 binding sites, all of which are essential for full promoter activity in proliferating myoblasts (4Patel S.G. DiMario J.X. Gene. 2001; 270: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Parakati R. DiMario J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9278-9285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Negative transcriptional regulators control FGFR1 promoter activity as FGFR1 gene expression declines during myogenic differentiation. We recently identified E2F4 as a negative regulator of FGFR1 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells (6Parakati R. DiMario J.X. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Its repressor activity was mediated by E2F4 binding to a proximal cis-element at –65 bp. However, E2F4 was present in both myoblast and muscle fiber nuclear extracts and bound to the E2F site. Therefore, the mechanism of E2F4-mediated repression of FGFR1 promoter activity in a cell and developmentally regulated manner could not be explained by E2F4-mediated repression alone.Members of the E2F family of transcriptional regulators functionally interact with the pocket protein transcription factors, p107, p130, and pRb. The nature of these interactions defines the transcriptional regulatory complexes as activators or repressors. These complexes regulate expression of a variety of genes, many of which are associated with cell cycle regulation (7Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 specifically interact with pRb and not p107 or p130 in vivo (8Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A.

In contrast, E2F4 associates with pRb, p107, and p130 and comprises the majority of E2F-pocket protein complexes in vivo (12Beijersbergen R.L. Kerkhoven R.M. Zhu L. Carlee L. Voorhoeve P.M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Primary embryonic mouse fibroblasts that lack E2F4 and -5 or their associated pocket proteins are defective in their ability to exit the cell cycle (14Bruce J.L. Hurford Jr., R.K. Classon M. Koh J. Dyson N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Repressive E2F-pocket protein complexes are also required for normal development in vivo. Mice lacking E2F4 or -5 display developmental defects resulting in neonatal lethality (15Rempel R.E. Saenz-Robles M.T. Storms R. Morham S. Ishida S. Engel A. Jakoi L. Melhem M.F. Pipas J.M. Smith C.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1287-1298PubMed Google Scholar). Proliferating human fibroblasts have high levels of p107 and E2F4-p107 complexes and very low levels of p130 (18Ikeda M. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Kastner A. Espanel X. Brun G. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 857-867PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of p107 decline as cells exit the cell cycle, whereas p130 increases until p130-E2F4 complexes predominate (21Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). p107 and p130 also interact with other cell cycle-associated proteins. In muscle fibers, p107 and p130 associate with cyclin D3, levels of which increase during myogenesis (20Kiess M. Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1287-1298PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of these multimeric complexes has been suggested to play a role in control of cyclinE-cdk2 activity in differentiated cells and prevent cell cycle reentry (7Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar).Pocket proteins regulate gene expression via different E2F-mediated mechanisms. p107 and p130 directly bind E2Fs and modulate their transcriptional activity (20Kiess M. Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1287-1298PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shin E.K. Shin A. Paulding C. Schaffhausen B. Yee A.S. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1997; 3: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). p107 and p130 also recruit additional transcription factors to promoters containing E2F sites. For example, pRb and p130 interact directly with histone deacetylase (HDAC1) leading to local chromatin remodeling (25Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 26Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Sp1 has been reported to interact directly with p107, pRb, and E2F1–3 (28Datta P.K. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Chang Y.-C. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell.

However, E2F4 lacks an Sp1 binding domain and therefore does not interact directly with Sp1 (30Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Sp1 may contribute to E2F4-based transcriptional complexes via interaction with pocket protein co-regulators.We demonstrated in this study that pocket protein family members p107 and p130 regulate E2F4-mediated repression of FGFR1 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Transient transfections in proliferating myoblasts and electromobility shift assays indicated that these proteins form functional complexes with E2F4 and repress FGFR1 gene promoter activity. We further demonstrate that in proliferating myoblasts, Sp1 interacts with p107 and masks the transcriptional repressor activity of the E2F4-p107 complex at the E2F site located in the proximal promoter region of the FGFR1 gene. These findings provide a novel mechanism for developmentally regulated expression of the FGFR1 gene during skeletal myogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid DNA Constructs—The plasmid m23/m42/m54FGFR1 containing mutations of three Sp1 sites in the proximal promoter region was described previously (5Parakati R. DiMario J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9278-9285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutation of the E2F site in the above plasmid was made by using the QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (6Parakati R. DiMario J.X. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with the following forward primer and its antisense oligonucleotide as a reverse primer 5′-GGTTCCCATGCAGCTATCATACAGGGGGTTAACCTGCAC-3′. The base substitutions are underlined. Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid DNA was designated as m23/m42/m54/m65FGFR1. The new truncated promoter versions of plasmid m23/m42/m54FGFR1 and m23/m42/m54/m65FGFR1 were prepared by deletion of a distal 2.2-kb SacI fragment and ligation to generate the plasmids mSp11058FGFR1 and mE2F/Sp11058FGFR1, respectively. The truncated plasmid 1058FGFR1 containing wild-type Sp1 and E2F promoter sequences was described previously (4Patel S.G. DiMario J.X. Gene. 2001; 270: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and Reporter Assays—Fetal chick myoblasts (embryonic day 13) were isolated from leg muscles and incubated in collagen coated dishes as described previously (33DiMario J.X. Stockdale F.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34O'Neill M.C. Stockdale F.E. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in FM medium (15% horse serum (Hyclone Labs), 5% chick embryo extract, 1.32 mm CaCl2, in F-10 base medium (Invitrogen)) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Medium was replaced every other day. Myotube cultures were treated with 10 μg/ml β-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride as described previously (35Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene. 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The plasmid 3284FGFR1CAT containing the full-length wild-type FGFR1 promoter was described previously (35Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene. 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/6-cm dish in FM medium and transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Parakati R. DiMario J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9278-9285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For all transfections, 1.5 or 3 μg of 3284FGFR1CAT plasmid and 1 μg of pRSVβGAL plasmid were kept constant. Increasing amounts of p107 or p130 expression plasmids, pCMVp107 and pCMVp130 encoding human cMyc-tagged p107 and hemagglutinin (HA) tagged p130, respectively, and vector DNA alone were added to bring total DNA to 8 μg. Some cultures were transfected with 1.5 μg of pCMVTAG (Stratagene). Transfected cells were harvested after 24 h and 10 days in culture and suspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Cells were lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing, and the CAT assays were performed as described previously (35Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene. 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Resulting thin layer chromatography plates were then cut and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. β-Galactosidase activities were used to normalize transfection efficiencies (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The CAT activities from expression of wild-type 3284FGFR1CAT co-transfected with increasing amounts of pCMVp107 and pCMVp130 were expressed as percentage activities relative to FGFR1 promoter activity in the absence of exogenous p107 or p130.For transfection of SL2 cells, cells were grown in Drosophila melanogaster SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine plus 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 25 °C without CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/6-cm dish on the day before transfection. Cells were transfected in D. melanogaster SFM medium without antibiotics using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each plate received various amounts of pCMVp107 and pCMVp130 expression plasmids, 1 μg of pRSVβGAL, 750 ng of Sp1 expression plasmid (pPacSp1), 1.5 or 3 μgof promoter-CAT reporter plasmid as well as pKS BlueScript (Stratagene) DNA to bring the total DNA up to 8 μg per plate. After transfection, cells were maintained in growth medium. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and CAT assays were performed (35Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene. 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For all transfection assays, four to five independent experiments were performed.Immunocytochemistry—Rabbit anti-E2F4, p107, p130, Sp1, E47, Gαq, and HA primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Mouse anti-pRb was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-cMyc and β-actin antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen and Abcam, respectively. DAPI was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Vector Laboratories, Inc.Myogenic cultures were immunostained 24 h or 10 days after plating. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min. Cultures were washed as above and incubated for 1 h with blocking solution (BS) containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween in PBS. Polyclonal anti-rabbit E2F4, p130, p107, and Sp1 antibodies and pRb monoclonal antibody were diluted 1:700 in BS. Cultures were incubated in primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and washed as above. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were diluted 1:100 in BS and added to the cultures for 1 h. DAPI at a concentration of 1.2 μm in PBS was added to the cultures for 10 min at room temperature and washed five times with PBS. Two drops of 2.5% diazabicyclooctane in glycerol/PBS (9:1) and coverslips were applied, and the cells were viewed with fluorescence microscopy.Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—Fractionation of cultured cells was performed as described previously (6Parakati R. DiMario J.X. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins (50 μg) were resolved in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C in BS containing 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween. Thereafter, the blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal p107, p130, Sp1, E47, cMyc, or HA antibody and mouse monoclonal pRb antibody, diluted 1:1000 in BS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed five to six times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and the immunocomplexes were detected using the Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and x-ray film.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electromobility Shift Assay— Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized (Integrated DNA Technology). The oligonucleotides (10 μg each) were boiled for 10 min in 10× kinase buffer and allowed to cool gradually to room temperature. Approximately 200 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide were 5′ end-labeled using T4 kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (MP Biomedicals). The sequence of the wild-type E2F4 binding site oligonucleotide was 5′-CATGCAGCAGCGGGACAGGGGGCTG-3, and the mutated E2F4 binding site oligonucleotide was 5′-CCATGCAGCTATCATACAGGGGGCTG-3′. Base substitutions are underlined. The –23 Sp1 oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-GACTCTCTTTCTCCCCTCCACAGCTC-3′, and the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′.Nuclear extract proteins (12 μg) were added to a 20-μl binding reaction containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2 μg of poly dIdC (Amersham Biosciences), 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. For supershifts, 2 μg of the antibody was added to the reaction mixture. Labeled probe (70,000 cpm in 1 μl) was added and further incubated for 25 min at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels with 1× Tris-borate/EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight.Transient Electromobility Shift Assay—Transfections of D. melanogaster SL2 cells were performed as described above using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). Each plate received various combinations of transcription factor expression constructs. One set of plates received 1 μgof Sp1 expression plasmid (pPacSp1), 3 μg of E2F4 expression plasmid (pCMVE2F4), and 3 μg of p107 expression plasmid (pCMVp107). The other set received only 1 μg of pPacSp1 and 3 μg of pCMVp107, and the total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted to 7 μg with pKS Blue-Script DNA (Stratagene). Forty-eight hours after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar), and the gel shifts were performed as described above with 3 μg of nuclear extracts.Immunoprecipitations—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described for electromobility shift assays (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar). Extracts from ∼4 × 107 cells (100 μl containing 200 μg of protein) were diluted to 1 ml with chilled NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. The nuclear lysate was precleared by incubation with 50 μl of protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C and further centrifugation. The nuclear protein was incubated with 2 μg of antibody against E2F4, pRb, p107, p130, and Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After addition of 50 μlof protein A/G agarose, the suspension was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with cold NET buffer, and resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. After the suspension was heated to 95 °C for 10 min, 20-μl samples were resolved in denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed for the presence of specific proteins by immunodetection as described above.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—We performed chromatin immunoprecipitations using a modification of previously published methods (39Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 40Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% directly to the cell culture media of proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes (4 × 107 cells). Fixation proceeded at room temperature for 10 min and was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and harvested in PBS containing 10% horse serum. Cells were collected by centrifugation and rinsed in cold PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in swelling buffer (10 mm potassium acetate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 20 min, and then processed on a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were collected by microcentrifugation and then resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Before sonication, 0.1 g of glass beads (212- to 300-μm diameter; Sigma) was added to each sample. The samples were sonicated on ice with an Ultra sonicator at setting 3 for four 20-s pulses to an average length of 0.5 to 1.0 kb and then microcentrifuged.Chromatin was pre-cleared with a mixture of protein A and protein G Sepharose (blocked previously with 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 4 h two times. Precleared chromatin was equally divided and was separately incubated with 4 μg of anti-E2F4, anti-p107, anti-p130, anti-Sp1, and Gαq antibodies, or no antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation, washing, and elution of immune complexes were carried out as described previously (41Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Before the first wash, 20% of the supernatant from the reaction with no primary antibody for each sample (myoblasts and myotubes) was saved as total input chromatin and was processed with the eluted immunoprecipitates beginning at the cross-link reversal step. Cross-links were reversed by the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm, and RNA was removed by the addition of 10 μg of RNase A per sample followed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 to 5 h. The samples were then ethanol precipitated. The samples were resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, 25 μlof5× proteinase K buffer (1.25% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 25 mm EDTA), and 10 μg of proteinase K (Sigma) and incubated at 45 °C for 2 h. Samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The pellets were collected by microcentrifugation, resuspended in 30 μl of water, and analyzed by PCR.PCR mixtures contained 2 μl of immunoprecipitate or 2 μl of a 1:200 dilution of the total sample, 50 ng of each primer, 25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dNTP mix, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase in a total volume of 100 μl. After 25 cycles of amplification, the PCR products were run in 1% agarose gels and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR primers used to amplify the –321 to +9 region were: 5′ CTGTTTTCAGTGCCAACT 3′ (forward primer, –321 to –302) and 5′ CATGGGGCCCCGTCGGCCGCTG 3′ (reverse primer, +9 to –13). The primers used to amplify the –1950 to –1788 region were: 5′ CCGCGTGAACAAGTGCTTCTTTG 3′ (forward primer, –1950 to –1927) and 5′ GGGAAAGGGTTCATTGGGAAAC 3′ (reverse primer, –1788 to –1809).For transient chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (42Lavrrar J.L. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46343-46349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), fetal chick myoblasts (embryonic day 13) were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/10 cm and were transfected with 1.5 μg of the 1058FGFR1 wild-type promoter construct and its mutant derivatives by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Parakati R. DiMario J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9278-9285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation, the cells were cross-linked with the use of formaldehyde and harvested, and chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. The resulting DNA was analyzed by PCR reactions with a forward primer (–321 to +9 bp) common to all constructs and a reverse primer to the pCAT3Basic (Promega) plasmid backbone (5′-GATATATCAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG-3′) at +351 to +325 bp.RESULTSCellular Localization of Pocket Proteins in Chicken Muscle Cells—We have recently shown that E2F4, present in the nuclei of both myoblasts and myotubes, acts as a negative regulator of FGFR1 gene expression (6Parakati R. DiMario J.X. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To identify potential E2F4 binding partners within nuclei, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of pocket proteins in undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes by immunocytochemistry. p107, p130, and pRb proteins were localized to nuclei of both myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescent localization of these proteins in the nuclei of myoblasts and myotubes colocalized with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence.Western blot analysis was carried out using fractionated cell lysates of both myoblasts and myotubes to validate the immunostaining results (Fig. 2). p107, p130, and pRb proteins were detected in the nuclear extra"
https://openalex.org/W2069009733,"Mammalian lysyl oxidase (LOX) is essential for the catalysis of lysyl-derived cross-links in fibrillar collagens and elastin in the extracellular matrix and has also been implicated in cell motility, differentiation, and tumor cell invasion. The active LOX has been shown to translocate to the nuclei of smooth muscle cells and regulate chromatin structure and transcription. It is difficult to interpret the role of the LOX protein as it is co-expressed with other members of the LOX amine oxidase family in most mammalian cells. To investigate the function of the LOX proteins, we have characterized the Drosophila lysyl oxidases Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2. We present the gene, domain structure, and expression pattern of Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2 during development. In early development, only Dmloxl-1 was expressed, which allowed functional studies. We have expressed Dmloxl-1 in S2 cells and determined that it is a catalytically active enzyme, inhibited by β-amino-proprionitrile (BAPN), a specific LOX inhibitor. We localized DmLOXL-1 in the nuclei in embryos and in adult salivary gland cells in the nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell surface, using immunostaining and a DmLOXL-1 antibody. To address the biological function of Dmloxl-1, we raised larvae under BAPN inhibitory conditions and over-expressed Dmloxl-1 in transgenic Drosophila. DmLOXL-1 inhibition resulted in developmental delay and a shift in sex ratio; over-expression in the wm4 variegating strain increased drosopterin production, demonstrating euchromatinization. Our previous data on the transcriptional down-regulation of seven ribosomal genes and the glue gene under inhibitory conditions and the current results collectively support a nuclear role for Dmloxl-1 in euchromatinization and gene regulation. Mammalian lysyl oxidase (LOX) is essential for the catalysis of lysyl-derived cross-links in fibrillar collagens and elastin in the extracellular matrix and has also been implicated in cell motility, differentiation, and tumor cell invasion. The active LOX has been shown to translocate to the nuclei of smooth muscle cells and regulate chromatin structure and transcription. It is difficult to interpret the role of the LOX protein as it is co-expressed with other members of the LOX amine oxidase family in most mammalian cells. To investigate the function of the LOX proteins, we have characterized the Drosophila lysyl oxidases Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2. We present the gene, domain structure, and expression pattern of Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2 during development. In early development, only Dmloxl-1 was expressed, which allowed functional studies. We have expressed Dmloxl-1 in S2 cells and determined that it is a catalytically active enzyme, inhibited by β-amino-proprionitrile (BAPN), a specific LOX inhibitor. We localized DmLOXL-1 in the nuclei in embryos and in adult salivary gland cells in the nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell surface, using immunostaining and a DmLOXL-1 antibody. To address the biological function of Dmloxl-1, we raised larvae under BAPN inhibitory conditions and over-expressed Dmloxl-1 in transgenic Drosophila. DmLOXL-1 inhibition resulted in developmental delay and a shift in sex ratio; over-expression in the wm4 variegating strain increased drosopterin production, demonstrating euchromatinization. Our previous data on the transcriptional down-regulation of seven ribosomal genes and the glue gene under inhibitory conditions and the current results collectively support a nuclear role for Dmloxl-1 in euchromatinization and gene regulation.

In addition to its essential role in the catalysis of lysyl-derived cross-links in fibrillar collagens and elastin, LOX has been implicated in cellular processes, including motility, differentiation, ras-transformed reversion, and tumor cell invasion. The active extracellular LOX has been shown to translocate to the nuclei of smooth muscle cells (3Li W. Nellaiappan K. Strassmaier T. Graham L. Thomas K.M. Kagan H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

LOX, LOXL, and LOXL4 have been reported as active amine oxidases inhibited by BAPN, using collagen, elastin, and synthetic substrates (16Nagan N. Callery P.S. Kagan H.M. Front.

In addition, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 have four Group A SRCR domains in their conserved N-terminal region. SRCR domains are evolutionarily conserved with either six (Group A) or eight (Group B) cysteine residues. SRCR domains are candidates for protein interactions, and although they have been described in a large variety of proteins, including molecules participating in immune signaling processes, their function is mostly unknown (19Sarrias M.R. Gronlund J. Padilla O. Madsen J. Holmskov U. Lozano F. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).BAPN, a well known irreversible inhibitor of the LOX enzyme, is routinely used to evaluate the amine oxidase activity of LOX in assays using cell and tissue extracts (2Kagan H.M.

Kagan H.M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that BAPN inhibition of LOX results in alterations in a range of processes including cell proliferation (22Li W. Nugent M.A. Zhao Y. Chau A.N. Li S.J. Chou I.N. Liu G.

However, the results of these experiments are increasingly difficult to interpret because the LOX-like amine oxidases, also inhibited by BAPN, are co-expressed with LOX in many cells and tissues (1Csiszar K.

The LOX null mice demonstrate cardiovascular dysfunction, aortic aneurysms and ruptured diaphragms, and die soon after birth (36Maki J.M. Rasanen J. Tikkanen H. Sormunen R. Makikallio K.

These phenotypes confirmed an essential role of LOX but, apart from the consequence of the elastin and collagen cross-linking deficiencies, did not reveal other functions. Several cellular studies were initiated to uncover the intracellular function of LOX in transformation and tumor cell invasion. In these experiments, LOX was inhibited by antisense LOX and over-expressed as the full-length 50-kDa and the active 32-kDa forms (6Giampuzzi M. Oleggini R. Di Donato A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Contente S. Kenyon K. Sriraman P. Subramanyan S. Friedman R.M. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4478-4483PubMed Google Scholar). The results confirmed significant roles in cell phenotype control; however, the molecular mechanisms influenced by LOX remained largely unclear.In search of an animal model to study the individual roles of LOXs, we have identified two lysyl oxidase genes, Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2, in Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike the mammalian LOXs, Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2 demonstrate a differential expression pattern. Dmloxl-1 is expressed throughout development and adulthood, whereas Dmloxl-2 is expressed only in adults. We have also demonstrated that in vivo BAPN inhibition of DmLOXL-1 reduced the steady state mRNA levels of seven ribosomal protein genes (38Molnar J. Fong K.S.K. He Q.P. Hayashi K. Kim Y. Fong S.F.T. Fogelgren B. Szauter K.M. Mink M. Csiszar K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These results supported the nuclear role of LOX previously observed in NIH 3T3 cells and the hypothesis regarding the potential role of LOX in regulating overall chromatin structure and consequently transcription (7Mello M.L Contente S. Vidal B.C. Planding W. Schenk U. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Changes in chromatin organization can be monitored in Drosophila using heterochromatin-induced gene silencing in the well established position effect variegation (PEV) model. In the wm4 strain, the w gene, responsible for red eye color, is placed close to the heterochromatin boundary as a result of chromosomal inversion. In the variegating eye phenotype of the wm4 strain, the expanding heterochromatin silences the clonally initiated expression of the w gene in some cells, resulting in more white eye cells. In contrast, euchromatinization results in more red eye cells (39Schotta G. Ebert A. Dorn R. Reuter G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Changes in heterochromatinization can be monitored by the ratio of red and white eye cells and quantified by the concentration of drosopterin (40Real M.D. Ferre J. Mensua J.L. Drosoph. Inf. Serv. 1985; 61: 198-199Google Scholar).In this study, we describe the structure and expression of the Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2 genes, characterize DmLOXL-1 as a BAPN-inhibited, catalytically active amine oxidase, demonstrate nuclear localization of DmLOXL-1 using immunohistochemistry, test the biological function of DmLOXL-1 during development using in vivo inhibitory conditions and a transgenic Drosophila strain to over-express Dmloxl-1, and monitor changes in chromatin structure induced by increased DmLOXL-1 expression in transgenic flies.MATERIALS AND METHODSDmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2 cDNAs and Chromosomal Mapping—The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project expressed sequence tag (EST) data base was searched by the TBLASTX program using the conserved C-terminal end of the human LOX cDNA sequence M94054 (GenBank™ accession number M94054) as a query. Two different but homologous Drosophila EST sequences, GH05569 (GenBank™ accession number BT001394) and LP04931 (GenBank™ accession number AI260913), were identified and fully sequenced using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI Prism 310. For chromosomal localization of the corresponding genes, the cDNA inserts were isolated from the recombinant clones and labeled with digoxigenin, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). The probes were hybridized overnight to polytene chromosome squashes prepared from third-instar larvae salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster as described previously (41Ashburner M. Drosophila, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 28-29Google Scholar). The bound probe was visualized with anti-digoxigenin coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) and diaminobenzidine (Sigma) to identify the chromosomal location of both genes.Primer Extension—The Dmloxl-1-specific oligonucleotide 5′-AACTTGGCTGAGAACCACA-3′ and the Dmloxl-2-specific oligonucleotide 5′-CAGGACCTCAATGTTGCCT-3′ were radiolabeled at their 5′ termini by polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP and used in primer extension experiments to determine the 5′ end of the transcripts (42Mink M. Fogelgren B. Olszewski K. Maroy P. Csiszar K. Genomics. 2001; 74: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A cDNA synthesis kit was utilized to prepare extension products as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The sizes of the extended DNA products were determined on a 6% sequencing gel by comparison with the nucleotide sequence of pUC plasmid DNA generated by the m13 primer.Developmental Northern Analysis—Synchronized cultures of the Drosophila Canton-S strain were established. Adult heads, adult male bodies, and adult female bodies were collected for RNA extraction using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of 10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed in a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). 32P-Radiolabeled cDNA inserts of the EST clones GH05569 and LP04931 and rp49, a ribosomal standard, were used as probes for Northern analysis.PCR Expression Profiling of Dmloxl-1 and Dmloxl-2—First strand cDNA representing total mRNA for a given developmental stage in Drosophila was obtained from OriGene Technologies, Inc. The amount of template per PCR reaction was 1 ng. The panel of templates was normalized by OriGene for equivalent amounts of rp49 cDNA. The PCR primer pairs used were: forward, 5′-GACGCTTACGAGATCCGAAGGAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCTTAAACCAAAGCGGCTTTCG-3′ for Dmloxl-1; and forward, 5′-GTGTGGCAACGAGGCGTATC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTGGCAGTTTTGCACTCTGGC-3′ for Dmloxl-2. Standard PCR reactions were prepared, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), Taq buffer (Promega), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 80 μm each dNTP, 1.25 pmol of each primer, and 1 ng of the template in 25-μl reactions, using 5 min at 94 °C initial denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C denaturation, 1 min at 60 °C annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C elongation followed by 5 min at 72 °C terminal extension. The reaction products were displayed on 1.25% agarose gels with 0.5 μg/ml EtBr in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer and photographed.Immunohistochemical Detection of DmLOXL-1 in Embryos and Salivary Glands—Fresh 0–6-h Canton-S embryos were collected, dechorionated in 50% bleach, and fixed in 1:4 dilution of freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde:n-heptane for 20 min (43Roberts D.B. 2nd Ed. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1998: 219-222Google Scholar). The embryos were rehydrated and blocked for 30 min with 10% normal goat serum (Molecular Probes Inc.) and then incubated with 1:1000 lamin Dm0 antibody and either pre-adsorbed 1:300 DmLOXL-1 antibody or 1:300 preimmune serum at 4 °C overnight. The polyclonal DmLOXL-1 antibody was generated using full-length purified recombinant DmLOXL-1 in rabbits at the Montana State University Animal Resource Center. The specificity of the antibody was tested using 6 m urea extracts of pupae with recombinant DmLOXL-1 as a positive control. The monoclonal lamin Dm0 antibody, ADL67, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (44Stuurman N. Sasse B. Fisher P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Riemer D. Stuurman N. Berrios M. Hunter C. Fisher P.A. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3189-3198PubMed Google Scholar, 46Klapper M. Exner K. Kempf A. Gehrig C. Stuurman N. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2519-2532PubMed Google Scholar). After six washes in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, the samples were incubated with secondary antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes Inc.) Embryos were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (H-1200, Vector Laboratories Inc.) and visualized on a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope using a ×100 oil immersion objective. Polytene chromosome squashes were prepared from third-instar larvae salivary glands as described previously (47Paro R. Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 131-140Google Scholar). DmLOXL-1 antibody and preimmune serum were used in 1:250 dilutions. RNA polymerase II monoclonal antibody (rabbit) (48Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was used in 1:500 dilution. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes Inc.) was diluted at 1:300 to detect RNA polymerase II staining, and goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes Inc.) diluted at 1:300 was used to visualize DmLOXL-1 staining. Fluorescence of the tissue specimens was photographed using the appropriate filters.Activity Measurement of Recombinant DmLOXL-1—The coding sequence for Dmloxl-1, using the cDNA clone LP49319 (Research Genetics), was amplified without the signal sequence by using primer adaptors and Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a PCR reaction containing LP49319 cDNA as template. The product was trimmed by appropriate restriction enzymes, then inserted into a vector containing a metalothionein promoter and the coding sequence for the signal sequence of BiP, and fused at the 3′ end to a stop codon linked to a transcription terminator (pMT/BiP/V5-His, Invitrogen). The constructs were amplified in Escherichia coli, and the inserts were sequence-verified.The expression construct was co-precipitated with a plasmid coding for hygromycin resistance (pHygro, Invitrogen) using calcium phosphate. Drosophila S2 cells in complete medium were exposed to the precipitate for 24 h. The cells were moved to fresh complete medium with 500 μg/ml hygromycin, cultured until resistant cells began to grow, and then were progressively transferred into serum-free medium (Excell-420, JRH Biosciences, Inc.) containing hygromycin. For expression, recombinant cells were grown to 5 × 106 cells/ml in shake flasks at room temperature, 0.5 mm copper sulfate was added, and the cells were cultured for 2 more days.Cells were separated from the culture medium by low speed centrifugation. The medium was diluted with an equal volume of water and 120 g/liter urea; 2 ml/liter Cibacron blue bound to agarose was added, and the suspension was stirred for 60 min at room temperature. Cibacron blue bound to agarose with bound Dmloxl-1 was centrifuged out of the mixture, resuspended in 2 m urea in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl), transferred to a column, washed with TBS-2 m urea and Dmloxl-1, and eluted with TBS-6 m urea. The copper content of Dmloxl-1 was measured by atomic absorption chromatography. Standards were dissolved in copper sulfate in TBS-2 m urea, and the same buffer was used for the samples. Five readings of each sample were taken and averaged for comparison with the standard curve. The copper content was determined after removal of extraneous copper from samples by dialysis against EDTA. Recombinant Dmloxl-1 in TBS-6 m urea was dialyzed sequentially at 4 °C against TBS-2 m urea containing 10 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl for 1 day, 0.5 mm CuSO4 for 2–4 days, and 10 mm EDTA for 1 day; a final dialysis was performed against TBS-2 m urea for 1 day to remove EDTA. The initial rate of amine oxidation was measured as the rate of hydrogen peroxide formation. Amplex Red (Molecular Probes) was used as the reductant and indicator with horseradish peroxidase to measure the production of hydrogen peroxide (49Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of oxidized Amplex Red was measured by a Tecan plate reader. 100 μl of TBS containing Amplex Red, horseradish peroxidase, and substrate was placed in the well of a microplate. The final substrate concentration of recombinant tropoelastin was 0.5 mg/ml. Reactions were started by adding 100 μl of TBS containing 0.5 μg of Dmloxl-1 for a total concentration of 67.5 nm, with 40 mm urea with or without BAPN at 30 °C. Excitation was at 560 nm, and emission was read at 590 nm. Readings were taken every 30 s for 300 s.DmLOXL-1 Inhibition in Vivo by BAPN—BAPN was dissolved in standard Drosophila food in a series of concentrations from 0.05 to 10 mm (20Tang S.S. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4331-4338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synchronized 0–1 h wild-type Canton-S embryos were transferred to the medium, and development was followed by microscopic observation of the population.Dmloxl-1 Transgenic Flies and Development of a Homozygous Strain—The cDNA insert of the LP04931 EST containing the full coding region of the Dmloxl-1 gene was excised with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the SalI-EcoRI linearized P-element derivative pP{hsneo} vector (50Steller H. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct was injected into white (w–) embryos. Male progeny were crossed pairwise with Oregon-R virgins. Emerging larvae were transferred to media containing 10 mm neomycin and kept permanently at 29 °C to induce the expression of the construct by the heat shock promoter. All of the Drosophila strains used in these experiments were from the collection of the Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, University of Szeged, Hungary.The transgenic virgins were crossed pairwise with a multibalanced strain, pP{hsneoDmloxl−1}−×CyBcGla;TM3GFPSb(Eq. 1) Male offspring with the Cy;Sb phenotype were collected and crossed with virgins from the same multibalanced strain. The hatched larvae were raised as above. To follow the balancer cross-links, the phenotype of the dead flies was examined daily. The surviving flies were either Gla or Cy.To generate pP{hsneoDmloxl-1}/pP{hsneoDmloxl-1} homozygotes, Cy or Gla flies from the above cross that survived the neomycin selection were crossed pairwise, and homozygotes emerged without a second chromosomal balancer. The viability of homozygous transgenic flies and the loss of the second chromosome balancer indicated that the integration had not occurred within an essential locus.Real-time PCR Analysis of Dmloxl-1 Expression in Dmloxl-1/Dmloxl-1 Transgenic Drosophila—Adult males and females of Dmloxl-1/Dmloxl-1 transgenic, heat-shocked (29 °C) non-transgenic, and heat-shocked Dmloxl-1/Dmloxl-1 transgenic animals were collected for RNA extraction using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After DNase treatment, 1 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, using Superscript II (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers. RNase treatment (37 °C, 20 min) followed the first strand synthesis. The real-time PCR was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Inc.). The PCR primer pairs used were: Dmloxl-1 forward primer, 5′-GCCTGATGGACAGTGAATGCC-3′, and reverse primer, CGCCAGTGTAGTCAAGAAGGC; rp49 control forward primer, 5′-TCCTACCAGCTTCAAGATCAC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTGTATTCCGACCACGTTACA-3′. Standard reactions were performed in triplicate in 25-μl volumes using 1 μl of cDNA and DyNAmo master mix (Finnzymes Oy) containing an optimized PCR buffer with Tbr DNA polymerase, SYBR Green I fluorescent dye, 5 mm MgCl2, and dNTP. Initial denaturation occurred at 95 °C for 5 min, and each cycle consisted of a 95 °C 10-s denaturation, 60 °C 30-s annealing, and 72 °C 30-s elongation. Fluorescence was measured at the end of every extension step at 83 °C for 39 cycles. Product-specific amplification was confirmed by melting curve analysis at the end of the thermocycle profile. The threshold cycle line was established by the Opticon Monitor 2 software (MJ Research, Inc.) at the linear portion of the log scale curve, and the ratio of Dmloxl-1 to rp49 was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method (51Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (119422) Google Scholar). Melting curves were obtained at a range from 65 to 92 °C at 0.2 °C steps to ensure the quality of the reactions. Statistical significance was calculated using an unpaired t test.Drosopterin Quantitation—The red eye pigment drosopterin was extracted as described previously (40Real M.D. Ferre J. Mensua J.L.

https://openalex.org/W1993525652,"We have reported that the chemoattractant, fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP), induces the activation of NF-κB in human peripheral blood monocytes and that this requires the activity of small GTPase, RhoA (Huang, S., Chen, L.-Y., Zuraw, B. L., Ye, R. D., and Pan, Z. K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 40977-40981). Here we showed that the novel protein kinase C isozyme, PKCϵ, associates functionally with RhoA in fMLP-stimulated monocytes and that PKCϵ acted as a signaling component downstream of the GTPase RhoA during fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB. Stimulation of monocytes with fMLP resulted in activation of both PKCϵ and NF-κB. This latter activation was largely blocked by specific inhibitors of PKCϵ by transient expression of a dominant-negative form of PKCϵ and by PKCϵ-specific short interfering RNA. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB utilizes a signaling pathway, which requires activity of PKCϵ, and that PKCϵ acts as a signaling component downstream of RhoA in cytokine gene transcription stimulated by a chemoattractant. The specificity of this response suggests an important role for the Rho GTPase-PKCϵ-NF-κB pathway in host defense and represents a novel and potentially important mechanism through which fMLP not only attracts leukocytes but may also contribute directly to inflammation. We have reported that the chemoattractant, fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP), induces the activation of NF-κB in human peripheral blood monocytes and that this requires the activity of small GTPase, RhoA (Huang, S., Chen, L.-Y., Zuraw, B.

It binds to seven transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors on monocytes and neutrophils and induces a variety of functional responses that are associated with inflammation. The inflammatory response produced by infecting bacteria involves a leukocyte gene expression that is tightly regulated by the activities of transcription factors such as NF-κB, NF-IL-6, and AP-1. NF-κB is of considerable importance in immune cell function because of its ability to activate the transcription of many proinflammatory immediate early genes, and we have shown that it can be activated by chemoattractants such as fMLP (1Pan Z.

Indeed, the fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB appears essential for proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in human peripheral blood monocytes (5Pan Z.K. Chen L-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) represents a family of serine/threonine kinases mediating intracellular signaling events (6Mellor H.

PKC isoforms have been classified into three groups on the basis of their molecular structure and activation mechanisms: 1) conventional PKCs (cPKCα, βI, βII, and γ), 2) novel PKCs (nPKCδ, ϵ, μ, θ, and η), and 3) atypical PKCs (aPKCζ, and λ/ι). A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated a role for PKCs in the regulation of host defense and inflammation (8Ivaska J. Bosca L. Parker P.J. Nat.

However, the contribution of each PKC isoform to the regulation of monocyte activation has not yet been elucidated. We have demonstrated that fMLP stimulates increased activity in RhoA, a small GTPase (15Huang S. Chen L-Y. Zuraw B.L. Ye R.D. Pan Z.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40977-40981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and that this activity in human peripheral blood monocytes is mediated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc (16Chen L-Y. Zuraw B.L. Ye R.D. Pan Z.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7208-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of PKC in the fMLP-stimulated signaling events that lead to the activation of NF-κB. We report that exposure of monocytes to fMLP causes increased activity of an nPKC isoform, PKCϵ, and that inhibition of PKCϵ activity blocks fMLP-stimulated activation of NF-κB. We also report that RhoA associates specifically with the PKCϵ in fMLP-stimulated monocytes and that the fMLP-induced PKCϵ activity is blocked by an inhibitor of RhoA. The results demonstrate that PKCϵ is a novel signal transducer for RhoA-mediated activation of NF-κB leading to proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with bacterial products. Reagents—fMLP and 1,25(OH)2D3 were obtained from Sigma. Staurosporine, Gö 6976, and PKCϵ inhibitor peptide were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human TNFα was obtained from R & D Systems Inc (Minneapolis, MN). The cDNAs encoding the constitutively active mutant of PKCϵ and the dominant-negative mutants of PKCϵ and PKCα were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEFneo. The dominant-negative IKKβ mutant and the recombinant Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase exoenzyme were obtained as described previously (17Chen L-Y. Zuraw B.L. Liu F.-T. Huang S. Pan Z.K. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody against phospho-PKCϵ and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against RhoA, PKCϵ, and PKCα were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal antibody against phospho-PKCα/β was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Preparation of Monocytes from Peripheral Blood—Heparinized human peripheral blood from healthy donors was fractionated on Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradients. Mononuclear cells and neutrophils were obtained by centrifugation through a 55/74% discontinuous Percoll gradient. Monocytes were further separated from this population using gelatin/plasma-coated flasks (1Pan Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Monocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm; Irvine Scientific). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from human peripheral blood monocytes using the method of Dignam et al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 2.5 μg of the nuclear extract as described previously (2Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J-M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14928-14934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Monocyte lysates were incubated with an appropriate amount of antibody for 3 h and then precipitated following absorption onto protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitates were washed three times, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Filter strips were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, followed by addition of peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:10,000 dilution, 30 min) and then analyzed for peroxidase using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Science). Detection of Phosphorylated PKCs—Monocytes were incubated in medium ± fMLP then lysed in Laemmli buffer. Equal volumes of the lysates from each condition were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 8% gels and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were initially probed with a polyclonal anti-phospho PKC antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) that at a dilution of 1:2000 detects activated forms of cPKCα/β. A 1:200 dilution of anti-PKCϵ antibody was used at the same time to detect the nPKCϵ isoform. Membranes then were stripped and incubated with a murine anti-PKCα or murine anti-PKCϵ mAb. Transfection of Cells with PKC-specific siRNA and Luciferase Activity Assay—Short interfering RNA was used to reduce PKC levels in THP1 cells. 21-mer siRNA sequences with a dTdT-3′ overhang (Qiagen-Xeragon, Germantown, MD) specific for PKCα (5′-AAGCACAAGTTCAAAATCCAC-3′) or PKCϵ (5′-AAGCCCCTAAAGACAATGAAG-3′) were purchased. THP1 cells were co-transfected with either a PKCα-siRNA or a PKCϵ-siRNA together with the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-LUC). The reporter construct NF-κB-LUC was generated as described (19Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech) was used as a control for transfection efficiency, and this was monitored via the expression of β-galactosidase. THP1 cells were differentiated by incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 days (20Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and then transiently transfected with plasmids using diethyl aminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran. The transfected cells were cultivated for 48 h before a 6-h incubation in medium ± 100 nm fMLP. Luciferase activity was determined by using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). fMLP-induced NF-κB Activation Is Blocked by a PKC Inhibitor—To assess the role of PKC in fMLP-induced NF-κB activation, we examined the consequences of preincubating cells with specific PKC inhibitors. Staurosporine is a specifically inhibitor of PKC. It inhibits cPKC and nPKC but not aPKC isozymes (21Marte B.M. Meyer T. Stabel S. Standke G.J.R. Jaken S. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 22Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar). Following pretreatment ±50 nm staurosporine for 15 min, human monocytes were stimulated with fMLP or TNFα for 60 min, and the activation of NF-κB was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In the absence of an inhibitor, the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was strongly induced by both fMLP and TNFα (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). This activation was largely prevented in those monocytes pretreated with staurosporine that were subsequently exposed to fMLP (Fig. 1A, lane 5). In contrast, the staurosporine treatment only marginally affected TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Because staurosporine inhibits both cPKC and nPKC activity, we next examined which of these was required for fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB. Although pretreatment of monocytes with Gö 6976, an inhibitor of cPKC (PKCα and -β), did not significantly inhibit NF-κB activation (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6), the pretreatment with a PKCϵ inhibitory peptide suppressed the activation of NF-κB in fMLP-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 1C, lane 5) suggesting a role for PKCϵ. In contrast, neither a PKCα/β-specific inhibitory peptide nor a nonsense control peptide had any effect (data not shown). fMLP Induces Activation of PKCϵ and PKCα/β in Human Blood Monocytes—Because inhibition of PKCϵ activity abrogated fMLP-induced NF-κB activation, we next examined whether fMLP induced PKCϵ activation, as PKCs play a key role in intracellular signal processes linked to diverse receptor types. As PKCϵ is activated through phosphorylation of a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic site (Ser-729), which increases the kinase activity up to 80-fold (23Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-34764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we were able to use an antibody that strictly recognizes Ser-729-phosphorylated PKCϵ to detect the activation of PKCϵ. Following stimulation with fMLP, monocytes were lysed, and the lysates (20 μg) were analyzed for phosphorylation of PKC by using a Western blot. Exposure to fMLP led to a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of PKCϵ that was seen within 10 min and peaked after 10-20 min (Fig. 2A). This phosphorylation was not as rapid as that that seen for the fMLP-induced phosphorylation of PKCα/β, which was largely complete within 5 min (Fig. 2B). PKCϵ but Not PKCα Is Needed for fMLP-induced Activation of NF-κB—The necessity of PKCϵ for fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB was further demonstrated by overexpressing a dominant-negative form of PKCϵ in THP1 cells. Cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding either a dominant-negative PKCα or a dominant-negative PKCϵ together with the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-LUC) and then exposed to fMLP. Dominant-negative protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-PKC antibodies (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows that expression of the dominant-negative PKCϵ mutant protein was associated with poor induction of luciferase activity promoted by NF-κB (Fig. 3A, lane 6). In contrast, the expression of a dominant-negative PKCα did not have this effect (Fig. 3A, lane 4). To further confirm the role of PKCα and PKCϵ in fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. The effect of siRNA on PKC expression was quantified by immunoblotting cells 96 h posttransfection. Although none of the PKC isoform-specific siRNA sequences affected the expression of β-tubulin, PKCα expression was reduced by PKCα-siRNA to 59.25 ± 6.18% and PKCϵ-siRNA reduced expression of PKCϵ to 67.27 ± 5.78% of the amounts found in cells transfected with control RNA (Fig. 3B). The PKC-siRNA-transfected cells were then exposed to fMLP. Here, PKCϵ-siRNA reduced NF-κB activity, whereas PKCα siRNA had no effect (Fig. 3C). These results confirmed that PKCϵ activity was required for fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB. Although fMLP exposure led to increased PKCα activity, this appeared not to be required for the activation of NF-κB. Rather, PKCα activity may be involved in the respiratory burst or chemotaxis both of which would be induced by fMLP (13Majumdar S. Kane L.H. Rossi M.W. Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Korchak H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Korchak H.M. Rossi M.W. Kilpatrick L.E. J. Biol.

PKCϵ Signals fMLP-induced Activation NF-κB Activation via IκB Kinase (IKK)β—We previously found that fMLP induced the degradation of IκBα in human blood monocytes (5Pan Z.K. Chen L-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This degradation is required for the activation NF-κB and requires IκBα to be phosphorylated by IKKβ. We therefore sought to determine the involvement of IKKβ in the fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB. THP1 cells were co-transfected with NF-κB-LUC in combination with a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant of IKKβ, which was provided by Dr. Frank Mercurio (Signal Transduction, San Diego, CA). This dominant-negative mutant largely prevented the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4A, lane 4) indicating a requirement for IKKβ in the response. We also addressed the function of IKKβ in PKCϵ-mediated activation of NF-κB. Although expression of the constitutively active form of PKCϵ induces NF-κB activity in the absence of fMLP, this NF-κB activity was not found when these cells were also co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the dominant-negative IKKβ (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Thus, it appears that PKCϵ mediates its effects via the activation of IKKβ. PKCϵ Interacts with RhoA in fMLP-stimulated Monocytes—We previously demonstrated that fMLP stimulates the activity of RhoA, a small GTPase and that this activity in monocytes is required for the activation of NF-κB induced by fMLP (15Huang S. Chen L-Y. Zuraw B.L. Ye R.D. Pan Z.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40977-40981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the functional interaction between PKCϵ and RhoA was important for this fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB. We examined whether the biological activity of the PKCϵ in human peripheral blood monocytes was based on its ability to interact with low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins and whether PKCϵ was functional when binding to RhoA GTPase in vivo. Monocytes (10 × 106) were exposed to medium ± 100 nm fMLP (37 °C, 10 min) and then lysed. Anti-RhoA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the RhoA GTPase from the lysates, and the components of the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for PKCϵ or PKCα. Only PKCϵ was detected as a co-precipitate with RhoA (Fig. 5). In control experiments, we preincubated the anti-RhoA antibody with blocking peptides before adding it to cell lysates. The blocking peptides eliminated the formation of an immunoprecipitate containing PKCϵ (Fig. 5, lanes 3). These data showed that PKCϵ binds to the RhoA GTPase. PKCϵ Acts as a Signaling Component Downstream of RhoA— The results presented above demonstrated that there was an interaction between PKCϵ and RhoA in monocytes after their exposure to fMLP. We next examined whether RhoA mediated the activation of NF-κB via a downstream effect on PKCϵ. This question was addressed by using C. botulinum C3 transferase, which is an exotoxin that inhibits the Rho GTPases (RhoA, -B, and -C) but does not inhibit Rac nor Cdc42 GTPases (26Aktories K. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Following incubation with or without 10 μg/ml recombinant C3 transferase for 16 h, human monocytes were stimulated with fMLP for 10 min, and PKCϵ activity was assessed. As shown in Fig. 6A, the PKCϵ activity was significantly inhibited by C3 transferase, indicating that PKCϵ is a signaling component that becomes activated downstream of RhoA. The relationship between RhoA activity and subsequent PKCϵ activation was further investigated using THP1 cells that had been co-transfected with expression vectors encoding a constitutively active form of RhoA (Fig. 6B, lanes 2-4) and either a dominant-negative PKCϵ (lane 3) or a dominant-negative PKCα (lane 4) together with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid. The constitutively active RhoA induced a strong luciferase activity, but this activity was inhibited by co-expression of the dominant-negative PKCϵ (Fig. 6B, lane 3), whereas co-expression of the dominant-negative PKCα had no effect (Fig. 6B, lane 4). These results confirm that RhoA activity is required for the activation of PKCϵ induced by fMLP and that PKCϵ acts as a signaling component downstream of RhoA. We previously demonstrated that fMLP stimulates small GTPase RhoA activity in monocytes, and this activity is required for the activation of NF-κB that is induced by fMLP (15Huang S. Chen L-Y. Zuraw B.L. Ye R.D. Pan Z.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40977-40981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that PKCϵ is a signaling component downstream of RhoA and mediates the fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB in human peripheral blood monocytes. We employed multiple approaches to establish the role of PKCϵ in fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB in monocytes as PKCϵ has not previously been implicated in the signaling pathway. Exposure of monocytes to fMLP stimulated a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of PKCϵ and preincubation of the monocytes with staurosporine or PKCϵ inhibitory peptide significantly inhibited the fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB. The requirement for phosphorylation of PKCϵ was then confirmed by co-transfecting THP1 cells with either plasmids encoding dominant-negative forms of PKCϵ and PKCα or short interfering RNA to reduce the expression of PKCϵ and PKCα. Because there was only partial inhibition of NF-κB activity, both after incubation with PKCϵ inhibitory peptide and by expression of dominant-negative PKCϵ, it is possible that other nPKC isoforms, such as PKCδ and PKCθ, are also involved in fMLP-induced signaling, because PKCδ and PKCθ can activate NF-κB (10Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 11Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The finding that PKCϵ was critical to the activation of NF-κB led us to address its role in fMLP-induced signaling in monocytes. Despite an apparent role of the Rho GTPases in cytokine gene expression, relatively little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways linking RhoA activation to cytokine gene transcription in leukocytes. The Rho family of small G-proteins has been shown to activate several serine/threonine kinases, which can mediate downstream effects. These appear mainly to act on the actin cytoskeleton. Naumann and colleagues (27Foryst-Ludwig A. Naumann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39779-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that p21-activating kinase 1, the immediate downstream effector of Rac1 and Cdc42, bound and activated NF-κB-inducing kinase, leading to degradation of IκB and increasing the binding of NF-κB to DNA in gastric epithelial cells infected by Helicobacter pylori. Furthermore, Frost et al. (28Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

These results suggest that p21-activating kinase 1 may play a role in the activation of NF-κB and the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression mediated by both Rac1 and Cdc42 but not by RhoA. Activated RhoA has been shown to be involved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-mediated activation of PKC in a murine T cell line and HEK 293 cells (29Flynn P. Mellor H. Casamassima A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11064-11070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have indicated the role of PKCϵ in mitogen-activate protein kinase activation and in NF-κB activation in macrophages activated by bacterial products (9Castrillo A.

Our data suggest that fMLP activates PKCϵ in human peripheral blood monocytes, and this activation provides a signal acting downstream of GTPase RhoA that mediates fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. We determined the mechanisms by which PKCϵ and its downstream effector, IκB kinase, contributed to NF-κB activity. Studies have shown that NF-κB activity is primarily regulated at the level of IκB degradation, which is accomplished through serine phosphorylation of IκB (Ser-32 and Ser-36) by IKK (32Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 33Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K-F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). We observed that expression of a dominant-negative form of IKKβ prevented the development of NF-κB activity induced both by fMLP and by the expression of a constitutively active form of PKCϵ. Although we found that IKKβ is required for PKCϵ-mediated NF-κB activation induced by fMLP, the underlying mechanism is yet to be defined. One possible mechanism is that PKCϵ may phosphorylate IKKβ directly. This suggestion is supported by the observation that PKCζ, an atypical isoform of PKC, directly phosphorylates IKKβ in vitro and physically associates with IKKβ in 293 cells (34Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to detect a physical association between PKCϵ and the IKK complexes (data not shown). An alternative explanation is that PKCϵ may indirectly activate IKK through one or more intermediate components. One such signaling intermediate might be MEKK1, which has been implicated in the T cell receptor signaling pathway whereby CD3-CD28 co-stimulation leads to the activation of NF-κB through selective activation of IKKβ (35Kempiak S.J. Hiura T.S. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3176-3187PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that fMLP stimulates the activation of PKCϵ in monocytes. Utilizing both specific inhibitors as well as transient expression of a dominant-negative PKCϵ mutant or PKCϵ siRNA, we found that the fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB required PKCϵ activity. Furthermore, we have shown that PKCϵ associates functionally with the RhoA in fMLP-stimulated monocytes and that the PKCϵ activation induced by fMLP is inhibited by a specific RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase, suggesting that RhoA likely functions upstream of PKCϵ in the signaling pathway. These findings provide evidence that fMLP-induced activation of NF-κB utilizes a signaling pathway that requires the activity of PKCϵ. The RhoA GTPase-PKCϵ-NF-κB pathway appears to play a central role in the leukocyte response to chemoattractant and is likely to be important in host defense and inflammation. We thank Drs. J. Han, F.

The beautifully preserved skull pictured on the left is from Dmanisi in the republic of Georgia, a site that has already yielded archaeological evidence for the presence of early Homo outside Africa 1.77 million years ago. The notable thing about the new find is its teeth, or rather its tooth. This individual lost all but one tooth some years before death. He or she may have eaten soft plant and animal foods that didn't require heavy chewing — or perhaps other individuals in the social group gave support beyond that offered by non-human primates. In 1632, Galileo described his experience of motion aboard a large ship1,2 and exposed in detail the invariance principle, which was then rightly named after him. I suggest that more than three centuries earlier, in The Divine Comedy, his fellow countryman Dante Alighieri intuitively grasped what Galileo was later to establish as one of the pillars of modern science."
