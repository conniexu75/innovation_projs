https://openalex.org/W2028600070,"Background Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is associated with metabolic disorder and cell death, which are important triggers in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). We aimed to explore whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to DCM and the mechanism involved. Methods Type 2 diabetic rat model was induced by high fat diet and low dose streptozotocin. The characteristics of type 2 DCM were evaluated by metabolic tests, echocardiography and histopathology. Gene silencing therapy was used to investigate the role of NLRP3 in the pathogenesis of DCM. High glucose treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes were used to determine the mechanism by which NLRP3 modulated the DCM. The cell death in vitro was detected by TUNEL and EthD-III staining. TXNIP-siRNA and pharmacological inhibitors of ROS and NF-kB were used to explore the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Results Diabetic rats showed severe metabolic disorder, cardiac inflammation, cell death, disorganized ultrastructure, fibrosis and excessive activation of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), pro-caspase-1, activated caspase-1 and mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Evidence for pyroptosis was found in vivo, and the caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis was found in vitro. Silencing of NLRP3 in vivo did not attenuate systemic metabolic disturbances. However, NLRP3 gene silencing therapy ameliorated cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, fibrosis and cardiac function. Silencing of NLRP3 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes suppressed pyroptosis under high glucose. ROS inhibition markedly decreased nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) phosphorylation, thioredoxin interacting/inhibiting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3 inflammasome, and mature IL-1β in high glucose treated H9c2 cells. Inhibition of NF-kB reduced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. TXNIP-siRNA decreased the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β. Conclusion NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to the development of DCM. NF-κB and TXNIP mediated the ROS-induced caspase-1 and IL-1β activation, which are the effectors of NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 gene silencing may exert a protective effect on DCM."
https://openalex.org/W2075691559,"Single-cell sequencing is emerging as an important tool for studies of genomic heterogeneity. Whole genome amplification (WGA) is a key step in single-cell sequencing workflows and a multitude of methods have been introduced. Here, we compare three state-of-the-art methods on both bulk and single-cell samples of E. coli DNA: Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA), Multiple Annealing and Looping Based Amplification Cycles (MALBAC), and the PicoPLEX single-cell WGA kit (NEB-WGA). We considered the effects of reaction gain on coverage uniformity, error rates and the level of background contamination. We compared the suitability of the different WGA methods for the detection of copy-number variations, for the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and for de-novo genome assembly. No single method performed best across all criteria and significant differences in characteristics were observed; the choice of which amplifier to use will depend strongly on the details of the type of question being asked in any given experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2091410656,"Clinical trial results demonstrating that B-cell depletion substantially reduces new relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have established that B cells play a role in the pathophysiology of MS relapses. The same treatment appears not to impact antibodies directed against the central nervous system, which underscores the contribution of antibody-independent functions of B cells to disease activity. One mechanism by which B cells are now thought to contribute to MS activity is by over-activating T cells, including through aberrant expression of B cell pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms underlying the observed B cell cytokine dysregulation in MS remain unknown. We hypothesized that aberrant expression of particular microRNAs might be involved in the dysregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses of B cells of patients with MS. Through screening candidate microRNAs in activated B cells of MS patients and matched healthy subjects, we discovered that abnormally increased secretion of lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor α by MS B cells is associated with abnormally increased expression of miR-132. Over-expression of miR-132 in normal B cells significantly enhanced their production of lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor α. The over-expression of miR-132 also suppressed the miR-132 target, sirtuin-1. We confirmed that pharmacological inhibition of sirtuin-1 in normal B cells induces exaggerated lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor α production, while the abnormal production of these cytokines by MS B cells can be normalized by resveratrol, a sirtuin-1 activator. These results define a novel miR-132-sirtuin-1 axis that controls pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by human B cells, and demonstrate that a dysregulation of this axis underlies abnormal pro-inflammatory B cell cytokine responses in patients with MS."

The sialic acid residues can be linked to the adjacent monosaccharide by α2–3- or α2–6-type glycosidic bonds. It is this linkage difference that primarily defines the species barrier of the influenza virus infection with α2–3 binding being associated with avian influenza viruses and α2–6 binding being associated with human strains. The ferret has been extensively used as an animal model to study the transmission of influenza. To better understand the validity of this model system, we undertook glycomic characterization of respiratory tissues of ferret, which allows a comparison of potential viral receptors to be made between humans and ferrets. To complement the structural analysis, lectin staining experiments were performed to characterize the regional distributions of glycans along the respiratory tract of ferrets. Finally, the binding between the glycans identified and the hemagglutinins of different strains of influenza viruses was assessed by glycan array experiments. Our data indicated that the respiratory tissues of ferret heterogeneously express both α2–3- and α2–6-linked sialic acids. However, the respiratory tissues of ferret also expressed the Sda epitope (NeuAcα2-3(GalNAcβ1–4)Galβ1–4GlcNAc) and sialylated N,N′-diacetyllactosamine (NeuAcα2–6GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc), which have not been observed in the human respiratory tract surface epithelium. The presence of the Sda epitope reduces potential binding sites for avian viruses and thus may have implications for the usefulness of the ferret in the study of influenza virus infection.

https://openalex.org/W2091730298,"‘Phase amplitude coupling’ (PAC) in oscillatory neural activity describes a phenomenon whereby the amplitude of higher frequency activity is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Such coupled oscillatory activity – also referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ or ‘nested rhythms’ – has been shown to occur in a number of brain regions and at behaviorally relevant time points during cognitive tasks; this suggests functional relevance, but the circuit mechanisms of PAC generation remain unclear. In this paper we present a model of a canonical circuit for generating PAC activity, showing how interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neural populations can be periodically shifted in to and out of oscillatory firing patterns by afferent drive, hence generating higher frequency oscillations phase-locked to a lower frequency, oscillating input signal. Since many brain regions contain mutually connected excitatory-inhibitory populations receiving oscillatory input, the simplicity of the mechanism generating PAC in such networks may explain the ubiquity of PAC across diverse neural systems and behaviors. Analytic treatment of this circuit as a nonlinear dynamical system demonstrates how connection strengths and inputs to the populations can be varied in order to change the extent and nature of PAC activity, importantly which phase of the lower frequency rhythm the higher frequency activity is locked to. Consequently, this model can inform attempts to associate distinct types of PAC with different network topologies and physiologies in real data."
https://openalex.org/W1968881357,"Elevated levels of erythrocyte-derived microparticles are present in the circulation in medical conditions affecting the red blood cells. Erythrocyte-derived microparticles expose phosphatidylserine thus providing a suitable surface for procoagulant reactions leading to thrombin formation via the tenase and prothrombinase complexes. Patients with elevated levels of circulating erythrocyte-derived microparticles have increased thrombin generation in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether erythrocyte-derived microparticles are able to support the anticoagulant reactions of the protein C system. Erythrocyte-derived microparticles were isolated using ultracentrifugation after incubation of freshly prepared erythrocytes with the ionophore A23187 or from outdated erythrocyte concentrates, the different microparticles preparations yielding similar results. According to flow cytometry analysis, the microparticles exposed phoshatidylserine and bound lactadherin, annexin V, and protein S, which is a cofactor to activated protein C. The microparticles were able to assemble the tenase and prothrombinase complexes and to stimulate the formation of thrombin in plasma-based thrombin generation assay both in presence and absence of added tissue factor. The addition of activated protein C in the thrombin generation assay inhibited thrombin generation in a dose-dependent fashion. The anticoagulant effect of activated protein C in the thrombin generation assay was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody that prevents binding of protein S to microparticles and also attenuated by anti-TFPI antibodies. In the presence of erythrocyte-derived microparticles, activated protein C inhibited tenase and prothrombinase by degrading the cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, respectively. Protein S stimulated the Arg306-cleavage in FVa, whereas efficient inhibition of FVIIIa depended on the synergistic cofactor activity of protein S and FV. In summary, the erythrocyte-derived microparticle surface is suitable for the anticoagulant reactions of the protein C system, which may be important to balance the initiation and propagation of coagulation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2081903555,"Background Rapidly driven by the need for developing sustainable sources of nutritionally important fatty acids and the rising concerns about environmental impacts after using fossil oil, oil-plants have received increasing awareness nowadays. As an important oil-rich plant in China, Camellia oleifera has played a vital role in providing nutritional applications, biofuel productions and chemical feedstocks. However, the lack of C. oleifera genome sequences and little genetic information have largely hampered the urgent needs for efficient utilization of the abundant germplasms towards modern breeding efforts of this woody oil-plant. Results Here, using the 454 GS-FLX sequencing platform, we generated approximately 600,000 RNA-Seq reads from four tissues of C. oleifera. These reads were trimmed and assembled into 104,842 non-redundant putative transcripts with a total length of ∼38.9 Mb, representing more than 218-fold of all the C. oleifera sequences currently deposited in the GenBank (as of March 2014). Based on the BLAST similarity searches, nearly 42.6% transcripts could be annotated with known genes, conserved domains, or Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Comparisons with the cultivated tea tree, C. sinensis, identified 3,022 pairs of orthologs, of which 211 exhibited the evidence under positive selection. Pathway analysis detected the majority of genes potentially related to lipid metabolism. Evolutionary analysis of omega-6 fatty acid desaturase (FAD2) genes among 20 oil-plants unexpectedly suggests that a parallel evolution may occur between C. oleifera and Olea oleifera. Additionally, more than 2,300 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 20,200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the C. oleifera transcriptome. Conclusions The generated transcriptome represents a considerable increase in the number of sequences deposited in the public databases, providing an unprecedented opportunity to discover all related-genes associated with lipid metabolic pathway in C. oleifera. It will greatly enhance the generation of new varieties of C. oleifera with increased yields and high quality."
https://openalex.org/W2146291422,"Background We have previously reported the results of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the antero-medial globus pallidus interna (GPi) for severe Tourette Syndrome (TS) in 11 patients. We extend this case series to 17 patients and a longer follow-up to a maximum of 46 months. Methods 17 patients (14 male; mean age 29.1 years, range 17–51 years) with severe and medically intractable TS were implanted with Medtronic quadripolar electrodes bilaterally in the antero-medial GPi. The primary outcome measure was the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). Secondary outcome measures included the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Gilles de la Tourette Quality of Life Scale and Global Assessment of Functioning. Follow up was at one month, three months and finally at a mean 24.1 months (range 8–46 months) following surgery. Results Overall, there was a 48.3% reduction in motor tics and a 41.3% reduction in phonic tics at one month, and this improvement was maintained at final follow-up. 12 out of 17 (70.6%) patients had a>50% reduction in YGTSS score at final follow up. Only 8 patients required ongoing pharmacotherapy for tics post-surgery. Patients improved significantly on all secondary measures. Adverse consequences included lead breakage in 4 patients, infection (1), transient anxiety (2), dizziness (1), poor balance (1) and worsening of stuttering (1). Conclusions This case series provides further support that antero-medial GPi DBS is an effective and well tolerated treatment for a subgroup of severe TS, with benefits sustained up to 4 years."
https://openalex.org/W1981444339,"This paper reports on studies of the effect of temperature step-change (between a cool and a neutral environment) on human thermal sensation and skin temperature. Experiments with three temperature conditions were carried out in a climate chamber during the period in winter. Twelve subjects participated in the experiments simulating moving inside and outside of rooms or cabins with air conditioning. Skin temperatures and thermal sensation were recorded. Results showed overshoot and asymmetry of TSV due to the step-change. Skin temperature changed immediately when subjects entered a new environment. When moving into a neutral environment from cool, dynamic thermal sensation was in the thermal comfort zone and overshoot was not obvious. Air-conditioning in a transitional area should be considered to limit temperature difference to not more than 5°C to decrease the unacceptability of temperature step-change. The linear relationship between thermal sensation and skin temperature or gradient of skin temperature does not apply in a step-change environment. There is a significant linear correlation between TSV and Qloss in the transient environment. Heat loss from the human skin surface can be used to predict dynamic thermal sensation instead of the heat transfer of the whole human body."
https://openalex.org/W2172298605,"The insect Rhodnius prolixus is responsible for the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, which is the etiological agent of Chagas disease in areas of Central and South America. Besides this, it can be infected by other trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma rangeli. The effects of these parasites on vectors are poorly understood and are often controversial so here we focussed on possible negative effects of these parasites on the reproductive performance of R. prolixus, specifically comparing infected and uninfected couples. While T. cruzi infection did not delay pre-oviposition time of infected couples at either temperature tested (25 and 30°C) it did, at 25°C, increase the e-value in the second reproductive cycle, as well as hatching rates. Meanwhile, at 30°C, T. cruzi infection decreased the e-value of insects during the first cycle and also the fertility of older insects. When couples were instead infected with T. rangeli, pre-oviposition time was delayed, while reductions in the e-value and hatching rate were observed in the second and third cycles. We conclude that both T. cruzi and T. rangeli can impair reproductive performance of R. prolixus, although for T. cruzi, this is dependent on rearing temperature and insect age. We discuss these reproductive costs in terms of potential consequences on triatomine behavior and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2037806158,"The flavones apigenin (4',5,7,-trihydroxyflavone) and luteolin (3',4',5,7,-tetrahydroxyflavone) are plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticancer activities. We evaluated their impact on cell signaling pathways related to insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes. Apigenin and luteolin were identified in our U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell screening assay for micronutrients triggering rapid intracellular translocation of the forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FOXO1), an important mediator of insulin signal transduction. Insulin reversed the translocation of FOXO1 as shown by live cell imaging. The impact on the expression of target genes was evaluated in HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells. The mRNA-expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pc), the lipogenic enzymes fatty-acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) were down-regulated by both flavones with smaller effective dosages of apigenin than for luteolin. PKB/AKT-, PRAS40-, p70S6K-, and S6-phosphorylation was reduced by apigenin and luteolin but not that of the insulin-like growth factor receptor IGF-1R by apigenin indicating a direct inhibition of the PKB/AKT-signaling pathway distal to the IGF-1 receptor. N-acetyl-L-cysteine did not prevent FOXO1 nuclear translocation induced by apigenin and luteolin, suggesting that these flavones do not act via oxidative stress. The roles of FOXO1, FOXO3a, AKT, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived2)-like2 (NRF2), investigated by siRNA knockdown, showed differential patterns of signal pathways involved and a role of NRF2 in the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzyme expression. We conclude that these flavones show an antidiabetic potential due to reduction of gluconeogenic and lipogenic capacity despite inhibition of the PKB/AKT pathway which justifies detailed investigation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2107679744,"Cysteine-containing peptides represent an important class of T cell epitopes, yet their prevalence remains underestimated. We have established and interrogated a database of around 70,000 naturally processed MHC-bound peptides and demonstrate that cysteine-containing peptides are presented on the surface of cells in an MHC allomorph-dependent manner and comprise on average 5-10% of the immunopeptidome. A significant proportion of these peptides are oxidatively modified, most commonly through covalent linkage with the antioxidant glutathione. Unlike some of the previously reported cysteine-based modifications, this represents a true physiological alteration of cysteine residues. Furthermore, our results suggest that alterations in the cellular redox state induced by viral infection are communicated to the immune system through the presentation of S-glutathionylated viral peptides, resulting in altered T cell recognition. Our data provide a structural basis for how the glutathione modification alters recognition by virus-specific T cells. Collectively, these results suggest that oxidative stress represents a mechanism for modulating the virus-specific T cell response."
https://openalex.org/W2045889088,"Diffusional limitations to photosynthesis, relative water content (RWC), pigment concentrations and their association with reflectance indices were studied in olive (Olea europaea) saplings subjected to water-stress and re-watering. RWC decreased sharply as drought progressed. Following rewatering, RWC gradually increased to pre-stress values. Photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), mesophyll conductance (gm), total conductance (gt), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), water index (WI) and relative depth index (RDI) closely followed RWC. In contrast, carotenoid concentration, the carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio, water content reflectance index (WCRI) and structural independent pigment index (SIPI) showed an opposite trend to that of RWC. Photosynthesis scaled linearly with leaf conductance to CO2; however, A measured under non-photorespiratory conditions (A1%O2) was approximately two times greater than A measured at 21% [O2], indicating that photorespiration likely increased in response to drought. A1%O2 also significantly correlated with leaf conductance parameters. These relationships were apparent in saturation type curves, indicating that under non-photorespiratory conditions, CO2 conductance was not the major limitations to A. PRI was significant correlated with RWC. PRI was also very sensitive to pigment concentrations and photosynthesis, and significantly tracked all CO2 conductance parameters. WI, RDI and WCRI were all significantly correlated with RWC, and most notably to leaf transpiration. Overall, PRI correlated more closely with carotenoid concentration than SIPI; whereas WI tracked leaf transpiration more effectively than RDI and WCRI. This study clearly demonstrates that PRI and WI can be used for the fast detection of physiological traits of olive trees subjected to water-stress."
https://openalex.org/W2037067840,"Background Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have emerged as important foodborne pathogens, among which seven serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, O157) are most frequently implicated in human infection. The aim was to determine if a light scattering sensor can be used to rapidly identify the colonies of STEC serogroups on selective agar plates. Methodology/Principal Findings Initially, a total of 37 STEC strains representing seven serovars were grown on four different selective agar media, including sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC), Rainbow Agar O157, BBL CHROMagarO157, and R&F E. coli O157:H7, as well as nonselective Brain Heart Infusion agar. The colonies were scanned by an automated light scattering sensor, known as BARDOT (BActerial Rapid Detection using Optical scattering Technology), to acquire scatter patterns of STEC serogroups, and the scatter patterns were analyzed using an image classifier. Among all of the selective media tested, both SMAC and Rainbow provided the best differentiation results allowing multi-class classification of all serovars with an average accuracy of more than 90% after 10–12 h of growth, even though the colony appearance was indistinguishable at that early stage of growth. SMAC was chosen for exhaustive scatter image library development, and 36 additional strains of O157:H7 and 11 non-O157 serovars were examined, with each serogroup producing unique differential scatter patterns. Colony scatter images were also tested with samples derived from pure and mixed cultures, as well as experimentally inoculated food samples. BARDOT accurately detected O157 and O26 serovars from a mixed culture and also from inoculated lettuce and ground beef (10-h broth enrichment +12-h on-plate incubation) in the presence of natural background microbiota in less than 24 h. Conclusions BARDOT could potentially be used as a screening tool during isolation of the most important STEC serovars on selective agar plates from food samples in less than 24 h."
https://openalex.org/W2068451535,"Glycosylation of proteins and lipids takes place in the Golgi apparatus by the consecutive actions of functionally distinct glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. Current evidence indicates that they function as enzyme homomers and/or heteromers in the living cell. Here we investigate their organizational interplay and show that glycosyltransferase homomers are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon transport to the Golgi, the majority of homomers are disassembled to allow the formation of enzyme heteromers between sequentially acting medial-Golgi enzymes GnT-I and GnT-II or trans-Golgi enzymes GalT-I and ST6Gal-I. This transition is driven by the acidic Golgi environment, as it was markedly inhibited by raising Golgi luminal pH with chloroquine. Our FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) measurements showed that the complexes remain mobile Golgi membrane constituents that can relocate to the endoplasmic reticulum or to the scattered Golgi mini-stacks upon brefeldin A or nocodazole treatment, respectively. During this relocation, heteromers undergo a reverse transition back to enzyme homomers. These data unveil an unprecedented organizational interplay between Golgi N-glycosyltransferases that involves dynamic and organelle microenvironment-driven transitions between enzyme homomers and heteromers during their trafficking within the early secretory compartments.

https://openalex.org/W2158054199,"Theory of complex networks proved successful in the description of a variety of static networks ranging from biology to computer and social sciences and to economics and finance. Here we use network models to describe the evolution of a particular economic system, namely the International Trade Network (ITN). Previous studies often assume that globalization and regionalization in international trade are contradictory to each other. We re-examine the relationship between globalization and regionalization by viewing the international trade system as an interdependent complex network. We use the modularity optimization method to detect communities and community cores in the ITN during the years 1995-2011. We find rich dynamics over time both inter- and intra-communities. Most importantly, we have a multilevel description of the evolution where the global dynamics (i.e., communities disappear or reemerge) tend to be correlated with the regional dynamics (i.e., community core changes between community members). In particular, the Asia-Oceania community disappeared and reemerged over time along with a switch in leadership from Japan to China. Moreover, simulation results show that the global dynamics can be generated by a preferential attachment mechanism both inter- and intra-communities."
https://openalex.org/W1972367845,"Children's health problems caused by the electronic waste (e-waste) lead exposure in China remains. To assess children's blood lead levels (BLLs) in Guiyu of China and investigate risk factors of children's elevated BLLs in Guiyu.842 children under 11 years of age from Guiyu and Haojiang were enrolled in this population-based study during 2011-2013. Participants completed a lifestyle and residential environment questionnaire and their physical growth indices were measured, and blood samples taken. Blood samples were tested to assess BLLs. Children's BLLs between the two groups were compared and factors associated with elevated BLLs among Guiyu children were analyzed by group Lasso logistic regression model.Children living in Guiyu had significant higher BLLs (7.06 µg/dL) than the quantity (5.89 µg/dL) of Haojiang children (P<0.05). Subgroup analyses of BLLs exceeding 10 µg/dL showed the proportion (24.80%) of high-level BLLs for Guiyu children was greater than that (12.84%) in Haojiang (P<0.05). Boys had greater BLLs than girls, irrespectively of areas (P<0.05). The number of e-waste piles or recycling workshops around the house (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.87) significantly contributed to the elevated BLLs of children in Guiyu, and girls had less risk (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.83) of e-waste lead exposure than boys.This analysis reinforces the importance of shifting e-waste recycling piles or workshops to non-populated areas as part of a comprehensive response to e-waste lead exposure control in Guiyu. To correct the problem of lead poisoning in children in Guiyu should be a long-term mission."
https://openalex.org/W2114715733,"Different parts of the genome occupy specific compartments of the cell nucleus based on the gene content and the transcriptional activity. An example of this is the altered nuclear positioning of the HLXB9 gene in leukaemia cells observed in association with its over-expression. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of a chromosomal translocation with breakpoint proximal to the HLXB9 gene. Before becoming an interesting gene in cancer biology, HLXB9 was studied as a developmental gene. This homeobox gene is also known as MNX1 (motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1) and it is relevant for both motor neuronal and pancreatic beta cells development. A spectrum of mutations in this gene are causative of sacral agenesis and more broadly, of what is known as the Currarino Syndrome, a constitutional autosomal dominant disorder. Experimental work on animal models has shown that HLXB9 has an essential role in motor neuronal differentiation. Here we present data to show that, upon treatment with retinoic acid, the HLXB9 gene becomes over-expressed during the early stages of neuronal differentiation and that this corresponds to a reposition of the gene in the nucleus. More precisely, we used the SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cell line as an in vitro model and we demonstrated a transient transcription of HLXB9 at the 4th and 5th days of differentiation that corresponded to the presence, predominantly in the cell nuclei, of the encoded protein HB9. The nuclear positioning of the HLXB9 gene was monitored at different stages: a peripheral location was noted in the proliferating cells whereas a more internal position was noted during differentiation, that is while HLXB9 was transcriptionally active. Our findings suggest that HLXB9 can be considered a marker of early neuronal differentiation, possibly involving chromatin remodeling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2006810080,"A novel family of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, that may hold a role in calcium homeostasis, has recently been described. By employing a GeneChip array analysis we have demonstrated a clear and specific upregulation of the TRP vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) mRNA in the left ventricles (LV) 3-5 days post-acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to sham-operated controls, both in rats and in mice. We sought to characterize the cardiac cellular subpopulations in which TRPV2 is overexpressed upon acute MI.Lewis rats underwent an acute MI by ligation of the left anterior descending artery or chest opening only (sham). The animals were terminated at various time points and an immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescent (IFC) staining of the LV sections as well as a flow cytometry analysis of LV-derived cells were carried out, using anti-TRPV2 and anti-monocyte/macrophage antibodies. Rat alveolar macrophage cells, NR8383, transiently transfected with TRPV2 siRNA were allowed to migrate towards hypoxic conditioned media of the rat cardiac myoblast line H9C2 using a trans-well migration assay. The macrophage cells migrating to the bottom side of the inserts were counted.The IHC and IFC staining as well as the flow cytometry data demonstrated a substantial expression of TRPV2 in infiltrating macrophages in the peri-infarct region 3-5 days post-acute MI. The in vitro migration assay data demonstrated that following inhibition of the TRPV2 channel, the number of migrating macrophages towards conditioned medium of hypoxic cardiomyocytes was significantly reduced.TRPV2 is highly expressed on the peri-infarct infiltrating macrophages and may play an important role in post-MI phagocytosis. Better characterization of this channel may pave the way for identifying a new target for modulating the dramatic post-MI immune reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2115970237,"Microalgae are considered a promising source for various high value products, such as carotenoids, ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The unicellular green alga Lobosphaera (Parietochloris) incisa is an outstanding candidate for the efficient phototrophic production of arachidonic acid (AA), an essential ω-6 PUFA for infant brain development and a widely used ingredient in the baby formula industry. Although phototrophic production of such algal products has not yet been established, estimated costs are considered to be 2-5 times higher than competing heterotrophic production costs. This alga accumulates unprecedented amounts of AA within triacylglycerols and the molecular pathway of AA biosynthesis in L. incisa has been previously elucidated. Thus, progress in transformation and metabolic engineering of this high value alga could be exploited for increasing the efficient production of AA at competitive prices. We describe here the first successful transformation of L. incisa using the ble gene as a selection marker, under the control of the endogenous RBCS promoter. Furthermore, we have succeeded in the functional complementation of the L. incisa mutant strain P127, containing a mutated, inactive version of the delta-5 (Δ5) fatty acid desaturase gene. A copy of the functional Δ5 desaturase gene, linked to the ble selection marker, was transformed into the P127 mutant. The resulting transformants selected for zeocine resistant, had AA biosynthesis partially restored, indicating the functional complementation of the mutant strain with the wild-type gene. The results of this study present a platform for the successful genetic engineering of L. incisa and its long-chain PUFA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1974875622,"Cotton-rapeseed or cotton-wheat double cropping systems are popular in the Yangtze River Valley and Yellow River Valley of China. Due to the competition of temperature and light resources during the growing season of double cropping system, cotton is generally late-germinating and late-maturing and has to suffer from the coupling of declining temperature and low light especially in the late growth stage. In this study, late planting (LP) and shading were used to fit the coupling stress, and the coupling effect on fiber cellulose synthesis was investigated. Two cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars were grown in the field in 2010 and 2011 at three planting dates (25 April, 25 May and 10 June) each with three shading levels (normal light, declined 20% and 40% PAR). Mean daily minimum temperature was the primary environmental factor affected by LP. The coupling of LP and shading (decreased cellulose content by 7.8%–25.5%) produced more severe impacts on cellulose synthesis than either stress alone, and the effect of LP (decreased cellulose content by 6.7%–20.9%) was greater than shading (decreased cellulose content by 0.7%–5.6%). The coupling of LP and shading hindered the flux from sucrose to cellulose by affecting the activities of related cellulose synthesis enzymes. Fiber cellulose synthase genes expression were delayed under not only LP but shading, and the coupling of LP and shading markedly postponed and even restrained its expression. The decline of sucrose-phosphate synthase activity and its peak delay may cause cellulose synthesis being more sensitive to the coupling stress during the later stage of fiber secondary wall development (38–45 days post-anthesis). The sensitive difference of cellulose synthesis between two cultivars in response to the coupling of LP and shading may be mainly determined by the sensitiveness of invertase, sucrose-phosphate synthase and cellulose synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2084696373,"This study investigated the current management practices associated with stock herding dogs on Australian farms. A parallel goal was to determine whether these practices and the characteristics of the dog handlers were associated with success rates. Success rate refers to the proportion of dogs acquired by the farmer that were retained as working dogs. Data on a total of 4,027 dogs were obtained through The Farm Dog Survey which gathered information from 812 herding dog owners around Australia. Using logistic regression, significant associations were identified between success rate and seven variables: dog breed, housing method, trial participation, age of the dog at acquisition, electric collar use, hypothetical maximum treatment expenditure and the conscientiousness score of the owner's personality. These findings serve as a guide to direct further research into ways of optimising herding dog performance and welfare. They emphasise the importance of not only examining the genetic predispositions of the working dog but also the impact the handler can have on a dog's success in the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W2110981548,"Establishment of conservation priorities for primates is a particular concern in the island archipelagos of Southeast Asia, where rates of habitat destruction are among the highest in the world. Conservation programs require knowledge of taxonomic diversity to ensure success. The Philippine tarsier is a flagship species that promotes environmental awareness and a thriving ecotourism economy in the Philippines. However, assessment of its conservation status has been impeded by taxonomic uncertainty, a paucity of field studies, and a lack of vouchered specimens and genetic samples available for study in biodiversity repositories. Consequently, conservation priorities are unclear. In this study we use mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to empirically infer geographic partitioning of genetic variation and to identify evolutionarily distinct lineages for conservation action. The distribution of Philippine tarsier genetic diversity is neither congruent with expectations based on biogeographical patterns documented in other Philippine vertebrates, nor does it agree with the most recent Philippine tarsier taxonomic arrangement. We identify three principal evolutionary lineages that do not correspond to the currently recognized subspecies, highlight the discovery of a novel cryptic and range-restricted subcenter of genetic variation in an unanticipated part of the archipelago, and identify additional geographically structured genetic variation that should be the focus of future studies and conservation action. Conservation of this flagship species necessitates establishment of protected areas and targeted conservation programs within the range of each genetically distinct variant of the Philippine tarsier."
https://openalex.org/W1969409666,"Lack of tyrosine sulfation of ocular proteins results in disorganized photoreceptor structure and drastically reduced visual function, demonstrating the importance of this post-translational modification to vision. To understand the role that tyrosine sulfation plays in the function of ocular proteins, we identified some tyrosine-sulfated proteins in the retinal pigment epithelium using two independent methods, immuno-affinity column purification with an anti-sulfotyrosine specific antibody and computer-based sequence analysis of retinal pigment epithelium secretome by means of the prediction program Sulfinator. Radioactive labeling followed by thin layer electrophoresis revealed that three proteins, vitronectin, opticin, and complement factor H (CFH), were post-translationally modified by tyrosine sulfation. The identification of vitronectin and CFH as tyrosine-sulfated proteins is significant, since both are deposited in drusen in the eyes of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Furthermore, mutations in CFH have been determined to be a major risk factor in the development of AMD. Future studies that seek to understand the role of CFH in the development of AMD should take into account the role that tyrosine sulfation plays in the interaction of this protein with its partners, and examine whether modulating sulfation provides a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1997822345,"The luminal sides of vascular endothelial cells are heavily covered with a so-called glycocalyx, but the precise role of the endothelial glycocalyx remains unclear. Our previous study showed that N-glycan α2,6-sialylation regulates the cell surface residency of an anti-apoptotic molecule, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), as well as the sensitivity of endothelial cells toward apoptotic stimuli. As PECAM itself was shown to be modified with biantennary N-glycans having α2,6-sialic acid, we expected that PECAM would possess lectin-like activity toward α2,6-sialic acid to ensure its homophilic interaction. To verify this, a series of oligosaccharides were initially added to observe their inhibitory effects on the homophilic PECAM interaction in vitro. We found that a longer α2,6-sialylated oligosaccharide exhibited strong inhibitory activity. Furthermore, we found that a cluster-type α2,6-sialyl N-glycan probe specifically bound to PECAM-immobilized beads. Moreover, the addition of the α2,6-sialylated oligosaccharide to endothelial cells enhanced the internalization of PECAM as well as the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Collectively, these findings suggest that PECAM is a sialic acid binding lectin and that this binding property supports endothelial cell survival. Notably, our findings that α2,6-sialylated glycans influenced the susceptibility to endothelial cell apoptosis shed light on the possibility of using a glycan-based method to modulate angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1992864423,"Swiprosin-1/EFhd2 (EFhd2) is a cytoskeletal Ca2+ sensor protein strongly expressed in the brain. It has been shown to interact with mutant tau, which can promote neurodegeneration, but nothing is known about the physiological function of EFhd2 in the nervous system. To elucidate this question, we analyzed EFhd2-/-/lacZ reporter mice and showed that lacZ was strongly expressed in the cortex, the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the olfactory bulb. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting confirmed this pattern and revealed expression of EFhd2 during neuronal maturation. In cortical neurons, EFhd2 was detected in neurites marked by MAP2 and co-localized with pre- and post-synaptic markers. Approximately one third of EFhd2 associated with a biochemically isolated synaptosome preparation. There, EFhd2 was mostly confined to the cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions. Both synaptic endocytosis and exocytosis in primary hippocampal EFhd2-/- neurons were unaltered but transport of synaptophysin-GFP containing vesicles was enhanced in EFhd2-/- primary hippocampal neurons, and notably, EFhd2 inhibited kinesin mediated microtubule gliding. Therefore, we found that EFhd2 is a neuronal protein that interferes with kinesin-mediated transport."
https://openalex.org/W2025096524,"The rapid progress of genomic technologies has been providing new opportunities to address the need of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) molecular diagnosis. However, whether a new mutation causes MODY can be questionable. A number of in silico methods have been developed to predict functional effects of rare human mutations. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of different bioinformatics methods in the functional prediction of nonsynonymous mutations in each MODY gene, and provides reference matrices to assist the molecular diagnosis of MODY. Our study showed that the prediction scores by different methods of the diabetes mutations were highly correlated, but were more complimentary than replacement to each other. The available in silico methods for the prediction of diabetes mutations had varied performances across different genes. Applying gene-specific thresholds defined by this study may be able to increase the performance of in silico prediction of disease-causing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2072902106,"Cutaneous pain sensations are mediated largely by C-nociceptors consisting of both mechano-sensitive (CM) and mechano-insensitive (CMi) fibres that can be distinguished from one another according to their characteristic axonal properties. In healthy skin and relative to CMi fibres, CM fibres show a higher initial conduction velocity, less activity-dependent conduction velocity slowing, and less prominent post-spike supernormality. However, after sensitization with nerve growth factor, the electrical signature of CMi fibres changes towards a profile similar to that of CM fibres. Here we take a combined experimental and modelling approach to examine the molecular basis of such alterations to the excitation thresholds. Changes in electrical activation thresholds and activity-dependent slowing were examined in vivo using single-fibre recordings of CM and CMi fibres in domestic pigs following NGF application. Using computational modelling, we investigated which axonal mechanisms contribute most to the electrophysiological differences between the fibre classes. Simulations of axonal conduction suggest that the differences between CMi and CM fibres are strongly influenced by the densities of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (Kdr), the voltage-gated sodium channels NaV1.7 and NaV1.8, and the Na+/K+-ATPase. Specifically, the CM fibre profile required less Kdr and NaV1.8 in combination with more NaV1.7 and Na+/K+-ATPase. The difference between CM and CMi fibres is thus likely to reflect a relative rather than an absolute difference in protein expression. In support of this, it was possible to replicate the experimental reduction of the ADS pattern of CMi nociceptors towards a CM-like pattern following intradermal injection of nerve growth factor by decreasing the contribution of Kdr (by 50%), increasing the Na+/K+-ATPase (by 10%), and reducing the branch length from 2 cm to 1 cm. The findings highlight key molecules that potentially contribute to the NGF-induced switch in nociceptors phenotype, in particular NaV1.7 which has already been identified clinically as a principal contributor to chronic pain states such as inherited erythromelalgia."
https://openalex.org/W2094344729,"Disease or pathogen risk prioritisations aid understanding of infectious agent impact within surveillance or mitigation and biosecurity work, but take significant development. Previous work has shown the H-(Hirsch-)index as an alternative proxy. We present a weighted risk analysis describing infectious pathogen impact for human health (human pathogens) and well-being (domestic animal pathogens) using an objective, evidence-based, repeatable approach; the H-index. This study established the highest H-index European pathogens. Commonalities amongst pathogens not included in previous surveillance or risk analyses were examined. Differences between host types (humans/animals/zoonotic) in pathogen H-indices were explored as a One Health impact indicator. Finally, the acceptability of the H-index proxy for animal pathogen impact was examined by comparison with other measures. 57 pathogens appeared solely in the top 100 highest H-indices (1) human or (2) animal pathogens list, and 43 occurred in both. Of human pathogens, 66 were zoonotic and 67 were emerging, compared to 67 and 57 for animals. There were statistically significant differences between H-indices for host types (humans, animal, zoonotic), and there was limited evidence that H-indices are a reasonable proxy for animal pathogen impact. This work addresses measures outlined by the European Commission to strengthen climate change resilience and biosecurity for infectious diseases. The results include a quantitative evaluation of infectious pathogen impact, and suggest greater impacts of human-only compared to zoonotic pathogens or scientific under-representation of zoonoses. The outputs separate high and low impact pathogens, and should be combined with other risk assessment methods relying on expert opinion or qualitative data for priority setting, or could be used to prioritise diseases for which formal risk assessments are not possible because of data gaps."
https://openalex.org/W2115615569,"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is being developed as a bioenergy crop for many temperate regions of the world. One way to increase biomass yields is to move southern adapted lowland cultivars to more northern latitudes. However, many southerly adapted switchgrass germplasm can suffer significant winter kill in northerly climes.Here, we have applied next-generation sequencing in combination with biochemical analyses to query the metabolism of crowns and rhizomes obtained from two contrasting switchgrass cultivars. Crowns and rhizomes from field-grown lowland (cv Kanlow) and upland (cv Summer) switchgrass cultivars were collected from three randomly selected post-flowering plants. Summer plants were senescing, whereas Kanlow plants were not at this harvest date.Principal component analysis (PCA) differentiated between both the Summer and Kanlow transcriptomes and metabolomes. Significant differences in transcript abundances were detected for 8,050 genes, including transcription factors such as WRKYs and those associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Gene-set enrichment analyses showed that a number of pathways were differentially up-regulated in the two populations. For both populations, protein levels and enzyme activities agreed well with transcript abundances for genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway that were up-regulated in Kanlow crowns and rhizomes. The combination of these datasets suggests that dormancy-related mechanisms had been triggered in the crowns and rhizomes of the Summer plants, whereas the crowns and rhizomes of Kanlow plants had yet to enter dormancy.Delayed establishment of dormancy at more northerly latitudes could be one factor that reduces winter-survival in the high-yielding Kanlow plants. Understanding the cellular signatures that accompany the transition to dormancy can be used in the future to select plants with improved winter hardiness."
https://openalex.org/W2026784761,"Objectives To assess how girls' preferences have changed almost 3 years after the much debated start of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program. Methods A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among girls aged 11–15 years who were invited, or were not yet invited, to get vaccinated. A panel latent class model was used to determine girls' preferences for vaccination based on five characteristics: degree of protection against cervical cancer; duration of protection; risk of mild side-effects; age of vaccination; and the number of required doses of the vaccine. Results The response rate was 85% (500/592). Most girls preferred vaccination at age 14 years (instead of at age 9 years) and a 2-dose scheme (instead of the current 3-dose scheme). Girls were willing to trade-off 7% (CI: 3.2% to 10.8%) of the degree of protection to have 10% less risk of mild side-effects, and 4% (CI: 1.2% to 5.9%) to receive 2 doses instead of 3 doses. Latent class analyses showed that there was preference heterogeneity among girls, i.e., higher educated girls and HPV vaccinated girls had a higher probability to opt for HPV vaccination at a higher age than lower educated girls or non-vaccinated girls. Conclusions Three years after the start of HPV vaccination program the risk of mild side-effects and age at vaccination seem to have become less important. For the Dutch national immunization program, we recommend not to lower the current target age of 12 years. A 2-dose scheme may result in a higher uptake and we recommend that if this scheme is introduced, it needs to receive adequate publicity."
https://openalex.org/W2061865489,"Aims Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress-activated immediate early gene suggested to have both detrimental and cardioprotective role in the heart. Here we studied the mechanisms of ATF3 activation by hypertrophic stimuli and ATF3 downstream targets in rat cardiomyocytes. Methods and Results When neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to endothelin-1 (ET-1, 100 nM) and mechanical stretching in vitro, maximal increase in ATF3 expression occurred at 1 hour. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by PD98059 decreased ET-1– and stretch–induced increase of ATF3 protein but not ATF3 mRNA levels, whereas protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 attenuated both ATF3 mRNA transcription and protein expression in response to ET-1 and stretch. To characterize further the regulatory mechanisms upstream of ATF3, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling was investigated using a gain-of-function approach. Adenoviral overexpression of p38α, but not p38β, increased ATF3 mRNA and protein levels as well as DNA binding activity. To investigate the role of ATF3 in hypertrophic process, we overexpressed ATF3 by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. In vitro, ATF3 gene delivery attenuated the mRNA transcription of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and enhanced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Nkx-2.5 DNA binding activities. Reduced PAI-1 expression was also detected in vivo in adult rat heart by direct intramyocardial adenovirus-mediated ATF3 gene delivery. Conclusions These data demonstrate that ATF3 activation by ET-1 and mechanical stretch is partly mediated through ERK and cAMP-PKA pathways, whereas p38 MAPK pathway is involved in ATF3 activation exclusively through p38α isoform. ATF3 activation caused induction of modulators of the inflammatory response NF-κB and Nkx-2.5, as well as attenuation of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory proteins IL-6 and PAI-1, suggesting cardioprotective role for ATF3 in the heart."

Deficiency of ARSG leads to a new type of mucopolysaccharidosis, as described in a mouse model. Here, we provide a detailed molecular characterization of the endogenous murine enzyme. ARSG is expressed and proteolytically processed in a tissue-specific manner. The 63-kDa single-chain precursor protein localizes to pre-lysosomal compartments and tightly associates with organelle membranes, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, proteolytically processed ARSG fragments of 34-, 18-, and 10-kDa were found in lysosomal fractions and lost their membrane association. The processing sites and a disulfide bridge between the 18- and 10-kDa chains could be roughly mapped. Proteases participating in the processing were identified as cathepsins B and L. Proteolytic processing is dispensable for hydrolytic sulfatase activity in vitro. Lysosomal transport of ARSG in the liver is independent of mannose 6-phosphate, sortilin, and Limp2. However, mutation of glycosylation site N-497 abrogates transport of ARSG to lysosomes in human fibrosarcoma cells, due to impaired mannose 6-phosphate modification."
https://openalex.org/W1984553344,"The enzyme Dicer generates 21-25 nucleotide RNAs that target specific mRNAs for silencing during RNA interference and related pathways. Although their active sites and RNA binding regions are functionally conserved, the helicase domains have distinct activities in the context of different Dicer enzymes. To examine the evolutionary origins of Dicer helicase functions, we investigated two related Dicer enzymes from the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile. RNA cleavage assays showed that S. thermophile Dicer-1 (StDicer-1) can process hairpin precursor microRNAs, whereas StDicer-2 can only cleave linear double-stranded RNAs. Furthermore, only StDicer-2 possesses robust ATP hydrolytic activity in the presence of double-stranded RNA. Deletion of the StDicer-2 helicase domain increases both StDicer-2 cleavage activity and affinity for hairpin RNA. Notably, both StDicer-1 and StDicer-2 could complement the distantly related yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacking its endogenous Dicer gene but only in their full-length forms, underscoring the importance of the helicase domain. These results suggest an in vivo regulatory function for the helicase domain that may be conserved from fungi to humans."

Our previous work characterized a PDZ interaction that restricts the apical membrane half-life of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Using iterative cycles of peptide-array and solution-binding analysis, we targeted the PDZ domain of the CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL), and showed that an engineered peptide inhibitor rescues cell-surface expression of the most common CFTR disease mutation ΔF508. Here, we present a series of scaffolds containing chemically modifiable side chains at all non-motif positions along the CAL PDZ domain binding cleft. Concordant equilibrium dissociation constants were determined in parallel by fluorescence polarization, isothermal titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance techniques, confirming robust affinity for each scaffold and revealing an enthalpically driven mode of inhibitor binding. Structural studies demonstrate a conserved binding mode for each peptide, opening the possibility of combinatorial modification. Finally, we diversified one of our peptide scaffolds with halogenated substituents that yielded modest increases in binding affinity. Overall, this work validates our approach and provides a stereochemical foundation for further CAL inhibitor design and screening."
https://openalex.org/W1997231384,"Homeobox B9 (HOXB9), a member of the homeobox gene family, is overexpressed in breast cancer and promotes tumor progression and metastasis by stimulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. HOXB9 activates the TGFβ-ATM axis, leading to checkpoint activation and DNA repair, which engenders radioresistance in breast cancer cells. Despite detailed reports of the role of HOXB9 in breast cancer, the factors that regulate HOXB9 transcription have not been extensively examined. Here we uncover an underlying mechanism that may suggest novel targeting strategies for breast cancer treatment. To identify a transcription factor binding site (TFBS) in the HOXB9 promoter region, a dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted. Protein candidates that may directly attach to a TFBS of HOXB9 were examined by Q-PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and mutation analysis. A HOXB9 promoter region from −404 to −392 was identified as TFBS, and E2F1 was a potential binding candidate in this region. The induction of HOXB9 expression by E2F1 was observed by Q-PCR in several breast cancer cell lines overexpressing E2F1. The stimulatory effect of E2F1 on HOXB9 transcription and its ability to bind the TFBS were confirmed by luciferase, EMSA and ChIP assay. Immunohistochemical analysis of 139 breast cancer tissue samples revealed a significant correlation between E2F1 and HOXB9 expression (p<0.001). Furthermore, a CDK4/6 inhibitor suppressed E2F1 expression and also reduced expression of HOXB9 and its downstream target genes. Our in vitro analysis identified the TFBS of the HOXB9 promoter region and suggested that E2F1 is a direct regulator of HOXB9 expression; these data support the strong correlation we found between E2F1 and HOXB9 in clinical breast cancer samples. These results suggest that targeting the E2F1/HOXB9 axis may be a novel strategy for the control or prevention of cancer progression and metastasis."

A multidimensional scaling analysis coupled with subjective attribute ratings was performed to assess these factors both qualitatively and quantitatively. The perceptual somatosensory factors of warmth, hardness and roughness dominated over the basic taste factors, and roughness was observed to be a less significant sensation compared to touch-only experiments. The perceptual somatosensory ratings were compared directly with physical property data in order to assess the correlation between the perceived properties and measured physical properties. In each case, a strong correlation was observed, suggesting that physical properties may be useful in industrial design for predicting oral perception."

During cell division, genomic DNA must be partitioned to daughter cells in a highly regulated fashion to ensure the maintenance of genome integrity from each generation to the next. High fidelity segregation of eukaryotic genomes requires precise coordination between the multiple components of the cellular segregation machinery. For instance, replicated sister chromatids must be connected to each other and reconfigured into highly condensed chromosomes to allow effective segregation in anaphase (1.Bazile F. St-Pierre J.

The microtubule-based cytoskeleton also undergoes dramatic changes and intricate regulation during the cell cycle. Microtubules switch from providing a structural role for the maintenance of cell shape and for intracellular transport in interphase to building the underlying framework for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Mitotic chromosome formation and spindle assembly are often considered to be two precisely coordinated but separate events because proteins that are involved in chromatin organization and remodeling are often distinct from those that regulate cytoskeletal structures. Prime examples include histones, which are not linked to any polymer structures other than chromatin. Similarly, many known microtubule-associated proteins, including the XMAP215 family of TOG domain-containing proteins and the EB family of proteins, are not known to interact with chromatin (5.Kinoshita K.

Therefore, proteins linking chromosomes to the spindle apparatus are of great interest because they can provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms responsible for high fidelity genome segregation in eukaryotes.

Xenopus meiotic microtubule-associated interactome.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9248Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14.Mack G.J. Compton D.A. Analysis of mitotic microtubule-associated proteins using mass spectrometry identifies astrin, a spindle-associated protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14434-14439Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15.Sauer G. Körner R. Hanisch A. Ries A. Nigg E.A. Silljé H.H. Proteome analysis of the human mitotic spindle.Mol.

Dissection of the mammalian midbody proteome reveals conserved cytokinesis mechanisms.Science. 2004; 305: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some chromatin-binding proteins, most notably SMC family members, were consistently identified as microtubule-interacting proteins in such studies (13.Gache V. Waridel P. Winter C. Juhem A. Schroeder M. Shevchenko A. Popov A.V. Xenopus meiotic microtubule-associated interactome.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9248Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15.Sauer G. Körner R. Hanisch A. Ries A. Nigg E.A. Silljé H.H. Proteome analysis of the human mitotic spindle.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fact that these microtubule interactomes are devoid of other abundant chromatin-associated proteins, such as histones, suggests that the SMC family members identified in these studies are not simply contaminants or artifacts. This raises the possibility that SMC proteins directly bind to microtubules, an unexpected property for this family of chromatin-binding proteins. However, formal proof of this possibility is still lacking. Given the biological significance of proteins linking microtubules and chromatin, we set out to determine whether SMC proteins interact directly with microtubules and to understand the potential roles and implications of these interactions in vivo. Full-length Smc5-STH was expressed and purified in yeast, as described previously (17.Roy M.A. Siddiqui N. D'Amours D. Dynamic and selective DNA-binding activity of Smc5, a core component of the Smc5-Smc6 complex.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Smc5 fragments were expressed in bacteria from pET-series vectors (Novagen) and purified by nickel chelate and/or Strep-Tactin chromatography (Qiagen), according to the manufacturers' suggested conditions. The condensin complex containing Brn1, Smc2, Smc4, Ycg1, and Ycs4 subunits was purified from budding yeast by sequential nickel chelate, Strep-Tactin, and gel exclusion chromatography, as described previously (18.St-Pierre J. Douziech M. Bazile F. Pascariu M. Bonneil E. Sauvé V. Ratsima H. D'Amours D. Polo kinase regulates mitotic chromosome condensation by hyperactivation of condensin DNA supercoiling activity.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 416-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All proteins were purified to ≥95% purity, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining. Purification of bovine tubulin and the labeling of tubulin with X-Rhodamine dye were performed as described (19.Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Kin I kinesins are microtubule-destabilizing enzymes.Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The co-sedimentation assay was performed as described previously with some modifications (20.Solinet S. Mahmud K. Stewman S.F. Ben El Kadhi K. Decelle B. Talje L. Ma A. Kwok B.H. Carreno S. The actin-binding ERM protein Moesin binds to and stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtubules were prepared by polymerizing 25–40 µm tubulin in 1× BRB80 (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2), 1 mm GTP, 1 mm DTT in the presence of 10% DMSO at 37 °C for 30 min and then diluted to 10 or 20 µm working stocks in 1× BRB80 with 20 µm paclitaxel. Binding reactions were done by mixing SMC proteins with microtubules in 1× BRB80 supplemented with the indicated salt concentrations (75–125 mm NaCl), 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Tween 20, and 20 µm paclitaxel. After a 20-min incubation, mixtures were spun at 45,000–60,000 rpm in a Sorvall S120AT3 rotor at 25 °C for 5 min. Samples from supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained by Coomassie Blue and scanned with a digital scanner. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ (NIH). Kd measurements were done as described previously (20.Solinet S. Mahmud K. Stewman S.F. Ben El Kadhi K. Decelle B. Talje L. Ma A. Kwok B.H. Carreno S. The actin-binding ERM protein Moesin binds to and stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Microscopy-based microtubule binding assays were performed as described previously (20.Solinet S. Mahmud K. Stewman S.F. Ben El Kadhi K. Decelle B. Talje L. Ma A. Kwok B.H. Carreno S. The actin-binding ERM protein Moesin binds to and stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For detection of the microtubule-Smc5-DNA ternary complex, samples of Smc5-bound X-Rhodamine-labeled microtubules were first generated by mixing of the two components at a molar ratio of ∼1:4 (Smc5/tubulin dimer) and then attached them onto a tubulin antibody-coated (rat α-tubulin antibody from Serotec, at 10 ng/ml) coverslip in a flow chamber. Fluorescently labeled DNA (6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled 60-bp single-stranded DNA, Integrated DNA Technologies) was then introduced into the chamber. After a 5-min incubation, unbound DNA was flushed out, and images of the bound DNA and microtubules were visualized and recorded on a Zeiss Axio-Imager Z1 microscope equipped with a 1.4 numerical aperture Plan-APOCHROMAT 63× objective using the Zeiss AxioVision release 4.8 software. The TIFF files of the acquired images were then processed by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, LLC). The quantitative analysis of the microtubules and the associated FAM-labeled DNA was done using MetaMorph® (Molecular Devices). To identify microtubules, the images of the X-Rhodamine-labeled microtubules for the no Smc5 control were first thresholded to a signal intensity that would allow the detection of individual microtubules in the control image while minimizing background noise. The objects were identified using the “integrated morphometry analysis” functionality with exclusion of objects that touched the image edge and those with an area smaller than 50 square pixels (non-microtubule signals or X-Rhodamine aggregates). The same thresholding and exclusion filtering were applied to the acquired images with Smc5-WT and Smc5-3KE. The average area and average signal intensity of all of the objects were obtained automatically using the integrated morphometry analysis. A conservative cut-off of area occupied by microtubules was set to distinguish single microtubules from bundles. Object identification was verified by visual inspection. To analyze the extent of the FAM-oligonucleotide binding to microtubules, regions were created around the identified objects in the microtubule images and were transferred onto the corresponding images containing the FAM signal. This allows the determination of the average signal intensity within the microtubule delineated areas. For all calculations, the average background signal intensities (from unoccupied areas) were subtracted from the average signal intensity of microtubules and FAM, respectively. Using this analytical method, the average area occupied by single microtubules in the control, the average number of microtubules within bundles and the FAM intensity per microtubule were calculated. To prepare biotin-labeled Smc5 protein that has impaired microtubule binding ability, purified Smc5 proteins were chemically modified in the presence of 0.1–0.5 mm NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce/Thermo Fisher). Biotinylation reactions were performed at room temperature for 5 min and quenched by the addition of potassium glutamate. Modification was verified by streptavidin-HRP Western blot (streptavidin-HRP from Pierce/Thermo Fisher, 1:2000 dilution). Biotinylated Smc5 proteins were allowed to bind to microtubules and subjected to a sedimentation assay. This allows the separation of the fraction that associated with microtubules (pellet) and the fraction that remains in the supernatant (enriched for protein with biotinylated sites that interfere with binding). Optimal biotinylation and microtubule binding conditions were determined experimentally. Smc5 proteins in the supernatant fraction and the pellet fraction were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Intensities of the trypsin-digested peptides were normalized and compared between the two fractions. Biased enrichment of any biotinylated peptides in the supernatant fraction indicated lysine sites that were potentially essential for microtubule binding. The assay was performed as previously described (21.Arora K. Talje L. Asenjo A.B. Andersen P. Atchia K. Joshi M. Sosa H. Allingham J.S. Kwok B.H. KIF14 binds tightly to microtubules and adopts a rigor-like conformation.J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426: 2997-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, stock microtubules were diluted 10-fold in 1× BRB80 with 2 µm paclitaxel and 75 mm NaCl either in the absence or presence of the Smc5 proteins. The mixtures were then chilled to 2 °C in a PCR machine and incubated for 30 min to induce microtubule depolymerization while the control sample was placed at room temperature. The samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation to separate the depolymerized tubulin dimers from microtubules and processed as described above in the co-sedimentation assay. Yeast culture and genetic modifications were performed according to St-Pierre et al. (18.St-Pierre J. Douziech M. Bazile F. Pascariu M. Bonneil E. Sauvé V. Ratsima H. D'Amours D. Polo kinase regulates mitotic chromosome condensation by hyperactivation of condensin DNA supercoiling activity.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 416-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The genotypes of yeast strains used in this study are described in Table 1. smc5 mutants defective in microtubule-binding residues were created by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) and integrated into the yeast genome, as described previously (17.Roy M.A. Siddiqui N. D'Amours D. Dynamic and selective DNA-binding activity of Smc5, a core component of the Smc5-Smc6 complex.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence of the appropriate mutations in the yeast genome was confirmed by sequencing the SMC5 locus. Cell proliferation at various temperatures and/or in the presence of DNA-damaging agents was determined by spotting 5-fold dilution series of yeast cultures on solid medium containing the appropriate supplements and/or drugs. Cells were grown until individual colonies became visible on the surface of the solid media (2–3 days between 23 and 37 °C; 4–5 days at 18 °C). A previously characterized temperature-sensitive mutant in the SMC5 gene, smc5-6, was included in some experiments as a control for the effect associated with losing Smc5-Smc6 complex function (22.Torres-Rosell J. Machín F. Farmer S. Jarmuz A. Eydmann T. Dalgaard J.Z. Aragón L. SMC5 and SMC6 genes are required for the segregation of repetitive chromosome regions.Nat.

Samples were taken at intervals and processed for microscopic characterization of yeast bud, spindle, and nuclear morphology, as described previously (23.Ratsima H. Ladouceur A.M. Pascariu M. Sauvé V. Salloum Z. Maddox P.S. D'Amours D. Independent modulation of the kinase and polo-box activities of Cdc5 protein unravels unique roles in the maintenance of genome stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: E914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Yeast images were acquired on a Leica DM5500B microscope equipped with an EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu). Volocity software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to acquire images. Brightness and contrast adjustments were applied to primary micrographs using Photoshop software (Adobe). During time course experiments, yeast culture samples were also processed for determination of DNA content by flow cytometry using published procedures (23.Ratsima H. Ladouceur A.M. Pascariu M.

Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 µm pepstatin A, 10 µm E-64), as described previously (18.St-Pierre J.

During the immunoprecipitation process, 5 µg of anti-Myc 9E-10 (GenTex) or anti-Strep-tagII (Qiagen) were allowed to bind to GammaBind Plus Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Protein samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels for 16 h and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. For Western blotting, antibodies were used at the following concentrations: mouse monoclonal anti-Strep-tagII (Qiagen, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal anti-PGK-22C5 (Abcam, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc 9E-10 (GenTex, 1:1000). Proximity ligation assay (PLA) experiments were performed as described previously (20.Solinet S. Mahmud K. Stewman S.F. Ben El Kadhi K. Decelle B. Talje L. Ma A. Kwok B.H. Carreno S. The actin-binding ERM protein Moesin binds to and stabilizes microtubules at the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, images were acquired on a DeltaVision microscope (Olympus), controlled by softWoRx software (Applied Precision). Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-α-tubulin (DM1α, Sigma) at 1:1000; anti-Streptag (GenScript) at 1:400; Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 1:500. To test the possibility that SMC proteins bind to microtubules directly, we first tested the purified condensin complex in a microtubule co-sedimentation assay and found it to be associated with the polymers. Indeed, Fig. 1A shows that the five subunits of the yeast condensin complex (i.e. Brn1, Smc2, Smc4, Ycg1, and Ycs4) (18.St-Pierre J. Douziech M. Bazile F. Pascariu M. Bonneil E. Sauvé V. Ratsima H. D'Amours D. Polo kinase regulates mitotic chromosome condensation by hyperactivation of condensin DNA supercoiling activity.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 416-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) are enriched in the pellet fraction containing microtubules after sedimentation. We next sought to determine whether this microtubule-binding behavior is also typical of other SMC complexes. Specifically, we focused on Smc5 because this protein can be purified in recombinant form (17.Roy M.A. Siddiqui N. D'Amours D. Dynamic and selective DNA-binding activity of Smc5, a core component of the Smc5-Smc6 complex.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Smc5 is a member of the Smc5-Smc6 complex related structurally to the condensin complex but completely distinct in subunit composition. The fact that it can be purified in monomeric form enabled us to determine whether SMC subunits are directly responsible for the interaction with microtubules within their own complexes. We found that Smc5 also associated with microtubules in the co-sedimentation assay, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins (Fig. 1B). Judging by the observation that more than half of the SMC proteins associated with microtubules (at 0.5 µm tubulin dimer concentration) in these experiments, we concluded that SMC-microtubule interaction was of high affinity, with a dissociation constant (kd) of about or below 0.5 µm. It should be noted that the ionic strength of the buffer condition used in these experiments (80 mm PIPES with ∼125 mm NaCl) was much higher than those used traditionally (ranging typically from 12 to 80 mm PIPES or 20 mm sodium phosphate with 0–50 mm KCl or NaCl) (24.Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Weak and strong states of kinesin and ncd.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25.Kwok B.H. Yang J.G. Kapoor T.M.

Microtubule interaction site of the kinesin motor.Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although the condensin complex is an ATPase (2.Hirano T. Condensins: universal organizers of chromosomes with diverse functions.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1659-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), its association with microtubules did not appear to be affected by the presence of different nucleotides (ADP, ATP, or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP). The condensin complex did, however, appear to bind more to microtubules in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 1C). This is distinct from the nucleotide dependence of many prototypical kinesin motor proteins, where ATP hydrolysis or ADP releases motors from microtubules (24.Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Weak and strong states of kinesin and ncd.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27.Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Identification of a novel force-generating protein, kinesin, involved in microtubule-based motility.Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although Smc5 is capable of hydrolyzing ATP as a monomer (17.Roy M.A. Siddiqui N. D'Amours D. Dynamic and selective DNA-binding activity of Smc5, a core component of the Smc5-Smc6 complex.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), possible differences in the levels of ATPase activity present in the purified Smc5 and condensin fractions may explain their differential sensitivity to nucleotides in microtubule-binding assays (Fig. 1C). To simplify our investigation, we decided to follow the SMC component of the Smc5-Smc6 complex and chose purified Smc5 for subsequent experiments (17.Roy M.A. Siddiqui N. D'Amours D. Dynamic and selective DNA-binding activity of Smc5, a core component of the Smc5-Smc6 complex.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We reconfirmed the Smc5-microtubule interaction using a microscopy-based flow chamber assay (Fig. 1D). In this assay, Smc5 protein was nonspecifically absorbed onto a glass coverslide in a flow chamber. Fluorescently labeled microtubules were then infused into the chamber to allow binding to the surface-immobilized Smc5. As observed in Fig. 1E, microtubules were efficiently captured only in the chamber that had been coated with Smc5 protein, again indicating a direct interaction. Having demonstrated the ability of Smc5 to bind directly to microtubules, we next asked what the functional significance of this interaction would be. One way to address this question is to identify and characterize a mutant with impaired microtubule binding ability. However, without a crystal structure or a recognizable microtubule-binding motif in Smc5, locating the interaction interface in a ∼125-kDa protein is not a trivial task. To narrow our search, we decided to map the minimal binding domain using truncated forms of Smc5 containing only the ATPase heads, or the hinge domain with medium (HM) or long (HL) coiled-coil extensions (Fig. 2A). By a co-sedimentation assay, we found that the hinge and the coiled-coil domains, but not the ATPase domain, contain most if not all of the microtubule-binding sites (Fig. 2, B and C). This finding is consistent with our finding that Smc5-microtubule interaction is not sensitive to the nucleotide-binding states of Smc5 (Fig. 1C). Next we determined whether Smc5, like many microtubule-associated proteins, interacts"

Methods A total of 442 patients with T2 gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy from January 1996 to December 2009 were evaluated. The clinicopathological parameters were analyzed for lymph node metastasis and prognosis, including gender, age, tumor size, tumor location, histological type, depth of invasion, vascular tumor emboli, nervous invasion, resection type, and pathological stage. Results The rate of lymph node metastasis was 45.9%. Univariate analysis showed that depth of invasion, tumor size, and vascular tumor emboli were associated with lymph node metastasis. Logistic regression demonstrated that depth of invasion, tumor size, and vascular tumor emboli were independently predictive factors for lymph node metastasis. The 5-year survival rate was 64.0%. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size, tumor location, resection type, and pathological stage were independent prognostic factors. Based on tumor size, there were significant differences of 5-year survival between small size tumor (<6 cm) and large size tumor (≥6 cm) according to stage IIA (P = 0.006). Based on tumor location, there were significant differences of 5-year survival among different tumor location according to stage IB. Based on resection type, there were significant differences of overall 5-year survival between curative surgery and palliative surgery according to stage IIB (P = 0.015) and IIIA (P = 0.001). Conclusion Depth of invasion, tumor size, and vascular tumor emboli were independently predictive factors for lymph node metastasis. Tumor size, tumor location, resection type, and pathological stage were independent prognostic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2002844191,"Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR) induces, not only, activation of multiple signaling pathways that play critical roles in cell fate determination, but also alteration of molecular pathways involved in cell death or survival. Recently, DNA methylation has been established as a critical epigenetic process involved in the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells, suggesting that DNA methylation inhibition may be an effective cancer treatment strategy. Because alterations of gene expression by DNA methylation have been considered to influence radioresponsiveness, we investigated the effect of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), on radiosensitivity. In addition, we investigated the underlying cellular mechanisms of combination treatments of ionizing irradiation (IR) and 5-aza-dC in human colon cancer cells. Colon cancer cell lines were initially tested for radiation sensitivity by IR in vitro and were treated with two different doses of 5-aza-dC. Survival of these cell lines was measured using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and clonogenic assays. The effects of 5-aza-dC along with irradiation on cell growth, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and apoptosis-related gene expression were examined. Combination irradiation treatment with 5-aza-dC significantly decreased growth activity compared with irradiation treatment alone or with 5-aza-dC treatment alone. The percentage of HCT116 cells in the sub-G1 phase and their apoptotic rate was increased when cells were treated with irradiation in combination with 5-aza-dC compared with either treatment alone. These observations were strongly supported by increased caspase activity, increased comet tails using comet assays, and increased protein levels of apoptosis-associated molecules (caspase 3/9, cleaved PARP). Our data demonstrated that 5-aza-dC enhanced radiosensitivity in colon cancer cells, and the combination effects of 5-aza-dC with radiation showed greater cellular effects than that of single treatment, suggesting that the combination of 5-aza-dC and radiation has the potential to become a clinical strategy for the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1970028952,"We used the so called “land-bridge island” or “nested-subsets” theory to test the resilience of a highly fragmented and perturbated waterbird metacommunity, after legal protection of 18 wetlands in the western Mediterranean. Sites were monitored during 28 years and two seasons per year. The metacommunity was composed by 44 species during breeding and 67 species during wintering, including shorebirds, ducks, herons, gulls and divers (Podicipedidae). We identified a strong nested pattern. Consistent with the fact that the study system was to a large extent a spatial biogeographical continuous for thousands of years, fragmented only during the last centuries due to human activities. Non-random selective extinction was the most likely historical process creating the nested pattern, operated by the differential carrying capacity (surface-area) of the remaining sites. We also found a positive temporal trend in nestedness and a decreasing trend in species turnover among sites (β-diversity), indicating that sites are increasingly more alike to each other (i.e. increased biotic homogenization). This decreasing trend in β-diversity was explained by an increasing trend in local (α) diversity by range expansion of half the study species. Regional (γ) diversity also increased over time, indicating that colonization from outside the study system also occurred. Overall our results suggest that the study metacommunity is recovering from historical anthropogenic perturbations, showing a high long-term resilience, as expected for highly vagile waterbirds. However, not all waterbird groups contributed equally to the recovery, with most breeding shorebird species and most wintering duck species showing no geographical expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1970224376,"In this study we explore the impact of asymmetrical vs. uniform crown shading on the mortality and growth of upper and lower branches within tree crowns, for two conifer species: shade intolerant lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and shade tolerant white spruce (Picea glauca). We also explore xylem hydraulics, foliar nutrition, and carbohydrate status as drivers for growth and expansion of the lower and upper branches in various types of shading. This study was conducted over a two-year period across 10 regenerating forest sites dominated by lodgepole pine and white spruce, in the lower foothills of Alberta, Canada. Trees were assigned to one of four shading treatments: (1), complete uniform shading of the entire tree, (2) light asymmetric shading where the lower 1/4-1/3 of the tree crown was shaded, (3) heavy asymmetric shading as in (2) except with greater light reduction and (4) control in which no artificial shading occurred and most of the entire crown was exposed to full light. Asymmetrical shading of only the lower crown had a larger negative impact on the bud expansion and growth than did uniform shading, and the effect was stronger in pine relative to spruce. In addition, lower branches in pine also had lower carbon reserves, and reduced xylem-area specific conductivity compared to spruce. For both species, but particularly the pine, the needles of lower branches tended to store less C than upper branches in the asymmetric shade, which could suggest a movement of reserves away from the lower branches. The implications of these findings correspond with the inherent shade tolerance and self-pruning behavior of these conifers and supports a carbon based mechanism for branch mortality--mediated by an asymmetry in light exposure of the crown."
https://openalex.org/W2069870872,"A chemical inhibition model of inflammation is proposed by semi-continuous monitoring the density of toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) expressed on mammalian cells following bacterial infection to investigate an in vivo-mimicked drug screening system. The inflammation was induced by adding bacterial lysate (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to a mammalian cell culture (e.g., A549 cell line). The TLR1 density on the same cells was immunochemically monitored up to three cycles under optimized cyclic bacterial stimulation-and-restoration conditions. The assay was carried out by adopting a cell-compatible immunoanalytical procedure and signal generation method. Signal intensity relative to the background control obtained without stimulation was employed to plot the standard curve for inflammation. To suppress the inflammatory response, sodium salicylate, which inhibits nuclear factor-κB activity, was used to prepare the standard curve for anti-inflammation. Such measurement of differential TLR densities was used as a biosensing approach discriminating the anti-inflammatory substance from the non-effector, which was simulated by using caffeic acid phenethyl ester and acetaminophen as the two components, respectively. As the same cells exposed to repetitive bacterial stimulation were semi-continuously monitored, the efficacy and toxicity of the inhibitors may further be determined regarding persistency against time. Therefore, this semi-continuous biosensing model could be appropriate as a substitute for animal-based experimentation during drug screening prior to pre-clinical tests."
https://openalex.org/W2069595544,"The Unfolded Protein Response is a homeostatic mechanism that permits eukaryotic cells to cope with Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress caused by excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The more conserved branch of the UPR relies on an ER transmembrane enzyme, Ire1, which, upon ER stress, promotes the unconventional splicing of a small intron from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor Xbp1. In mammals, two specific regions (the hydrophobic region 2 - HR2 - and the C-terminal translational pausing site) present in the Xbp1unspliced protein mediate the recruitment of the Xbp1 mRNA-ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane, so that Xbp1 mRNA can be spliced by Ire1. Here, we generated a Drosophila Xbp1 deletion mutant (Excision101) lacking both HR2 and C-terminal region, but not the Ire1 splicing site. We show that Ire1-dependent splicing of Xbp1 mRNA is reduced, but not abolished in Excision101. Our results suggest the existence of additional mechanisms for ER membrane targeting of Xbp1 mRNA that are independent of the C-terminal domain of Drosophila Xbp1unspliced."
https://openalex.org/W2070783224,"Objectives To examine the clinical utility of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing in achieving medium-term vitamin D (VD) sufficiency in a managed care population. Methods Retrospective study of a continuously-enrolled patient population in a 3-year period between 2011 and 2013. Primary outcome was VD status at ∼1 year after 25(OH)D testing. Patient demographics, comorbidities, medications, and 25(OH)D test results were gathered from relevant databases and multivariate logistic regression analysis used to study the risk factors of persistent VD deficiency or insufficiency. Results Of 22,784 patients, 7533 (females 69.3%) did 14,563 25(OH)D tests, with an estimated cost of $582,520. Of the 7533 patients, 1126 had another 25(OH)D test at 300–400 days after the first one. Based on the two test results, 234 patients (20.8%) maintained sufficient 25(OH)D levels; 132 (11.7%) turned from VD-sufficient into VD-insufficient or -deficient; 538 (47.8%) remained VD-insufficient or -deficient, and only 222 (19.7%) improved to be VD-sufficient. Overall, only 8.0% more patients were VD-sufficient at ∼1 year after 25(OH)D testing. Only younger age and higher BMI were independent risk factors for persistent low 25(OH)D levels and high-dose VD use was not associated with achieving VD sufficiency. Conclusions 25(OH)D testing only benefits a small portion of patients thus lacks clinical utility in achieving VD sufficiency in the medium term but incurs a significant cost. A practical strategy to treat VD deficiency or insufficiency is needed; without it, 25(OH)D testing adds little value to most patients’ health and should be used with discretion."

Topoisomerase V is the sole member of the type IC topoisomerase subtype.

Residues Arg-131, Arg-144, His-200, Glu-215, Lys-218, and Tyr-226 were mutated individually to a series of conservative and non-conservative amino acids, and the DNA relaxation activity at different pH values, times, and enzyme concentrations was compared with wild-type activity. The results suggest that Arg-144 is essential for protein stability because any substitution at this position was deleterious and that Arg-131 and His-200 are involved in transition state stabilization. Glu-215 reduces the DNA binding ability of topoisomerase V, especially in shorter fragments with fewer helix-hairpin-helix DNA binding motifs.

Topoisomerases are divided into two main types (Type I and Type II) based on whether they cleave single- or double-stranded DNA. Each type is further subdivided based on mechanism, sequence characteristics, and structure. Type II enzymes form dimeric or tetrameric complexes to coordinate the simultaneous cleavage of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and pass an intact double strand through the resulting break (5.Champoux J.J. DNA Topoisomerases: Structure, Function, and Mechanism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). Type I enzymes, on the other hand, cleave a single strand of DNA and pass a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) or dsDNA through the break or rotate the broken ssDNA around the intact ssDNA (5.Champoux J.J.

Topoisomerases use transesterification chemistry to cleave and religate DNA during relaxation of DNA supercoils. First, a general base catalyst abstracts a proton from the active site tyrosyl oxygen and activates it for nucleophilic attack on the phosphate backbone of DNA. Upon attack, a pentavalent phosphorane transition state forms, accompanied by the buildup of negative charge on the non-bridging oxygens. The pentavalent intermediate is usually stabilized by Arg, Lys, or His residues. The transition state is resolved when a general acid makes possible the expulsion of the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of a phosphotyrosine bond and cleavage of DNA (11.Krogh B.O.

DNA relaxation occurs at this stage either by strand passage or controlled rotation. The reversal of the above steps occurs when the free hydroxyl oxygen generated in the first reaction attacks the phosphorus of the covalent phosphotyrosine bond. The enzyme and the relaxed DNA molecule are released at the end of the reaction cycle (6.Baker N.M. Rajan R. Mondragón A. Structural studies of type I topoisomerases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Type IA topoisomerases form a covalent phosphotyrosine link with the 5′ end of the broken DNA strand, relax negatively supercoiled DNA, and require divalent metal cations and ssDNA regions for activity (5.Champoux J.J.

Type IC is the newest subtype of Type I topoisomerases. Methanopyrus Topo-V is currently the sole member of this subtype. It was first identified in the hyperthermophilic archaeon M. kandleri and was later found in other Methanopyrus species. Topo-V is a two-domain protein, with an N-terminal topoisomerase domain followed by 24 helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs arranged as 12 tandem (HhH)2 domains (8.Taneja B. Patel A. Slesarev A.

Some of the (HhH)2 domains are involved in DNA repair, and there are at least two apurinic/apyrimidinic site-processing active sites (31.Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H.

Topo-V displays many characteristics similar to those of type IB enzymes; it can relax positively and negatively supercoiled DNA, forms a transient covalent bond with the 3′ end of the broken DNA, does not require magnesium for activity, and relaxes DNA by a swiveling mechanism (7.Slesarev A.I.

The most striking differences, which place Topo-V in an entirely different subtype, are the distinct domain organization with two different DNA processing activities, the unique structure of the topoisomerase domain, and the lack of sequence similarity with any other topoisomerase subtype (8.Taneja B. Patel A. Slesarev A. Mondragón A.

DNA topoisomerase V: a new fold of mysterious origin.Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 245-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase domain is mainly α-helical, with a helix-turn-helix motif carrying some of the important catalytic residues, and four of the (HhH)2 domains curling around the topoisomerase domain (8.Taneja B. Patel A. Slesarev A. Mondragón A.

Structures of minimal catalytic fragments of topoisomerase V reveals conformational changes relevant for DNA binding.Structure. 2010; 18: 829-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The active site of Topo-V contains five catalytic residues, which are identical to those found in the eukaryotic type IB active site: Tyr-226, Arg-131, Arg-144, His-200, and Lys-218 (8.Taneja B. Patel A. Slesarev A. Mondragón A. Structure of the N-terminal fragment of topoisomerase V reveals a new family of topoisomerases.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previously, Tyr-226 was shown to be the nucleophile for the topoisomerase reaction (31.Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H. Slesarev A.I. A type IB topoisomerase with DNA repair activities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite such close correspondence in residue identities, the overall active site structure of Topo-V differs drastically from that of the type IB enzymes, and the catalytic pentads are not superimposable (Fig. 1) (8.Taneja B. Patel A. Slesarev A. Mondragón A. Structure of the N-terminal fragment of topoisomerase V reveals a new family of topoisomerases.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A superposition based on Tyr-226, Arg-131, and Arg-144 shows that the lysines in Topo-V and type IB enzymes fall on opposite sides of the active site (8.Taneja B. Patel A. Slesarev A. Mondragón A. Structure of the N-terminal fragment of topoisomerase V reveals a new family of topoisomerases.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, another major difference is the presence of an acidic residue, Glu-215, in Topo-V, which is located within 3–4 Å of the catalytic Tyr-226 (35.Rajan R. Taneja B. Mondragón A. Structures of minimal catalytic fragments of topoisomerase V reveals conformational changes relevant for DNA binding.Structure. 2010; 18: 829-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The role of this glutamate is unknown, but in type IA topoisomerases, a proximal glutamate serves as a proton donor for the DNA cleavage reaction (13.Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragón A. Crystal structure of a complex of a type IA DNA topoisomerase with a single-stranded DNA molecule.Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lack of structural conservation between the active sites of Topo-V and type IB enzymes suggests that Topo-V might employ a different mechanism for DNA cleavage and religation. The aim of the present study was to test the essentiality of the catalytic pentad and glutamate in the topoisomerization reaction and identify potential roles in catalysis of these residues. The catalytic pentad and the active site glutamate were individually mutated to several amino acids with different characteristics, and the effects on DNA relaxation over a range of pH values, times, and enzyme concentrations were analyzed. The results suggest that Arg-144 is essential because mutations at this position affected protein expression and enzymatic activity. Residues Arg-131, Lys-218, His-200, and Glu-215 were successfully mutated to several amino acids with different characteristics. The mutagenesis results suggest a role for each of the active site residues. Arg-131 and His-200 are potentially involved in transition state stabilization, and Lys-218 should have a more direct role in catalysis (e.g. as a proton donor/proton relay for the reaction). Glu-215 does not contribute directly to the topoisomerase catalytic mechanism but instead affects DNA binding characteristics of Topo-V, especially in shorter fragments of Topo-V with fewer (HhH)2 domains. These observations manifest that although type IB and type IC topoisomerases have different active site architectures, they both use a similar mechanism for DNA cleavage/religation. Arg-131, Arg-144, His-200, Glu-215, Lys-218, and Tyr-226 were individually mutated to the residues listed in Table 1 on the pET15bT44 and pET14bT78 expression plasmids. The pET15bT44 plasmid carries the coding sequence for the 44-kDa amino-terminal fragment of Topo-V (Topo-44) that extends to residue 380 (35.Rajan R. Taneja B. Mondragón A.

For mutagenesis, DNA primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were designed for use with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For protein production, Topo-44 mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta (DE3) cells, whereas Topo-78 mutants were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Protein induction and purification was done according to protocols reported previously (35.Rajan R. Taneja B. Mondragón A.

Pure protein was concentrated and stored in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. All of the mutants were analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm the mutation through its molecular weight (Table 2). Topo-78 R144A was very unstable and degraded during storage, preventing accurate mass spectrometry analysis. To ensure that inactivity was not the result of folding defects, the secondary structures of the inactive mutants were tested by circular dichroism (CD) (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Mutants that were designed in both the Topo-44 and Topo-78 fragmentsResidueDesigned mutationsPurified in Topo-44 backbonePurified in Topo-78 backboneArginine 131Ala, Lys, GlnAla, LysAla, GlnArginine 144Ala, Lys, GlnAlaHistidine 200Ala, Arg, Asn, Gln, GluAla, Arg, Asn, Gln, GluAla, Arg, Asn, GluGlutamate 215Ala, His, Leu, Gln, ArgAla, His, Gln, ArgAla, His, Leu, GlnLysine 218Ala, Glu, Gln, ArgArgAla, Glu, Gln, ArgTyrosine 226PhePhePhe Open table in a new tab TABLE 2MS analysis of the different proteins used in the experimentsNameMr from MSDifference in Mr compared with WTExpected difference in MrT44wt43,884.09T44R131A43,799.118585T44R131K43,8562828T44H200R43,9031919T44H200A41,257.14−2626.9566.05T44H200Q43,87599T44H200N43,8612323T44H200E43,876.1688T44E215A43,826.045858T44E215R43,911.212727T44E215Q43,883.311T44E215H43,892.2588T44K218R43,918.8334.7416T44Y226F43,868.011616T78wt78,426.66T78R131A78,341.1985.4785.11T78H200A78,360.4566.2166.16T78H200R78,445.8419.1819.04T78H200N78,403.7522.9123.04T78H200E78,419.367.38.03T78E215A78,368.2658.458.03T78E215Q78,426.520.140.99T78E215L78,410.3416.3215.96T78E215H78,434.357.698.02T78K218A78,368.957.7657.19T78K218E78,427.671.010.94T78K218R78,454.7328.0728.01T78Y226F78,410.2616.416 Open table in a new tab DNA relaxation assays were carried out as described previously (35.Rajan R.

Briefly, the enzyme was incubated with 250 ng of negatively supercoiled pUC19 plasmid in 15 µl of reaction mix containing a 50 mm concentration of the appropriate buffer, 30 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA for 15 min. Activity was measured at 65 °C, covering a pH range from 4 to 10. The different buffers used were sodium acetate for pH 4 and 5, MES for pH 6, HEPES for pH 7, Tris for pH 8, CHES for pH 9, and CAPS for pH 10. The pH of all buffers was adjusted at 65 °C. For Topo-78 mutants, 0.15 µg of enzyme and for Topo-44 mutants, 0.75 µg of pure enzyme were used in each reaction unless otherwise noted. Protein concentration gradients and time course reactions were also carried out with the different mutants to analyze the effect of varying enzyme concentration and incubation times on the DNA relaxation activity. For both time and concentration gradient experiments, the buffer was at pH 5. For concentration gradient and time course experiments, the relaxation was quantified using ImageQuant (version 5.2) based on the appearance of relaxed or partially relaxed DNA in each lane. Two important assumptions were made: 1) the amount of nicked DNA in a plasmid is constant, and 2) relaxed and nicked DNA run identically under the experimental conditions used. Based on the fact that on a given lane, DNAtot = DNAn + DNAsc + DNArel, where DNAtot is the total amount of DNA in the reaction, DNAn is the amount of nicked DNA, DNAsc is amount of fully supercoiled DNA, and DNArel is the amount of relaxed and partially relaxed DNA (topoisomers), it is possible to write the fraction of relaxed DNA as freli = 1 − fn0 − fsci, where the superscript refers to either a time point or a concentration condition, and fn0 refers to the fraction of nicked DNA either at the starting time or in the absence of protein. In practice, first, a large rectangular box was drawn around each lane and covering both the supercoiled and relaxed DNA, and the total intensity inside of this box was measured (BB). Next, a smaller box was drawn covering the supercoiled plasmid in each lane, and the intensity was measured (SB). To correct for variations in the background, BB and SB were selected in an empty lane, and the intensity was measured. The background values were subtracted from the corresponding boxes in the sam"
https://openalex.org/W2039417622,"The Snail transcription factor regulates diverse aspects of stem cell biology in organisms ranging from Drosophila to mammals. Here we have asked whether it regulates the biology of neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the forebrain of postnatal and adult mice, taking advantage of a mouse containing a floxed Snail allele (Snailfl/fl mice). We show that when Snail is inducibly ablated in the embryonic cortex, this has long-term consequences for cortical organization. In particular, when Snailfl/fl mice are crossed to Nestin-cre mice that express Cre recombinase in embryonic neural precursors, this causes inducible ablation of Snail expression throughout the postnatal cortex. This loss of Snail causes a decrease in proliferation of neonatal cortical neural precursors and mislocalization and misspecification of cortical neurons. Moreover, these precursor phenotypes persist into adulthood. Adult neural precursor cell proliferation is decreased in the forebrain subventricular zone and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and this is coincident with a decrease in the number of adult-born olfactory and hippocampal neurons. Thus, Snail is a key regulator of the numbers of neural precursors and newborn neurons throughout life."

We now describe our results of HC transfer experiments to chondroitin sulfate A, chemically desulfated chondroitin, chemoenzymatically synthesized chondroitin, unsulfated heparosan, heparan sulfate, and alginate. Of these potential HC acceptors, only chemically desulfated chondroitin and chemoenzymatically synthesized chondroitin were HC acceptors. The kinetics of HC transfer to chondroitin was similar to HA. At earlier time points, HCs were more widely distributed among the different sizes of chondroitin chains. As time progressed, the HCs migrated to lower molecular weight chains of chondroitin. Our interpretation is that TSG-6 swaps the HCs from the larger, reversible sites on chondroitin chains, which function as HC acceptors, onto smaller chondroitin chains, which function as irreversible HC acceptors. HCs transferred to smaller chondroitin chains were unable to be swapped off the smaller chondroitin chains and transferred to HA.

Induction of TSG-6 gene expression typically occurs in 2–4 h (8.Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. A novel secretory tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein (TSG-6) is a member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, closely related to the adhesion receptor CD44.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and it is generally considered an acute phase protein. The formation of HC-HA starts when TSG-6 removes an HC from inter-α-inhibitor to form a covalent HC-TSG-6 intermediate (18.Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. Characterization of complexes formed between TSG-6 and inter-α-inhibitor that act as intermediates in the covalent transfer of heavy chains onto hyaluronan.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the presence of HA, TSG-6 rapidly transfers the HC to HA. In the absence of HA, or another HC acceptor, TSG-6 “shuffles” HCs between IαI molecules with two HCs and produces some forms with one HC or three HCs (19.Sanggaard K.W. Scavenius C. Rasmussen A.J. Wisniewski H.G. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. The TSG-6/HC2-mediated transfer is a dynamic process shuffling heavy chains between glycosaminoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21988-21993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TSG-6 is also known to shuffle HCs between larger HA molecules until an equilibrium is reached where the HCs are evenly distributed between individual HA molecules (20.Lauer M.E. Glant T.T. Mikecz K.

Chem. 2013; 288: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, HC transfer between larger HA molecules is a reversible event. In contrast, when TSG-6 transfers HCs to smaller HA molecules such as HA oligosaccharides 8–21 monosaccharides in length, this is an irreversible event where subsequent HC swapping cannot occur (20.Lauer M.E. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. DeAngelis P.L. Haller F.M. Husni M.E. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Irreversible heavy chain transfer to hyaluronan oligosaccharides by tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6.J. Biol.

Little is known regarding the effect this has on leukocyte activation. There is evidence that CD44 “caps” (i.e. becomes more densely populated) on the surface of a monocytic cell line in the region where it is bound to HC-HA (22.Wang A. de la Motte C. Lauer M. Hascall V. Hyaluronan matrices in pathobiological processes.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subsequent HA degradation was observed by these cells, indicative of a phagocytic phenotype. In this study, we investigated the ability of different glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and an anionic polysaccharide with GAG-like chemophysical properties, to function as HC acceptors. We also tested the ability of these GAGs to function as irreversible HC acceptors. Human serum was used as our source of IαI (donor 736; Equitech-Bio Inc., Kerrville, TX). Whole serum was used, and IαI was not purified from the serum. Recombinant human TSG-6 (2104-TS; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was resuspended at 0.005 mg/ml. Two independently sourced chondroitin preparations were employed in this study: (a) chemically desulfated (acid-methanol treatment) shark cartilage chondroitin (400640; Seikagaku, Japan) or (b) chemoenzymatically synthesized chondroitin (quasi-monodisperse with average molecular mass, 40 kDa; method of Tracy et al.

The former preparation contains some residual sulfate groups (∼6% of the disaccharide units), but the latter preparation completely lacks sulfation due to the in vitro synthetic scheme. In addition, the chemical desulfation process results in chain fragmentation. Quasi-monodisperse unsulfated heparosan (average molecular mass, 29 kDa; method of Sismey-Ragatz et al.

Quasi-monodisperse HA 1,000 kDa in size (molecular mass/number average molecular weight = 1.007) was purchased from Hyalose, L.L.C. (HYA-1000K-1; Oklahoma City, OK). The HA14 oligosaccharide, 14 monosaccharides in length, was kindly provided by Seikagaku (lot 010618). Heparan sulfate was purchased from Seikagaku (400700-1A). Chondroitin sulfate A (sturgeon notochord) was also purchased from Seikagaku (400658-1A); its disaccharide composition was 6% ΔDi0S, 24% ΔDi6S, and 70% ΔDi4S (as determined by fluorophore-assisted-carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) analysis; data not shown). Two different alginates were used (A2033 and A2158; Sigma-Aldrich). The antibody against IαI was purchased from Dako (A0301, Dako North America, Inc. Carpinteria, CA). Streptomyces hyaluronidase (100740-1, Seikagaku, East Falmouth, MA) was used at 8 microunits/µl of reaction volume. An HA ladder of different sizes of HA oligosaccharides and polysaccharides was generated by limited digestion of HA (80190; 1.7 kDa; Lifecore Biomedical, Chaska, MN) with ovine testicular hyaluronidase (109169; Roche Applied Science). This was done by incubating 1 µl of a 12.8 µg/ml stock of testicular hyaluronidase with 100 µl of sodium hyaluronate at 1 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 for 15.5 h at 37 °C. The reaction volumes were 25 µl of PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 5% serum supplemented with 1.25 µg of HA, chondroitin, CS, heparan sulfate, heparosan, alginate, and/or 0.005 µg TSG-6. TSG-6 was always added last and marked the beginning of the incubation period (time 0). EDTA was used to stop the reaction by adding 0.5 µl of a 0.5 m (pH 8.0) solution. In HC-swapping studies, HCs were first transferred to HA or chondroitin molecules, and after a specified time, equal mass amounts of HA or chondroitin were added to the same reaction mixture for a specified time. All experiments included negative and positive controls, as described for each figure. Most experiments included internal replicates (i.e. incubations at different time points). For those that did not, they were repeated for confirmation at least one time. FACE was used to assess the purity of the HA oligosaccharides used in the size range study. This method has been described previously (26.Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J.

Samples were electrophoresed on 4–15% mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted using the Bio-Rad nitrocellulose and Trans-Blot Turbo System. Samples of 25 µl with 1.25 µl of serum gave a strong HC signal on the blots with an IαI antibody (A0301, Dako North America, Inc. Carpinteria, CA; 1:8000 dilution). The molecular weight standard was purchased from Li-Cor (928-40000). The blots were blocked for 1 h with Li-Cor blocking buffer (927-40000; Li-Cor) and then probed with the IαI antibody (dilution 1:8000) in the blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The blots were washed 5× in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with an IRDYE secondary antibody (Li-Cor; 926-32213) at 1:15,000 dilution in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% lauryl sulfate for 45 min. The blots were washed as described previously and imaged on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). We tested the ability of different GAGs to function as HC acceptors (Fig. 1). We also tested the ability of two different alginate preparations (described from the manufacturer as having low and medium viscosity) to function as HC acceptors. The rationale for testing alginate was that this polymer is a linear, anionic polysaccharide with GAG-like chemophysical properties. Human serum was our source of IαI (A, lane 1). We had two positive controls: (i) a HA oligosaccharide, 14 monosaccharides in length (HA14), that induces a gel shift when HCs are transferred from the chondroitin sulfate chain of IαI (250 kDa) to a single HC molecule (84 kDa) (lane 3), and (ii) the redistribution of the IαI band (250 kDa) to the top of the gel when HCs are transferred to a HA molecule with a mass of 1000 kDa (i.e. it is too large to enter the gel) (lane 4). Lane 10 portrays an important negative control in which IαI was incubated with TSG-6 alone, for the entire reaction period (4 h). In the absence of a HC acceptor, TSG-6 shuffles HCs between IαI molecules, producing IαI with an extra HC (i.e. three HCs), IαI lacking one of its two HCs (i.e. containing only one HC), and the release of free HCs. This has been previously demonstrated in an earlier study (20.Lauer M.E. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. DeAngelis P.L. Haller F.M. Husni M.E. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Irreversible heavy chain transfer to hyaluronan oligosaccharides by tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At longer incubation times, such as 24 h, TSG-6 will disassemble IαI, completely releasing all HCs and bikunin (20.Lauer M.E. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. DeAngelis P.L. Haller F.M. Husni M.E. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Irreversible heavy chain transfer to hyaluronan oligosaccharides by tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the doublet of bands at ∼125 kDa is likely the covalently TSG-6-HC intermediate (18.Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. Characterization of complexes formed between TSG-6 and inter-α-inhibitor that act as intermediates in the covalent transfer of heavy chains onto hyaluronan.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present experiment, the IαI band profile will resemble the profile in lane 10 if the glycan added to the reaction mixture is not an HC acceptor. Thus, neither chondroitin sulfate (lane 6), heparan sulfate (lane 7), or the two alginate preparations (lanes 8 and 9), functioned as HC acceptors. In contrast, HC transfer to chemically desulfated chondroitin was observed as a cluster of bands (due to the polydisperse nature of this polymer), ranging from ∼90–140 kDa (lane 5). We expanded this observation to include similar sizes of synthetic HA (41 kDa), chemoenzymatically synthesized unsulfated chondroitin (40 kDa), and unsulfated heparosan (29 kDa) (B). HA and chondroitin accepted HCs, but heparosan, a polysaccharide with the identical monosacharide composition as HA but connected with different glycosidic linkages, did not. We used FACE analysis to confirm the disaccharide composition of our desulfated shark cartilage chondroitin preparation and the size distribution of individual chondroitin chains within this preparation (Fig. 2). The unsulfated chondroitin disaccharide (ΔDi0S) comprised 94% of the total GAG, with 3% composition for sulfation on the 6-OH of N-acetylgalactosamine (ΔDi6S) and 3% for sulfation on the 4-OH of this hexosamine (ΔDi4S). We labeled the individual, undigested, chains of chondroitin with AMAC and ANTS (lanes 3 and 6, respectively) to measure the size distribution of the GAG. For comparison, we labeled a HA ladder, generated by a limited digest with testicular hyaluronidase, with AMAC and ANTS (lanes 4 and 7, respectively). The resolution of the chondroitin bands was good but not quite as sharp as for HA. Our interpretation is that some of the chondroitin chains contained 4S and 6S, thus somewhat affecting the banding pattern and creating a cluster of bands on the gel. That being said, it is clear from the AMAC labeled chondroitin preparation that oligonucleotides as small as HA4 and -6 were detectable. It should be noted that AMAC labeled HA oligonucleotides do not migrate in the predicted pattern (i.e. from largest to smallest). This phenomenon has been described previously (14.Kota D.J. Wiggins L.L. Yoon N. Lee R.H. TSG-6 produced by hMSCs delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes by suppressing Th1 development and enhancing tolerogenicity.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 2048-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Regardless, from HA8 and larger, the banding pattern for AMAC-labeled oligonucleotides is as expected (i.e. smaller oligonucleotides migrate faster). Because eight monosaccharides are the minimum size of HA that can function as a HC acceptor, chondroitin chains eight monosaccharides and above are the most relevant to this study (28.Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fülöp C. Specificity of the tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 6-mediated heavy chain transfer from inter-α-trypsin inhibitor to hyaluronan: implications for the assembly of the cumulus extracellular matrix.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By comparing lanes 3 and 4, it is clear that our preparation of shark cartilage chondroitin contains chains at least as small as eight monosaccharides and as large as 40 or greater. This finding is also confirmed in lanes 6 and 7 that portray ANTS-labeled GAG chains. In our gel system, ANTS is only able to resolve GAG chains 14 monosaccharides and above. For this reason, we ran HA14 as a standard in lane 8. By comparing lanes 6 and 7, it is clear that the chondroitin preparation contains chains at least 14 monosaccharides in length and greater, ranging 40 monosaccharides and above. It should also be noted that the disaccharide composition of the chondroitin sulfate preparation from Fig. 1, lane 6, was 6% ΔDi0S, 24% ΔDi6S, and 70% ΔDi4S (as determined by FACE analysis; data not shown). In a previous study, we showed that HC transfer to HA, under defined experimental conditions, was detectable as early as 30 min after the addition of TSG-6 and complete between 2–4 h (20.Lauer M.E. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. DeAngelis P.L. Haller F.M. Husni M.E. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Irreversible heavy chain transfer to hyaluronan oligosaccharides by tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We tested the kinetics of HC transfer to chondroitin under these same experimental conditions (Fig. 3). The kinetics of HC transfer to chondroitin were nearly identical to the kinetics of HC transfer to HA (11.Roddy G.W. Oh J.Y. Lee R.H. Bartosh T.J. Ylostalo J. Coble K. Rosa Jr., R.H. Prockop D.J. Action at a distance: systemically administered adult stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) reduce inflammatory damage to the cornea without engraftment and primarily by secretion of TNF-α-stimulated gene/protein 6.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 1572-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the earliest (30 min) HC transfer to chondroitin was to higher molecular mass chains of chondroitin, as indicated by a 120-kDa band (lane 4). Thirty minutes later, HC distribution among different sizes of chondroitin chains was observed (lane 5). After 2 h, the HC distribution among the smaller sizes of chondroitin chains stabilized and did not change, significantly, for up to 8 h. Given the choice of HC transfer to HA or chondroitin, we wanted to determine whether TSG-6 had a GAG preference for HC transfer. To test this, we incubated human serum (i.e. our IαI source) with TSG-6 and combinations of HA14, HA1000K, and chondroitin (Fig. 4). When chondroitin and HA14 (lane 6) or chondroitin and HA1000K (lane 7) were mixed together with TSG-6 for 4 or 24 h (lanes 8 and 9, respectively), HCs from IαI (human serum) were preferentially transferred onto HA instead of chondroitin. Lanes 3–5 are controls where the GAGs were added separately. Lane 10 is a control where serum was incubated with TSG-6 alone to demonstrate the release of free HCs from IαI during a 24-h incubation period. Given the choice, TSG-6 prefers to transfer HCs to HA instead of chondroitin. We wanted to know whether HCs could be “swapped” from chondroitin to HA (Fig. 5). We transferred HCs to chondroitin for 24 h (lane 1) and then added HA14 from 1–24 additional hours (lanes 4–8). HCs transferred to chondroitin remained attached to chondroitin and could not be swapped onto HA14. Lane 9 is a control showing HC transfer to HA14 in the absence of chondroitin. Lane 10 is an end point control showing the stability of HC transfer to chondroitin in the absence of HA14 for 48 h. The experiment portrayed in Fig. 6 is very similar to the one portrayed in Fig. 5 with the exception that HC swapping from chondroitin to HA1000K was also tested. In this experiment, HCs were transferred to chondroitin for 24 and 48 h to show the stability of the end product (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). After a 24-h incubation in which TSG-6 transferred HCs to chondroitin, HA14 was added to the reaction mixture for 4 and 24 additional hours (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Similarly, After a 24-h incubation in which TSG-6 transferred HCs to chondroitin, HA1000K was added to the reaction mixture for 4 and 24 additional hours (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). As can be seen when comparing to controls showing complete HC transfer to HA14 and HA alone (lanes 7 and 10, respectively), once HCs were transferred to chondroitin, they could not be swapped onto HA. Thus, we conclude that HC transfer to a certain size of chondroitin GAG chain is an irreversible event where subsequent swapping does not occur. In the experiment described in Fig. 4, we learned that, given the opportunity, TSG-6 prefers to transfer HCs to HA instead of chondroitin. In FIGURE 4., FIGURE 5., we demonstrated that once the HCs are transferred to certain size of chondroitin, they cannot be swapped from chondroitin to HA (i.e. the process is irreversible). Previously, we have shown that TSG-6 can remove nearly all of the HCs from HC-HA1000K and swap them onto HA14 (20.Lauer M.E. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. DeAngelis P.L. Haller F.M. Husni M.E. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Irreversible heavy chain transfer to hyaluronan oligosaccharides by tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This process was irreversible. In Fig. 7, we present data showing that, once transferred to HA, HCs cannot be swapped from HA to chondroitin. HC transfer to HA1000K for 24 h produces a HC-HA1000K complex that is too large to enter the gel (lane"
https://openalex.org/W2091681920,"This study explores how the metal materials of the applicator influence the dose distribution when performing brachytherapy for cervical cancer. A pinpoint ionization chamber, Monte Carlo code MCNPX, and treatment planning system are used to evaluate the dose distribution for a single Ir-192 source positioned in the tandem and ovoid. For dose distribution in water with the presence of the tandem, differences among measurement, MCNPX calculation and treatment planning system results are <5%. For dose distribution in water with the presence of the ovoid, the MCNPX result agrees with the measurement. But the doses calculated from treatment planning system are overestimated by up to a factor of 4. This is due to the shielding effect of the metal materials in the applicator not being considered in the treatment planning system. This result suggests that the treatment planning system should take into account corrections for the metal materials of the applicator in order to improve the accuracy of the radiation dose delivered."
