We determined the baseline prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and the effect of TDF on BMD in men who have sex with men (MSM) in a PrEP trial in San Francisco. Methods/Findings We evaluated 1) the prevalence of low BMD using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) in a baseline cohort of 210 HIV-uninfected MSM who screened for a randomized clinical trial of daily TDF vs. placebo, and 2) the effects of TDF on BMD in a longitudinal cohort of 184 enrolled men. Half began study drug after a 9-month delay to evaluate changes in risk behavior associated with pill-use. At baseline, 20 participants (10%) had low BMD (Z score≤−2.0 at the L2–L4 spine, total hip, or femoral neck). Low BMD was associated with amphetamine (OR = 5.86, 95% CI 1.70–20.20) and inhalant (OR = 4.57, 95% CI 1.32–15.81) use; men taking multivitamins, calcium, or vitamin D were less likely to have low BMD at baseline (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.10–0.71). In the longitudinal analysis, there was a 1.1% net decrease in mean BMD in the TDF vs. the pre-treatment/placebo group at the femoral neck (95% CI 0.4–1.9%), 0.8% net decline at the total hip (95% CI 0.3–1.3%), and 0.7% at the L2–L4 spine (95% CI −0.1–1.5%). At 24 months, 13% vs. 6% of participants experienced >5% BMD loss at the femoral neck in the TDF vs. placebo groups (p = 0.13). Conclusions Ten percent of HIV-negative MSM had low BMD at baseline. TDF use resulted in a small but statistically significant decline in BMD at the total hip and femoral neck. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the trajectory of BMD changes and any association with clinical fractures. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00131677"
https://openalex.org/W2022309828,"Emerging evidence suggests that connexin mediated gap junctional intercellular communication contributes to many aspects of bone biology including bone development, maintenance of bone homeostasis and responsiveness of bone cells to diverse extracellular signals. Deletion of connexin 43, the predominant gap junction protein in bone, is embryonic lethal making it challenging to examine the role of connexin 43 in bone in vivo. However, transgenic murine models in which only osteocytes and osteoblasts are deficient in connexin 43, and which are fully viable, have recently been developed. Unfortunately, the bone phenotype of different connexin 43 deficient models has been variable. To address this issue, we used an osteocalcin driven Cre-lox system to create osteoblast and osteocyte specific connexin 43 deficient mice. These mice displayed bone loss as a result of increased bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis. The mechanism underlying this increased osteoclastogenesis included increases in the osteocytic, but not osteoblastic, RANKL/OPG ratio. Previous in vitro studies suggest that connexin 43 deficient bone cells are less responsive to biomechanical signals. Interestingly, and in contrast to in vitro studies, we found that connexin 43 deficient mice displayed an enhanced anabolic response to mechanical load. Our results suggest that transient inhibition of connexin 43 expression and gap junctional intercellular communication may prove a potentially powerful means of enhancing the anabolic response of bone to mechanical loading."
https://openalex.org/W2102942827,"Bacteria from the genus Polaromonas are dominant phylotypes in clone libraries and culture collections from polar and high-elevation environments. Although Polaromonas has been found on six continents, we do not know if the same phylotypes exist in all locations or if they exhibit genetic isolation by distance patterns. To examine their biogeographic distribution, we analyzed all available, long-read 16S rRNA gene sequences of Polaromonas phylotypes from glacial and periglacial environments across the globe. Using genetic isolation by geographic distance analyses, including Mantel tests and Mantel correlograms, we found that Polaromonas phylotypes are globally distributed showing weak isolation by distance patterns at global scales. More focused analyses using discrete, equally sampled distances classes, revealed that only two distance classes (out of 12 total) showed significant spatial structuring. Overall, our analyses show that most Polaromonas phylotypes are truly globally distributed, but that some, as yet unknown, environmental variable may be selecting for unique phylotypes at a minority of our global sites. Analyses of aerobiological and genomic data suggest that Polaromonas phylotypes are globally distributed as dormant cells through high-elevation air currents; Polaromonas phylotypes are common in air and snow samples from high altitudes, and a glacial-ice metagenome and the two sequenced Polaromonas genomes contain the gene hipA, suggesting that Polaromonas can form dormant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048523500,"The monosaccharide, β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), can be added to the hydroxyl group of either serines or threonines to generate an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) residue (Love, D. C., and Hanover, J. A. (2005) Sci. STKE 2005 312, 1–14; Hart, G. W., Housley, M. P., and Slawson, C. (2007) Nature 446, 1017–1022). This post-translational protein modification, termed O-GlcNAcylation, is reversible, analogous to phosphorylation, and has been implicated in many cellular processes. Here, we present evidence that in human cells all four core histones of the nucleosome are substrates for this glycosylation in the relative abundance H3, H4/H2B, and H2A. Increasing the intracellular level of UDP-GlcNAc, the nucleotide sugar donor substrate for O-GlcNAcylation enhanced histone O-GlcNAcylation and partially suppressed phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10ph). Expression of recombinant H3.3 harboring an S10A mutation abrogated histone H3 O-GlcNAcylation relative to its wild-type version, consistent with H3S10 being a site of histone O-GlcNAcylation (H3S10glc). Moreover, O-GlcNAcylated histones were lost from H3S10ph immunoprecipitates, whereas immunoprecipitation of either H3K4me3 or H3K9me3 (active or inactive histone marks, respectively) resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of O-GlcNAcylated histones. We also examined histone O-GlcNAcylation during cell cycle progression. Histone O-GlcNAcylation is high in G1 cells, declines throughout the S phase, increases again during late S/early G2, and persists through late G2 and mitosis. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation is a novel histone post-translational modification regulating chromatin conformation during transcription and cell cycle progression. The monosaccharide, β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), can be added to the hydroxyl group of either serines or threonines to generate an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) residue (Love, D. C., and Hanover, J. A. (2005) Sci. STKE 2005 312, 1–14; Hart, G. W., Housley, M. P., and Slawson, C. (2007) Nature 446, 1017–1022).

Thus, O-GlcNAcylation is a novel histone post-translational modification regulating chromatin conformation during transcription and cell cycle progression. O-GlcNAcylation, analogously to protein phosphorylation, occurs as a reversible post-translational modification of proteins involved in cell signaling, stress responses, and during cell growth (reviewed in Refs. 1Love, D. C., Hanover, J. A. (2005) Sci. STKE 2005, re13.Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). This glycosylation involves the addition of a single sugar molecule, β-N-acetylglucosamine, to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine (termed O-GlcNAc). This may lead to a reciprocal regulation of protein function because phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation may compete with each other for the same amino acid residue. O-GlcNAcylation has also been reported to regulate protein “turnover” by altering the activity of the proteasome or substrates targeted for degradation (3Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 218-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The level of O-GlcNAcylation is controlled within the cell by two evolutionarily conserved enzymes, a transferase (O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase or OGT) 4The abbreviations used are: OGTO-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferaseWGAwheat germ agglutininCTDC-terminal domainOGAO-GlcNAcaseTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineTAUTriton X-100/acetic acid/urea. and a hydrolase (O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, alternatively O-GlcNAcase or OGA), which add or remove, respectively, O-GlcNAc (4Hurtado-Guerrero R. Dorfmueller H.C. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). OGT is present in mammals as a single copy gene on the X chromosome, and its deletion in the mouse results in early (day E5 post-fertilization) embryonic lethality (5Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5735-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, OGT plays a role in insulin resistance as its deletion suppressed the induction of dauer formation in a genetic background defective for insulin signaling (6Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, knock-out of OGA promoted dauer formation (7Forsythe M.E. Love D.C. Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), supporting an involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in metabolic regulation in this animal. O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase wheat germ agglutinin C-terminal domain O-GlcNAcase N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine Triton X-100/acetic acid/urea. OGT in human cells interacts with phosphoinositide at the plasma membrane, where O-GlcNAcylation is believed to attenuate insulin signaling by suppressing the phosphorylation of protein kinase Akt (8Yang X. Ongusaha P.P. Miles P.D. Havstad J.C. Zhang F. So W.V. Kudlow J.E. Michell R.H. Olefsky J.M. Field S.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 964-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation may control cell growth by altering the stability of the tumor suppressor p53 (9Yang W.H. Kim J.E. Nam H.W. Ju J.W. Kim H.S. Kim Y.S. Cho J.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), as well as the NFκB-IκkB signaling pathway (10Kawauchi K. Araki K. Tobiume K. Tanaka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3431-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Yang W.H. Park S.Y. Nam H.W. Kim do H. Kang J.G. Kang E.S. Kim Y.S. Lee H.C. Kim K.S. Cho J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17345-17350Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In response to various cellular stresses, an increased level of protein O-GlcNAcylation was observed (12Zachara N.E. O'Donnell N. Cheung W.D. Mercer J.J. Marth J.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation may have an effect on the formation of protein complexes, as has been observed for ribosomal proteins and which, in this case, leads to an alternation of translational activities or RNA decay (13Ohn T. Kedersha N. Hickman T. Tisdale S. Anderson P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Modification of proteins by O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated in chromosome biology as this glycosylation is enriched in the condensed and repressed regions of Drosophila polytene chromosomes (14Kelly W.G. Hart G.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 243-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chromosomal proteins modified by O-GlcNAc are exemplified by many transcriptional factors, such as Sp1 (15Yang X. Su K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6611-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and c-Myc (16Chou T.Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), as well as p53 (9Yang W.H. Kim J.E. Nam H.W. Ju J.W. Kim H.S. Kim Y.S. Cho J.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A further role for this modification in regulating transcription is suggested by the reciprocal relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and elongation-dependent phosphorylation at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (17Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7845-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A direct role in transcriptional repression is suggested by the observation that the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain of OGT interacts with a transcriptional repressor, mSin3, which exists in a complex with a histone deacetylase involved in gene silencing (18Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Even more intriguingly, the C terminus of OGA contains a domain resembling a histone acetyltransferase domain that has been shown to be capable of acetylating nucleosomal histones in vitro (19Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Clearly, the associations between OGT and histone deacetylase and OGA and histone acetyltransferase activities suggest reciprocal and reversible control of gene expression. Two recent observations further highlight the potential for O-GlcNAcylation in the regulation of transcription. First, the gene encoding OGT in Drosophila has been mapped to a polycomb group (PcG) gene locus termed super sex combs (sxc), which is involved in the repression of homeotic genes during the development of this organism (20Sinclair D.A. Syrzycka M. Macauley M.S. Rastgardani T. Komljenovic I. Vocadlo D.J. Brock H.W. Honda B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13427-13432Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Gambetta M.C. Oktaba K. Müller J. Science. 2009; 325: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Second, O-GlcNAcylation of MLL5, a histone lysine methyltransferase, has been shown to lead to dimethylation of H3K4 required for retinoic acid-induced transcription during promyelocyte differentiation (22Fujiki R. Chikanishi T. Hashiba W. Ito H. Takada I. Roeder R.G. Kitagawa H. Kato S. Nature. 2009; 459: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, despite increasing evidence supporting the involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in multiple aspects of chromosome biology, the possibility that the histones proteins may also be the targets for O-GlcNAcylation remained to be investigated. This might relate to difficulty in mapping sites of O-GlcNAcylation via mass spectrometry due to the labile glycosidic bond and/or low stoichiometry of this modification on some proteins (1Love, D. C., Hanover, J. A. (2005) Sci. STKE 2005, re13.Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent data based on in silico analysis of histone post-translational modifications predict the occurrence of histone O-GlcNAcylation (23Kaleem A. Hoessli D.C. Ahmad I. Walker-Nasir E. Nasim A. Shakoori A.R. Nasir-ud-Din J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 103: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore used both antibodies and a lectin (wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) with specificity for O-GlcNAc to examine histones from human cells for O-GlcNAcylation. Here, we report that histones are indeed substrates for O-GlcNAcylation. Using both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis, we determined that all four nucleosomal core histones are O-GlcNAcylated in the relative order H3, H4 or H2B, and H2A. Furthermore, we provide multiple lines of evidence that serine 10 of histone H3 is indeed a site of O-GlcNAcylation (H3S10glc). Our data are compatible with the possibility of either an O-GlcNAc or an O-phosphate modification at serine 10 of histone H3. Increased global O-GlcNAcylation of all three isoforms of histone H3 resulted in a global loss of a modification indicative of active chromatin (H3K9Ac) and a corresponding global increase of a modification indicative of repressed chromatin (H3K9me3). Finally, histone O-GlcNAcylation correlated with progression of cells through the cell cycle. Specifically, histone O-GlcNAcylation was high in G1, globally decreased during S phase but re-emerged in late S/early G2, and persisted during mitosis. These findings suggest that regulation of histones by O-GlcNAcylation plays a regulatory role in chromosome metabolism during the cell cycle, with histone H3S10 being a major site of O-GlcNAcylation and global histone O-GlcNAcylation being specifically depleted during DNA replication. The mouse monoclonal antibodies CTD110.6 and RL2 specific to O-GlcNAc and the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against histone H3K9me3, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, and H3S28p were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The rabbit polyclonal IgG specific to histone H3S10ph was supplied by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All antibodies were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Human HeLa and HEK293 epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Lonza Walkersville, Inc., MD), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Lonza), and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Human CCRF-CEM, acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, and K562, erythroleukemia cells (both from ATCC), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS (Lonza) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Treatment with glucosamine was performed with actively growing cells by adding it to the cell culture medium at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, and up to 15 mm. The cells were harvested after overnight incubation (>16 h), and whole cell lysates or histones proteins were prepared as described below. Histone preparation was based on an acid extraction using hydrochloric acid (HCl). The extraction was performed at 4 °C with all buffers supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), and 80 μm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino N-phenylcarbamate (Sigma), an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase. The cultured cells were harvested and washed once with PBS, followed by a suspension of cell pellets in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2 and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were lysed by suspending them in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 75 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with repeated pipetting, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellets were washed in high salt buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 430 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to dissociate weakly interacting proteins and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. This high salt wash was repeated twice to minimize contamination with non-histone proteins. Histone proteins in the pellets were then extracted by treatment with 0.25 n HCl (in distilled H2O) and vigorous vortexing for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min to obtain the histone-enriched supernatants. This acid extraction was repeated twice, and both supernatants were combined, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min to clear the histone extracts. Eight volumes of acetone were then added per 1 volume of clarified histone extract and incubated at −20 °C overnight to precipitate proteins. Acetone-precipitated histones were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and washed once with 0.1 n HCl (in acetone) and twice with acetone alone. Histone pellets were air-dried and finally dissolved in a minimal volume of sterile distilled water. Histone preparations were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until required. Analysis of histones by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using the protocol described by Shechter et al. (24Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The first dimension of histone separation was obtained by TAU electrophoresis in a short (∼10 cm) gel, with a final gel volume of 10 ml that contained 3.6 g of urea, 2.5 ml of a 60:0.4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution, 500 μl of glacial acetic acid, 370 μl of Triton X-100; 60 μl of TEMED, and 140 μl of 10% ammonium persulfate. Histones to be loaded onto the TAU gel were mixed with a freshly prepared sample buffer generated as follows: 0.36 g of urea, 100 μl of 0.2% pyronin Y, 50 μl of glacial acetic acid, and 500 μl of 25 mg/ml protamine sulfate in a final volume of 1 ml. TAU gel electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for ∼90 min in a buffer of 5% glacial acetic acid. After TAU gel electrophoresis, conventional SDS-PAGE was performed in the second dimension to resolve individual histones and certain isoforms. For the second dimension, one lane from the TAU gel after electrophoresis of the histones was excised and incubated in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol with three changes each of 5 min duration. The equilibrated gel slice was then placed on top of a standard 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by an overlay of stack gel solution. After polymerization of the stacking gel, electrophoresis was performed as usual for SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis of histones on TAU gels, histones were transferred to PVDF membranes at 30 V overnight (>16 h) in a buffer of 0.7% acetic acid. Prior to transfer, TAU gels were incubated with 0.7% acetic acid for 15 min to equilibrate with the transfer buffer. After electrophoresis of histones by SDS-PAGE, transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes was performed using standard conditions. For detection of O-GlcNAc, the membranes were blocked in 3% BSA and then incubated with the mouse antibody RL2 or CTD110.6, both diluted at 1:1000. Alternatively, a lectin probe specific to O-GlcNAc, WGA, coupled with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP, from Alpha Diagnostic, TX) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Membranes for all other immunodetections were blocked in 3% milk powder with a dilution of antibody 1:2000 for the rabbit polyclonal antibody against H3S10ph and H3S28ph, 1:1000 for the rabbit polyclonal antibody against H3K9ac, and 1:10,000 for the rabbit polyclonal antibody against H3K9me3 and H3K4me3. A double thymidine (5 mm) block (25Bootsma D. Budke L. Vos O. Exp. Cell Res. 1964; 33: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) was used to synchronize HeLa cells at the transition from G1 into S phase as described previously (26Bauerschmidt C. Pollok S. Kremmer E. Nasheuer H.P. Grosse F. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 745-758PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blocked cells were allowed to resume the cell cycle by removal of the thymidine-containing medium, extensive washing of the cells with PBS, and replacement with fresh pre-warmed culture medium. Collected cells at each time point were divided into two halves, one for flow cytometry (FACS) and the other for an immediate lysis in SDS-PAGE sampling buffer for analysis by Western blotting. Cells for FACS analysis were collected and immediately fixed in 85% ethanol, stored at −20 °C, and then stained with propidium iodide, followed by the measurement of DNA content in a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur). As an alternative method for synchronizing cells, the elutriation procedure was used to obtain a cell size-based fractionation of CEM, K562, and HEK293 cells into different phases of the cell cycle as described previously (27Dehde S. Rohaly G. Schub O. Nasheuer H.P. Bohn W. Chemnitz J. Deppert W. Dornreiter I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This was performed by loading actively growing cells (2 × 107–108) into the standard chamber of an elutriator rotor (JE-5.0, Beckman Coulter), followed by collection of cells at 2200 rpm and increasing the flow rate from 32, 36, and 41–47 ml/min, which fractionated the cells into G1, S, and G2 plus mitosis-enriched populations. The collected cells were processed for FACS analysis and Western blot analyses as described above. Nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells were used for histone immunoprecipitations. All steps were performed at 4 °C with a supplement of protease inhibitor mixture in all the buffers. After washing with PBS, the collected cell pellets were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer composed of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, the nuclei pellets were suspended in a buffer of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor mixture, followed by sonication for 6 pulses, each of 6 s duration at an output of 40% in a Branson-250 digital sonifier. After centrifugation of the sonicated nuclear extracts at 20,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were divided for incubation with antibodies specific to different histone post-translational modifications. Subsequently, protein G-agarose (20-μl bed, GE Healthcare) was added to each mixture followed by a further incubation for 1 h. The protein G-agarose beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min, washed three times with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were finally suspended in a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A plasmid vector, pOZ FH-C, for expression of FLAG and HA-tagged wild-type human histone H3.3 in mammalian cells was a kind gift from Prof. Tsuyoshi Ikura (Radiation Biology Centre, Kyoto University). Wild-type H3.3 and its mutant S10A or T11V were synthesized by the gene synthesis service from GENEART (Regensburg, Germany) and subcloned into XhoI and NotI sites of plasmid pOZ FH-C. For in vivo expression, plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells via the CaCl2 method. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection to prepare whole cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation of recombinant H3.3 was performed as described above with the M2 FLAG immunoaffinity agarose (Sigma). A pET plasmid encoding full-length human OGT (116 kDa) was kindly supplied by Prof. J. A. Hanover (Laboratory of Cell Biology and Biochemistry, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The full-length OGT gene was then subcloned into a donor plasmid pFastBacTM at the BamHI site for its expression from baculovirus (bacmid, Invitrogen), with a His6 tag at its N terminus for affinity purification on Ni2+-agarose. Insect cells (High 5) 48 h after infection with bacmid expressing OGT were harvested and suspended in a hypotonic buffer (I) of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol for disruption of the cells. The lysates were then supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, followed by incubation with rotation at 4 °C for 30 min, and then centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The obtained supernatants were mixed at 4 °C for 30 min with nickel-agarose pre-equilibrated with a high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl in buffer I). His6-tagged OGT was eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole in the same high salt buffer. Purified OGT (eluted at 80 mm imidazole) was applied to an in vitro assay for observing its effect on Aurora B kinase (Abcam), with histone H3 as the substrate. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 100 μm UDP-GlcNAc (donor substrate of OGT, Sigma), recombinant histone H3 (0.1 μg/μl), and different amounts of Aurora B (Abcam) or OGT. When used, [γ-32P]ATP as a phosphate donor was included at 10 μCi/per assay (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in addition to the unlabeled ATP given above. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by electrophoresis and autoradiography, or Western blotting with a phospho-epitope-specific antibody to examine the phosphorylation. We initially examined O-GlcNAcylation of human histones from whole cell lysates of HEK293 cells. Using an O-GlcNAc-specific antibody, CTD110.6, Western blot analysis revealed bands at positions corresponding to core histones (Fig. 1A). This putative identification of O-GlcNAcylated histone using CTD110.6 was confirmed using RL2 (Fig. 1B), an independent monoclonal antibody specific to O-GlcNAc. In this experiment, we also enriched the histones using acid extraction, and because the O-GlcNAc modification is notoriously labile (1Love, D. C., Hanover, J. A. (2005) Sci. STKE 2005, re13.Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), we used O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino N-phenylcarbamate, an inhibitor of the OGA enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc. We obtained highly similar data with the RL2 antibody, as well as demonstrating increased histone O-GlcNAcylation upon increasing concentration of the OGA inhibitor. These analyses also revealed an apparent order (which was similar with both antibodies) of histone O-GlcNAcylation, with histone H3 displaying the most O-GlcNAcylation, H4 and H2B being similarly O-GlcNAcylated, and H2A O-GlcNAcylation only weakly apparent after prolonged exposure (and see below). To further confirm the authenticity of histone O-GlcNAcylation, we used a nonimmunological method to detect histone O-GlcNAcylation. The lectin WGA is specific to O-GlcNAc (1Love, D. C., Hanover, J. A. (2005) Sci. STKE 2005, re13.Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), and when coupled to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) it can be used in Western analyses to detect O-GlcNAcylated protein. WGA-HRP revealed a similar pattern of histone reactivity to the antibodies RL2 or CTD110.6, although WGA-HRP preferentially detects H4 over H2B (Figs. 1C and 2). In addition, in this experiment we also used a mild base treatment (up to 50 mm NaOH) of the acid-extracted histones, as this treatment is known to reduce O-linked rather than N-linked glycosylation due to the β-elimination reaction (28Zachara N.E. Cole R.N. Hart G.W. Gao Y. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 2002; 57: 17.6.1-17.6.22Google Scholar). This mild base treatment significantly diminished the WGA detection of histone O-GlcNAcylation by ∼50% (see upper graph in Fig. 1C).FIGURE 2Histone O-GlcNAcylation is further resolved using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Acid-extracted histones from HEK293 cells were separated first by TAU gel electrophoresis, followed by a second dimensional separation through 15% SDS-PAGE. Histones after TAU or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were visualized by Coomassie Blue (A) or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot (WB) with the antibody RL2 (B) or WGA-HRP (C), both of which revealed the levels of O-GlcNAcylation of individual histones and some of their isoforms or variants, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain a higher resolution of individual histones modified by O-GlcNAc, and also to further confirm histone O-GlcNAcylation, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with acid-extracted histones (Fig. 2). The first dimension involved a separation based on both the positive charge and hydrophobic properties of histones, termed TAU gel electrophoresis (24Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The second dimension separates proteins based on molecular weight using conventional SDS-PAGE. This methodology resolved all histones from the core nucleosome, including H2A and its minor variants, all three H3 variants, H3.1, -3.2, and -3.3, H2B and H4 (Fig. 2A). Histones resolved on these two-dimensional gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, followed by detection with either the RL2 (Fig. 2B) or CTD110.6 (data not shown) antibodies, which both revealed that the O-GlcNAc signal was highest for histone H3 (the sum of all three of its variants), followed by H2B and H4, and finally H2A (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also obtained using WGA-HRP to detect O-GlcNAcylated histones (Fig. 2C), although detection of H2B in these gels with this lectin reagent is relatively weaker than with either of the immunological reagents. Notably, the two-dimensional gel technique greatly facilitates visualization of O-GlcNAcylated H2B and H2A that are otherwise difficult to resolve by the one dimensional SDS-PAGE, the latter technique has a lower resolution and more limited loading capacity that together prevent easy detection of weak O-GlcNAc signals (see Fig. 1). Within cells the O-GlcNAc donor is the nucleotide-sugar UDP-GlcNAc that is used by OGT to add the GlcNAc moiety to serine or t"

However, the inefficient production of transgenic pigs represents a technological bottleneck. Here, we assessed the hyperactive Sleeping Beauty (SB100X) transposon system for enzyme-catalyzed transgene integration into the embryonic porcine genome. The components of the transposon vector system were microinjected as circular plasmids into the cytoplasm of porcine zygotes, resulting in high frequencies of transgenic fetuses and piglets. The transgenic animals showed normal development and persistent reporter gene expression for >12 months. Molecular hallmarks of transposition were confirmed by analysis of 25 genomic insertion sites. We demonstrate germ-line transmission, segregation of individual transposons, and continued, copy number-dependent transgene expression in F1-offspring. In addition, we demonstrate target-selected gene insertion into transposon-tagged genomic loci by Cre-loxP-based cassette exchange in somatic cells followed by nuclear transfer. Transposase-catalyzed transgenesis in a large mammalian species expands the arsenal of transgenic technologies for use in domestic animals and will facilitate the development of large animal models for human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2160756056,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in cancer and may play essential roles in tumorigenesis. Additionally, miRNAs have been shown to have prognostic and diagnostic value in certain types of cancer. The objective of this study was to identify dysregulated miRNAs in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (EEC) and the precursor lesion, complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH). Methodology We compared the expression profiles of 723 human miRNAs from 14 cases of EEC, 10 cases of CAH, and 10 normal proliferative endometria controls using Agilent Human miRNA arrays following RNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The expression of 4 dysregulated miRNAs was validated using real time reverse transcription-PCR. Results Forty-three miRNAs were dysregulated in EEC and CAH compared to normal controls (p<0.05). The entire miR-200 family (miR-200a/b/c, miR-141, and miR-429) was up-regulated in cases of EEC. Conclusions This information contributes to the candidate miRNA expression profile that has been generated for EEC and shows that certain miRNAs are dysregulated in the precursor lesion, CAH. These miRNAs in particular may play important roles in tumorigenesis. Examination of miRNAs that are consistently dysregulated in various studies of EEC, like the miR-200 family, will aid in the understanding of the role that miRNAs play in tumorigenesis in this tumour type."
https://openalex.org/W1968702293,"Tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) have been classically defined as genes whose loss of function in tumor cells contributes to the formation and/or maintenance of the tumor phenotype. TSGs containing nonsense mutations may not be expressed because of nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). We combined inhibition of the NMD process, which clears transcripts that contain nonsense mutations, with the application of high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays analysis to discriminate allelic content in order to identify candidate TSGs in five breast cancer cell lines. We identified ARID1A as a target of NMD in the T47D breast cancer cell line, likely as a consequence of a mutation in exon-9, which introduces a premature stop codon at position Q944. ARID1A encodes a human homolog of yeast SWI1, which is an integral member of the hSWI/SNF complex, an ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling, multiple-subunit enzyme. Although we did not find any somatic mutations in 11 breast tumors, which show DNA copy-number loss at the 1p36 locus adjacent to ARID1A, we show that low ARID1A RNA or nuclear protein expression is associated with more aggressive breast cancer phenotypes, such as high tumor grade, in two independent cohorts of over 200 human breast cancer cases each. We also found that low ARID1A nuclear expression becomes more prevalent during the later stages of breast tumor progression. Finally, we found that ARID1A re-expression in the T47D cell line results in significant inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. These results suggest that ARID1A may be a candidate TSG in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2085432002,"The Kruppel-like factor (KLF) proteins are multitasked transcriptional regulators with an expanding tumor suppressor function. KLF2 is one of the prominent members of the family because of its diminished expression in malignancies and its growth-inhibitory, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic roles. In this study, we show that epigenetic silencing of KLF2 occurs in cancer cells through direct transcriptional repression mediated by the Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Binding of EZH2 to the 5'-end of KLF2 is also associated with a gain of trimethylated lysine 27 histone H3 and a depletion of phosphorylated serine 2 of RNA polymerase. Upon depletion of EZH2 by RNA interference, short hairpin RNA or use of the small molecule 3-Deazaneplanocin A, the expression of KLF2 was restored. The transfection of KLF2 in cells with EZH2-associated silencing showed a significant anti-tumoral effect, both in culture and in xenografted nude mice. In this last setting, KLF2 transfection was also associated with decreased dissemination and lower mortality rate. In EZH2-depleted cells, which characteristically have lower tumorigenicity, the induction of KLF2 depletion 'rescued' partially the oncogenic phenotype, suggesting that KLF2 repression has an important role in EZH2 oncogenesis. Most importantly, the translation of the described results to human primary samples demonstrated that patients with prostate or breast tumors with low levels of KLF2 and high expression of EZH2 had a shorter overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W1973185157,"γ-Secretase is essential for the generation of the neurotoxic 42-amino acid amyloid β-peptide (Aβ42). The aggregation-prone hydrophobic peptide, which is deposited in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient brain, is generated from a C-terminal fragment of the β-amyloid precursor protein by an intramembrane cleavage of γ-secretase. Because Aβ42 is widely believed to trigger AD pathogenesis, γ-secretase is a key AD drug target. Unlike inhibitors of the enzyme, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) selectively lower Aβ42 without interfering with the physiological function of γ-secretase. The molecular target(s) of GSMs and hence the mechanism of GSM action are not established. Here we demonstrate by using a biotinylated photocross-linkable derivative of highly potent novel second generation GSMs that γ-secretase is a direct target of GSMs. The GSM photoprobe specifically bound to the N-terminal fragment of presenilin, the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, but not to other γ-secretase subunits. Binding was differentially competed by GSMs of diverse structural classes, indicating the existence of overlapping/multiple GSM binding sites or allosteric alteration of the photoprobe binding site. The β-amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment previously implicated as the GSM binding site was not targeted by the compound.

Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). Aβ is a small 37–43-amino acid secreted peptide that is generated from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential action of two membrane-bound proteases, β- and γ-secretase (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme is an intramembrane-cleaving protease composed of presenilin (PS) 1 or 2 as the catalytic subunit, APH-1a or -b, nicastrin, and PEN-2 (2Steiner H. Fluhrer R. Haass C. J. Biol.

Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). As inhibition and/or modulation of Aβ generation are promising therapeutic strategies to treat AD, β- and γ-secretase are key AD drug targets, and inhibitors of both enzymes are investigated in clinical trial studies (5Tomita T. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2009; 9: 661-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

Apart from APP, a number of other γ-secretase substrates have been identified (3Wakabayashi T. De Strooper B. Physiology. 2008; 23: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Among these, Notch1 represents a substrate of major importance for the regulation of cell differentiation during embryonic development as well as in adulthood (6Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Notch1 by γ-secretase gives rise to the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), which acts in the nucleus as an essential transcriptional regulator (6Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, direct inhibition of Aβ generation by γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) is problematic due to the inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway (5Tomita T. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2009; 9: 661-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and a large clinical phase 3 trial has also recently been halted due to the appearance of severe side effects. In contrast to GSIs, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) may offer safer alternatives for AD therapy. Such drugs typically shift the cleavage specificity of γ-secretase toward the increased production of the shorter peptide Aβ38, whereas concomitantly reducing the generation of the pathogenic Aβ42 species. A subset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as sulindac sulfide and other cyclooxygenase inhibitors, was identified 10 years ago as the first GSMs (7Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P.

Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Although clinical efficacy has yet to be demonstrated, the discovery of Aβ42-lowering GSMs has opened a new opportunity for AD drug discovery, and more potent and brain-penetrant second generation compounds have been identified and developed since the first study (5Tomita T. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2009; 9: 661-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These compounds differ structurally from the first generation compounds. Most of the new compounds lack the acidic carboxyl group of NSAIDs and typically consist of bridged aromates (5Tomita T. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2009; 9: 661-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Supplemental Table 1 shows representatives of these compounds that were used in this study. Certain low potency GSMs such as the NSAIDs flurbiprofen and sulindac sulfide have been reported to bind to the APP CTF as well as to Aβ in the N-terminal third of the APP transmembrane domain (8Kukar T.L.

However, this study was conducted under conditions in which the γ-secretase complex was dissociated and with isolated PEN-2, i.e. under non-native conditions. Thus, the identity of the binding site(s) of GSMs has been unsettled and remained a major open question. Here we identify the N-terminal fragment of PS, but not PEN-2 or the APP CTF, as the binding site of novel highly potent GSMs with bridged aromatic structural scaffold.

Additional details are described in the supplemental material, including cell lines and antibodies used for analysis. Membrane fractions of HEK293 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of RO-57-BpB and competitor compounds as indicated and following photoactivation of RO-57-BpB with UV light solubilized in SDS-containing buffer. After a clarifying spin, proteins covalently bound to RO-57-BpB were captured with streptavidin-Sepharose. Following three washes, bound proteins were eluted in biotin- and urea-containing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Experimental details and information on the antibodies used for analysis are given in the supplemental material. We identified a series of a novel class of bridged aromatic aminopyrimidine-derived compounds as highly potent second generation GSMs with IC50 values for inhibition of Aβ42 reaching the low nanomolar range (28Baumann, K., Flohr, A., Goetschi, E., Jacobsen, H., Jolidon, S., Luebbers, T.

One of these compounds, RO-02 (Fig. 1A), was characterized as a prototype in cell-based and cell-free assays in more detail. RO-02 robustly lowered Aβ42 species in HEK293 cells stably expressing the APPsw mutant (HEK293/sw) (IC50 = 15 nm; log IC50 = −7.82 ± 0.05), increased the short species Aβ38, and consistent with the behavior of GSMs of this structural class (12Kounnas M.Z.

We next asked whether RO-02 would be effective on distinct γ-secretase complexes using HEK293/sw cell lines stably expressing all possible combinations of PS and APH-1 (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1E, all six individual complexes generated a similar profile of secreted Aβ species. The compound effectively lowered Aβ42 generation of all six γ-secretase complexes with an apparently increased potency for PS2-containing γ-secretase complexes (Fig. 1F; see also supplemental Fig. 1). Finally, the potent and preferential Aβ42-lowering activity of RO-02 was confirmed in rat primary cortical neurons (IC50 (Aβ42) = 13 nm; log IC50 = −7.90 ± 0.04) (Fig. 1G). To further characterize the mode of action of RO-02 and to address the question whether the compound may target γ-secretase directly, we next investigated whether RO-02 could also modulate γ-secretase activity in a cell-free in vitro assay using purified enzyme complex reconstituted into lipid vesicles (15Winkler E.

Dose-response analysis showed that RO-02 modulated the generation of Aβ species by γ-secretase from the recombinant APP substrate C100-His6 as expected (IC50 (Aβ42) = 0.5 μm under these conditions) and without affecting the levels of total Aβ and total AICD (Fig. 1H). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that RO-02 did not alter the relative levels of the AICD species generated in the cell-free assay when used at a concentration modulatory for the γ-sites (1 μm), suggesting that the compound does not modulate ϵ-cleavage (Fig. 1I). Although the cell-free assay data provide evidence that RO-02 may target γ-secretase directly, they do not prove this as they do not demonstrate direct binding of the drug to its target. Therefore, to unambiguously identify the molecular target(s) of our compounds, a derivative of RO-02 was synthesized (RO-57) that facilitated linkage of a photoactivatable benzophenone group coupled to a biotin moiety (RO-57-BpB) to capture cross-linked target protein(s) by a streptavidin pulldown after photoactivation of the compound (Fig. 2A). The parental compound RO-57 and the photosensitive derivative RO-57-BpB modulated γ-secretase in cultured HEK293/sw cells with an IC50 (Aβ42) of 47 nm (log IC50 = −7.33 ± 0.07) and 185 nm (log IC50 = −6.73 ± 0.07), respectively (Fig. 2B). When total membrane fractions of untransfected HEK293 cells were probed with 1 μm RO-57-BpB, a concentration that inhibits Aβ42 production by ∼30% (supplemental Fig. 2), the PS1 and PS2 N-terminal fragments (NTFs) were identified as molecular targets of RO-57-BpB (Fig. 2C). Capture of the PS NTFs was observed neither in the absence of RO-57-BpB nor in the presence of RO-57-BpB but in the absence of UV irradiation. Labeling of PS1 and PS2 NTFs was strongly inhibited in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the parental compound RO-57, demonstrating specific cross-linking. As expected, the close and more potent structural relative of RO-57, RO-02, highly efficiently competed for PS NTF labeling by RO-57-BpB (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our results above (Fig. 1F), we noted that labeling of the PS2 NTF was stronger than that of PS1. These results could be confirmed with RO-03, another potent compound of our GSM series (supplemental Fig. 3). As further shown in Fig. 2C, no capture was observed for any other γ-secretase subunits. Because certain GSM photoprobes, which were based on the low potency compounds flurbiprofen or fenofibrate, have previously been reported to bind to the APP CTF γ-secretase substrates (8Kukar T.L. Ladd T.B. Bann M.A. Fraering P.C. Narlawar R. Maharvi G.M. Healy B. Chapman R. Welzel A.T. Price R.W. Moore B. Rangachari V. Cusack B. Eriksen J. Jansen-West K. Verbeeck C. Yager D. Eckman C. Ye W.

Nature. 2008; 453: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we performed labeling experiments using isolated membranes from HEK293/sw cells. These experiments showed that RO-57-BpB failed to specifically label APP CTFs, suggesting that compounds of this structural class used here are not substrate-targeting GSMs (Fig. 2D). To further investigate whether the binding site of RO-57-BpB may also be targeted by other GSMs, we next tested whether other classes of GSMs could compete for binding of RO-57-BpB. Two structurally similar bridged aromatic second generation GSMs from Eisai Co., Ltd. (ES 1 (= E2012 (18Portelius E. Van Broeck B. Andreasson U. Gustavsson M.K. Mercken M. Zetterberg H. Borghys H.

Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 21: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) and ES 2) (supplemental Table 1) also efficiently competed for labeling of the PS NTFs by RO-57-BpB (Fig. 3A), whereas, interestingly, the bridged aromates from TorreyPines Therapeutics (TP 1 and TP 2) (supplemental Table 1) showed differential effects. While one of the compounds (TP 1) partially prevented PS NTF labeling, the other one (TP 2) did not (Fig. 3A). The acidic GSMs sulindac sulfide, a low potency GSM (7Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P.

GSM-1 showed a differential effect and competed for labeling of the PS1 NTF by RO-57-BpB only weakly, whereas PS2 NTF labeling was more strongly reduced. The inverse GSMs fenofibrate (19Kukar T.

Neurochem. 2007; 101: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) did weakly reduce the capture of PS NTF by RO-57-BpB. Considering its low potency (IC50 (Aβ42) = 70 μm (14Kretner B. Fukumori A. Gutsmiedl A. Page R.M. Luebbers T. Galley G. Baumann K. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol.

However, although the lack of labeling competition by its inactive analog sulindac sulfone suggested specificity (7Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18664-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 4), the potential contribution of other factors to the observed labeling competition by sulindac sulfide could not be excluded (see “Discussion”). Finally, we investigated whether binding of RO-57-BpB to the PS NTF was affected by different classes of highly potent GSIs including the transition-state analog L-685,458, the dipeptidic GSIs DAPT and LY-411,575, and begacestat, a Notch-sparing sulfonamide-type GSI (5Tomita T. Expert. Rev. Neurother. 2009; 9: 661-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, the investigated GSIs did not or only weakly inhibited labeling of the PS NTFs and LY-411,575 rather increased labeling of the PS1 NTF. Taken together, the various GSMs and GSIs differentially competed for PS NTF labeling by RO-57-BpB. With respect to the GSMs, the above results indicate that the binding site of RO-57-BpB might be shared for some GSMs such as the Eisai compounds, whereas for other compounds, the binding site may overlap or be located elsewhere. L-685,458 was the only GSI capable of competing for labeling to some extent, indicating some overlap of the RO-57-BpB binding site with the catalytic site. Alternatively, the competitor compounds used may allosterically alter the RO-57-BpB binding site. The identity of the molecular target(s) of GSMs and thus also the mechanism(s) of GSM action are not yet understood and represent major unresolved questions in the AD drug discovery field (8Kukar T.L.

Here we have provided evidence that γ-secretase is a direct target of new potent second generation GSMs with non-acidic bridged aromatic structure. The compounds target the NTF of its catalytic subunits PS1 and PS2. Binding of PS2 by RO-57-BpB was substantially stronger than that of PS1, indicating that these compounds may preferentially target PS2. This is also supported by the more potent Aβ42 inhibition by RO-02 of γ-secretase containing PS2 as catalytic subunit. To further characterize the binding site targeted by RO-57-BpB in the PS NTF, we investigated whether other GSMs of similar or different structural scaffold would be able to compete with binding of RO-57-BpB to its target site. Such labeling competition experiments can indicate whether a binding site is shared between different compounds, although they do not discriminate for the alternative possibility that the competitor compound may allosterically alter the binding site of the labeling compound. Each of the two GSMs from Eisai and TorreyPines Therapeutics were tested as representatives of other bridged aromatic GSMs structurally related to our compounds. Both Eisai compounds efficiently competed for labeling of the PS NTF, but only one of the TorreyPines Therapeutics compounds (TP 1) was effective and displayed partial competition. Although it is thus likely that the Eisai compounds target the same site as our compounds, the binding site of the TorreyPines Therapeutics compounds may partially overlap or locate elsewhere (12Kounnas M.Z. Danks A.M. Cheng S. Tyree C. Ackerman E. Zhang X. Ahn K. Nguyen P. Comer D. Mao L. Yu C. Pleynet D. Digregorio P.J. Velicelebi G. Stauderman K.A. Comer W.T. Mobley W.C. Li Y.M. Sisodia S.S. Tanzi R.E. Wagner S.L. Neuron. 2010; 67: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The partial labeling competition (TP 1) or its absence (TP 2) could, however, also be due to less favorable physicochemical properties of the TorreyPines Therapeutics compounds, such as high lipophilicity and/or low solubility that may have caused reduced drug availability in the labeling competition experiments. Consistent with its previously reported direct allosteric interaction with γ-secretase (22Beher D. Clarke E.E. Wrigley J.D. Martin A.C. Nadin A. Churcher I. Shearman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43419-43426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), labeling competition was also observed for sulindac sulfide, suggesting that this NSAID-type acidic GSM may target the binding site of our GSMs. However, despite the finding that its inactive analog sulindac sulfone did not compete, it could not be definitively answered whether sulindac sulfide targeted the same site as our GSM photoprobe. For example, the differential effects on labeling competition by these drugs could also have been due to their distinct radical scavenging (23Santos F. Teixeira L. Lúcio M. Ferreira H. Gaspar D. Lima J.L. Reis S. Free Radic. Res. 2008; 42: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or membrane-partitioning properties (24Fan S.S. Shen T.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The second generation acidic compound GSM-1 only weakly competed with RO-57-BpB for PS1 NTF labeling, whereas the drug robustly competed for the labeling of the PS2 NTF. This suggests that the GSM binding sites in the PS1 and PS2 NTFs may have somewhat different conformations and indicates that the binding site of GSM-1 overlaps only partially with that of RO-57-BpB in PS1. The inverse modulators behaved as comparably mild competitors in these assays, suggesting that the PS NTFs are not their principal targets. With the exception of the transition state analog L-685,458, which displayed moderate labeling competition, the GSIs competed for labeling of the PS NTFs very weakly or not at all. The GSM binding site identified here may therefore partially overlap with that of the active site. However, as mentioned before, these interpretations should be taken with some caution as allosteric modulation of the RO-57-BpB binding site by the competitor compounds and/or other factors discussed above influencing labeling competition cannot always be excluded. Vice versa binding experiments using photoactivatable derivatives of the GSMs and GSIs used as competitor compounds in this study against our GSMs would be needed to clarify these issues. The identification of γ-secretase as a direct target of GSMs also sheds further light on the mechanism of action of GSMs. Although a substrate-targeting mode of GSM action had been suggested (8Kukar T.L.

https://openalex.org/W2150930265,"Rapidly emerging insecticide resistance is creating an urgent need for new active ingredients to control the adult mosquitoes that vector malaria. Biopesticides based on the spores of entomopathogenic fungi have shown considerable promise by causing very substantial mortality within 7-14 days of exposure. This mortality will generate excellent malaria control if there is a high likelihood that mosquitoes contact fungi early in their adult lives. However, where contact rates are lower, as might result from poor pesticide coverage, some mosquitoes will contact fungi one or more feeding cycles after they acquire malaria, and so risk transmitting malaria before the fungus kills them. Critics have argued that 'slow acting' fungal biopesticides are, therefore, incapable of delivering malaria control in real-world contexts. Here, utilizing standard WHO laboratory protocols, we demonstrate effective action of a biopesticide much faster than previously reported. Specifically, we show that transient exposure to clay tiles sprayed with a candidate biopesticide comprising spores of a natural isolate of Beauveria bassiana, could reduce malaria transmission potential to zero within a feeding cycle. The effect resulted from a combination of high mortality and rapid fungal-induced reduction in feeding and flight capacity. Additionally, multiple insecticide-resistant lines from three key African malaria vector species were completely susceptible to fungus. Thus, fungal biopesticides can block transmission on a par with chemical insecticides, and can achieve this where chemical insecticides have little impact. These results support broadening the current vector control paradigm beyond fast-acting chemical toxins."

Chem. 2005; 280: 32285-32290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that human OAT1 (hOAT1) forms oligomers in cultured cells and kidney, and we provided evidence that rOat1, rOct1, and rOct2 form homo-oligomers in detergent solution (12Keller T. Schwarz D. Bernhard F. Dötsch V. Hunte C. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4552-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that the sixth transmembrane α-helix (TMH) of hOAT1 comprises a contact region for oligomerization and that surface expression of hOAT1 was reduced when oligomerization of hOAT1 was disturbed (13Duan P. Li S. You G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 79: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). organic cation transporter organic anion transporter rat Oct1 and Oct2, respectively rat Oat1 human OAT1 transmembrane α-helix 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium tetraethylammonium 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide human embryonic kidney cyan fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] tetrabutylammonium tetrapentylammonium Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline complementary RNA. In the present study, we provide evidence that the structural integrity of the large extracellular loop of rOct1 is critically dependent on disulfide bond formation and that the large extracellular loop is pivotal for homo-oligomerization. We show that mutations within the large extracellular loop may change substrate affinity, but homo-oligomerization has no effect on affinity and transport function. 3H-Labeled 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (3.1 TBq/mmol) and [14C]TEA+ (1.9 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Biotrend (Köln, Germany). 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemical (Ontario, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained as described earlier (12Keller T. Schwarz D. Bernhard F. Dötsch V. Hunte C. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4552-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Keller T. Elfeber M. Gorboulev V. Reiländer H. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12253-12263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All mutants were made on the basis of the vector rOct1/pRSSP (15Gorboulev V. Volk C. Arndt P. Akhoundova A. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It contains HindIII and EcoRV sites 5′ of rOct1 and a SacI site at the 3′-end of rOct1. Mutants rOct1(rOct2-l) (16Gorboulev V. Shatskaya N. Volk C. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1612-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), rOct1-FLAG (7Popp C. Gorboulev V. Müller T.D. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and rOct1(10ΔC) (17Sturm A. Gorboulev V. Gorbunov D. Keller T. Volk C. Schmitt B.M. Schlachtbauer P. Ciarimboli G. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F767-F779Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have been described previously. rOct1(10ΔC,G478C) was prepared by the overlap extension method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (16Gorboulev V. Shatskaya N. Volk C. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1612-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Plasmid rOct1(rOat1-l), in which the large extracellular loop of rOct1 is replaced by the corresponding loop of rOat1 (amino acids 40–136), was constructed in analogy to rOct1(rOct2-l) (16Gorboulev V. Shatskaya N. Volk C. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1612-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). rOct1(rOat1-l)-FLAG and rOct1(6ΔC-l)-FLAG were obtained by substituting a HindIII/NheI fragment of rOct1-FLAG/pRSSP with the corresponding fragments of rOct1(rOat1-l) or rOct1(6ΔC-l). To create rOct1(10ΔC)/rOct1(10ΔC,G478C) tandem constructs in the pRSSP vector, intermediate constructs were prepared. 1) A new BamHI site was introduced 5′ of the nucleotides coding for the first amino acids of the rOct1 mutants, and 2) a short linker containing a BamHI site followed by a SacI site was inserted behind the nucleotides coding for the last amino acids of the rOct1 mutants. BamHI/SacI fragments were isolated from the 5′ BamHI constructs and inserted into BamHI/SacI sites of the 3′ BamHI/SacI vectors, resulting in the tandem constructs rOct1(10ΔC)-rOct1(10ΔC), rOct1(10ΔC,G478C)-rOct1(10ΔC), and rOct1(10ΔC,G478C)-rOct1(10ΔC,G478C). rOct1 and rOct1 mutants rOct1(rOat1-l), rOct1(G159V,G163V), rOct1(2ΔC-l), and rOct1(6ΔC-l) with a His tag at their C termini were made by PCR covering the complete coding region without initiation and stop codons. PCR was performed as described (7Popp C. Gorboulev V. Müller T.D. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PCR amplificates were cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pET21a vector, conserving the open reading frame with T7 tag and His tag of the vector. The rOct1-FLAG, rOct1(rOat1-l)-FLAG, and rOct1(6ΔC-l)-FLAG in vector pET21a were obtained by substituting the 3′-terminal parts of rOct1-His, rOct1(rOat1-l)-His, and rOct1(6ΔC-l)-His in the pET21a vector with the corresponding parts of the rOct1-FLAG, rOct1(rOat1-l)-FLAG, and rOct1(6ΔC-l)-FLAG constructs in pRSSP. Constructs were sequenced to rule out PCR errors. The construct rOct1/pRcCMV has been described earlier (15Gorboulev V. Volk C. Arndt P. Akhoundova A. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression plasmids rOct1(rOat1-l)/pRcCMV and rOct1(6ΔC-l)/pRcCMV were made by replacing the HindIII/NheI fragments of rOct1/pRcCMV with the respective fragment of the mutant transporters. Fusion proteins of rOct1, rOct1(rOat1-l), and rOct1(6ΔC-l) bearing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at their N termini (rOct1-C, rOct1-Y, rOct1(rOat1-l)-C, rOct1(rOat1-l)-Y, rOct1(6ΔC-l)-C, and rOct1(6ΔC-l)-Y) were prepared using the overlap extension PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) and cloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of the vector pcDNA3.1. The resulting constructs comprise the complete ORF of the fluorescent proteins connected by a short (two amino acids) linker to the ORF of rOct1 variants without their initiation codon. Cell-free expression was performed in the continuous exchange mode using bacterial extracts from Escherichia coli strain A19 as described (12Keller T. Schwarz D. Bernhard F. Dötsch V. Hunte C. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4552-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Klammt C. Löhr F. Schäfer B. Haase W. Dötsch V. Rüterjans H. Glaubitz C. Bernhard F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 568-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Reaction mixture and feeding mixture were composed as described (19Klammt C. Löhr F. Schäfer B. Haase W. Dötsch V. Rüterjans H. Glaubitz C. Bernhard F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 568-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was performed in the absence of detergent in 1-ml dialysis tubes containing a membrane with a cut-off of 25 kDa (dispodialyzers obtained from Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Breda, The Netherlands). The dispodialyzers were rotated for 20 h at 30 °C in tubes containing 17 ml of feeding mixture. Precipitated proteins were spun down by a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g (4 °C). For purification of His-tagged proteins on Ni2+-NTA-agarose, pellets were washed with Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole. For purification of FLAG-tagged proteins using anti-FLAG-antibody coupled to agarose, washing was performed with Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The washed precipitates were solubilized by incubation for 1 h at 30 °C with 1 ml of 2% (w/v) 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (LMPG) dissolved in Tris buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (His-tagged transporters) or in Hepes buffer (FLAG-tagged transporters). The suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g (4 °C), and the supernatants (LMPG supernatants) were used for purification. Purification was performed as described previously (12Keller T. Schwarz D. Bernhard F. Dötsch V. Hunte C. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4552-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, for purification on Ni2+-NTA-agarose, 1 ml of LMPG supernatant was mixed with 11 ml of Tris buffer containing 10 mm imidazole plus 1% (w/v) CHAPS and Ni2+-NTA-agarose and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was poured into a column and washed with 10 ml of Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 10 mm imidazole. After additional washing in the presence of 1% CHAPS and 20 mm imidazole, proteins were eluted with 5 ml of Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 100 mm imidazole. For immunopurification, 1 ml of LMPG supernatant was mixed with 10.5 ml of Hepes buffer containing 1% CHAPS and agarose beads coupled to anti-FLAG-antibody. The suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were separated by 10 min of centrifugation at 500 × g and washed with Hepes-CHAPS, and transport proteins were eluted by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 1 ml of Hepes-CHAPS containing 0.2 mg/ml antigenic FLAG peptide. Beads were removed by 10 min of centrifugation at 500 × g. Coprecipitation was performed as described (12Keller T. Schwarz D. Bernhard F. Dötsch V. Hunte C. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4552-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). LMPG supernatants (100 μl of each containing 20 μg of in vitro expressed His-tagged or FLAG-tagged transporter, 2% LMPG, and 10 mm imidazole) were mixed and diluted with 200 μl of Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 10 mm imidazole (final concentration of 1% LMPG and 0.5% CHAPS). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, 100 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose equilibrated with Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 10 mm imidazole were added. The suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were separated by a 10-min centrifugation at 500 × g. The beads were washed five times at room temperature with 1 ml of Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 10 mm imidazole and five times with Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 20 mm imidazole. For protein elution, pelleted beads were suspended for 10 min at room temperature in 400 μl of Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 100 mm imidazole, and the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatants were collected, and FLAG-tagged transporters were analyzed by Western blots. Each analysis was performed in the absence or presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) using a 40-μl sample containing 160 μg of rOct1 protein, which was solubilized with 2% (w/v) LMPG. The running buffers without or with 10 mm DTT contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and either 1% (w/v) CHAPS or 0.5% (w/v) LMPG plus 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS. Protein samples were applied to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column in a SMART system (GE Healthcare) or to a tandem of two coupled Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 columns in an ÄKTAmicroTM system (GE Healthcare). After equilibration of the columns, gel filtration was performed with a flow rate of 50 μl/min (Superdex 200 column) or of 280 μl/min (Superose 6 columns). The systems were calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (14 kDa) supplied by GE Healthcare. For SDS-PAGE, protein samples were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C in 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, and 7% (v/v) glycerol. The pretreatment was performed in the presence or absence of 100 mm DTT. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (20Valentin M. Kühlkamp T. Wagner K. Krohne G. Arndt P. Baumgarten K. Weber W. Segal A. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For immunostaining, anti-FLAG antibody raised in mice diluted 1:20,000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and successively anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1:5,000 (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Binding of HRP-coupled antibodies was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, GE Healthcare). Prestained molecular weight markers (BenchMark, Invitrogen) were used to determine apparent molecular masses. 1 mg of cholesterol, 1 mg of phosphatidylcholine, and 1 mg of phosphatidylserine were dissolved in 1 ml of a chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1, v/v) and dried in a round bottom flask under a stream of nitrogen, and 500 μl of purified transporter proteins solubilized in Tris buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 100 mm imidazole were added. The round bottom flasks were shaken for 1 h at 4 °C, and CHAPS was removed by dialysis at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 100 mm choline chloride. The obtained suspensions were centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g (4 °C). The sediments were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold KC buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm Mg2+, 100 mm K+, 100 mm cyclamate−). After another 30-min centrifugation at 200,000 × g, the sediments were suspended in 150 μl of KC buffer. The protein-lipid aggregates were used for binding measurements and for preparation of large proteoliposomes. Reconstitution of purified transporters into large proteoliposomes was performed using a freeze-thaw procedure (12Keller T. Schwarz D. Bernhard F. Dötsch V. Hunte C. Gorboulev V. Koepsell H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4552-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Large multilamellar liposomes were mixed with protein-lipid aggregates, and the mixture was frozen and thawed, pelleted, and homogenized. To prepare large multilamellar liposomes, 4 mg of phosphatidylserine and 2 mg of cholesterol in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) were dried in a round bottom flask under a stream of nitrogen. 1 ml of KC buffer was added, and the flask was shaken for 3 h at room temperature under nitrogen. Large lipid aggregates were pelleted by 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g at room temperature, and multilamellar liposomes in the supernatant were concentrated by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min and resuspension of the pellet in 150 μl of KC buffer (room temperature). To form large proteoliposomes, 150 μl of the protein-lipid aggregates were mixed with 150 μl of the multilamellar liposomes and incubated for 15 min at 41 °C. This mixture was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Shortly before transport measurements were started, the sample was thawed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C in a water bath. After the addition of 1.7 ml of KC buffer (room temperature), the proteoliposomes were spun down by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min (room temperature). The pellet was suspended in 300 μl of KC buffer (room temperature), and formation of monolamellar proteoliposomes was induced by repeated suction of the suspension into and forced extrusion out of a 100-μl pipette tip. Binding measurements were performed at 0 °C to avoid contribution of MPP+ uptake and to reduce dissociation of MPP+ during washing. Assuming that the rate constants for association and dissociation of MPP+ have a similar temperature dependence, similar dissociation constant (KD) values are expected at 0 and 37 °C. 10 μl of ice-cold protein-lipid aggregates were mixed with 90 μl of ice-cold KC buffer containing 12 nm [3H]MPP+ without or with different concentrations of non-radioactive MPP+. After incubation for 10 min at 0 °C, the protein-lipid aggregates were applied to 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters (Millipore GSWP) and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold KC buffer. The filters were dissolved in LUMASAFETM PLUS mixture (Lumac LSC, Groningen, The Netherlands) and assayed for radioactivity. For measurements of MPP+ uptake, large proteoliposomes filled with KC buffer were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 20 μm valinomycin. The preincubation was performed without or with a 100 μm concentration of the OCT inhibitor quinine (1Koepsell H. Lips K. Volk C. Pharm. Res. 2007; 24: 1227-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Uptake was initiated by mixing 10 μl of prewarmed proteoliposomes (37 °C) with 90 μl of prewarmed (37 °C) NaC buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm Mg2+, 100 mm Na+, 100 mm cyclamate−) containing 12 nm [3H]MPP+ without or with non-radioactive MPP+, TEA+, tetrabutylammomium (TBuA+), or tetrapentylammomium (TPeA+). After incubation for 1 s, uptake was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (KC buffer containing 100 μm quinine). An accurate 1-s incubation was achieved by placing the proteoliposomes on the inner wall of the reaction tube just above the incubation buffer. Uptake was started by moving the tube close to a switched-on vortexer and immediately stopped with stop solution from a prepositioned pipette. The 1-s incubation time was determined using a metronome. For measurement of radioactivity within proteoliposomes, the proteoliposomes suspended in stop solution were applied to 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters (Millipore GSWP) and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold stop solution. The filters were dissolved and assayed for radioactivity as described above. FRET (21Schmid J.A. Sitte H.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was measured with a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 epifluorescence microscope using the “three-filter method” (22Bartholomäus I.

Images were taken using ×63 oil immersion objectives and filter wheels from Ludl Electronic Products allowing a rapid excitation and emission filter exchange. We investigated HEK293 cells, which were transiently transfected with plasmid cDNA (1.7 μg/μl) using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (23Sucic S. Dallinger S. Zdrazil B. Weissensteiner R.

The filter wheels were configured as follows: CFP (Idonor; excitation, 436 nm; emission, 480 nm; dichroic mirror, 455 nm); YFP (Iacceptor; excitation, 500 nm; emission, 535 nm; dichroic mirror, 515 nm); and FRET (IFRET; excitation, 436 nm; emission, 535 nm; dichroic mirror, 455 nm). Images were taken with a CCD camera (Coolsnap fx, Roper Scientific). Background fluorescence was subtracted from all images. Images were analyzed pixel by pixel using ImageJ, version 1.43b (Wayne Rassband, National Institutes of Health) and the ImageJ plug-in PixFRET (Pixel by Pixel analysis of FRET with ImageJ, version 1.5.0) (24Feige J.N. Sage D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Spectral bleed-through parameters for the donor bleed-through (BTdonor) and the acceptor bleed-through (BTacceptor) were determined, and NFRET was calculated in the following way. NFRET=IFRED-BTdonor×Idonor-BTacceptor×IacceptorIdonor×Iacceptor×100(Eq. 1) The mean NFRET was measured at the plasma membrane (predefined as the region of interest) using the computed NFRET image. The regions of interest were selected in the CFP (donor) or YFP (acceptor) image (to avoid bleaching-associated bias) and transmitted to the NFRET image by the ImageJ Multi Measure Tool. As a negative control, we employed the CFP-labeled form of rOct1 (C-Oct1) with a membrane-bound form of YFP (25Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that was kindly provided by Viacheslav Nikolaev (University of Würzburg). Uptake of [3H]MPP+ was measured into HEK293 cells stably transfected with rOct1 (26Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Gorboulev V. Akhoundova A. Waldegger S. Lang F. Koepsell H.

Confluent cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS), suspended by shaking, and collected by 10-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g. Cells were either directly used for transport measurements (control) or incubated for 6 min at 37 °C with D-PBS containing 10 mm DTT or with D-PBS containing 0.1 mm DTT (0.1 mm DTT control). DTT-treated cells were sedimented by centrifugation, washed two times at room temperature with D-PBS containing 0.1 mm DTT, and suspended at 37 °C in D-PBS containing 0.1 mm DTT. For uptake measurement, cells were incubated for 1 s with D-PBS containing 0.1 μm [3H]MPP+ plus various concentrations of non-radioactive MPP+. Uptake was stopped by the addition of ice-cold D-PBS containing 100 μm quinine+ (stop solution). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold stop solution, solubilized with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, and analyzed for radioactivity.

One key aspect of this regulation is the cell surface up-regulation upon DC maturation of peptide·MHC-II complexes and the costimulatory molecule CD86. It is now clear that these critical induction events involve changes in ubiquitin-dependent trafficking of MHC-II and CD86 by the E3 ligase membrane-associated RING-CH-1 (MARCH1). Although ubiquitin-dependent trafficking of MHC-II has been well characterized, much less is known regarding the post-transcriptional regulation of CD86 expression. Here, we examined the physical and functional interaction between CD86 and MARCH1. We observed that CD86 is rapidly endocytosed in the presence of MARCH1 followed by lysosome-dependent degradation. Furthermore, we found that the association between CD86 and MARCH1 was conferred primarily by the transmembrane domains of the respective proteins. In contrast to MHC-II, which has a single, conserved ubiquitin acceptor site in the cytosolic domain, we found that multiple lysine residues in the cytosolic tail of CD86 could support ubiquitination consistent with the relative lack of sequence conservation across species within the CD86 cytosolic domain. These findings suggest that MARCH1 recruits multiple substrates via transmembrane domain-mediated interactions to permit substrate ubiquitination in the face of diverse cytosolic domain sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2033500899,"BAFF, in addition to promoting B cell survival and differentiation, may affect T cells. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of BAFF on Th17 cell generation and its ramifications for the Th17 cell-driven disease, EAE.Th17 cells were increased in BAFF-Tg B6 (B6.BTg) mice and decreased in B6.Baff(-/-) mice. Th17 cells in B6.Baff(-/-) mice bearing a BAFF Tg (B6.Baff(-/-).BTg mice) were identical to those in B6.BTg mice, indicating that membrane BAFF is dispensable for Th17 cell generation as long as soluble BAFF is plentiful. In T + non-T cell criss-cross co-cultures, Th17 cell generation was greatest in cultures containing B6.BTg T cells and lowest in cultures containing B6.Baff(-/-) T cells, regardless of the source of non-T cells. In cultures containing only T cells, Th17 cell generation followed an identical pattern. CD4(+) cell expression of CD126 (IL-6R α chain) was increased in B6.BTg mice and decreased in B6.Baff(-/-) mice, and activation of STAT3 following stimulation with IL-6 + TGF-β was also greatest in B6.BTg cells and lowest in B6.Baff(-/-) cells. EAE was clinically and pathologically most severe in B6.BTg mice and least severe in B6.Baff(-/-) mice and correlated with MOG(35-55) peptide-induced Th17 cell responses.Collectively, these findings document a contribution of BAFF to pathogenic Th17 cell responses and suggest that BAFF antagonism may be efficacious in Th17 cell-driven diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2029734368,"Despite 35 years of clinical trials, there is little improvement in 1-year survival rates for patients with metastatic melanoma, and the disease is essentially untreatable if not cured surgically. The paucity of chemotherapeutic agents that are effective for treating metastatic melanoma indicates a dire need to develop new therapies. Here, we found a previously unrecognized role for c-Abl and Arg in melanoma progression. We demonstrate that the kinase activities of c-Abl and Arg are elevated in primary melanomas (60%), in a subset of benign nevi (33%) and in some human melanoma cell lines. Using siRNA and pharmacological approaches, we show that c-Abl/Arg activation is functionally relevant because it is requiredfor melanoma cell proliferation, survival and invasion. Significantly, we identify the mechanism by which activated c-Abl promotes melanoma invasion by showing that it transcriptionally upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), and using rescue approaches we demonstrate that c-Abl promotes invasion through a STAT3 → MMP-1 pathway. Additionally, we show that c-Abl and Arg are not merely redundant, as active Arg drives invasion in a STAT3-independent manner, and upregulates MMP-3 and MT1–MMP, in addition to MMP-1. Most importantly, c-Abl and Arg not only promote in vitro processes important for melanoma progression, but also promote metastasis in vivo, as inhibition of c-Abl/Arg kinase activity with the c-Abl/Arg inhibitor, nilotinib, dramatically inhibits metastasis in a mouse model. Taken together, these data identify c-Abl and Arg as critical, novel, drug targets in metastatic melanoma, and indicate that nilotinib may be useful in preventing metastasis in patients with melanomas harboring active c-Abl and Arg."

Air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and oxidants are important factors in causing exacerbations in asthmatics, and the source and composition of pollutants greatly affects pathological implications.This randomized crossover study investigated responses of the respiratory system to Stockholm subway air in asthmatics and healthy individuals. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins were quantified in the distal lung to provide a measure of shifts in lipid mediators in association with exposure to subway air relative to ambient air.Sixty-four oxylipins representing the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic pathways were screened using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-fluid. Validations through immunocytochemistry staining of BAL-cells were performed for 15-LOX-1, COX-1, COX-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Multivariate statistics were employed to interrogate acquired oxylipin and immunocytochemistry data in combination with patient clinical information.Asthmatics and healthy individuals exhibited divergent oxylipin profiles following exposure to ambient and subway air. Significant changes were observed in 8 metabolites of linoleic- and α-linolenic acid synthesized via the 15-LOX pathway, and of the COX product prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Oxylipin levels were increased in healthy individuals following exposure to subway air, whereas asthmatics evidenced decreases or no change.Several of the altered oxylipins have known or suspected bronchoprotective or anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting a possible reduced anti-inflammatory response in asthmatics following exposure to subway air. These observations may have ramifications for sensitive subpopulations in urban areas."

Most cofactors bind p97 through a ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) or UBX-like domain or linear sequence motifs, including the hitherto ill defined p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM). Here, we present the new, minimal consensus sequence RX5AAX2R as a general definition of the VIM that unites a novel family of known and putative p97 cofactors, among them UBXD1 and ZNF744/ANKZF1. We demonstrate that this minimal VIM consensus sequence is necessary and sufficient for p97 binding. Using NMR chemical shift mapping, we identified several residues of the p97 N-terminal domain (N domain) that are critical for VIM binding. Importantly, we show that cellular stress resistance conferred by the yeast VIM-containing cofactor Vms1 depends on the physical interaction between its VIM and the critical N domain residues of the yeast p97 homolog, Cdc48.

https://openalex.org/W2064771945,"The fates of BlaI, the gene repressor protein for the bla operon, BlaR1, the β-lactam sensor/signal transducer, and PC1 β-lactamase in four strains of Staphylococcus aureus upon exposure to four different β-lactam antibiotics were investigated as a function of time. The genes for the three proteins are encoded by the bla operon, the functions of which afford inducible resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in S. aureus. BlaR1 protein is expressed at low copy number. Acylation of the sensor domain of BlaR1 by β-lactam antibiotics initiates signal transduction to the cytoplasmic domain, a zinc protease, which is activated and degrades BlaI. This proteolytic degradation derepresses transcription of all three genes, resulting in inducible resistance. These processes take place within minutes of exposure to the antibiotics. The BlaR1 protein was shown to undergo fragmentation in three S. aureus strains within the time frame relevant for manifestation of resistance and was below the detection threshold in the fourth. Two specific sites of fragmentation were identified, one cytoplasmic and the other in the sensor domain. This is proposed as a means for turnover, a process required for recovery from induction of resistance in S. aureus in the absence of the antibiotic challenge. In S. aureus not exposed to β-lactam antibiotics (i.e. not acylated by antibiotic) the same fragmentation of BlaR1 is still observed, including the shedding of the sensor domain, an observation that leads to the conclusion that the sites of proteolysis might have evolved to predispose the protein to degradation within a set period of time.

Antibiotic acylates the C-terminal sensor domain located on the surface of the plasma membrane by a mechanism involving a surface loop of the protein (1Hanique S. Colombo M.L. Goormaghtigh E.

The acylated species enjoys a longevity that often exceeds the doubling time of most S. aureus strains; hence, a single BlaR1 modification by the antibiotic is sufficient for the entire bacterial generation (5Golemi-Kotra D.

It has been proposed that the cytoplasmic domain of BlaR1 is a zinc protease (6Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Hence, the surface sensing of the antibiotic (the signal) is amplified by the protease activity of the cytoplasmic domain.

It is also argued that once the signal is transduced to the cytoplasmic side, the zinc protease domain experiences autolytic fragmentation between amino acids Arg-293 and Arg-294, an event that was proposed to activate the protease domain from latency (6Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The now active protease domain would proteolyze the gene repressor BlaI, inducing expression of BlaI, β-lactamase, and BlaR1 itself as a mechanism against β-lactam antibiotics. Here, we examine the time dependence of the events involving BlaI, β-lactamase, and BlaR1 within four strains of S. aureus in the presence of four β-lactam antibiotics. We disclose herein that BlaR1 in some strains of S. aureus experiences the aforementioned fragmentation within a time frame relevant to induction of resistance. Furthermore, we document and characterize three BlaR1 species, two of which are fragmentation products. One fragmentation takes place in the cytoplasmic domain, and another takes place in the sensor domain. The proteolytic event in the sensor domain leads to shedding of the domain into the medium from the surface of the membrane. These fragmentation events are proposed herein as regulatory events necessary for the recovery from the induction of resistance in the absence of antibiotic. S. aureus strains NRS128 (also designated NCTC8325 (RN0031)), NRS123 (also designated MW2, C1999000459, USA400, and 99065), NRS70 (also designated N315), and NRS144 (also designated RN4220) were obtained through the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA) program. S. aureus strain MRSA252 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC® number BAA-1720). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of β-lactam compounds were determined by the broth microdilution method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (7Wikler M.A. Cockerill 3rd, F.R. Bush K. Dudley M.N. Eliopoulos G.M. Hardy D.J. Hecht D.W. Hindler J.F. Patel J.B. Powell M. Turnidge J.D. Weinstein M.P. Zimmer B.L. Ferraro M.J. Swenson J.M. Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically: Approved Standard. 7th Ed. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA2006Google Scholar). The MICs were determined in BBLTM Mueller Hinton II broth using a bacterial inoculum of 5 × 105 cfu/ml. All plates were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h before the results were interpreted. The procedure for MIC determination in the presence of recombinant BlaRS (rBlaRS)is described in the supplemental material. We compared the levels of BlaI and BlaR1 proteins in S. aureus NRS128, NRS123, NRS70, and MRSA252. The different cultures were first grown to exponential phase, at which point different β-lactam antibiotics were added at sub-MIC concentrations, and the cultures were allowed to grow for different durations to a maximum of 3 h. The concentrations of antibiotics were as described in supplemental Table S1: 3.2-fold below the MIC for penicillin G (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), and oxacillin (OXA); and 6.4-fold below MIC for 2-(2′-carboxyphenyl)-benzoyl-6-aminopenicillanic acid (CBAP) (in order to make it comparable with the concentrations used in a key previous publication) (6Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For each strain, 250 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in a 3-liter Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with 250 μl of an overnight culture (stationary phase). The cultures were grown at 37 °C, 220 rpm, until A625 reached 0.8 (∼4 h after inoculation). At this point, the cultures were divided in 30-ml aliquots in sterile 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. One 30-ml culture was grown in the absence of β-lactam compounds as the non-induced control; the other aliquots were supplemented with the corresponding concentration of each one of the β-lactam antibiotics assayed. Cultures were then grown at 37 °C, 220 rpm. Five-ml aliquots were taken from each culture at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 3 h. After 3 h of growth, all non-induced cultures reached an A625 of 1.9–2.2. After 3 h, the β-lactam-induced NRS128 cultures reached an A625 of 1.8–1.9; the β-lactam-induced NRS123 cultures reached an A625 of 1.2–1.3 upon induction with OXA and CBAP and of 1.8–2 upon induction with PEN and AMP; the β-lactam-induced NRS70 cultures reached an A625 of ∼1.2 upon induction with OXA and CBAP; and the β-lactam-induced MRSA252 cultures reached an A625 of 2.1–2.2. Each 5-ml aliquot was centrifuged for 30 min at 3200 × g and 4 °C, and the supernatant and cell pellets were separated. The supernatants (culture media) were kept at 4 °C, and β-lactamase activity was assayed immediately; the cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. For BlaR1 and BlaI protein detection in whole-cell extracts, the cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in Lysis Buffer 1 (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaHCO3, 1× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 15 μg/ml DNase I, 15 μg/ml RNase A, 200 μg/ml lysostaphin) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Total protein was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific); for each sample, a 60- or 80-μg portion of the total protein was loaded in Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protocol for membrane protein preparation is described in the supplemental material. The blaR1 gene was amplified from plasmid pI258 of S. aureus NRS128 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned in pET-24a(+) vector between NdeI and XhoI sites (supplemental material). This construct, designated pET-24a(+)_BlaRHis6, allowed inducible expression of BlaR1 from the T7 promoter, with eight additional amino acids on the C terminus: LEHHHHHH (the first two amino acids introduced by the XhoI cloning site, and the His6 tag). E. coli BL21 StarTM(DE3) competent cells were transformed with plasmid pET-24a(+)_BlaRHis6, and transformants were selected on kanamycin plates. Recombinant BlaR1 (rBlaR1) was expressed in E. coli BL21 StarTM(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-24a(+)_BlaRHis6, upon induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 28 °C. Membrane proteins were prepared by ultracentrifugation from a 500-ml culture. A detailed protocol for the induction and membrane protein preparation is described in the supplemental material. rBlaRS and rBlaI expressed in E. coli were purified as described previously (5Golemi-Kotra D.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7975-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against BlaRS (anti-BlaRS, 1.93 mg/ml) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against BlaI (anti-BlaI, 1.86 mg/ml) were generated by immunization of a rabbit with either purified rBlaRS or rBlaI protein, respectively (EZBiolab). The antibodies were (NH4)2SO4-precipitated from the sera or purified by Protein A chromatography by EZBiolab. Stabilized goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit-HRP) was purchased from Pierce, Thermo Scientific. For the detection of BlaR1, the samples were resolved in 10, 11, or 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. For the detection of BlaI, the samples were separated in 15% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot® transfer medium, Bio-Rad), using Tris-glycine-methanol buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol) at 4 °C, 2 h, 200 mA, or to 0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, using CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% methanol), at 4 °C, 1.5 h, 140 mA, when indicated. The membranes were blocked at 4 °C overnight in 10 ml of Blotto (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, 3% nonfat milk, 0.02% sodium azide). In the case of Western blot analysis on S. aureus extracts, the membranes were blocked with Blotto supplemented with 100 μg/ml human IgG (Sigma), and 1× Protein A/G blocker (GenScript), in order to block the IgG-binding proteins present in the cell extracts (including Protein A). BlaI and BlaR1 were detected by immunoblot analysis using the rabbit anti-BlaI and anti-BlaRS primary antibodies, respectively (1:1000 dilution in both cases), and a 1:15,000 dilution of anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody. The antibodies were diluted in Tween/Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 1.1% nonfat dry milk. In the case of Western blot analyses on S. aureus extracts, the antibody dilutions were also supplemented with 10 μg/ml human IgG and 1× Protein A/G blocker. The membranes were washed with Tween/Tris-buffered saline. The immune complexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminiscence system (SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration substrate) according to the manufacturer's instructions and CL-XPosureTM films (Thermo Scientific). Alternatively, the ONE-HOUR IP-WesternTM kit (rabbit; GenScript) was used to detect BlaR1, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each membrane, 40 μg of anti-BlaRS antibody were incubated with 100 μl of IP-WB1 solution for 2 h at room temperature. The presence of PC1 β-lactamase in the media of S. aureus cultures was evaluated using the chromogenic β-lactam nitrocefin as substrate. The medium was separated from the cells by centrifugation for 30 min at 3200 × g at 4 °C. A 1-ml portion of culture was first equilibrated to room temperature, and the reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of a 10 mm nitrocefin stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (final nitrocefin concentration was 99 μm). Nitrocefin hydrolysis was monitored at 500 nm, for 2 min at room temperature. The initial rate was obtained from the slope of the time course, which was linear in the first 2 min of the reaction. At a saturating concentration of nitrocefin, the initial rate measured is a good estimation of the Vmax, which is directly proportional to the concentration of PC1 β-lactamase in the medium sample. Immobilized anti-BlaRS antibody (anti-BlaRS/Protein A resin) was prepared as described earlier (9Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A detailed protocol is provided in the supplemental material. The anti-BlaRS/Protein A resin were stored at 4 °C. Prior to specific immunoprecipitation of BlaR1 and its proteolytic fragments from either S. aureus whole-cell extracts or culture media, the S. aureus IgG-binding proteins were removed by incubation with IgG-SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). Because the anti-BlaRS antibody can efficiently immunoprecipitate the denatured target (as determined in preliminary experiments with purified rBlaRS; data not shown), the samples were supplemented with SDS and boiled for 5 min. For the immunoprecipitation of the BlaR1 C-terminal fragment from culture medium, the medium was first incubated with IgG-SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow, and the supernatant was then supplemented with SDS and boiled. For immunoprecipitation of BlaR1 from cell extracts, the cells were first resuspended in buffer with SDS and boiled, and after centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with IgG-SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow. In either case, the sample was then supplemented with Triton X-100 (2.5% final concentration), mixed with anti-BlaRS/Protein A resin, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant (unbound proteins) was collected, and the resin (bound protein) was washed. The bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (non-reducing), and a small aliquot was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. BlaR1 protein and fragments were identified by immunoblot analysis, as described above. A detailed protocol is provided in the supplemental material. For in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, the eluted proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the protein band of interest was cut from the gel and processed, as described below. For Edman degradation, the eluted proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.2-μm PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue; the protein band of interest was cut from the membrane and sent for analysis (Proseq Inc., Boxford, MA). E. coli BL21 StarTM(DE3) cells harboring pET-24a(+)_BlaRHis6 plasmid were induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to express rBlaR1 protein, as described above. Cells were centrifuged (30 min at 3000 × g), and 200 mg of wet pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 1× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C, supplemented with 2% final concentration of SDS, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation (15 min at 8000 × g) the soluble fraction was collected and supplemented with 10% glycerol and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. The total soluble proteins were separated on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE using a PrepCell (Bio-Rad, model 491, 28-mm gel tube) continuous electrophoresis unit. Two-ml fractions were collected (at 1 ml/min). The presence of rBlaR1 in each fraction was evaluated in 20-μl aliquots by immunoblot analysis using anti-BlaRS-specific antibody, as described above. The fractions containing rBlaR1 were pooled, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% before immunoaffinity purification using the anti-BlaRS/Protein A resin as described above. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer and separated again on 10% SDS-PAGE using a PrepCell continuous electrophoresis unit. This purification step allowed separation of rBlaR1 from the immunoglobulins. The presence of rBlaR1 in the fractions was followed by immunoblot analysis. Fractions containing the pure rBlaR1 protein were pooled and concentrated using a 10-kDa Amicon Ultra device (Millipore). Non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer was added to this concentrated protein fraction, and the sample was run on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2-μm PVDF membrane. rBlaR1 was visualized by Coomassie staining. The protein band was cut and sent for N terminus determination by Edman degradation (Proseq Inc.). Individual bands were excised with a clean razor blade, placed into individual tubes, and digested in gel essentially according to previously published work (10Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were dehydrated and rehydrated with alternating addition of 2:1 acetonitrile (ACN), 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 60 °C and alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature. Bands intended for pepsin digestion were then exchanged with alternating washes of ACN and 10 mm HCl. The samples were then dried in a SpeedVac. Gel bands were swollen in ∼20 μl of sequencing grade trypsin (20 ng/μl) or pepsin (75 ng/μl) and allowed to absorb for 30 min at 4 °C. A 50–100-μl portion of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (trypsin digestions) or 10 mm HCl (pepsin digestions) was added to cover the band and then incubated overnight at 37 °C for complete proteolysis or 6 h for the pepsin digestion. The liquid was removed and pooled with an additional portion of 30% ACN, 2% formic acid and then dried in a SpeedVac. In-gel pepsin digests were quenched first by the addition of 1 m NH4OH and then reacidified. Samples were resuspended in 15 μl of 0.5% formic acid and then Zip-tip-cleaned (Millipore). A 2-μl aliquot of the sample (10 μl total) was injected directly onto a 75 μm × 15-cm column (in-house packed with Jupiter 90 Å Proteo C12), running at 300 nl/min. Sample was washed for 12 min with 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid and then separated over a 60-min gradient from 2 to 35% B (B = 98% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). Analysis by MS/MS was performed on a QTrap 5500 mass spectrometry system (ABSciex) running in ion trap IDA mode coupled to a two-dimensional Eksignet Ultra Nano ultrahigh performance liquid chromatograph. Acquisition parameters were essentially identical to those reported earlier (11DiGiuseppe Champion P.A. Champion M.M. Manzanillo P. Cox J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 950-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two summed survey scans (EMS) were followed by six data-dependent full-scan MS/MS scans (enhanced product ion) by the TOP6 method. Dynamic fill time was used with a total ion current target of 1 × 107 ions for EMS and 1 × 108 ions for enhanced product ion scans. Data files were searched using the Mascot (Matrix Science) and Paragon (ABSciex) search engines. Briefly, mass tolerance was set to 2.0, and MS/MS was set to 0.8 Da. Two missed cleavages were considered to decrease protease specificity. For Mascot, carbamidomethylation of Cys was defined as a permanent modification, and variable modifications of carbamidomethylation were considered on Lys residues and peptide N termini. Deamidation on Asn and Gln and oxidation of Met were also considered as variable modifications. Paragon utilizes a custom set of modifications, which are detailed in the literature (12Shilov I.V. Seymour S.L. Patel A.A. Loboda A. Tang W.H. Keating S.P. Hunter C.L. Nuwaysir L.M. Schaeffer D.A. Mol.

As one example of the instances of full-length BlaR1 identification, 15 peptides with confidence >95% were detected and sequenced. Sequence coverage was 30% with respect to the full-length protein entry and 62% based on the new N terminus reported here. False positive assessment was performed in accordance with the Molecular and Cellular Proteomics guidelines (13Jones A.R. Orchard S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2067-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and are included as fully annotated spectra and sequences within (supplemental Figs. S6, S7, S9–S13, S15, and S16). In order to address the question of which peptide(s) are at the N terminus of the protein, the data were searched using semitryptic tolerances. This enables the search engine to identify peptides that are non-tryptic for either the N or C terminus but not both. This allows for the processed N terminus of a protein to be detected and determined. Non-canonical search tolerances are automatically considered in the Paragon search algorithm and are included in these data. All BlaR1 spectra were manually annotated for confirmation. Targeted detection and sequencing of specific peptides from BlaR1 for enhanced sensitivity and quantification were performed on samples prepared identically. Generation of the MRM transitions was determined using MRM-initiated detection and sequencing as well as the empirical MS/MS data from the LC/MS/MS of the gel bands (11DiGiuseppe Champion P.A.

In-gel-digested E. coli-expressed rBlaR1 was used to determine appropriate peptide transitions for analysis. Briefly, three or four transitions were generated for each peptide from the empirical MS/MS spectra obtained from data-dependent analysis and search results. MRM acquisition was performed on a QTrap 5500 running in triple-quadrupole mode. Quantification was performed with peak areas using Multi-Quant (AB Sciex), and relative peak ratios for identical peptides are illustrated between samples (supplemental Figs. S9 and S13). In order to evaluate the time course of activation of the bla system, we monitored the levels of the three proteins encoded in the operon (BlaR1, BlaI, and β-lactamase) in S. aureus strains NRS70, NRS123, NRS128, and MRSA252. The process of induction was with concentrations of antibiotic below the MICs of CBAP, PEN, AMP, and OXA (supplemental Table S1). CBAP is an excellent inducer of the system, but it is not a clinical drug and is no longer available commercially. Ampicillin is an extended spectrum penicillin, penicillin G is a β-lactamase-sensitive narrow spectrum penicillin, and oxacillin is a β-lactamase-resistant narrow spectrum penicillin (in the same class as methicillin). All four strains used in this study contain the complete bla system. The genes of the bla operon are localized in the chromosome of strain MRSA252 and in plasmids in the other three strains (plasmid pI258 in NRS128, plasmid pMW2 in strain NRS123, and plasmid pN315 in NRS70). Strains NRS70 and MRSA252 also contain the complete mec operon (localized in plasmid pN315 and in the chromosome, respectively). Strain NRS123 also presents the mec operon (localized in plasmid pMW2), but the mecI gene is missing, and the mecR1 gene has a deletion and codes only for amino acids 1–325. This strain is believed to rely on BlaR1 and BlaI for the regulation of induction of β-lactamase and PBP2a. The BlaI proteins from the different strains used here have 98–100% identity (100% identity between BlaI from NRS128 and MRSA252) and only 59–60% identity with MecI of strains NRS70 and MRSA252 (16Larkin M.A. Blackshields G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W695-W699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The BlaR1 proteins from the different strains that we used exhibit 93–99% identity (99% identity between BlaR1 from NRS128 and MRSA252) and only 30% identity with MecR1 from strain MRSA252 (with 40% homology in the sensor domain region). The β-lactamases from the different strains exhibit 98–100% identity (100% identity for the enzymes from NRS128 and MRSA252). We will discuss first the changes observed with BlaI. In the absence of antibiotic, BlaI, a protein of 14.4 kDa, remains stable and intact (Fig. 2A). As we determined earlier, concentrations of BlaI in NRS128 and NRS70 are 2.3–6.4 μm (NRS128) and 1.3–3.6 μm (NRS70) in the cells at the exponential phase of growth and 0.98–2.7 μm (NRS128) and 0.75–2.1 μm (NRS70) in the stationary phase (8Llarrull L.I. Prorok M. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7975-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All four antibiotics initiate the process of degradation of BlaI within minutes. As depicted in Fig. 2 for strain NRS128, induction with CBAP was rapid (turnover of BlaI) and was sustained for the 3-h monitoring period. With the other three antibiotics as well, induction was rapid, but we observed gradual expression of BlaI, which was no longer degraded toward the end of the time course (Fig. 2A). This pattern was the same for strains NRS70, NRS123, and MRSA252 (supplemental Fig. S1). In general, CBAP was the best inducer, and oxacillin was the second best, but with penicillin G, ampicillin, and oxacillin, induction was g"

IntroductionEndostatin, first discovered by Folkman and collaborators (1O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4211) Google Scholar), is a potent therapeutic agent through its ability to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels and reduce tumor growth as a single drug or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (2Marneros A.G. Olsen B.R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Ling Y. Yang Y. Lu N. You Q.D. Wang S. Gao Y. Chen Y. Guo Q.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Endostatin, which corresponds to the C-terminal domain of collagen XVIII (NC-1 domain), is released by cleavage of a proteolysis-sensitive unstructured hinge region. Endostatin prevents the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of endothelial cells, blocks cell intravasation, and may also induce apoptosis (4Dhanabal M. Volk R. Ramchandran R. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Dixelius J. Cross M. Matsumoto T. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L.

Inhibition of the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 3The abbreviations used are: HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellAMC7-amino-4-methyl coumarinAPN/CD13aminopeptidase NCA-074N-(l-3-trans-propylcarbomoyl-oxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-isoleucyl-l-prolineE-64L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidio)butaneFMKfluoromethyl ketoneMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseRPreverse phaseZbenzyloxycarbonyl. occurs in response to VEGF (7Yamaguchi N.

The various effects that endostatin elicits on cells is indicative of its multiple modes of action and molecular partners (e.g. integrin αVβ3 and integrin α5β1, glypicans, heparin and heparan sulfates) that form the so-called “endostatin interaction network” (8Faye C. Inforzato A. Bignon M. Hartmann D.J. Muller L. Ballut L. Olsen B.R. Day A.J. Ricard-Blum S. Biochem. J. 2010; 427: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Alterations in endostatin levels that are frequently observed in pathophysiological processes are of crucial importance. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in the production and catabolism of endostatin remains poorly characterized. Although endostatin is generally described as a single protein of ∼20 kDa, several forms of varying lengths have been identified in vivo in both humans and mice (9John H. Preissner K.T. Forssmann W.G. Ständker L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10217-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The first protease identified as responsible for the release of murine endostatin (20-kDa form) was cathepsin L (10Felbor U. Dreier L. Bryant R.A. Ploegh H.L. Olsen B.R. Mothes W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have also been implicated in the release of high molecular mass endostatin forms (24–30 kDa) (11Wen W. Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Arbiser J.L. Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6052-6056PubMed Google Scholar). Despite high primary structural identity in collagen XVIII between human and mice, their hinge regions display some critical differences in their amino acid sequences (9John H. Preissner K.T. Forssmann W.G. Ständker L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10217-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Ständker L. Schrader M. Kanse S.M. Jürgens M. Forssmann W.G. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consequently, the proteases involved in the release of human endostatin from collagen XVIII have not been clearly identified.The aim of this study was to delineate the role of cysteine cathepsins in the production and/or degradation of human collagen XVIII-derived endostatin and to analyze the consequences in its anti-angiogenic properties on endothelial cells. Our results suggest that cathepsins may finely tune release and breakdown of endostatin and give new molecular insights into its angiogenic mechanisms. These data also advocate that through endostatin-derived peptides, cysteine cathepsins and aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) may both participate in the multidirectional network of proteolytic interactions that occur during angiogenesis (13Mason S.D. Joyce J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes, Inhibitors, and PeptidesHuman cathepsins B, L, H, and S were from Calbiochem (VWR Intl., Libourne, France). Aminopeptidase N was from R&D Systems Europe (Lille, France). Bestatin, l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidio)butane (E-64), N-(l-3-trans-propylcarbomoyl-oxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-isoleucyl-l-proline (CA-074), methylmethanethiosulfonate, pepstatin A, and PMSF were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). EDTA was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ac-DEVD-FMK (FMK, fluoromethyl ketone) was from Calbiochem, and bestatin was R&D Systems Europe. DTT was from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). Z-FR-AMC, Z-GPR-AMC, Z-LR-AMC, H-R-AMC, and Ac-DEVD-AMC were from Calbiochem, whereas H-A-AMC was supplied by Bachem. Cathepsins were titrated by E-64 in their activity buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and Brij 35 0.01%). FRET peptides (Endo-01 to Endo-10) were prepared as described previously (14Godat E. Lecaille F. Desmazes C. Duchêne S. Weidauer E. Saftig P. Brömme D. Vandier C. Lalmanach G. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). G10T (GSDPNGRRLT), Sc-G10T (i.e. scrambled G10T; GNPTDLRSRG), and K15T (KSVWHGSDPNGRRLT) peptides were synthesized by Eurogentec SA (Seraing, Belgium).Kinetics MeasurementThe hydrolysis of Endo-01 to Endo-10 substrates was followed by measuring fluorescence release (Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter; excitation wavelength, 320 nm; emission wavelength, 420 nm). The system was formerly standardized using Abz-FR-OH prepared by the total tryptic hydrolysis of an Abz-FR-pNA solution, with ϵ410 nm = 8,800 m−1 cm−1 for p-nitroanilide as reported previously (15Serveau C. Lalmanach G. Juliano M.A. Scharfstein J. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Final enzyme concentrations were 1–5 nm for cathepsins L and S, 5–10 nm for cathepsin B, and 10–100 nm for cathepsin H. Assays (triplicate) were carried out at 37 °C by adding cathepsins to intramolecularly quenched fluorescent peptides (0.5 μm) in their activity buffer. Second-order rate constants (kcat/Km) for the hydrolysis of Endo-01 to Endo-10 were determined under pseudo-first order conditions, i.e. using a substrate concentration far below the Km). Under these conditions, the Michaelis-Menten equation is reduced to: v = kobs·S, where kobs = Vm/Km. Integrating this equation over time gives ln [S] = −kobs·t + ln[S]0, where [S]0 and [S] are the substrate concentrations at time 0 and time t, respectively. Because Vm = kcat·[E]t, where [E]t is the final enzyme concentration, dividing kobs by [E]t yields the kcat/Km ratio. The kobs for the first-order substrate hydrolysis was calculated by fitting experimental data to the first-order equation using the Enzfitter software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Kinetics data (i.e. specificity constants) are reported as means ± S.D. Additionally, enzymes (10 nm) were incubated with peptides (100 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C in the assay buffer before RP-HPLC analysis (Purospher star RP18 column, Merck) using a 20-min linear (0–60%) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA (λ = 220 nm). Cleavage sites were identified by mass spectrometry (Valérie Labas, Proteomics Facilities, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique Tours).Degradation of Human Endostatin by Cysteine CathepsinsRecombinant human endostatin (1 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 2 mm DTT in the presence of proteases (enzyme/substrate molar ratio, 1:200 to 1:5). Hydrolysis products were separated by RP-HPLC (Purospher star RP8 column, Merck) using a 35-min linear (0–60%) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA and analyzed by mass spectrometry. In parallel samples were submitted to a 15% SDS-PAGE then electroblotted. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with a rabbit anti-endostatin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (dilution of 1:1000) and then with a anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) (dilution: 1: 5000) and revealed (ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). In addition, endostatin was incubated with cathepsins (enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10) for 0–120 min, and samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the level of uncleaved residual endostatin was estimated by densitometry (NIH ImageJ software). Control was performed in the presence of E-64 (10 mm).Silencing of Cathepsins B, L, and S by RNA InterferenceHUVECs (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) were grown in endothelial cell growth medium, containing 2% FCS at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Small interfering RNAs for cathepsin L (siCatL), cathepsin S (siCatS), cathepsin B (siCatB), and a negative control siRNA (siCTL) were obtained from Qiagen SA (Courtaboeuf, France) (Table 1). At 80% confluence, cells were transfected with 40 nm siRNA in endothelial basal medium using HiPerFect transfection agent (Qiagen SA). Total RNAs were extracted at different times (24, 48, 72, and 96 h) (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen SA), and reverse transcription was performed on total RNA (1 mg) using RevertAid M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (GmbH, Germany). Reduction of cathepsins transcripts was determined by quantitative real-time PCR using the MyiQ system (Bio-Rad) in the presence of SyberGreen Mix (ABgene, Epsom, UK). Sense and antisense primers for cathepsins were reported in Table 1. For quantification of relative expression levels, the ΔΔCt method was used (normalization gene, human ribosomal protein S16 (RPS16)).TABLE 1siRNA sequences and primers used for quantitative PCR experimentsProteinSequences of siRNA (5′–3′)Sequences of PCR primers (5′–3′)Cat S SenseGGAUAUAUUCGGAUGGCAAGCTTCACAACCTGGAGCATTC AntisenseUUGCCAUCCGAAUAUAUCCGGCAATATCCGATTAGGGTTTGACat L SenseGAUCCGAGUGUGAUUUGAAGGAAAACTGGGAGGCTTATCTC AntisenseUUCAAUCACACUCGGAUCAGCATAATCCATTAGGCCACCACat B SenseGCAUGAUUCUUUAAUAGAAAGAGTTATGTTTACCGAGGACCT AntisenseUUCUAUUAAAGAAUCAUGCGCAGATCCGGTCAGAGATGGRPS16 SenseACGTGGCCCAGATTTATGCTAT AntisenseTGGAAGCCTCATCCACATATTTC Open table in a new tab At various post-transfection times, cells were rinsed in PBS, lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, Nonidet P40 1% in the presence of 100 μm E-64, 0.5 mm PMSF, 40 μm pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and centrifuged, and the protein concentration was measured (BCA protein assay kit, Interchim, Montluçon, France). Following running by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, Western blots were accomplished as described earlier using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (dilution of 1:1000) directed, respectively, against endostatin (Abcam), cathepsin L, cathepsin S, and cathepsin B (Calbiochem). Furthermore, proteolytic activities of cathepsins were measured at 37 °C in both supernatants and cell lysates. Assays were performed in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, using Z-FR-AMC (50 mm) as a substrate for both cathepsins B and L and Z-LR-AMC (50 mm) as a preferred substrate for cathepsins S and K (Spectramax Gemini, Molecular Devices; excitation wavelength = 350 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) (16Serveau-Avesque C. Martino M.F. Hervé-Grépinet V. Hazouard E. Gauthier F. Diot E. Lalmanach G. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Assay for specific cathepsin K activity was achieved by using Z-GPR-AMC (50 μm) in the presence of CA-074. Alternatively, because only cathepsin S retains its proteolytic activity under mildly alkaline conditions, sample was incubated in a 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C before the residual specific activity of cathepsin S was measured using Z-LR-AMC (50 μm). Overall cathepsin activity was determined by E-64 titration, whereas cathepsin B was titrated by CA-074.Cell CultureProliferation AssaysHUVEC cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (10,000 cells/well) for 24 h in complete medium before adding VEGF (20 ng/ml) in basal medium (PromoCell). Moreover, either 0.1 mm endostatin, 0.1 mm hydrolysis products, or peptides G10T and K15T (10−14 to 10−7 m) were combined to the medium in the presence of 20 mm E-64. 24 h later, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (Promega) was added (20 ml/well), and absorbance was measured after a 2-h incubation (l = 490 nm; Thermomax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Correspondingly, HUVEC cells were seeded 24 h after siRNA transfection. 24 h later, the medium was replaced by basal medium in the presence or not of 20 mm E-64. After 2 h, both VEGF (20 ng/ml) and endostatin (10−14 to 10−6 m) were added. Cell proliferation was determined as described previously.Caspase-3 ActivityHUVEC cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (100,000 cells/well) for 24 h before addition of VEGF (20 ng/ml) in basal medium together with endostatin or its hydrolysis products (0.1 mm) or endostatin-derived peptides (G10T and K15T, 10−8 to 10−6 m). After 10 h, cells were rinsed with PBS and then lysed (buffer lysis, 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 ml of EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2% Nonidet P40). The proteolytic activity of caspase-3 was measured in the presence of 50 mm Z-DEVD-AMC (excitation wavelength = 380 nm, emission wavelength = 450 nm; Spectramax Gemini) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT. Assays were repeated in the presence of 50 mm Z-DEVD-FMK, an irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor.Migration AssaysFibronectin-coated (50 ng/ml, 1 h, 37 °C) filter inserts (pores, 8-mm diameter) were positioned on 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson) in the presence of VEGF (20 ng/ml) as chemoattractant. Control was performed in the absence of VEGF. Trypsinized HUVEC cells (250,000 cells/ml) were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with endostatin (0.1 mm) or its hydrolysis fragments (0.1 mm) and then placed in inserts (50,000 cells/insert) for 5 h. After fixation for 10 min in methanol and staining with hematoxylin for 2 min, cells present in the lower section were counted (median of three fields/insert) using an inverted microscope (magnification ×200). Experiments were repeated with both G10T and K15T (10−8 to 10−6 m). Alternatively, siRNA-transfected cells were seeded 24 h after transfection in 24-well plates (250,000 cells per well). After 24 h, complete medium was replaced with basal medium in the presence or absence of E-64 (20 mm) and recombinant endostatin was added (10−9 to 10−7 m). After 12 h, cells were taken off and placed on inserts, and migration assays were carried out as described previously.Aminopeptidase N AssayAssays were carried out by preincubating APN (20 ng) for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, prior adding H-Ala-AMC (100 mm) as recommended by the supplier (excitation wavelength, 380 nm; emission wavelength, 460 nm; Spectramax Gemini). Inhibitory assays were performed in the presence of bestatin, G10T, and Sc-G10T (0–200 mm), and results were reported as means ± S.D. (triplicate experiments).Endothelial Tube Formation AssayTwo hundred microliters of Matrigel (10 mg/ml, BD Biosciences) was applied to pre-cooled 48-well plates, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and then allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C. HUVECs (1 × 105 cells per well, TCS Cellworks, Buckingham, England) were incubated with a range of predetermined concentrations of bestatin, G10T, Sc-G10T, or vehicle-only controls. After incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 16 h, cells were viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and images taken using a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera (×20 magnification). Total tubule branching was counted, and results were expressed as the total length of tubule formation per field of view. All variables were performed in duplicate, and seven images were taken from each replicate before analysis (17Burden R.E. Gormley J.A. Jaquin T.J. Small D.M. Quinn D.J. Hegarty S.M. Ward C. Walker B.

Data were presented as median ± lower and upper quartile (*, p < 0.1; **, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001).DISCUSSIONProteases are key players in angiogenesis due to their ability to activate and release cytokines and angiogenic factors (matrikines) from constituents of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix. As such, they are potential therapeutic targets in the regulation of neovascularization, particularly during neoplastic processes. However, the failure of early clinical trials using MMP inhibitors clearly indicates that the sustainable molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Since the late 1990s, an increasing number of anti-angiogenic factors released by proteases were identified, and most studies have focused on their therapeutic impact in high pharmaceutical doses, particularly in controlling tumor progression (37Nyberg P. Xie L. Kalluri R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3967-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In contrast, few studies have investigated their physiological and pathophysiological roles. These latter observations demonstrate the importance of studying the regulation of these anti-angiogenic factors and raise the question of the ambivalent role of proteases involved in their homeostasis. Cysteine cathepsins are commonly reported to participate to and enhance cell growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and comprehensible relationships have been established between their deregulation and cancer progression (25Mohamed M.M. Sloane B.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 26Vasiljeva O. Reinheckel T. Peters C. Turk D. Turk V. Turk B. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38Turk B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). For instance, cathepsin S, which can degrade anti-angiogenic collagen IV-derived peptides and release proangiogenic fragments from laminin, has been described to favor angiogenesis and microvessel formation in physiological neovascularization (39Wang B. Sun J. Kitamoto S. Yang M. Grubb A. Chapman H.A. Kalluri R. Shi G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6020-6029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our current perception of the role of cathepsins is evolving. In addition to digestive and executioner enzymes, cathepsins that are subject to complex and contrasting controls and checkpoints (transcription, translation, trafficking, and microenvironment) may also act as signaling and regulatory molecules (40Reiser J. Adair B. Reinheckel T. J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). More than 30 proteases, including cysteine cathepsins, have been catalogued with beneficial tumor-suppressive roles in opposition to the currently established rule that their up-regulation is synonymous with tumor progression and poor clinical prognosis (41López-Otín C. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Contrary to other previous studies, cathepsin L KO mice displayed early onset aggressive tumors and an hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in a skin carcinogenesis model, proving that cathepsin L may have a protective role in cancer in association with its critical role for the termination of growth factor signaling (42Reinheckel T. Hagemann S. Dollwet-Mack S. Martinez E. Lohmüller T. Zlatkovic G. Tobin D.J. Maas-Szabowski N. Peters C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 43Dennemärker J.

These statements emphasize that proteases may have dual roles and exert for instance opposing proangiogenic and angiostatic effects. Such proteases do not represent rare exceptions and, most probably, in a defined biological context, their number will grow depending on tissue type, cellular microenvironment, and surrounding signaling events (13Mason S.D. Joyce J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 41López-Otín C. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). As a consequence this also means a supplementary level of difficulty to delineate proangiogenic and anti-angiogenic properties of proteases with challenging activities and to assign a specific role to them. Our current findings support that cathepsins L and S release endostatin fragments with superior proapoptotic and angiostatic properties than its precursor, although they are both better known for their opposite action. Also our results suggest that, besides recycling properties with respect to the release and hydrolysis of the NC1 domain of collagen XVIII, cysteine cathepsins could have a likely regulatory function of angiogenesis via the generation of angiostatic peptides K15T and G10T. In conclusion, earlier reports have proposed that endostatin may be released proteolytically from collagen XVIII by various potential proteases including cathepsins, elastase, and MMPs. Furthermore, some cysteine cathepsins and acid cathepsin D, in contrast to MMPs, were also candidates to degrade endostatin, suggesting a complex role for cathepsins in the regulation of its anti-angiogenic potential (19Ferreras M. Felbor U. Lenhard T. Olsen B.R. Delaissé J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that cathepsins S and L liberate human endostatin by cleavage in the C-terminal sensitive hinge region of collagen XVIII (Fig. 7). Cathepsins L and S may then further cleave human endostatin and generate peptides (i.e. G10T and K15T), which display significantly increased angiostatic properties. Specifically, we have demonstrated that the endostatin-derived G10T peptide potently inhibits proliferation of HUVECs, is an effective proapoptotic molecule, and significantly impairs tube formation, suggesting that it could participate in the homeostasis of vascularization. In addition, we hypothesized that the bioactive NGR-containing G10T peptide act, at least in part, through targeting of aminopeptidase N.Given the superior anti-angiogenic efficacy of such peptides, they could be of enhanced therapeutic value compared with commercial full-size endostatin (also known as Endostar). Furthermore, due to the presence of the NGR neovasculature homing motif that targets and binds to APN as does bestatin, endostatin-derived peptides could also represent attractive cargos by conjugation to additional anticancer drugs to improve anti-angiogenic efficiency and bioavailability. IntroductionEndostatin, first discovered by Folkman and collaborators (1O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4211) Google Scholar), is a potent therapeutic agent through its ability to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels and reduce tumor growth as a single drug or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (2Marneros A.G. Olsen B.R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Ling Y. Yang Y. Lu N. You Q.D. Wang S. Gao Y. Chen Y. Guo Q.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Endostatin, which corresponds to the C-terminal domain of collagen XVIII (NC-1 domain), is released by cleavage of a proteolysis-sensitive unstructured hinge region. Endostatin prevents the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of endothelial cells, blocks cell intravasation, and may also induce apoptosis (4Dhanabal M. Volk R. Ramchandran R. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Dixelius J. Cross M. Matsumoto T. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L.

The various effects that endostatin elicits on cells is indicative of its multiple modes of action and molecular partners (e.g. integrin αVβ3 and integrin α5β1, glypicans, heparin and heparan sulfates) that form the so-called “endostatin interaction network” (8Faye C. Inforzato A. Bignon M. Hartmann D.J. Muller L. Ballut L. Olsen B.R. Day A.J. Ricard-Blum S. Biochem. J. 2010; 427: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Alterations in endostatin levels that are frequently observed in pathophysiological processes are of crucial importance. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in the production and catabolism of endostatin remains poorly characterized. Although endostatin is generally described as a single protein of ∼20 kDa, several forms of varying lengths have been identified in vivo in both humans and mice (9John H. Preissner K.T. Forssmann W.G. Ständker L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10217-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The first protease identified as responsible for the release of murine endostatin (20-kDa form) was cathepsin L (10Felbor U. Dreier L. Bryant R.A. Ploegh H.L. Olsen B.R. Mothes W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have also been implicated in the release of high molecular mass endostatin forms (24–30 kDa) (11Wen W. Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Arbiser J.L. Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6052-6056PubMed Google Scholar). Despite high primary structural identity in collagen XVIII between human and mice, their hinge regions display some critical differences in their amino acid sequences (9John H. Preissner K.T. Forssmann W.G. Ständker L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10217-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Ständker L. Schrader M. Kanse S.M. Jürgens M. Forssmann W.G. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consequently, the proteases involved in the release of human endostatin from collagen XVIII have not been clearly identified.The aim of this study was to delineate the role of cysteine cathepsins in the production and/or degradation of human collagen XVIII-derived endostatin and to analyze the consequences in its anti-angiogenic properties on endothelial cells. Our results suggest that cathepsins may finely tune release and breakdown of endostatin and give new molecular insights into its angiogenic mechanisms. These data also advocate that through endostatin-derived peptides, cysteine cathepsins and aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) may both participate in the multidirectional network of proteolytic interactions that occur during angiogenesis (13Mason S.D.

To determine how NF-κB builds transcriptional control networks, we need to obtain a topographic map of the factor bound to the genome and correlate it with global gene expression. We used a ChIP cloning technique and identified novel NF-κB target genes in response to virus infection. We discovered that most of the NF-κB-bound genomic sites deviate from the consensus and are located away from conventional promoter regions. Remarkably, we identified a novel abundant NF-κB-binding site residing in specialized Alu-repetitive elements having the potential for long range transcription regulation, thus suggesting that in addition to its known role, NF-κB has a primate-specific function and a role in human evolution. By combining these data with global gene expression profiling of virus-infected cells, we found that most of the sites bound by NF-κB in the human genome do not correlate with changes in gene expression of the nearby genes and they do not appear to function in the context of synthetic promoters.

The transcription factor NF-κB orchestrates gene expression programs controlling the response to a variety of stimuli, including bacterial and viral infections and diverse biological functions, such as inflammation, cell proliferation, cellular homeostatic mechanisms, and carcinogenesis (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, NF-κB is a mixture of homo- and heterodimers of a family of five sequence-specific DNA-binding protein subunits that include p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar). Access of NF-κB to DNA elements is inhibited by a family of inhibitory molecules called IκBs (IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, IκBϵ, IκBζ, p105, and p100) (3Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar, 4Wan F. Lenardo M.J. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a000067Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two major pathways of NF-κB activation have been characterized (5Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The canonical pathway culminates with the nuclear translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimer, whereas the non-canonical pathway depends primarily on the activity of the p52/RelB heterodimer. The canonical pathway plays an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses, whereas the non-canonical pathway is critical for lymphoid tissue development, organization, and function (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

NF-κB proteins work as transcriptional activators or repressors by binding to the consensus DNA sequence 5′-GGGRNYYYCC-3′ known as the κB site. There are ∼106 consensus κB sites in the human genome, and ∼500 genes are regulated by NF-κB (a list of all known NF-κB target genes has been compiled by T. Gilmore; see the Boston University NF-κB Transcription Factors Web site) (reviewed in Refs. 7Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G.

However, the actual number of putative κB sites in the human genome is much greater because variations that deviate from the consensus motif are also bound by NF-κB and have been also shown to play critical roles in gene transcription despite the wide variation in NF-κB DNA binding affinity (9Chen F.E.

Several studies have provided evidence that transcription factors, like NF-κB, can bind to many non-consensus sites with affinities similar to the ones displayed for consensus sites (reviewed in Ref. 16Farnham P.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and that most of the binding events in the nucleus occur in extragenic regions located far away from enhancers and promoters (17Fujiwara T.

However, these previous studies did not test for any significance of NF-κB binding and have raised a number of additional questions. For example, what proportion of the κB sites is functional? How do the κB sites that regulate gene expression compete with those that are not involved in gene regulation? Are there κB sites without functional importance? Recently, we have established the biological significance of NF-κB interaction with three κB sites localized on specialized Alu-repetitive elements and showed that this binding is required for the subsequent delivery of NF-κB to target enhancers (e.g. IFN-β) via interchromosomal interactions (22Apostolou E. Thanos D. Cell. 2008; 134: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, we do not know whether NF-κB binds selectively only to these three Alu repeats of thousands existing in the human genome; nor do we know the fraction of the activated NF-κB molecules bound to the Alu repeats. These early observations raised additional questions regarding the property of NF-κB and possibly of other transcription factors to bind repetitive DNA sequences under physiological conditions. Repetitive DNA represents a major component of non-coding sequences in higher eukaryotes and comprises ∼60% of the human genome (23Cordaux R. Batzer M.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 24Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 25Kunarso G.

BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Alu repeats are part of the short interspersed nuclear elements with an average size of 300 bp and exist in ∼1,500,000 copies in the cell. Several previous studies have implicated short interspersed nuclear elements in regulation of gene expression (22Apostolou E. Thanos D. Cell. 2008; 134: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Mol. Genet.

How do transcription factors select specific sites for DNA binding among the many similar ones in the genome, especially the ones occurring on repetitive DNA elements? Do transcription factors, like NF-κB, bind preferentially to the higher affinity consensus sites compared with the larger number of lower affinity sites? What is the role of the chromatin state in making accessible transcription factor binding sites throughout the genome? Does binding of transcription factors in remote sites cause local chromatin remodeling and/or recruitment of the basal transcription machinery? Does activation of a transcription factor like NF-κB by different signals induce selective binding to some sites, or is site selection signal-independent? Are all occupied sites by NF-κB capable of supporting transcriptional activation? Put simply, is NF-κB binding restricted to only the sites that control gene expression? If not, what is the functional significance of the other sites? These are obvious questions given the relatively small number of NF-κB-regulated genes (∼500) and the huge number of putative κB sites in the human genome (∼2 × 106). In this study, we have addressed many of the above questions using the NF-κB family of transcription factors as a model system to understand basic regulatory principles of transcription factor-dependent gene expression networks. It has been previously hypothesized that specificity in NF-κB-mediated transcriptional response can, in part, be provided through the combinatorial effects of the five different Rel members that are selectively regulated by IκB proteins and activated by distinct signals in different cell types (reviewed in Ref. 7Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and by the promoter context of the κB sites (27Leung T.H. Hoffmann A. Baltimore D.

Here, we identified a novel NF-κB-binding site residing in specialized Alu-repetitive elements that have the potential for long range transcription regulation, thus suggesting that in addition to its known role, NF-κB has a primate-specific function and a role in human evolution. We found that ∼11% of the total NF-κB binding events in human cells occur at the Alu-κB site. By combining these data with global gene expression profiling of virus-infected cells, we found that most of the sites bound by NF-κB in the human genome, including the Alu-κB sites, do not obviously correlate with changes in gene expression of the nearby genes. These results demonstrate that repetitive elements interspersed in the human genome are common target sites for transcription factors and may play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites to engage new genes into regulatory networks. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, transfected using the calcium phosphate method, and infected with Sendai virus as described previously (29Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). IB4 cells are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B cells, and they were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. For the Western blot of Fig. 7B, HeLa cells were transfected on 6-well plates, harvested in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and probed with the antibodies p65 (sc-109) and β-actin (sc-130301) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The thymidine kinase-luciferase constructs were generated by subcloning the genomic fragments from the p65 library. The plasmids (pCRII-TOPO vector) were digested with SacI/XhoI and cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter driving the expression of the luciferase reporter gene (30Lomvardas S. Thanos D.

The −40IFN-βluc constructs were generated by subcloning tandem repeats of oligonucleotides bearing the Alu-κB-binding site (one, two, or four copies) taken from the p65 library clones and placed upstream of the IFN-β core promoter driving the expression of the luciferase reporter gene (29Thanos D.

Chromatin preparation and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (31Agelopoulos M. Thanos D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

The following histone-specific antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology: H4ac (06-866) and H3ac (06-599). The primers and oligonucleotides used in this study are indicated in supplemental Fig. 6. To construct the p65 ChIP library, we immunoprecipitated chromatin prepared from HeLa cells infected with Sendai virus for 6 h, and the purified DNA fragments were processed with the tagged random PCR method, as described previously (32White R.B. Ziman M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Following transformation, we picked 450 clones and obtained sequence from 366 clones. Supplemental Fig. 1 shows the sequence of each clone along with its genomic location and the sequence of the putative κB site. The sequence from the 366 clones were analyzed by BLAST to locate the genomic position and by TRANSFAC to identify putative NF-κB-binding sites. The library containing the p52-binding sites was prepared by immunoprecipitated chromatin from IB4 cells with the p52 antibody, and the purified DNA fragments were treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (New England Biolabs) to add poly(A) tails to the 3′ ends. The isolated DNA fragments were enriched by PCR using oligo(dT) primers containing BamHI flanking overhangs. This DNA mix was subsequently digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pBlueScriptII vector. Recombinant NF-κB (p50/p65 heterodimer) was expressed and purified as described previously (33Koutroubas G. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, EMSAs and in vitro transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (33Koutroubas G. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total RNA was harvested from 7 × 106 mock- or virus-infected cells by TRIzol extraction in biological triplicates. Total RNA was labeled according to the Affymetrix protocols and used to hybridize Affymetrix HG133plus2.0 microarray chips. The data were analyzed initially by using Affymetrix Microarray Suite. The RMA algorithm (34Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6389) Google Scholar) was used for normalization of the data. Median chip normalization and log 2 transformation of the data were performed. Permutation tests (35Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9747) Google Scholar) and significant analysis of microarray (false discovery rate <5%) were performed. Annotation of the probe sets was performed with the DAVID Bioinformatics Database (36Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the statistical analysis of the microarrays, 1,262 genes were considered up-regulated at either 6 or 12 h after Sendai virus infection. More than 400 genes were annotated to be regulated by NF-κB from the Boston University NF-κB Transcription Factors Web site. χ2 tests were performed in order to check the correlation between the previously known NF-κB target genes and the 36 novel gene targets with the magnitude of activated gene expression in response to virus infection in HeLa cells. Genes were categorized into four categories according to their -fold change 12 h after virus infection. Levels of gene expression were categorized as follows: 1) low expression (-fold change < 2); 2) medium expression (2 -fold change < 4); 3) high expression (4 -fold change < 8); 4) very high expression (-fold change 8). The file containing the NF-κB (p65) significant ChIP-seq peaks obtained from ChIP-seq experiments using GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells after TNF-α treatment was downloaded from ENCODE (freely available from the University of California Santa Cruz Web site as a BED file describing the coordinates and the intensity of the peaks in hg18). The data were processed using the CEAS (Cis-regulatory Element Annotation System) software (available on the World Wide Web) to identify the genome-wide distribution of NF-κB (p65). Peaks overlapping with Alu repeats were determined by intersecting the intervals of NF-κB(p65) or the intervals of an INPUT-seq from HeLa cells 4A. Antonaki, C. Demetriades, A. Polyzos, A. Banos, G. Vatsellas, M. D. Lavigne, E. Apostolou, E. Mantouvalou, D. Papadopoulou, G. Mosialos, and D. Thanos, unpublished data. with each of the Alu repeat intervals as obtained from RepeatMasker version 3.2.7 (available on the World Wide Web). Overlapping intervals were counted, and their total number was normalized by the size of their coverage. In order to compare percentages or proportions between the ChIP-seq data or the ChIP-cloning data and the INPUT-seq data, the binomial distribution was used with a null hypothesis for difference of proportions equal to 0.0 and α = 0.05. p values of less than 1% were considered statistically significant (p < 0.01). We recovered the sequences corresponding to the peaks of the ChIP-seq data and submitted them to de novo motif identification using the Seqpos motif tool that can find motifs enriched in a set of regions and align them to the known motif published in JASPAR and TRANSFAC (available on the Harvard Galaxy/Cistrome Web site). To investigate the localization of NF-κB into the human genome following virus infection, we applied a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based cloning technique to isolate genomic DNA sequences bound by NF-κB dimers using specific antibodies against the p65 (RELA) subunit. The ChIP-PCR-cloning procedure was optimized to avoid nonspecific interactions and bias in DNA cloning as verified by IgG control immunoprecipitation experiments and by applying limited PCR amplification to limit background (see “Experimental Procedures”). HeLa cells were mock- or virus-infected with Sendai virus for 6 h, followed by chromatin preparation and immunoprecipitation with the anti-p65 antibody (31Agelopoulos M. Thanos D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The precipitated DNA was processed as described previously (32White R.B. Ziman M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Four hundred fifty colonies were randomly picked, and the inserts were sequenced, producing 366 DNA sequences that were characterized in detail. The lengths of the cloned DNA fragments ranged from 100 to 850 bp, averaging about 430 bp (data not shown). We searched the human genomic data base by BLAST to determine the location of the p65-bound DNA fragments in relation to known or predicted genes (supplemental Fig. 1). Fig. 1A shows the distribution of the identified NF-κB-binding sites relative to the closest transcription start site of nearby genes. Interestingly, the larger percentage of NF-κB-binding sites (49.5%) was found in regions located more than 10 kb away from known or predicted regulatory enhancer/promoter regions (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, ∼34% of NF-κB-binding sites were identified in introns, whereas smaller percentages ranging from 1.5 to 9% corresponded to κB sites located in exons, 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, and 5′-proximal regions (less than 10 kb upstream from known genes). Notably, in ∼38% of the cloned NF-κB-bound fragments, a consensus or a putative NF-κB-binding site could not be identified (Fig. 1B). Overall, these findings are consistent with several previous reports in which transcription factor-bound DNA sites were mapped into mammalian genomes using ChIP-cloning, ChIP-PET, and ChIP-seq techniques (reviewed in Ref. 16Farnham P.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with previous studies reporting binding of NF-κB into the human genome in response to LPS activation of macrophages or monocytes (10Lim C.A. Yao F. Wong J.J. George J.

Furthermore, these data may also reflect the property of NF-κB to control transcription primarily through distal enhancers or simply indicate that promoter elements are not well defined on a genome-wide basis or that the majority of the NF-κB-bound sites in vivo do not correlate with gene expression of the nearby genes (see below). We examined our data set to determine whether the NF-κB consensus motif, 5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′, is enriched in the isolated p65-bound genomic sequences. Fig. 1B shows that only 6.5% of the identified κB sites fit to the NF-κB consensus, whereas 38% of the bound DNA fragments lack a recognizable NF-κB site (i.e. they bear more than three mismatches from the consensus κB site). We scanned the DNA sequence of the 366 clones for κB-binding sites, and this search revealed an enrichment of the sequence 5′-GGGR(T/A)TYY(C/A)Y-3′ (Fig. 1D). This sequence is similar to the current NF-κB consensus motif (5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′) differing at only one nucleotide (underlined), an observation that underscores the robustness of our ChIP-cloning approach to identify in an unbiased manner genome-wide binding sites for NF-κB proteins. Of note, we discovered the frequent presence of a T instead of N at position 6 of the consensus (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, we discovered that 11% of our κB sites contained the specific GGGTTTCACC κB sequence (Fig. 1B) that deviates from the consensus at two nucleotides (underlined), thus increasing the total percentage of sequences bearing two mismatches to 35% (24 + 11%). The GGGTTTCACC DNA site (named the Alu-κB site from this point onwards) is present in specialized Alu-repetitive elements (38Häsler J. Samuelsson T. Strub K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Jurka J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We did not identify Alu-κB sites outside of Alu repeats. Thus, the Alu-κB site is not just another NF-κB DNA-binding site but the most frequent human DNA site on which NF-κB binds in vivo. None of the previous studies identified the Alu-κB site, probably because of the inherent bias of the methods used (10Lim C.A. Yao F. Wong J.J. George J. Xu H. Chiu K.P. Sung W.K. Lipovich L.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified three Alu-κB sites implicated in the NF-κB-dependent virus-induced expression of the human IFN-β gene via interchromosomal interactions with the IFN-β locus (22Apostolou E. Thanos D. Cell. 2008; 134: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the GGGTTTCACC κB site occurs 170,755 times in the human genome, whereas only 1,425 copies exist in the mouse genome, a result consistent with the absence of Alu-repetitive elements in mice (Fig. 1C). The Alu-κB site is present in the AluSx, AluSg, and AluY elements and not in the other types of Alu repeats, such as AluSq, AluJo, and AluJb (Fig. 2A). To verify in vivo binding of NF-κB to some of the κB site-containing specific Alu repeats (AluSx, AluSg, and AluY), we carried out ChIP experiments using anti-p65-immunoprecipitated chromatin prepared from mock- and Sendai virus-infected HeLa cells and PCR primers flanking each one of the Alu-repetitive elements. Fig. 2B (lanes 1 and 2) shows that indeed NF-κB associates only with those Alu elements that bear the GGGTTTCACC site (AluSx, AluSg, and AluY) and not with AluSq, AluJo, and AluJb repeats lacking the Alu-κB site. Fig. 1C shows the distribution of the GGGTTTCACC Alu-κB element in the human chromosomes in parallel with the distribution of the GGGTATCACC sequence bearing a single base substitution (underlined), used as a control in the bioinformatics analysis. We found that the frequency of the GGGTTTCACC element follows the distribution of the Alu repeats into the human genome, and it depends on the size of chromosomes, thus implying no preference for specific chromosomes (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, this comparison verified the presence of the GGGTTTCACC motif in repetitive elements and that the mutant control sequence occurs in the human genome at the expected abundance for any random 10-mer (2,634 times versus the theoretically expected 3,000 times for the 3 × 109-bp human genome). Finally, the distribution of the Alu-κB-containing loci in the genome relative to known genes revealed no preference for specific genomic positions, thus correlating with the overall distribution of Alu elements (Fig. 2C). The Alu-κB site was also highly represented among the DNA fragments that wer"
https://openalex.org/W2074836283,"Age at onset of Huntington's disease (HD) is largely determined by the CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the HTT gene. Importantly, the CAG repeat undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, prevalent in brain regions that are disease targets, suggesting a potential role for somatic CAG repeat instability in modifying HD pathogenesis. Thus, understanding underlying mechanisms of somatic CAG repeat instability may lead to discoveries of novel therapeutics for HD. Investigation of the dynamics of the CAG repeat size changes over time may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying CAG repeat instability.To understand how the HTT CAG repeat length changes over time, we quantified somatic instability of the CAG repeat in Huntington's disease CAG knock-in mice from 2-16 months of age in liver, striatum, spleen and tail. The HTT CAG repeat in spleen and tail was very stable, but that in liver and striatum expanded over time at an average rate of one CAG per month. Interestingly, the patterns of repeat instability were different between liver and striatum. Unstable CAG repeats in liver repeatedly gained similar sizes of additional CAG repeats (approximately two CAGs per month), maintaining a distinct population of unstable repeats. In contrast, unstable CAG repeats in striatum gained additional repeats with different sizes resulting in broadly distributed unstable CAG repeats. Expanded CAG repeats in the liver were highly enriched in polyploid hepatocytes, suggesting that the pattern of liver instability may reflect the restriction of the unstable repeats to a unique cell type.Our results are consistent with repeat expansion occurring as a consequence of recurrent small repeat insertions that differ in different tissues. Investigation of the specific mechanisms that underlie liver and striatal instability will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between instability and disease and the means to intervene in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1999583938,"Platelet-decorated von Willebrand factor (VWF) strings anchored to the endothelial surface are rapidly cleaved by ADAMTS13. Individual VWF string characteristics such as number, location, and auxiliary features of the ADAMTS13 cleavage sites were explored here using imaging and computing software. By following changes in VWF string length, we demonstrated that VWF strings are cleaved multiple times, successively shortening string length in the function of time and generating fragments ranging in size from 5 to over 100 μm. These are larger than generally observed in normal plasma, indicating that further proteolysis takes place in circulation. Interestingly, in 89% of all cleavage events, VWF strings elongate precisely at the cleavage site before ADAMTS13 proteolysis. These local elongations are a general characteristic of VWF strings, independent of the presence of ADAMTS13. Furthermore, large elongations, ranging in size from 1.4 to 40 μm, occur at different sites in space and time. In conclusion, ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis of VWF strings under flow is preceded by large elongations of the string at the cleavage site. These elongations may lead to the simultaneous exposure of many exosites, thereby facilitating ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2024341581,"Discovery of mechanisms that impede the aggressive and metastatic phenotype of human basal triple-negative-type breast cancers (BTNBCs) could provide novel targets for therapy for this form of breast cancer that has a relatively poor prognosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of GATA3, the master transcriptional regulator of mammary luminal differentiation, can reduce the tumorigenicity and metastatic propensity of the human BTNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line (MB231), although the mechanism for reduced metastases was not elucidated. We demonstrate through gene expression profiling that GATA3 expression in 231 cells resulted in the dramatic reduction in the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a metastasis-promoting, matrix-remodeling protein, in part, through methylation of the LOX promoter. Suppression of LOX expression by GATA3 was further confirmed in the BTNBC Hs578T cell line. Conversely, reduction of GATA3 expression by small interfering RNA in luminal BT474 cells increased LOX expression. Reconstitution of LOX expression in 231-GATA3 cells restored metastatic propensity. A strong inverse association between LOX and GATA3 expression was confirmed in a panel of 51 human breast cancer cell lines. Similarly, human breast cancer microarray data demonstrated that high LOX/low GATA3 expression is associated with the BTNBC subtype of breast cancer and poor patient prognosis. Expression of GATA3 reprograms BTNBCs to a less aggressive phenotype and inhibits a major mechanism of metastasis through inhibition of LOX. Induction of GATA3 in BTNBC cells or novel approaches that inhibit LOX expression or activity could be important strategies for treating BTNBCs."

In this study, we aim to identify potential novel molecular targets that contribute to the multigenic trait “anxiety”. We used microarrays to investigate the gene expression profiles of different brain regions within the limbic system of mice which were selectively bred for either high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior, and also show signs of comorbid depression-like behavior. We identified and confirmed sex-independent differences in the basal expression of 13 candidate genes, using tissue from the entire brain, including coronin 7 (Coro7), cathepsin B (Ctsb), muscleblind-like 1 (Mbnl1), metallothionein 1 (Mt1), solute carrier family 25 member 17 (Slc25a17), tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), zinc finger protein 672 (Zfp672), syntaxin 3 (Stx3), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 2 (Abca2), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5 (Enpp5), high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 (Hmgn3) and pyruvate dehydrogenase beta (Pdhb). Additionally, we confirmed brain region-specific differences in the expression of synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4). Our identification of about 90 polymorphisms in Ctsb suggested that this gene might play a critical role in shaping our mouse model's behavioral endophenotypes. Indeed, the assessment of anxiety-related and depression-like behaviors of Ctsb knock-out mice revealed an increase in depression-like behavior in females. Altogether, our results suggest that Ctsb has significant effects on emotionality, irrespective of the tested mouse strain, making it a promising target for future pharmacotherapy."

The pace and nature of this change is largely unstudied, especially for the most diverse elements of terrestrial communities--the arthropods--here we have only limited knowledge concerning the taxonomy and the ecology of these groups. Because Arctic ecosystems have already experienced significant increases in temperature over the past half century, shifts in community structure may already be in progress. Here we utilise collections of a particularly hyperdiverse insect group--parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera; Braconidae; Microgastrinae)--at Churchill, Manitoba, Canada in the early and mid-twentieth century to compare the composition of the contemporary community to that present 50-70 years ago. Morphological and DNA barcoding results revealed the presence of 79 species of microgastrine wasps in collections from Churchill, but we estimate that 20% of the local fauna awaits detection. Species composition and diversity between the two time periods differ significantly; species that were most common in historic collections were not found in contemporary collections and vice versa. Using barcodes we compared these collections to others from across North America; contemporary Churchill species are most affiliated with more south-western collections, while historic collections were more affiliated with eastern collections. The past five decades has clearly seen a dramatic change of species composition within the area studied coincident with rising temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1981125688,"Background Betacellulin (BTC), a member of the epidermal growth factor family, is known to play an important role in regulating growth and differentiation of pancreatic beta cells. Growth-promoting actions of BTC are mediated by epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbBs), namely ErbB-1, ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4; however, the exact mechanism for beta cell proliferation has not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated which ErbBs are involved and some molecular mechanisms by which BTC regulates beta cell proliferation. Methodology/Principal Findings The expression of ErbB-1, ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in both a beta cell line (MIN-6 cells) and C57BL/6 mouse islets. Immunoprecipitation and western blotting analysis showed that BTC treatment of MIN-6 cells induced phosphorylation of only ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 among the four EGF receptors. BTC treatment resulted in DNA synthetic activity, cell cycle progression, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive staining. The proliferative effect was blocked by treatment with AG1478 or AG825, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors of ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, respectively. BTC treatment increased mRNA and protein levels of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), and this was blocked by the ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 inhibitors. Inhibition of IRS-2 by siRNA blocked cell cycle progression induced by BTC treatment. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice injected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing BTC and treated with AG1478 or AG825 showed reduced islet size, reduced numbers of BrdU-positive cells in the islets, and did not attain BTC-mediated remission of diabetes. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that BTC exerts proliferative activity on beta cells through the activation of ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 receptors, which may increase IRS-2 expression, contributing to the regeneration of beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967746621,"Background Infection incidence increases with the average number of contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. Contact rates are normally assumed to increase linearly with host density. However, social species seek out each other at low density and saturate their contact rates at high densities. Although predicting epidemic behaviour requires knowing how contact rates scale with host density, few empirical studies have investigated the effect of host density. Also, most theory assumes each host has an equal probability of transmitting parasites, even though individual parasite load and infection duration can vary. To our knowledge, the relative importance of characteristics of the primary infected host vs. the susceptible population has never been tested experimentally. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we examine epidemics using a common ectoparasite, Gyrodactylus turnbulli infecting its guppy host (Poecilia reticulata). Hosts were maintained at different densities (3, 6, 12 and 24 fish in 40 L aquaria), and we monitored gyrodactylids both at a population and individual host level. Although parasite population size increased with host density, the probability of an epidemic did not. Epidemics were more likely when the primary infected fish had a high mean intensity and duration of infection. Epidemics only occurred if the primary infected host experienced more than 23 worm days. Female guppies contracted infections sooner than males, probably because females have a higher propensity for shoaling. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that in social hosts like guppies, the frequency of social contact largely governs disease epidemics independent of host density."
https://openalex.org/W2075967346,"Cell migration is essential for several important biological outcomes and is involved in various developmental disorders and disease states including cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. A fundamental step in cell migration is the development of a leading edge. By using HeLa carcinoma cells as an initial model system, we uncovered a surprising role for the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and its ability to bind the protein cross-linking enzyme, tissue transglutaminase (tTG), in cancer cell migration. Treatment of HeLa cells with EGF results in the activation of a plasma membrane-associated pool of tTG and its redistribution to the leading edges of these cells, which are essential events for EGF-stimulated HeLa cell migration. However, we then found that the ability of tTG to be localized to the leading edge is dependent on Hsp70. Similarly, the localization of tTG to the leading edges of MDAMB231 breast carcinoma cells, where it also plays an essential role in their migration, has a strict requirement for Hsp70. Treatment of these different cell lines with inhibitors against the ATP hydrolytic activity of Hsp70 prevented tTG from localizing to their leading edges and thereby blocked EGF-stimulated HeLa cell migration, as well as the constitutive migration normally exhibited by MDAMB231 cells. These findings highlight a new and unconventional role for the chaperonin activity of Hsp70 in the localization of a key regulatory protein (tTG) at the leading edges of cancer cells and the important consequences that this holds for their ability to migrate."

https://openalex.org/W2021112876,"B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) is crucial for the activation of NF-κB in numerous immune receptor signaling pathways, including the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to signal transduction from BCL10 to downstream NF-κB effector kinases, such as TAK1 and components of the IKK complex, are not entirely understood. Here we used a proteomic approach and identified the E3 ligase MIB2 as a novel component of the activated BCL10 complex. In vitro translation and pulldown assays suggest direct interaction between BCL10 and MIB2. Overexpression experiments show that MIB2 controls BCL10-mediated activation of NF-κB by promoting autoubiquitination and ubiquitination of IKKγ/NEMO, as well as recruitment and activation of TAK1. Knockdown of MIB2 inhibited BCL10-dependent NF-κB activation. Together, our results identify MIB2 as a novel component of the activated BCL10 signaling complex and a missing link in the BCL10-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1985706655,"Background Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with histology, is widely used to diagnose and to monitor treatment in oncology. Spatial correspondence between these modalities provides information about the ability of MRI to characterize cancerous tissue. However, registration is complicated by deformations during pathological processing, and differences in scale and information content. Methodology/Principal Findings This study proposes a methodology for establishing an accurate 3D relation between histological sections and high resolution in vivo MRI tumor data. The key features of the methodology are: 1) standardized acquisition and processing, 2) use of an intermediate ex vivo MRI, 3) use of a reference cutting plane, 4) dense histological sampling, 5) elastic registration, and 6) use of complete 3D data sets. Five rat pancreatic tumors imaged by T2*-w MRI were used to evaluate the proposed methodology. The registration accuracy was assessed by root mean squared (RMS) distances between manually annotated landmark points in both modalities. After elastic registration the average RMS distance decreased from 1.4 to 0.7 mm. The intermediate ex vivo MRI and the reference cutting plane shared by all three 3D images (in vivo MRI, ex vivo MRI, and 3D histology data) were found to be crucial for the accurate co-registration between the 3D histological data set and in vivo MRI. The MR intensity in necrotic regions, as manually annotated in 3D histology, was significantly different from other histologically confirmed regions (i.e., viable and hemorrhagic). However, the viable and the hemorrhagic regions showed a large overlap in T2*-w MRI signal intensity. Conclusions The established 3D correspondence between tumor histology and in vivo MRI enables extraction of MRI characteristics for histologically confirmed regions. The proposed methodology allows the creation of a tumor database of spatially registered multi-spectral MR images and multi-stained 3D histology."

The enzyme kinetics for hydrolysis of three fluorogenic triple-helical peptides (fTHPs) was evaluated herein. The first fTHP contained consensus residues 769–783 from type I–III collagens, the second inserted α1(II) collagen residues 763–768 N-terminal to the consensus sequence, and the third inserted α1(II) collagen residues 784–792 C-terminal to the consensus sequence. Our analyses showed that insertion of the C-terminal residues significantly increased kcat/Km and kcat for MMP-1. MMP-13 showed the opposite behavior with a decreased kcat/Km and kcat and a greatly improved Km in response to the C-terminal residues. Insertion of the N-terminal residues enhanced kcat/Km and kcat for MMP-8 and MT1-MMP. For MMP-2, the C-terminal residues enhanced Km and dramatically decreased kcat, resulting in a decrease in the overall activity. These changes in activities and kinetic parameters represented the collagen preferences of MMP-8, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP well. Thus, interactions with secondary binding sites (exosites) helped direct the specificity of these enzymes. However, MMP-1 collagen preferences were not recapitulated by the fTHP studies. The preference of MMP-1 for type III collagen appears to be primarily based on the flexibility of the hydrolysis site of type III collagen compared with types I and II. Further characterization of exosite determinants that govern interactions of MMPs with collagenous substrates should aid the development of pharmacotherapeutics that target individual MMPs.

They incorporate di- and tripeptides from the environment as carbon and energy sources. In the present study we cloned a novel dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) gene of P. endodontalis ATCC 35406, designated as DPP11. The DPP11 gene encoded 717 amino acids with a molecular mass of 81,090 Da and was present as a 75-kDa form with an N terminus of Asp22. A homology search revealed the presence of a P. gingivalis orthologue, PGN0607, that has been categorized as an isoform of authentic DPP7. P. gingivalis DPP11 was exclusively cell-associated as a truncated 60-kDa form, and the gene ablation retarded cell growth. DPP11 specifically removed dipeptides from oligopeptides with the penultimate N-terminal Asp and Glu and has a P2-position preference to hydrophobic residues. Optimum pH was 7.0, and the kcat/Km value was higher for Asp than Glu. Those activities were lost by substitution of Ser652 in P. endodontalis and Ser655 in P. gingivalis DPP11 to Ala, and they were consistently decreased with increasing NaCl concentration. Arg670 is a unique amino acid completely conserved in all DPP11 members distributed in the genera Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides, whereas this residue is converted to Gly in all authentic DPP7 members. Substitution analysis suggested that Arg670 interacts with an acidic residue of the substrate. Considered to preferentially utilize acidic amino acids, DPP11 ensures efficient degradation of oligopeptide substrates in these Gram-negative anaerobic rods.

An important relative of the bacterium is Porphyromonas endodontalis, which is predominantly isolated from periapical periodontitis sites, i.e. infected root canals with acute symptoms such as pain, swelling, and drainage (9van Steenbergen T.J.M. de Graaff J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1986; 33: 219-222Google Scholar, 10van Winkelhoff A.J. Kippuw N. de Graaff J. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 11Sundqvist G.

P. gingivalis possesses extracellular arginine aminopeptidase activity, which is mediated by Arg-gingipains (Rgps) 3The abbreviations used are: RgpArg-gingipainsRgpArg-specific gingipainKgpLys-specific gingipainDPPdipeptidyl peptidasePeDPP and PgDPPDPP from P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis, respectivelyPTP-Aprolyl tripeptidyl peptidase AGluV8glutamyl endopeptidase from S. aureusZ-benzyloxycarbonyl-MCA4-methylcoumaryl-7-amidesucsuccinylABCManaerobic bacteria culture media. isoforms A and B of Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase (X is any amino acid), whereas other aminopeptidase activities are not present (13Suido H.

Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 16: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Lys-specific gingipain (Kgp), another potent cysteine proteinase, does not exhibit aminopeptidase activity (15Curtis M.A. Kuramitsu H.K. Lantz M. Macrina F.L. Nakayama K. Potempa J. Reynolds E.C. Aduse-Opoku J. J. Periodontal Res. 1999; 34: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In accord with the lack of predominant aminopeptidase activities, it has been demonstrated that P. gingivalis mainly incorporates nutritional amino acids as forms of di- and tripeptides, not as single amino acids, and produces metabolic end products such as ammonia, acetate, propionate, and butyrate (16Takahashi N. Sato T. Yamada T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4704-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Takahashi N. Sato T. J. Dent.

Accordingly, the cell-surface and extracellular peptidases of P. gingivalis that produce di- and tri-peptides are considered to play critical roles in cell growth as well as its pathogenicity.

First, the predominant proteolytic activities of Kgp and Rgps (22Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Nakamura T. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 7: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Chen Z.

Subsequently, oligopeptides are processed by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5, DPPIV) (26Banbula A. Bugno M. Goldstein J. Yen J. Nelson D. Travis J. Potempa J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), DPP7 (27Banbula A. Yen J. Oleksy A. Mak P. Bugno M. Travis J. Potempa J. J. Biol.

P. gingivalis DPPIV preferentially cleaves NH2-XP↓Xn and less potently NH2-XA↓Xn (26Banbula A. Bugno M. Goldstein J. Yen J. Nelson D. Travis J. Potempa J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Kiyama M. Hayakawa M. Shiroza T. Nakamura S. Takeuchi A. Masamoto Y. Abiko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DPP7 (PgDPP7) cleaves NH2-XY↓Xn, where Y is an aliphatic or aromatic amino acid (27Banbula A. Yen J. Oleksy A. Mak P. Bugno M. Travis J. Potempa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6299-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When Pro is located at the third position from the N terminus, neither DPPIV nor DPP7 cleaves the peptides, and instead, PTP-A cleaves an NH2-XXP↓Xn bond (29Ito K. Nakajima Y. Xu Y. Yamada N. Onohara Y. Ito T. Matsubara F. Kabashima T. Nakayama K. Yoshimoto T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Krieger T.J. Bartfeld D. Jenish D.L. Hadary D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the integrated actions of DPPIV, DPP7, and PTP-A may be responsible for utilization of peptides from scarce resources in the oral cavity. On the other hand, although the growth of a DPPIV-, DPP7-, and PTP-A-triple knock-out P. gingivalis strain was demonstrated to be retarded, the mutant showed growth (32Oda H. Saiki K. Tonosaki M. Yajima A. Konishi K. J. Periodontal Res. 2009; 44: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which may indicate the presence of a complementary mechanism for supplying substances for the metabolic pathway. Moreover, Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln are the most intensively consumed nutritional amino acids in Tryptone-based medium (16Takahashi N. Sato T. Yamada T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4704-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the existence of P. gingivalis DPP that hydrolyzes Asp and Glu at the P1 position is reasonably surmised. In the case of P. endodontalis, which does not have the proteolytic activity equivalent to gingipains (10van Winkelhoff A.J. Kippuw N. de Graaff J. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Kon A. Dent. J. Iwate Med. Univ. 2002; 27 (in Japanese): 187-196Google Scholar), the mechanism on oligopeptide metabolism is further obscure. In the present study, we started from the analysis of a DPP activity of P. endodontalis, an important pathogenic organism in periapical lesions, because substantial DPP activities were observed in the extracellular fraction obtained from a dialysis membrane culture on an agar plate, whereas DPPs seemed completely cell-associated in P. gingivalis. In addition, because P. endodontalis does not have marked gingipain-like activities, this microorganism has a great advantage over P. gingivalis in handling of the activities without care about degradation or modification by gingipain-like proteinases (33Kon A. Dent. J. Iwate Med. Univ. 2002; 27 (in Japanese): 187-196Google Scholar). We isolated a gene of P. endodontalis using a PCR method with degenerated primers designed based on the sequence homology of DPP7-family genes and subsequently found the existence of its P. gingivalis orthologue, PGN0607, in a homology search that had already been proposed as an isoform of DPP7 (27Banbula A. Yen J. Oleksy A. Mak P. Bugno M. Travis J. Potempa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6299-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins of the cloned gene and PGN0607 expressed in Escherichia coli did not show DPP7-like activity, indicating their identity distinct from DPP7. Because I-VI and 6–10 have been already allocated to DPPs with various specificities and their subtypes, we designated this novel DPP as DPP11. The enzymatic and biochemical analyses on of DPP11 from P. endodontalis (PeDPP11) and P. gingivalis (PgDPP11) revealed that they possessed the activity to hydrolyze NH2-X(D/E)↓Xn. We also found Arg670 that is critical for the substrate specificity of DPP11. Furthermore, a MEROPS data base (34Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D227-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) search indicated that DPP11 orthologues are widely distributed in anaerobic Gram-negative species in the genera Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides. The expression and cloning vectors used were pTrcHisTOPO from Invitrogen, pQE60 from Qiagen, and pGEM-Teasy from Promega. DEAE-Sephacel, Sephacryl S200HR, CNBr-Sepharose, low molecular weight molecular markers, and rainbow markers were obtained from GE Healthcare. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes came from TAKARA BIO and New England Biolabs, respectively, whereas KOD Plus DNA polymerase came from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). MCA peptides and neuromedin B were obtained from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Variants of neuromedin B with an amino acid substitution to Asp at the first, second, third, or fifth position were synthesized by BEX (Tokyo, Japan), and LD-, LE-, acetyl (ac)-LD-, and benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-LLQ-MCA were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Ulm, Germany) and TORAY (Tokyo, Japan). A Genome Walker Universal kit and Talon metal affinity resin came from Clontech Laboratories. Thermolysin from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus rokko and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Sigma, and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and ZipTipμ-C18 came from Millipore. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was purchased from Applied Biosystems, oligonucleotide primers came from FASMAC (Atsugi, Japan), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig(G+A+M) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Recombinant Glu-specific endopeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus V8 strain (GluV8) was expressed using a method reported previously (35Nemoto T.K. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ono T. Kobayakawa T. Shimoyama Y. Kimura S. Takagi T. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 573-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. They were cultured in anaerobic bacteria culture media (ABCM) (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) in the presence of 1 μg/ml menadione (Sigma) at 35 °C under anaerobic conditions (90% N2, 5% H2, 5% CO2). To separate the cellular and soluble extracellular fractions, bacterial cells grown to the early stationary phase were inoculated onto ABCM agar plates covered with a sterilized dialysis membrane (cutoff, 6 kDa) and further cultured for 2 days. The cells were then suspended with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was filtered with a 0.45-μm membrane and used as the extracellular fraction. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of PBS and used as the cellular fraction. CDC anaerobe blood agar plates (Nippon Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) were used to examine black pigmentation. E. coli XL-1 Blue was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth and on agar plates supplemented with 75 μg/ml ampicillin. Genomic DNA from P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis (0.1 μg) was prepared as described previously (36Ikeda Y. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kimura S. Ishibashi K. Kikuchi K. Can. J. Microbiol. 2004; 50: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and used as templates. Degenerate 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotide primers (DPP7deg244–276 and DPP7deg676–643) (supplemental Table S1) were synthesized in consideration of the homology of DPP7-related peptidases from P. gingivalis (PG0491/Q7MWU6 and PG1283/BAG33126), Xyella fastidiosa (ZP00652070), and Shewanella putrefaciens (YP001182286 and YP001182445) (27Banbula A. Yen J. Oleksy A. Mak P. Bugno M. Travis J. Potempa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6299-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Degenerate PCR was performed with 7 cycles at 94 °C for 3 s and 72 °C for 3 min then 25 cycles at 94 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 3 min using a Genome Walker Universal kit. The resultant 448-bp DNA fragment was amplified, inserted into a pGEM-T Easy vector, and sequenced. Genomic DNA of P. endodontalis (2 μg) was digested with DraI, EcoRV, PvuII, or StuI, then ligated with an adaptor nucleotide, and the obtained DNA fragments were used as a template for genome walking. PCR was performed using one of the gene specific primers (8Fcomo127–102 and 8Fcomp326–350, Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1) in combination with the adaptor primer (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), resulting in amplification of 1- and 2-kbp DNA fragments from DraI- and EcoRV-digested genome DNA, respectively. Consequently, a 2303-bp nucleotide containing an open reading frame composed of 2154 bp was identified. The gene was designated as P. endodontalis DPP11 (PeDPP11, registered as AB610284 in DNA Data Bank of Japan). Because the N terminus of the soluble form of PeDPP11 was Asp22 (see Fig. 3), a DNA fragment encoding Asp22-Phe717 was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA and a set of primers (5PeDPP11D22Bgl, 3PeDPP11F717Bgl) containing BglII sites (supplemental Table S1), then the BglII-digested 2.2-kDa PCR fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pTrcHisTOPO (designated pTrcHis-PeDPP11). A DNA fragment encoding from Asp22 to the C-terminal Pro720 of PGN0607, the P. gingivalis gene (PgDPP11) most homologous to PeDPP11, was amplified by PCR with a set of primers (5PgDPP11D22Bam/3PgDPP11P720Bam, supplemental Table S1) and genomic DNA, then cloned into a BamHI site of pQE60 to generate pQE-PgDPP11. In vitro mutagenesis was performed using a PCR technique with primers to introduce an amino acid substitution (supplemental Table S1). The substitutions of S652A and S655A were introduced into plasmids encoding pTrcHis-PeDPP11 and pQE-PgDPP11, respectively, whereas substitution of Arg670 to Gly, Lys, His, Gln, or Asp was introduced to pTrcHis-PeDPP11. All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Recombinant PeDPP11 and PgDPP11 were expressed in E. coli by induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. Recombinant proteins were purified by Talon affinity chromatography as reported previously (35Nemoto T.K. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ono T. Kobayakawa T. Shimoyama Y. Kimura S. Takagi T. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 573-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For usage as antigens for developing antibodies, Talon affinity column-purified PeDPP11 and PgDPP11 were further separated by size-exclusion gel chromatography with a Sephacryl S200HR column (1 × 86 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). The peak fraction was lyophilized and used for immunization of rabbits. A DNA fragment encoding Asp22–Pro720 of PGN0607 was amplified with a primer set (5PgDPP11D22Bam and 3PgDPP11-P720Bam) and cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (pGEM-T Easy-PGN0607). An erythromycin-resistant gene fragment from Bacteroides fragilis was amplified by PCR from pUC19-Em with 5ErmF-AM-Cla and 3ErmF-AM-Cla primers (37Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J.

Electro-transformation of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 was carried out with SalI-linearlized pGEM-T Easy-PGN0607-Em, and PGN0607-disrupted strains were selected on ABCM agar supplemented with 1 μg/ml menadione and 10 μm erythromycin, according to a previously reported method (39Ueshima J.

Generally, various fractions of native DPP11 at 10 μl or 2 ng of recombinant DPP11 were used for measurement of proteolytic activity in 200 μl of reaction solution composed of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and containing 5 mm EDTA. The reaction was started with an addition of 20 μm MCA-peptides and continued at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm with a Fluorescence Photometer F-4000 (Hitachi). In some experiments, appropriate buffers (50 mm) from pH 4 to 10.5 or NaCl concentrations from 0 to 1.6 m were used. Dipeptidyl-MCA substrates not commercially available were prepared from tri- or tetrapeptidyl-MCA (0.4 mm) through digestion with 0.3 μg of GluV8 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm EDTA (100 μl) or 0.3 μg of thermolysin in 10 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0) and 2 mm CaSO4 containing 0.005% (v/v) Triton-X100 (100 μl) at 37 °C for 4 h (35Nemoto T.K.

The resultant protease-pretreated MCA peptides were used as substrates for DPP11 at 20 μm as described above. Chromatographic procedures were performed at 4 °C. Soluble extracellular fraction (100 ml) obtained from dialysis membrane cultures of P. endodontalis was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A) and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 19 cm) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After washing with Buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl in Buffer A (300 ml). Eighty-drop fractions (∼4 ml) were collected, then the proteolytic activities toward ac-DNLD-, KA-, and succinyl (suc)-AAA-MCA were determined as described above. Neuromedin B and its derivatives (1 nmol) were separately incubated with recombinant PeDPP11 (50 nm) or ion-exchange-fractionated fractions (10 μl) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (final 0.1%), then hydrolysates were adsorbed to ZipTipμ-C18, washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 50% of acetonitrile containing 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic under an isocratic condition. The molecular masses of the products were determined by mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems). Proteins were separated by PAGE in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) of SDS with a polyacrylamide concentration of 11% (w/v), then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-PeDPP11 or anti-PgDPP11 serum (104–106-fold dilutions), and the blots were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig(G+A+M) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega). For N-terminal sequencing, separated proteins were transferred to a Sequi-Blot membrane (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The N-terminal sequences of stained bands were determined with a model Procise 49XcLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (40Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ono T. Shimoyama Y. Kimura S. Nemoto T.K. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recombinant PeDPP11-coupled Sepharose was prepared using a CNBr-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A PeDPP11-specific antibody was purified from rabbit antiserum using PeDPP11-Sepharose affinity chromatography, then PeDPP11 antibody-conjugated Sepharose was prepared as above. For immunoadsorption assays, aliquots (100 μl) of DEAE-Sephacel-separated fractions were incubated with 15, 45, or 135 μl of PeDPP11-antibody resin (50% suspension). After rotation at 0 °C for 8 h, samples were centrifuged, and the activity remaining in the supernatant was determined. To determine the N-terminal sequence, fractions (3 ml) obtained by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography were immunoadsorbed to anti-PeDPP11 antibody resin (0.4 ml as 50% suspension), then the resin was washed with 1 ml of PBS 4 times. After centrifugation, materials bound to the resin were extracted with SDS-sample buffer (100 μl) at 94 °C for 10 min, and aliquots were separated on SDS-PAGE. We first attempted to purify DPP7-like activities from extracellular fraction of P. endodontalis, which exhibited higher activity than those of P. gingivalis (33Kon A. Dent. J. Iwate Med. Univ. 2002; 27 (in Japanese): 187-196Google Scholar); however, they were not purified to homogeneity, and thus their N-terminal sequences were not determined. Then gene cloning by degenerate PCR was undertaken with a set of primers (DPP7deg244–276 and DPP7deg676–643, supplemental Table S1) designed in consideration of the amino acid homology of DPP7s among P. gingivalis, X. fastidiosa, and S. putrefaciens. Using a combination of degenerate PCR and subsequent genome walking, we cloned a 2303-bp nucleotide sequence carrying a gene of 2154-bp ORF, which encoded a 717-amino acid protein with a deduced molecular mass of 81,090 Da (Fig. 1). This gene was designated as DPP11. The amino acid sequence identity of PeDPP11 to DPP7 from P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 (PGN1479) (21Naito M. Hirakawa H. Yamashita A. Ohara N. Shoji M. Yukitake H.

The arrangement of potential catalytic triad for the serine proteases His84, Asp197, and Ser652 in PeDPP11 was identical to that in PgDPP7 (Fig. 2), and the amino acid sequence at around Ser652 shared significant homology with the Glu-specific serine protease GluV8 (Fig. 2). However, the arrangement of the catalytic triad was distinct from that of P. gingivalis DPPIV (Ser593, Asp668, and His700). Interestingly, a BLAST search identified PGN0607 as having the highest homology (57.9%) to the PeDPP11 gene (Table 1) and the corresponding gene of P. gingivalis W83 (PG1283), which has only four amino acid substitutions with PGN0607 and has been annotated to be an isoform of authentic DPP7 in P. gingivalis, whereas its enzymatic property was not directly examined (27Banbula A.

High density lipoprotein (HDL) provides protection against atherosclerosis via several mechanisms from which promotion of reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery to the liver is perhaps physiologically the most important (1Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, in addition to these antiatherogenic functions, HDL is increasingly considered as a part of the innate immune system, the first line of host defense against invading pathogens. HDL displays broad antiviral activity by preventing virus penetration (2Singh I.P. Chopra A.K. Coppenhaver D.H. Ananatharamaiah G.M. Baron S. Antiviral Res. 1999; 42: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and protects the host against trypanosomiasis (3Pérez-Morga D. Vanhollebeke B. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Nolan D.P. Lins L.

Accordingly, the risk of coronary artery disease is higher in patients suffering from any infection, even under conditions when the pathogen does not localize to the vessel wall (7Mendall M.A. Goggin P.M.

The complement system is part of the primary line of human innate immunity (8Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Pathogens, however, have developed a number of strategies to evade antimicrobial action of the complement system. One of them is acquisition of host complement regulators that protect host tissues against complement-mediated damage. This strategy provides microbes with the means to block complement activation on their own surfaces (8Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In addition to well characterized complement regulators, HDL has also been suggested to display a complement-inhibitory potential via interference with the final step in complement activation, assembly of the membrane-attack complex (C5b-9). HDL-associated lipoproteins, apoA-I and apoA-II, recognize the same binding site on C5b-9, bind to C9, and interfere with C9 polymerization or insertion of the membrane-attack complex into the membrane (9Hamilton K.K.

Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:3 is a food-borne enteropathogen that causes enterocolitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, terminal ileitis, and reactive arthritis (12Bottone E.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 257-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Septicemia caused by Y. enterocolitica can occur in both normal and immunocompromised hosts. It may be associated with abscess formation in the liver and spleen, pneumonia, or lead to formation of an aneurysm (12Bottone E.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 257-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected on the basis of its pathogenicity, Y. enterocolitica resists bactericidal action of human serum (13Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LPS of Y. enterocolitica (LPSYeO3), built of distal polysaccharide O-antigen, the core oligosaccharide and the membrane-anchoring lipid A (14Caroff M. Karibian D. Carbohydr.

However, outer membrane proteins YadA and Ail, expressed exclusively at 37 °C, confer serum resistance via binding of complement regulators (17Biedzka-Sarek M. Jarva H. Hyytiäinen H. Meri S.

PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000140Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because Y. enterocolitica acquires host complement regulators to escape the complement attack, we investigated whether the bacteria could utilize the complement-regulatory potential of apoA-I. Surprisingly, we found that apoA-I mediates killing, not protection, of Y. enterocolitica. Here, we describe a new function for apo-AI as a pathogen-recognizing molecule that contributes to the killing of the bacteria in human serum. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and bacteriophages used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. Bacteria were grown as described (13Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (see also supplemental Methods). The antibodies used in this work are described in the supplemental Methods. Human lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (20Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The concentrations of lipoproteins used in the experiments are given in terms of their protein content. Protein concentration was determined as described (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified human apoA-I was provided by Dr. Peter Lerch (Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland). The mutant apoA-I Δ61–78, and Δ1–59 Δ185–243 forms were produced using baculovirus expression system (22Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S. Ishida B.Y. Duchateaux P.N. Krieger J.P. Kane J. Krieger M.

The adenoviruses expressing L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A and E223A/K226A were generated in a similar way (25Koukos G. Chroni A. Duka A. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). LPSs from Y. enterocolitica strains were extracted as described in the supplemental Methods. Normal human serum (NHS) was obtained as described (13Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Heat-inactivated serum (HIS) was generated by serum incubation at 56 °C for 30 min. Serum bactericidal assay was performed as described in the supplemental Methods. Size exclusion chromatography and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described in the supplemental Methods. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described in the supplemental Methods. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed t test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Because apoA-I belongs to negative complement regulators (9Hamilton K.K. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Packman C.H. Rosenfeld S.I. Leddy J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Rosenfeld S.I. Packman C.H. Leddy J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we first examined whether Y. enterocolitica bacteria could protect themselves against complement-mediated killing by utilizing apoA-I. To this end, we blocked apoA-I in NHS by the addition of (i) rabbit antiserum against human apoA-I, (ii) IgG fraction of rabbit apoA-I antiserum, or (iii) mAb against apoA-I. As a control, the IgG fraction of preimmune rabbit serum was used. Bactericidal potential of the sera was tested against the wild-type Y. enterocolitica and its YadA-, O-antigen-, or YadA-O-antigen-negative derivatives. Contrary to our expectations, blocking of apoA-I in sera resulted in increased survival of smooth (O-antigen-expressing) bacteria (Fig. 1, A and B) whereas addition of the preimmune rabbit serum did not affect the bacterial survival. This suggested that the observed increase in bacterial survival was due to specific blocking of apoA-I in NHS. Interestingly, the rough (O-antigen-negative) bacteria did not benefit from apoA-I blocking in serum (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that apoA-I targets specifically O-antigen on the bacterial surface. In fact, the rough bacteria were more potently killed by the serum supplemented with the control preimmune IgG (Fig. 1, C and D). The absence of O-antigen on the bacterial surface could, however, expose antigenic Y. enterocolitica structures that cross-react with antibodies present in rabbit preimmune serum and, in consequence, activate the classical pathway of complement. Because the smooth YeO3-O28 strain that does not express the main serum resistance protein YadA, benefitted the most from the apoA-I blocking (Fig. 1B), it was used as an indicator strain in all subsequent experiments. The survival of the indicator strain in serum increased with the increase of anti-apoA-I IgGs in a concentration-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1), demonstrating the specificity of the effect. We next studied whether LPS could be the target for apoA-I. We incubated LPS purified from Y. enterocolitica grown at 10 °C with purified apoA-I, HDL2, or HDL3. Subsequently, the samples and LPSYeO3 alone were chromatographed on a high resolution Superose 6 column. The distribution of LPS and apoA-I in the eluted fractions was detected using the immuno-dot blotting with mAbs TomA6 and R297. Although LPS alone was widely distributed in the collected fractions, it emerged predominantly in the void volume (fractions 15–17, Fig. 2A). The pattern of LPSYeO3 distribution in apoA-I-, HDL2-, or HDL3-containing samples was dramatically different. In these samples LPSYeO3 co-eluted with apoA-I with a predominant distribution in those fractions containing large apoA-I-containing particles (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the interaction of apoA-I and LPSYeO3 also took place in human serum, we immunoprecipitated apoA-I-LPSYeO3 complexes using protein G-Sepharose-coupled anti-apoA-I IgG antibodies and fractionated the bound material. Immuno-dot blotting analyses using anti-LPSYeO3 and anti-apoA-I antibodies revealed the co-elution of apoA-I and LPSYeO3 in the collected fractions (Fig. 2B). This demonstrated that the apoA-I-LPSYeO3 interaction also took place in NHS. We next examined whether apoA-I also binds to LPSYeO3 on the surface of Y. enterocolitica. We incubated the smooth or rough Y. enterocolitica strains with NHS for 5, 10, 15, or 20 min at 37 °C. Immunoblotting analyses revealed an immediate binding of apoA-I on both strains (Fig. 2C). ApoA-I deposition on the rough strain did not vary dramatically over time. On the contrary, the apoA-I deposition on the smooth Y. enterocolitica strain achieved the maximum at 5 min, after which the interaction decreased until 20 min (Fig. 2C). Importantly, at this time most of the bacteria were killed by the complement. To examine whether the apoA-I deposition on the bacteria could also take place in the absence of complement activation, we incubated the smooth and rough Y. enterocolitica strains in HIS and analyzed the apoA-I binding by immunofluorescence. The staining revealed again the binding of apoA-I to Y. enterocolitica strains regardless of the presence of O-antigen (Fig. 2D). Because the O-antigen-negative strain is a spontaneous derivative of our indicator strain, the lack of O-antigen was confirmed by immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. 2). To examine whether apoA-I also binds to Y. enterocolitica in the absence of other serum components, we tested direct binding of purified apoA-I or HDL (subclass HDL3) to the smooth and rough strains by immunofluorescence microscopy. Surprisingly, apoA-I staining was negative for both strains (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the previously observed interaction between the purified LPSYeO3 and apoA-I (Fig. 2A) occurred most likely via the lipid A portion of LPS, as suggested earlier (26Henning M.F. Herlax V. Bakás L. Innate Immun. 2011; 17: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Levine D.M. Parker T.S. Donnelly T.M. Walsh A. Rubin A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 12040-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In summary, apoA-I interaction with Y. enterocolitica is not direct and seems to require preexposure of the bacteria to serum proteins. Staining with the primary or conjugated antibodies alone in the immunofluorescence assays was negative (data not shown). No staining was seen with bacteria incubated in PBS instead of HIS (data not shown). Given that LPSYeO3 interacts in serum with apoA-I (Fig. 2B), we aimed to block apoA-I in human serum using purified LPSYeO3. We preincubated NHS with 10 μg of smooth or rough LPSYeO3 isolated from the bacteria cultured at 37 °C. Subsequently, the sera were used to kill the indicator Y. enterocolitica strain. We demonstrated that the addition of smooth but not rough LPSYeO3 to human serum increased the survival of the indicator strain (Fig. 3A). Because the O-antigen expression in the stationary phase Y. enterocolitica is maximal below 30 °C (28Lahtinen P. Brzezinska A. Skurnik M. Skurnik M. Granfors K. Bengoechea J.A. The Genus Yersinia: Entering the Functional Genomic Era. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2003Google Scholar), we performed the next experiment with 5 μg of the smooth LPSYeO3 isolated from the bacteria grown at 10 °C (Fig. 3B). Preincubation of NHS with this LPS caused a nearly 90% increase in bacterial survival (Fig. 3B). Thus, a higher survival rate was achieved with the use of 5 μg of 10 °C LPSYeO3 (Fig. 3B) compared with that obtained with 10 μg of 37 °C LPSYeO3 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the increased bacterial resistance depended on the blocking of apoA-I bactericidal function in serum, because the blocking was reversed by the addition of physiological amounts of exogenous lipid-free apoA-I into the 10 °C LPSYeO3-treated serum and was reflected by a drastic drop in bacterial survival (Fig. 3B). To show further that apoA-I bactericidal activity depends on the O-antigen content of LPSYeO3, we isolated LPS from Y. enterocolitica mutants that lack the LPS outer core (YeO3-trs24, YeO3-trs22, and YeO3-trs11) and vary in O-antigen expression levels (13Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Muszynski A. Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides from Mutants of Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 Cultivated at Different Temperatures. University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland2004Google Scholar). The strains were grown at 37 °C or 22 °C, and the abundance of the O-antigen in the isolated LPS was determined by the immune-dot blotting and quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) (Fig. 3C, right). LPSs isolated from the bacteria grown at 22 °C contained an amount of O-antigen comparable with 10 °C LPSYeO3. The only exception was the LPSYeO3-trs11 that contained reduced amount of O-antigen. As expected, 37 °C LPSs (LPSYeO3-trs24 and LPSYeO3-trs22) contained less O-antigen, and no O-antigen could be detected in the preparation of the LPSYeO3-trs11 (Fig. 3C, right). Next, these LPSs were tested for their ability to block the activity of apoA-I in NHS. This would be measured as an increase in survival of the indicator Y. enterocolitica bacteria. In support of our hypothesis, the apoA-I blocking potential of the LPSs correlated to their O-antigen content (Fig. 3C). In general, the 22 °C LPSs were much more potent than their 37 °C counterparts (Fig. 3C, left). In both 22 °C and 37 °C sets, LPSYeO3-trs24 and LPSYeO3-trs22 were more potent than LPSYeO3-trs11 (Fig. 3C, left). Moreover, preincubation of NHS with the 37 °C LPSYeO3-trs11, being O-antigen-negative, did not compromise the serum killing potential at all (Fig. 3C, left). Furthermore, the increase in bacterial survival, resulting from the LPS-mediated blocking of apoA-I, could be reversed in each case by the supplementation of the LPS-treated sera with the physiological amounts of exogenous lipid-free apoA-I (Fig. 3C, left). To confirm that the surface-expressed O-antigen of the serotype O:3 is required for apoA-I to exert its bactericidal activity, the LPSYeO3 O-antigen was expressed in the O-antigen-negative strain of Y. enterocolitica serotype O:8 (8081-c-R2) that did not respond to preincubation of serum with LPSYeO3 (data not shown). The resulting strain 8081-c-R2/pAY100:Tet was incubated with NHS preincubated with 5 or 8 μg of 10 °C LPSYeO3. Expression of LPSYeO3 O-antigen by 8081-c-R2/pAY100:Tet resulted in an increase in bacterial resistance in the serum pretreated with LPSYeO3, and the increase in resistance was LPSYeO3 concentration-dependent (Fig. 3D). Moreover, supplementation of the LPSYeO3-treated serum with the physiological amount of lipid-free apoA-I reduced the resistance of 8081-c-R2/pAY100:Tet to the basal level (Fig. 3D). To the contrary, no such effect was observed with the control strain 8081-c-R2/pBR322 (data not shown). Because lipid-free apoA-I appeared to have bactericidal activity, we next examined whether apoA-I in spherical HDL2 and HDL3 particles displays the same potential. As a control, we used apoA-I-lacking particles, such as LDL and VLDL, containing apoB-100 as the major structural protein. Lipoproteins were added to the sera, treated with 0.5, 2, or 5 μg of 10 °C LPSYeO3, at equiprotein concentrations. We observed that similar to the lipid-free apoA-I, the addition of HDL2 and HDL3 to the LPSYeO3-treated serum significantly diminished the LPSYeO3 effect and, in consequence, survival of the indicator strain in serum was greatly reduced (Fig. 3E). In contrast, addition of LDL or VLDL, devoid of apoA-I, to the LPSYeO3-treated serum did not improve the serum killing potential (Fig. 3E). Taken together, the data suggest that HDL, but not LDL nor VLDL, displays host-protective antibacterial properties. To map an apoA-I region that mediates bactericidal activity in human serum, we added mAbs specific for distinct domains of apoA-I (Fig. 4A, right) to NHS and subsequently determined the ability of the sera to kill Y. enterocolitica indicator bacteria. The only mAb that protected the bacteria was mAb 4.1, specific for the C-terminal domain of apoA-I (Fig. 4). To confirm that the C terminus of apoA-I has anti-bacterial activity, we used purified mutant apoA-I proteins with mutations in the C or N terminus or both. The mutant proteins were tested for their ability to reduce survival of the indicator bacteria in the 10 °C LPSYeO3-treated serum. In agreement with the antibody mapping results, mutant proteins having C-terminal deletions (Δ220–243, Δ185–243), C/N-terminal deletion (Δ1–59 Δ185–243), or having point mutations in the C-terminal portion of apoA-I (L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) were not able to restore the serum killing potential as efficiently as the wild-type apoA-I (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, the mutant protein with point mutations E223A/K226A was able to reverse the LPSYeO3 effect partially whereas the mutant protein having N-terminal internal deletion (Δ61–78) was almost as potent as the wild type (Fig. 4B). These results, consistent with the data obtained with mAb 4.1, suggest strongly that the apoA-I region encompassing residues 218–222 is required for the bacterial killing. Because apoA-I alone is not able to kill Y. enterocolitica bacteria (data not shown), and it does not bind to the bacteria in the absence of serum (Fig. 2D), we investigated whether apoA-I action depends on the active complement system. The activation of complement requires both Mg2+ and Ca2+. We used 5 mm EDTA to chelate these ions and block all of the complement activation pathways. As shown in Fig. 5A, addition of EDTA to NHS efficiently blocked the complement activation, as reflected by 100% survival of the indicator strain. Moreover, reconstitution of EDTA-serum with Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions fully restored the complement activity and reduced the bacterial survival (Fig. 5A). We thus added EDTA to 10 °C LPSYeO3-treated sera and examined the ability of apoA-I to reduce bacterial resistance under these conditions. Interestingly, the apoA-I effect could only be seen in LPSYeO3-treated serum and EDTA-containing LPSYeO3-treated sera with reconstituted Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions (Fig. 5A, right). To demonstrate that the impaired apoA-I activity in EDTA-serum was due to the complement inhibition rather than to the effect of the chemical on apoA-I, we blocked the three complement activation pathways in 10 °C LPSYeO3-treated serum using a mAb against the complement component C5. A mAb against HIV gp120 was used as an isotype-matched control. As shown in Fig. 5B (left), addition of anti-C5 mAb to NHS completely blocked the complement activity as reflected by the 100% survival of the indicator strain. In contrast, the serum supplemented with the control antibody was as efficient in killing the bacteria as NHS alone (Fig. 5B, left). The antibodies were thus added to 10 °C LPSYeO3-treated sera, and the ability of apoA-I to reduce bacterial resistance under these conditions was tested. Blocking of complement with anti-C5 mAb totally abolished the apoA-I effect in LPSYeO3-treated serum, as the apoA-I activity could only be observed in sera to which no antibody or the control antibody was added (Fig. 5B, right). Furthermore, decreasing anti-C5 mAb concentration in LPSYeO3-treated serum increased apoA-I activity in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). In summary, these findings strongly suggest that the active complement is the absolute requirement for the bactericidal function of apoA-I in human serum. In this study we have investigated the role of HDL in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Using Y. enterocolitica we demonstrated that both purified apoA-I and HDL display anti-bacterial activity that is mediated via the complement activation. We mapped the domain of apoA-I required for its anti-bacterial activity and obtained data suggesting that expression of O-antigen sensitizes the bacterial cell for the apoA-I-mediated destruction. Y. enterocolitica are usually acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water (30Naktin J. Beavis K.G. Clin. Lab. Med. 1999; 19: 523-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They pass through the acidic content of the stomach and reach the small intestine. There, they are shuttled across the intestinal epithelium by the M cells of Peyer's patches and gain access to subepithelial space (31Autenrieth I.B. Firsching R. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 44: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Marra A. Isberg R.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3412-3421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Simonet M. Richard S. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 841-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the bacteria reach the mesenteric lymph nodes and in some cases spread further to the liver and spleen. It is likely that HDL, along with the complement proteins, would leak into the inflamed tissue area from the dilated capillaries. In fact, HDL has been shown to infiltrate the synovial inflamed tissue (34Bresnihan B. Gogarty M. Fitzgerald O. Dayer J.M. Burger D. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: R563-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to lymphatics, however, Yersiniae may disseminate from the Peyer's patches via blood vessels (31Autenrieth I.B. Firsching R. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 44: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the bacteria could encounter apoA-I and complement also directly in the bloodstream. As Y. enterocolitica binds inhibitors of the alternative and classical pathway (17Biedzka-Sarek M. Jarva H. Hyytiäinen H. Meri S. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Kirjavainen V. Jarva H. Biedzka-Sarek M. Blom A.M. Skurnik M. Meri S. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000140Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35China B. N'Guyen B.T. de Bruyere M. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first examined whether the bacteria could also use apoA-I in interference with the terminal complement pathway (11Rosenfeld S.I. Packman C.H. Leddy J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that apoA-I contributes to the bacterial killing in serum and that its complement inhibitory properties could not be used by the bacteria. Interestingly, apoA-I deposition on the bacterial surface was detected exclusively in the presence of serum. Thus, bacterial opsonization by serum proteins seems to be a prerequisite for apoA-I to bind to the bacterial surface. Similarly, binding of apoA-I to endothelial cells exposed to complement is 10-fold higher compared with untreated cells (9Hamilton K.K. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We showed that the active complement system was critical for the action of apoA-I. Interestingly, studies with endothelial cells indicate that apoA-I may interfere with either insertion of C9 into a target membrane or with C9 polymerization at C5b-8 sites (11Rosenfeld S.I. Packman C.H. Leddy J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, HDL has been shown to interfere with insertion of nascent fluid phase C5b-7 complexes to cell membranes (36Lint T.F. Behrends C.L. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1977; 119: 883-888PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, HDL may provide alternative hydrophobic sites that could compete with membranes for the binding of fluid phase complement attack complexes thereby protecting bystander cells against complement. Alternatively, HDL could function as a carrier of membranophilic complement complexes and transport them to sites when they are needed to fight against an intruder. In fact, recent proteomic analyses of HDL composition revealed the presence of most of the complement components, including those of the membranophilic complexes (37Collins L.A. Olivier M. Proteome Sci. 2010; 8: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Vaisar T. Pennathur S. Green P.S. Gharib S.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Cheung M.C. Byun J. Vuletic S. Kassim S. Singh P. Chea H. Knopp R.H. Brunzell J. Geary R. Chait A. Zhao X.Q. Elkon K. Marcovina S. Ridker P. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although LDL can also protect cell membranes against insertion of fluid phase C5b-7 (36Lint T.F. Behrends C.L. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1977; 119: 883-888PubMed Google Scholar, 39Podack E.R. Kolb W.P. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), we did not find evidence for the involvement of LDL or VLDL in the killing of Y. enterocolitica. Although the mechanism of apoA-I bactericidal activity mediated by the activation of the complement system requires further study, one could speculate that apoA-I might enhance the deposition of the terminal complement complexes on the bacterial membrane. In this regard, apoA-I appears to act as an immune surveillance molecule that protects the host cells against the complement attack and contributes to the complement-mediated killing of Y. enterocolitica. It becomes obvious that to perform both functions, apoA-I needs to discriminate betweens self and non-self. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognized by apoA-I on Y. enterocolitica surface could be O-antigen. We have shown that only those bacteria that expressed O-antigen were targeted by apoA-I and that the amount of the O-antigen conditioned the extent of apoA-I activity. Importantly, earlier studies had shown that rough bacteria were more serum-resistant than their smooth derivatives expressing the main serum resistance proteins YadA and Ail (13Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In light of the results presented in this report, one could suggest that the increased resistance of the O-antigen-lacking bacteria could result from inability of apoA-I to destruct these bacteria. Accordingly, we found that the expression of LPSYeO3 O-antigen in the rough Y. enterocolitica serotype O:8 strain, that normally did not respond to apoA-I, transformed this strain to the apoA-I responder. LPSYeO3 O-antigen is a homopolymer of 6-deoxy-l-altrose (40Hoffman J. Lindberg B. Brubaker R.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 78: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a sugar that is an extremely rare component of bacterial polysaccharides and cannot be found in mammals. Interestingly, we did not detect apoA-I-mediated bactericidal action against Y. enterocolitica O:8 nor O:9 (data not shown). The O-antigens of these strains, however, dramatically differ from that of serotype O:3 (41Caroff M. Bundle D.R. Perry M.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 42Tomshich, S. V., Gorshkova, R. P., Ovodov, Y. S. (1987) Khim. Prirod. Soed. 657–664.Google Scholar). In the future, it will be important to determine how broad is a range of LPS O-antigens that apoA-I could recognize. Human apoA-I is a 243-residue polypeptide that consists of amphipathic α-helices (43Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The C-terminal residues 220–241 play a major role in binding of apoA-I to phospholipids (44Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 45Laccotripe M. Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal portion of apoA-I has recently been reported to interact with LPS (26Henning M.F. Herlax V. Bakás L. Innate Immun. 2011; 17: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results pointed to an involvement of specific residues, within the 218–222 region of the C-terminal domain, in the apoA-I bactericidal activity. A smaller but substantial inhibition of the bactericidal activity was also observed by substitution of Glu-223 and Lys-226 by alanine. The role of the 218–226 region of apoA-I in bacterial killing needs to be studied further with short apoA-I mimetic peptides. New strains of bacterial pathogens resistant to antibiotics have emerged in recent years. Detailed characterization of the role of HDL and apoA-I in host innate defense mechanisms could be of great importance in the combat against bacterial infections. Further studies are thus warranted to establish how broad is the spectrum of Gram-negative species responding to the bactericidal activity of apoA-I. In clinical context low HDL cholesterol level indicates an unfavorable prognosis in human sepsis (46Chien J.Y. Jerng J.S. Yu C.J. Yang P.C. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 33: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and is accompanied by extensive changes in HDL apolipoprotein composition, such as loss of apoA-I (47Barlage S. Fröhlich D. Böttcher A. Jauhiainen M. Müller H.P. Noetzel F. Rothe G. Schütt C. Linke R.P. Lackner K.J. Ehnholm C. Schmitz G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2066583455,"Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family and has an essential role in mitosis. Survivin is overexpressed in a large variety of human cancers and represents an attractive target for cancer therapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor and Her/neu-transformed human tumors in particular exhibit high levels of survivin. The survivin protein forms dimers through a conserved region that is critical for subcellular localization and biological functions of the protein. We identified small molecules that target a specific cavity adjacent to the survivin dimerization surfaces. S12, a lead compound identified in the screen, can bind to the survivin protein at the intended target site. Moreover, S12 alters spindle formation, causing mitotic arrest and cell death, and inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Cell death occurs in premetaphase stage following mitotic arrest and is not a consequence of general toxicity. Thus, the study validates a novel therapeutic target site in the survivin protein and provides a promising strategy to develop a new class of therapeutic small molecules for the treatment of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2006809997,"Transcription factor Oct1 regulates multiple cellular processes. It is known to be phosphorylated during the cell cycle and by stress, however the upstream kinases and downstream consequences are not well understood. One of these modified forms, phosphorylated at S335, lacks the ability to bind DNA. Other modification states besides phosphorylation have not been described.We show that Oct1 is phosphorylated at S335 in the Oct1 DNA binding domain during M-phase by the NIMA-related kinase Nek6. Phospho-Oct1 is also ubiquitinated. Phosphorylation excludes Oct1 from mitotic chromatin. Instead, Oct1(pS335) concentrates at centrosomes, mitotic spindle poles, kinetochores and the midbody. Oct1 siRNA knockdown diminishes the signal at these locations. Both Oct1 ablation and overexpression result in abnormal mitoses. S335 is important for the overexpression phenotype, implicating this residue in mitotic regulation. Oct1 depletion causes defects in spindle morphogenesis in Xenopus egg extracts, establishing a mitosis-specific function of Oct1. Oct1 colocalizes with lamin B1 at the spindle poles and midbody. At the midbody, both proteins are mutually required to correctly localize the other. We show that phospho-Oct1 is modified late in mitosis by non-canonical K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitination requires the anaphase-promoting complex, and we further show that the anaphase-promoting complex large subunit APC1 and Oct1(pS335) interact.These findings reveal mechanistic coupling between Oct1 phosphorylation and ubquitination during mitotic progression, and a role for Oct1 in mitosis."

The function of IL-22 in adipose tissue is currently unknown. We generated a transgenic mouse model with overexpression of IL-22 specifically in adipose tissue. The IL-22 transgenic mice had no apparent changes in obesity and insulin resistance after feeding with high fat diet (HFD). Unexpectedly, all the IL-22 transgenic mice fed with HFD for four months developed spontaneous tumors in epididymal adipose tissue. Histological analysis indicated that the tumors were well-differentiated liposarcomas with infiltration of inflammatory cells. IL-22 overexpression promotes production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-10 and stimulates ERK phosphorylation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, IL-22 treatment in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes could induce IL-1β and IL-10 expression, together with stimulation of ERK phosphorylation. Taken together, our study not only established a novel mouse model with spontaneous liposarcoma, but also revealed that IL-22 overexpression may collaborate with diet-induced obesity to impact on tumor development in mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1967553772,"Bacterial type-2 (protein-protein) toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are two-gene operons that are thought to participate in the response to stress. Previous work with Escherichia coli has led to a debate in which some investigators conclude that the modules protect from stress, while others argue that they amplify lethal stress and lead to programmed cell death. To avoid ambiguity arising from the presence of multiple TA modules in E. coli, the effect of the sole type-2 toxin-antitoxin module of Bacillus subtilis was examined for several types of lethal stress.Genetic knockout of the toxin gene, ndoA (ydcE), conferred protection to lethal stressors that included kanamycin, moxifloxacin, hydrogen peroxide, and UV irradiation. However, at low doses of UV irradiation the ndoA deficiency increased lethality. Indeed, gradually increasing UV dose with the ndoA mutant revealed a crossover response--from the mutant being more sensitive than wild-type cells to being less sensitive. For high temperature and nutrient starvation, the toxin deficiency rendered cells hypersensitive. The ndoA deficiency also reduced sporulation frequency, indicating a role for toxin-antitoxin modules in this developmental process. In the case of lethal antimicrobial treatment, deletion of the toxin eliminated a surge in hydrogen peroxide accumulation observed in wild-type cells.A single toxin-antitoxin module can mediate two opposing effects of stress, one that lowers lethality and another that raises it. Protective effects are thought to arise from toxin-mediated inhibition of translation based on published work. The enhanced, stress-mediated killing probably involves toxin-dependent accumulation of reactive oxygen species, since a deficiency in the NdoA toxin suppressed peroxide accumulation following antimicrobial treatment. The type and perhaps the level of stress appear to be important for determining whether this toxin will have a protective or detrimental effect."

Results were compared with previously reported results on the effective concentrations used on fouling (target) organisms.

Mechanistically, the phenotype of butenolide-treated Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos was similar to the phenotype of the pro-caspase-3 over-expression mutant with pericardial edema, small eyes, small brains, and increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the bodies of zebrafish embryos. Butenolide also induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), Bcl-2 family proteins, and caspases and proteasomes/lysosomes involved in this process.

https://openalex.org/W2024489941,"The Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.) is a grouse species of open boreal or high altitude forests of Eurasia. It is endangered throughout most mountain range habitat areas in Europe. Two major genetically identifiable lineages of Western Capercaillie have been described to date: the southern lineage at the species' southernmost range of distribution in Europe, and the boreal lineage. We address the question of genetic differentiation of capercaillie populations from the Rhodope and Rila Mountains in Bulgaria, across the Dinaric Mountains to the Slovenian Alps. The two lineages' contact zone and resulting conservation strategies in this so-far understudied area of distribution have not been previously determined. The results of analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of 319 samples from the studied populations show that Alpine populations were composed exclusively of boreal lineage; Dinaric populations of both, but predominantly (96%) of boreal lineage; and Rhodope-Rila populations predominantly (>90%) of southern lineage individuals. The Bulgarian mountains were identified as the core area of the southern lineage, and the Dinaric Mountains as the western contact zone between both lineages in the Balkans. Bulgarian populations appeared genetically distinct from Alpine and Dinaric populations and exhibited characteristics of a long-term stationary population, suggesting that they should be considered as a glacial relict and probably a distinct subspecies. Although all of the studied populations suffered a decline in the past, the significantly lower level of genetic diversity when compared with the neighbouring Alpine and Bulgarian populations suggests that the isolated Dinaric capercaillie is particularly vulnerable to continuing population decline. The results are discussed in the context of conservation of the species in the Balkans, its principal threats and legal protection status. Potential conservation strategies should consider the existence of the two lineages and their vulnerable Dinaric contact zone and support the specificities of the populations."

https://openalex.org/W2161201353,"Bursting as well as tonic firing patterns have been described in various sensory systems. In the olfactory system, spontaneous bursts have been observed in neurons distributed across several synaptic levels, from the periphery, to the olfactory bulb (OB) and to the olfactory cortex. Several in vitro studies indicate that spontaneous firing patterns may be viewed as “fingerprints” of different types of neurons that exhibit distinct functions in the OB. It is still not known, however, if and how neuronal burstiness is correlated with the coding of natural olfactory stimuli. We thus conducted an in vivo study to probe this question in the OB equivalent structure of insects, the antennal lobe (AL) of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. We found that in the moth's AL, both projection (output) neurons (PNs) and local interneurons (LNs) are spontaneously active, but PNs tend to produce spike bursts while LNs fire more regularly. In addition, we found that the burstiness of PNs is correlated with the strength of their responses to odor stimulation – the more bursting the stronger their responses to odors. Moreover, the burstiness of PNs was also positively correlated with the spontaneous firing rate of these neurons, and pharmacological reduction of bursting resulted in a decrease of the neurons' responsiveness. These results suggest that neuronal burstiness reflects a physiological state of these neurons that is directly linked to their response characteristics."

The generation of tumor-specific Tregs and the immune suppression function of Tregs were observed in cell culture models. High levels of TIM4 were detected in glioma-derived macrophages. Phosphatidylserine (PS) was detected in glioma-derived T cells; naïve T cells expressed low levels of PS that could be up-regulated by hypoxia. Glioma-derived macrophages phagocytosed PS-expressing T cells, gaining the tolerogenic properties, which could induce tumor-specific Tregs; the latter could suppress tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. We conclude that macrophage-derived TIM4 plays an important role in the induction of Tregs in gliomas, which may play an important role in tumor tolerance. Tumor tolerance plays a critical role in tumor growth and escape from immune surveillance. The mechanism of tumor tolerance development is not fully understood. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in tumor tolerance. TIM4 (T cell immunoglobulin- and mucin domain-containing molecule-4) is involved in immune regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2029721697,"Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a central role in the regulation of cardiac contraction and rhythm in mammals and humans but its role is controversial in teleosts. Since the zebrafish is an emerging model for studies of cardiovascular function and regeneration we here sought to determine if basic features of SR calcium release are phylogenetically conserved. Confocal calcium imaging was used to detect spontaneous calcium release (calcium sparks and waves) from the SR. Calcium sparks were detected in 16 of 38 trout atrial myocytes and 6 of 15 ventricular cells. The spark amplitude was 1.45±0.03 times the baseline fluorescence and the time to half maximal decay of sparks was 27±3 ms. Spark frequency was 0.88 sparks µm(-1) min(-1) while calcium waves were 8.5 times less frequent. Inhibition of SR calcium uptake reduced the calcium transient (F/F(0)) from 1.77±0.17 to 1.12±0.18 (p = 0.002) and abolished calcium sparks and waves. Moreover, elevation of extracellular calcium from 2 to 10 mM promoted early and delayed afterdepolarizations (from 0.6±0.3 min(-1) to 8.1±2.0 min(-1), p = 0.001), demonstrating the ability of SR calcium release to induce afterdepolarizations in the trout heart. Calcium sparks of similar width and duration were also observed in zebrafish ventricular myocytes. In conclusion, this is the first study to consistently report calcium sparks in teleosts and demonstrate that the basic features of calcium release through the ryanodine receptor are conserved, suggesting that teleost cardiac myocytes is a relevant model to study the functional impact of abnormal SR function."
https://openalex.org/W2050644715,"Any given single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a genome may have little or no functional impact. A biologically significant effect may possibly emerge only when a number of key SNP-related genotypes occur together in a single organism. Thus, in analysis of many SNPs in association studies of complex diseases, it may be useful to look at combinations of genotypes. Genes related to signal transmission, e.g., ion channel genes, may be of interest in this respect in the context of bipolar disorder. In the present study, we analysed 803 SNPs in 55 genes related to aspects of signal transmission and calculated all combinations of three genotypes from the 3×803 SNP genotypes for 1355 controls and 607 patients with bipolar disorder. Four clusters of patient-specific combinations were identified. Permutation tests indicated that some of these combinations might be related to bipolar disorder. The WTCCC bipolar dataset were use for replication, 469 of the 803 SNP were present in the WTCCC dataset either directly (n = 132) or by imputation (n = 337) covering 51 of our selected genes. We found three clusters of patient-specific 3×SNP combinations in the WTCCC dataset. Different SNPs were involved in the clusters in the two datasets. The present analyses of the combinations of SNP genotypes support a role for both genetic heterogeneity and interactions in the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1976658402,"APC is considered a gatekeeper for colorectal cancer (CRC). Cells with heterozygous APC mutations have altered expression profiles suggesting that the first APC hit may help set the stage for subsequent transformation. Therefore, we measured transformation efficiency following what we have designated as ‘simultaneous’ versus ‘stepwise’ Apc loss. We combined a conditional Apc allele (ApcCKO) with a Cre reporter gene and an out-of-frame Cre allele (Pms2cre) that stochastically becomes functional by a frameshift mutation in single cells. Loss of one Apc allele (ApcCKO/+) had little consequence, whereas simultaneous loss of both Apc alleles (ApcCKO/CKO) resulted in increased clonal expansion (crypt fission), consistent with the gatekeeper function of Apc. Interestingly, our analyses showed that most of the Apc-deficient crypts in ApcCKO/CKO mice appeared normal, with morphological transformation, including β-catenin deregulation, occurring in only 17% of such crypts. To determine whether transformation efficiency was different following stepwise Apc loss, we combined ApcCKO with a germline mutant allele, either ApcMin or Apc1638N. Transformation efficiency following stepwise Apc loss (ApcMin/CKO or Apc1638N/CKO) was increased five-fold and essentially all of the Apc-deficient cells were dysplastic. In summary, our data suggest that the gatekeeper function of Apc consists of two roles, clonal expansion and morphological transformation, because simultaneous Apc loss frequently leads to occult clonal expansion without morphological transformation, whereas stepwise Apc loss more often results in visible neoplasia. Finally, that Apc-deficient cells in certain scenarios can retain a normal phenotype is unexpected and may have clinical implications for surveillance strategies to prevent CRC."

This study aimed to test the feasibility and acceptability of the recruitment, allocation, measurement, retention and intervention procedures of a randomised controlled trial of an intervention to improve physical activity and dietary practices amongst obese adults with additional obesity related risk factors. Method Pilot single centre open-labelled outcome assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial of obese (Body Mass Index (BMI)≥30 kg/m2) adults (age≥18 y) with obesity related co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or hypertension. Participants were randomly allocated to a manual-based group intervention or a leaflet control condition in accordance to a 2∶1 allocation ratio. Primary outcome was acceptability and feasibility of trial procedures, secondary outcomes included measures of body composition, physical activity, food intake and psychological process measures. Results Out of 806 potentially eligible individuals identified through list searches in two primary care general medical practices N = 81 participants (63% female; mean-age = 56.56(11.44); mean-BMI = 36.73(6.06)) with 2.35(1.47) co-morbidities were randomised. Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) was the only significant predictor of providing consent to take part in the study (higher chances of consent for invitees with lower levels of deprivation). Participant flowcharts, qualitative and quantitative feedback suggested good acceptance and feasibility of intervention procedures but 34.6% of randomised participants were lost to follow-up due to overly high measurement burden and sub-optimal retention procedures. Participants in the intervention group showed positive trends for most psychological, behavioural and body composition outcomes. Conclusions The intervention procedures were found to be acceptable and feasible. Attrition rates were unacceptably high and areas for improvements of trial procedures were identified.

https://openalex.org/W2052033082,"The γ-glutamyl carboxylase converts Glu to carboxylated Glu (Gla) to activate a large number of vitamin K-dependent proteins with diverse functions, and this broad physiological impact makes it critical to understand the mechanism of carboxylation. Gla formation is thought to occur in two independent steps (i.e. Glu deprotonation to form a carbanion that then reacts with CO2), based on previous studies showing unresponsiveness of Glu deprotonation to CO2. However, our recent studies on the kinetic properties of a variant enzyme (H160A) showing impaired Glu deprotonation prompted a reevaluation of this model. Glu deprotonation monitored by tritium release from the glutamyl γ-carbon was dependent upon CO2, and a proportional increase in both tritium release and Gla formation occurred over a range of CO2 concentrations. This discrepancy with the earlier studies using microsomes is probably due to the known accessibility of microsomal carboxylase to water, which reprotonates the carbanion. In contrast, tritium incorporation experiments with purified carboxylase showed very little carbanion reprotonation and consequently revealed the dependence of Glu deprotonation on CO2. Cyanide stimulated Glu deprotonation and carbanion reprotonation to the same extent in wild type enzyme but not in the H160A variant. Glu deprotonation that depends upon CO2 but that also occurs when water or cyanide are present strongly suggests a concerted mechanism facilitated by His-160 in which an electrophile accepts the negative charge on the developing carbanion.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A recognition signal in the VKD proteins, which is usually a propeptide, confers tight association with the carboxylase and the processive modification of clusters of Glu residues to carboxylated Glu (Gla) residues in their Gla domains (2Morris D.P.

The propeptide is removed in the Golgi, and the Gla domain is transformed into a calcium-binding module that targets the VKD proteins to cell surfaces where negatively charged phospholipids are exposed or to hydroxyapatite in the extracellular matrix.

In addition, genomic sequencing has uncovered proteins with striking homology to the carboxylase in a large number of bacteria, which are thought to have acquired the carboxylase from metazoans by horizontal gene transfer (20Ren S.X.

The only bacterial ortholog to have been characterized to date is from Leptospira borgpetersenii, which appears to have adapted the enzyme for a purpose other than Glu carboxylation (22Rishavy M.A. Hallgren K.W.

The carboxylase drives Glu carboxylation by harnessing the energy obtained from oxygenation of the reduced form of vitamin K (i.e. vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2)). Chemical modeling studies have led to a “base amplification” model in which a weak base in the carboxylase active site deprotonates KH2 for reaction with O2 to form a much stronger vitamin K base (23Dowd P. Hershline R. Ham S.W. Naganathan S. Science. 1995; 269: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This strong base, which is thought to be an alkoxide or dialkoxide species, then deprotonates Glu to react with CO2 and form the Gla product (Fig. 1). Protonation of the vitamin K base results in the ultimate production of vitamin K epoxide, which is subsequently recycled back to KH2 by the vitamin K oxidoreductase (24Tie J.K. Stafford D.W. Vitam. Horm. 2008; 78: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). How the carboxylase facilitates catalysis is largely unknown because it is a large, integral membrane protein without structural information that reveals functional residues (9Berkner K.L. Vitam. Horm. 2008; 78: 131-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A critical breakthrough in understanding the mechanism and in beginning to define the active site was the identification of Lys-218 as the weak base that initiates the reaction by deprotonating KH2 to generate the vitamin K base (25Rishavy M.A. Hallgren K.W. Yakubenko A.V. Shtofman R.L. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13239-13248Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Currently, Glu carboxylation is thought to occur in two independent steps that can be uncoupled if CO2 is not available. Thus, Glu deprotonation is believed to result in the formation of a discrete carbanion (i.e. the Glu carbanion shown in Fig. 1), which subsequently reacts with CO2 to generate Gla. This stepwise mechanism is based on studies showing that Glu deprotonation is unaffected by the level of CO2 (26Friedman P.A. Shia M.A. Gallop P.M. Griep A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3126-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, recent results prompted us to reevaluate the question of whether Glu carboxylation does in fact occur in a stepwise mechanism. We found that carboxylase residue His-160 is required for Glu deprotonation (27Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); however, the H160A mutant that revealed the function of His-160 had a puzzling property, which was a 5-fold increase in Km for CO2 and which suggested that Glu deprotonation mediated by His-160 depends upon the presence of CO2. The original studies that led to the conclusion that carbanion formation and CO2 addition are two independent steps used crude microsomes as the source of carboxylase (26Friedman P.A. Shia M.A. Gallop P.M. Griep A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3126-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and we therefore performed similar experiments using purified enzyme. As described below, the results show that Glu deprotonation clearly depends upon CO2, and they suggest a concerted mechanism of Gla formation in which Glu deprotonation and CO2 addition occur simultaneously. Importantly, these findings provide insight into how the carboxylase catalyzes the reaction by avoiding the formation of a fully negatively charged carbanion intermediate. Baculoviruses containing wild type carboxylase or a variant with His-160 substituted by Ala were generated and expressed in SF21 insect cells as previously described (27Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both enzymes contain a C-terminal addition of an alanine linker followed by the FLAG epitope (i.e. AAADYKDDDDK). Microsomes from SF21 cells infected with baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 were prepared in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. The microsomes were adjusted to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml protein, as determined by a BCA assay (Pierce), followed by solubilization with a 0.5%/0.1% (w/v) mixture of CHAPS and phosphatidylcholine. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), carboxylase was affinity-purified from the solubilized microsomes using agarose-coupled anti-FLAG antibody resin (Sigma). Sample (1 ml) was nutated overnight with anti-FLAG resin (100 μl, 0.6 mg/ml), which was then washed by five successive rounds of centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 min) and incubation in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.2% (w/v) phosphatidylcholine, and 500 mm NaCl, all at 4 °C. Carboxylase was eluted for 1 h at 4 °C with 200 μl of the same buffer but containing FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml; Sigma), followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 min) to recover the carboxylase in the supernatant. The carboxylase levels were quantitated using combined LI-COR and Western analysis and a BAP-FLAG standard (Sigma). Wild type carboxylase was also tested in an activity assay and had a specific activity indistinguishable from enzyme isolated from tissue (28Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that the recombinant form was fully functional. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2), and all experiments described below used purified carboxylase. Carboxylase complexed with factor IX was also generated by coinfecting SF21 cells with baculoviruses containing the carboxylase and factor IX (28Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Rishavy M.A. Pudota B.N. Hallgren K.W. Qian W. Yakubenko A.V. Song J.H. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Proc.

Microsomes were solubilized as with free carboxylase, except that the NaCl concentration was 200 mm and phosphatidylcholine was omitted. To monitor the extent of complex formation between factor IX and the carboxylase, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using anti-FLAG-agarose and an immobilized polyclonal anti-factor IX antibody (2.5 mg/ml) (30Lingenfelter S.E. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8234-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Aliquots (450 μl) were incubated overnight with antibody-containing resin (100 μl). The resins were washed, and the anti-FLAG resin was incubated with FLAG peptide as described above. Factor IX and the carboxylase were then monitored by assaying starting sample (i.e. the solubilized microsomes), unbound material, and eluant (in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation) or washed resin (in the anti-factor IX immunoprecipitation). The factor IX was quantitated using LI-COR/Western analysis and a pure factor IX standard (Enzyme Research Laboratory), and carboxylase was measured by an activity assay (28Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Large amounts of complex were then generated by immunopurification on the anti-FLAG resin. An aliquot of the anti-FLAG eluant was tested for the stability of the carboxylase-factor IX complex by immunopurification on anti-factor IX resin as described above. Chemical reduction of vitamin K quinone under nitrogen was used to prepare CO2-free KH2 cofactor. All steps were performed with minimal lighting. Phylloquinone (0.2 mmol; Sigma) in 40 ml of ether was shaken vigorously for 5 min with 250 ml of 170 mm sodium hydrosulfite, and the ether layer was then evaporated to dryness with a stream of dry nitrogen. The residual KH2 was taken up in 10 ml of ethanol under nitrogen, and aliquots were transferred to sealed vials pregassed with nitrogen. The KH2 concentration was determined by absorbance at 248 nm (ϵ = 19 mm−1 cm−1). Radioactive peptides were generated to monitor the recovery of reaction products. The peptides Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu (FLEEL (5 mm), AnaSpec) and Lys-Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu (KFLEEL (5 mm), AnaSpec) were individually carboxylated in 1-ml reactions containing 5.5 mm [14C]bicarbonate (55 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 50 mm BES, pH 6.9, 2 mm KH2, carboxylase (∼150 nm), and a core reaction mixture used in almost all reactions described in this work. The core reaction mixture was composed of 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.16% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.16% (w/v) phosphatidylcholine, 10 μm factor X propeptide, and 2.5 mm DTT. After incubation at 21 °C for 2 days, water (1 ml) was added, and the samples were boiled (to ∼200 μl) to eliminate unreacted [14C]CO2. The samples were placed on ice, and 800 μl of ice-cold acetone was added to precipitate detergent and proteins. After 1 h at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and evaporated to 200 μl with a stream of dry nitrogen, followed by chromatography on P-2 columns (Bio-Rad) using 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. Fractions containing radioactivity were pooled and lyophilized to dryness. Carboxylated and uncarboxylated peptides were then separated by HPLC using a Hypersil C18 column (Thermo Scientific) and isocratic elution with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 15% (v/v) acetonitrile. The carboxylated peptides were located by absorbance at 258 nm and scintillation counting. The peptides are preferentially carboxylated at the first Glu (31Finnan J.L. Suttie J.W. Suttie J.W.

After three rounds of incubation in 50 mm HCl (100 μl) and lyophilization, the peptides were heated to 110 °C for 9 h under nitrogen, followed by neutralization with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8 (100 μl) and lyophilization to dryness. The samples were subjected to four cycles of resuspension in 50 mm HCl (100 μl) and lyophilization, and the decarboxylated peptides were purified by HPLC as above and quantitated by absorbance and scintillation counting. Initial experiments revealed that the reaction mixture and enzyme preparation contained appreciable levels of endogenous CO2, which was measured as described previously (27Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and steps were therefore taken to remove CO2. Reactions (170 μl) containing 5 mm FLEEL, 50 mm BES, pH 6.9, carboxylase (∼150 nm), and core reaction mixture were incubated without further manipulation or were placed in vials with rubber septums that allowed gassing either over the headspace or directly in the sample. A fourth set of reactions containing 25 mm MES, pH 5.5, instead of BES was also gassed directly in solution in the sealed vial, followed by neutralization with 80 mm BES, pH 7.25, which adjusted the final pH to 6.9. All of the reactions were then initiated by the addition of CO2-free KH2 (2 mm final concentration), prepared as described above. The reactions were incubated for 4 h at 21 °C, and Gla formation was then monitored by peptide isolation, followed by amino acid analysis. Peptide was isolated by acetone precipitation and P-2 chromatography as described above. The peptide was hydrolyzed with base, and amino acids were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde, followed by HPLC and fluorescence to quantitate the amount of derivatized Gla and Glu, as before (34Berkner K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 450-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All of the assays were performed in duplicate. These experiments indicated a substantial decrease in the amount of Gla formation from endogenous CO2 in samples that underwent low pH gassing, so the following manipulations were implemented in subsequent experiments. All reagents (except bicarbonate, KH2, and carboxylase) were bubbled for 2 h with nitrogen in a glove bag (Captair Pyramid, Erlab Group) flushed twice with nitrogen and filled with a final 1:1 mixture of nitrogen/oxygen. Reaction mixtures containing carboxylase were then bubbled at pH 5.5 for 10 min with a nitrogen/oxygen mixture prehumidified so as not to reduce the volume of the sample by evaporation. Pilot experiments revealed that bubbling for 10 min did not result in significant loss of enzyme activity; however, longer times attenuated activity. The reaction mixture was divided into aliquots and then titrated to pH 6.9 by the addition of 80 mm BES, pH 7.25. Bicarbonate was then added to supply CO2, if used, and the reactions were initiated with CO2-free KH2. Tritium release from the glutamyl γ-carbon was used as a direct measure of Glu deprotonation. Reaction mixtures were prepared (170 μl) that contained 5 mm Phe-Leu-[R,S-3H]Glu-Glu-Leu (FL-[R,S-3H]EEL, specific activity 98 cpm/nmol), 25 mm MES, pH 5.5, carboxylase (∼150 nm), and core reaction mixture. FL-[R,S-3H]EEL was prepared as described previously (27Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) except that peptide purification by HPLC used a different mobile phase (i.e. 15% (v/v) acetonitrile with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, instead of bicarbonate). The reaction mixture was bubbled and neutralized with BES as described above, and bicarbonate (final 8 mm concentration) was then added to one set of samples, followed by reaction initiation with CO2-free KH2 (2.5 mm final concentration). After a 4-h incubation at 21 °C, the samples were removed from the glove bag, and 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn for measuring vitamin K epoxidation. These aliquots were added to tubes containing 140 μl water, 500 μl of 1:1 ethanol/hexane, and 15 μl of a K25 standard (2 nmol; GL Synthesis) that monitored recovery. The samples were vortexed, the organic phase was removed under nitrogen, and the vitamin K epoxide product was quantitated by HPLC and absorbance, as before (22Rishavy M.A. Hallgren K.W. Yakubenko A.V. Zuerner R.L. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34870-34877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To assay the release of tritium from FL-[R,S-3H]EEL, the remaining samples underwent Thunberg distillation, as before (27Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All samples were assayed in duplicate. A separate set of reactions was also performed over a range of CO2 concentrations (0–8 mm), and in this experiment, parallel reactions were performed to determine Gla formation. In the parallel reactions, FLEEL replaced FL-[R,S-3H]EEL in the mixture, and trace (<5 μm) levels of FL-[14C]EEL were included to monitor recovery. Acetone precipitation and P-2 chromatography were performed as described above to isolate the peptide mixture (i.e. FLEEL, FLγEL, and FL-[14C]EEL), which was located by scintillation counting. After lyophilization, peptides were base-hydrolyzed and derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde, and Gla was quantitated by HPLC and fluorescence, as before (34Berkner K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 450-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The values were adjusted for recovery determined by quantitating both aliquots of the starting reaction mixture and [14C]Glu fractions eluting from the column during HPLC. All assays were performed in duplicate. Incorporation of tritium from solvent into Glu was measured by performing duplicate reactions (170 μl) in a mixture containing tritiated water (final specific activity ∼0.4 mCi/ml; Moravec Biochemicals, Inc.), 2.5 mm FLEEL, buffer (25 mm MES, pH 5.5, followed by neutralization to pH 6.9 with 80 mm BES, pH 7.25 after degassing), 2 mm KH2, carboxylase (∼150 nm), trace amounts (<5 μm) of KFL-[14C]EEL, and core reaction mixture. After 4 h at 21 °C, aliquots (10 μl) were removed to measure vitamin K epoxidation as described above. The remainder of the sample was added to a vial with 2 ml of water and then boiled to 200 μl to eliminate most of the tritiated water. After the addition of 800 μl of acetone and incubation on ice for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min) and then chromatographed on P-2 columns, which separated any remaining tritiated water from peptide. Fractions containing peptide (i.e. KFL-[14C]EEL, FLEEL, and FLγEL) were detected by scintillation counting and lyophilized to dryness. The samples were analyzed by HLPC on a C18 Hypersil column with 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, and 15% (v/v) acetonitrile as the mobile phase, and the FLEEL fractions were collected and counted for the presence of tritium. The KFL-[14C]EEL fraction was well resolved from FLEEL and was also collected, and scintillation counting was performed to correct the tritium counts for recovery loss during peptide isolation. FLγEL peptide was also quantitated by absorbance in some experiments to determine the extent of Gla formation. Glu reprotonation by deuterium was also monitored. Carboxylase was purified as described above but using reagents prepared in deuterium oxide, and a control carboxylation assay was performed that showed that the enzyme had a normal specific activity. The reaction to measure Glu reprotonation was then performed as described above, except that tritiated water was replaced by D2O, which was used to prepare all of the reaction components. The FLEEL peptide was isolated by HPLC and then quantitated for deuterium incorporation using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy on a Finnigan LTQ linear ion trap system. The amount of deuterated FLEEL was compared with a standard curve containing increasing amounts of FL-[R,S-2H]EEL mixed with FLEEL, giving a final concentration of 1 μm peptide for each sample. The FL-[R,S-2H]EEL was synthesized as described previously (27Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), except that D2O replaced T2O. When FLEEL alone was analyzed, the theoretical value predicted for natural isotopic abundance was within 1% of the observed value, validating the instrumentation used in this approach. Carboxylation reactions containing [14C]bicarbonate, 2.5 mm FLEEL, 50 mm BES, pH 6.9, carboxylase (25 nm), KH2 (2 mm), and core reaction mixture were performed over a range of cyanide concentrations (0–10 mm). After 1 h at 21 °C, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, followed by boiling to remove [14C]CO2, and [14C]CO2 incorporation into peptide substrate was then quantitated by scintillation counting. The effects of cyanide on Glu deprotonation and reprotonation were also determined. The assays were performed exactly as described above except for the inclusion of cyanide. A cyanide stock (340 mm) was sparged with nitrogen in the glove bag for 2 h prior to addition to the reaction mixture. Initial experiments revealed a complication by endogenous CO2 because high levels of carboxylation were observed in the absence of exogenously added CO2 (i.e. 37% Gla formation compared with vitamin K epoxidation; Fig. 3). Previously, lyophilization of microsomes was used to reduce the endogenous CO2 concentration to trace levels (∼0.1 mm) (35Anton D.L. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14084-14087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36McTigue J.J. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12129-12131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilization resulted in inactivation of purified carboxylase (not shown), so we sought an alternative method for removing endogenous CO2. When reaction mixtures that contained carboxylase were either gassed with a mixture of nitrogen/oxygen over the headspace or bubbled directly in solution, significant carboxylation was still observed (27 and 14% compared with vitamin K epoxidation; Fig. 3B). However, when the reaction mixture was first bubbled at pH 5.5 to eliminate bicarbonate and ca"
https://openalex.org/W1998804829,"CD8(+) T cells infiltrate the brain during an anti-viral immune response. Within the brain CD8(+) T cells recognize cells expressing target antigens, become activated, and secrete IFNγ. However, there are no methods to recognize individual cells that respond to IFNγ. Using a model that studies the effects of the systemic anti-adenoviral immune response upon brain cells infected with an adenoviral vector in mice, we describe a method that identifies individual cells that respond to IFNγ. To identify individual mouse brain cells that respond to IFNγ we constructed a series of adenoviral vectors that contain a transcriptional response element that is selectively activated by IFNγ signaling, the gamma-activated site (GAS) promoter element; the GAS element drives expression of a transgene, Cre recombinase (Ad-GAS-Cre). Upon binding of IFNγ to its receptor, the intracellular signaling cascade activates the GAS promoter, which drives expression of the transgene Cre recombinase. We demonstrate that upon activation of a systemic immune response against adenovirus, CD8(+) T cells infiltrate the brain, interact with target cells, and cause an increase in the number of cells expressing Cre recombinase. This method can be used to identify, study, and eventually determine the long term fate of infected brain cells that are specifically targeted by IFNγ. The significance of this method is that it will allow to characterize the networks in the brain that respond to the specific secretion of IFNγ by anti-viral CD8(+) T cells that infiltrate the brain. This will allow novel insights into the cellular and molecular responses underlying brain immune responses."
