https://openalex.org/W1563535758,"The association rate constants for the interaction of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, oxidized alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin with several mammalian serine proteinases have been determined. The results indicate that leukocyte elastase reacts more rapidly with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor than any other proteinase tested, while leukocyte cathepsin G shows the strongest association with alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. Oxidation of the critical methionine residue of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor reduces the association with leukocyte elastase by a factor of more than 2000 and also lowers the association with all of the other enzymes tested with the exception of chymotrypsin. Significantly, oxidation completely abolishes any interaction of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor with porcine elastase, human plasmin or human thrombin. These data support previous results (Johnson, D., and Travis, J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4022-4026) which indicated that oxidation of human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor in vivo could reduce the effectiveness of this inhibitor in controlling proteolysis. In the lung, in particular, oxidizing agents of both chemical and biological sources could, indirectly, augment elastolysis in this tissue, resulting in the development of pulmonary emphysema."
https://openalex.org/W1483819615,"[3H]Cytochalasin B binding and its competitive inhibition by D-glucose have been used to quantitate the number of functional glucose transport units in plasma and microsomal membranes prepared from intact rat diaphragm. In a series of three experiments, plasma membranes prepared from diaphragms which have not been incubated with insulin bind approximately 16 pmol of cytochalasin B/mg of membrane protein to the D-glucose-inhibitable binding site. If 280 nM (40,000 microunits/ml) insulin is present during the incubation, cytochalasin B binding to the plasma membranes is increased approximately 2-fold without alteration in the dissociation constant of this site. Membranes in the microsomal fraction prepared from diaphragms which have been incubated for 30 min in the absence of insulin contain 21 pmol of D-glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin B binding sites/mg of membrane protein. However, in the presence of insulin during the incubation period, the number of these sites in the microsomal fraction is decreased to 12 pmol/mg of membrane protein. These results suggest that insulin stimulates glucose transport in the isolated rat diaphragm primarily through a translocation of functional glucose transport units from an intracellular membrane pool to the plasma membrane. These results are similar to the results observed in rat adipose cells (Cushman, S. W., and Wardzala, L. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4758-4762) and suggest that this mechanism of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity may be general to other cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1996853305,"Choline acetyltransferase was demonstrated in neuronal structures of the rodent central nervous system by immunohistochemistry through the application of Fab fragments obtained from monospecific antiserums to human choline acetyltransferase. The specificity of the antiserum for the enzyme was confirmed by the staining of both the ventral horn motor neurons in the rat spinal cord and the neuromuscular junction of the guinea pig diaphragm. Enzyme-containing cell bodies were observed in frontal sections of rat and guinea pig brain in the neostriatum, accumbens, nucleus of the diagonal band, medial septum, and olfactory tubercle. Positively staining fibers and probable nerve terminals were also found in the olfactory tubercle field and other areas of the basal forebrain. The results provide information on the distribution of the cholinergic systems in the rostral forebrain of the rodent."

https://openalex.org/W1583126278,"A serine esterase with potent proteolytic activity against native bovine lens capsule type IV collagen was isolated and purified from extract of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The type IV collagenolytic activity co-purified with N-t-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-alanine nitroanilidase, and was inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala chloromethyl ketone. In addition, the purified enzyme had elastolytic activity, reacted with a specific antibody to PMN elastase, and, therefore, appeared to be identical with this enzyme. A simple, reproducible assay for the detection of type IV collagenase activity using insoluble bovine anterior lens capsule collagen was defined. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme released large molecular weight peptides (greater than 30,000) from the insoluble substrate. The enzyme was also active against native, pepsin-solubilized type IV collagen; five reaction products could be identified. These data suggest that PMN elastase may be involved in the degradation of basement membrane collagen in physiologic and pathologic states."

https://openalex.org/W2163050240,"The str operon at 72 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome contains genes for ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) S12 (str or rpsL) and S7 (rpsG) and elongation factors G (fus) and Tu (tufA). The sequence of the entire S12 gene, the S12-S7 intercistronic region, and the beginning of the S7 gene is reported. Also, the sequence of the end of the S7 gene, the S7-G intercistronic region, and the beginning of the elongation fractor G gene is reported. The S12-S7 intercistronic region is 96 base pairs long, in contrast to other intercistronic regions in r-protein operons which have been found to vary from 3 to 66 base pairs. The S7-G intercistronic region is only 27 bases long, supporting the previous conclusion that r-protein and elongation factor genes are co-transcribed. A comparison of translation initiation sites of the S12 and S7 genes, and other examples of co-transcribed r-protein genes, reveals no obvious features that could account for equimolar synthesis of all r-proteins. The codon usage in the S12 and S7 genes follows the pattern observed in other r-protein genes; that is, there is a highly preferential usage of codons recognized by the most abundant of isoaccepting tRNA species. This pattern could reflect the cell's need for efficient translation or minimal errors, or both, in r-protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1507551858,"A wide variety of double-stranded DNA templates are replicated extensively in an in vitro DNA replication system containing the purified proteins specified by seven T4 bacteriophage DNA replication genes (32, 41, 43, 44, 62, 45, and 61). In favorable conditions, this multiprotein system catalyzes the synthesis of several copies of the input DNA template in a 30- to 60-min incubation. The replication forks produced in vitro move in a highly processive fashion, at approximately the in vivo rate of 500 nucleotides per s. The DNA synthesized on the lagging side of the in vitro replication fork is made discontinuously, as it is in vivo, giving rise to pieces averaging some 10,000 nucleotides in length; in contrast, DNA is polymerized in a continuous manner on the leading side of the in vitro fork. Although the mechanism by which the seven-protein in vitro DNA replication system propagates replication forks closely resembles the in vivo mechanism, it lacks the capacity to remove RNA primers, to reseal Okazaki pieces, and to initiate replication forks at defined DNA origins; supplementation of the system with additional T4-specific replication proteins will be required to facilitate these latter three functions."

https://openalex.org/W2019859770,"Abstract Epithelial cells from human post-partal amniotic membrane in primary culture secreted two major matrix proteins, fibronectin and procollagen type III, and small amounts of laminin and basement membrane collagens (types IV and AB). Identified in the culture medium by immunoprecipitation, these components were located by immunofluorescence to a pericellular matrix beneath the cell monolayer. Deposition of fibronectin, laminin and procollagen type III occurred under freshly seeded spreading cells. In the matrix of confluent cultures, fibronectin and procollagen type III had a moss-like distribution. Matrix laminin had predominantly a punctate pattern and was sometimes superimposed on the fibronectin-procollagen type III matrix. In the human amniotic membrane in vivo, laminin, type IV collagen and fibronectin were located to a narrow basement membrane directly beneath the epithelial cells. Fibronectin and procollagen type III were detected in the underlying thick acellular compact layer. Fibronectin secreted by amniotic epithelial cells is a disulfide-bonded dimer of slightly higher apparent molecular weight (240 kilodaltons) than fibronectins isolated from human plasma or fibroblast cultures. Laminin was detected in small amounts in the culture medium. Laminin antibodies precipitated a polypeptide of about 400 kilodaltons, and two polypeptides with slightly faster mobility in electrophoresis under reducing conditions than fibronectin. Procollagen type III was by far the major collagenous protein whereas little or no production of procollagen type I could be observed. Basement membrane collagens were identified as minor components in the medium by immunoprecipitation (type IV) or chemical methods (αA and αB chains)."
https://openalex.org/W1551785117,"Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin derived from a strain pathogenic for man has been purified 13,000-fold to apparent homogeneity. The purification scheme involved growth in a minimal medium. Amberlite XAD-2 chromatography, acetone fractionation, Sephadex G-25 filtration, DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. This scheme resulted in a white flocculent material which was biologically active in 2.7-ng quantities. Heat-stable enterotoxin was homogeneous as determined by the following: (a) a single peak on gel filtration; (b) a single band on thin layer chromatography; (c) a single band on thin layer electrophoresis; (d) a single NH2-terminal amino acid residue, asparagine; and (e) an amino acid composition demonstrating a stoichiometric relationship among the amino acids. The molecule is composed of 10 different amino acids, a total of 18 amino acid residues, one-third of which are half-cystine. The molecule contains no detectable carbohydrate. Biological activity is promptly lost on treatment with the reducing reagents, 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, or after performic acid oxidation, suggesting the presence of disulfide bridges which are required for biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2055279201,"Micronuclei of Tetrahymena thermophila contain two electrophoretically distinct forms of histone H3. The slower migrating micronuclear species, H3S, is indistinguishable from the macronuclear H3 by electrophoretic analyses in three gel systems and by partial proteolytic peptide mapping. The faster species, H3F, is unique to micronuclei. Pulse-chase experiments with radioactive amino acids show that H3S is a precursor to H3F. We present evidence that the in vivo processing of H3S into H3F requires cell growth and/or division and may occur regularly each generation at a specific point in the cell cycle. The processing event must occur after H3F is deposited on micronuclear chromatin, since both H3S and H3F can be isolated from sucrose gradient-purified mononucleosomes (Allis, Glover and Gorovsky, 1979). Partial proteolytic peptide mapping coupled with 3H-N-ethylmaleimide labeling suggest that the processing event involves a proteolytic cleavage from the amino terminal end of H3F. Automated sequence analyses of 14C-lysine-labeled macronuclear H3 together with either 3H-lysine-labeled H3S or H3F demonstrated that H3F is derived from H3S by a proteolytic cleavage which removes six residues from the amino terminus. These observations represent the first demonstration of a physiologically regulated proteolytic processing event in histone metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2017520954,"In bacterial chemotaxis, adaptation is correlated with methylation or demethylation of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). Each protein migrates as a characteristic set of multiple bands in sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The changes in MCP methylation that accompany adaptation are not the same for all bands of a set. Adaptation to a type II repellent stimulus results in an overall decrease in MCP II methylation, but also in an increase in the amount of radioactive methyl groups in the upper band of the set. We demonstrate that this increase is not due to new methylation, but rather to reduced electrophoretic mobility of previously methylated molecules that have lost some but not all of their methyl groups. We suggest that the pattern of multiple bands is a direct reflection of multiple sites for methylation on MCP molecules, and that the distribution of radiolabel among the bands is determined by the total extent of methylation. The patterns of methylated peptides produced by limited proteolysis of different MCP bands imply that methylation of the multiple sites on a molecule may occur in a specific order."

https://openalex.org/W1648567303,"Alkaline-sensitive strains of Escherichia coli were selected by mutagenesis followed by penicillin killing in medium at pH 8.3. One such strain was found to lack K+/H+ exchange. At neutral pH, the doubling time of the mutant was not significantly different from that of the parent, but at pH 8.3 the doubling time of the mutant increased over 5-fold. No energy-dependent uptake of 204Tl+ was observed in the mutant, but addition of the K+/H+ exchanger Nigericin resulted in identical 204Tl+ uptake in the mutant and parent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the K+/H+ antiporter is responsible for regulation of cytosolic pH in E. coli. In the absence of antiporter, the organism would be unable to grow at alkaline pH due to alkalinization of the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1987636123,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains KL14-4A and 777-3A, four intervening sequences of 1900 (l alpha beta), 1400 (l beta gamma), 1300 (l gamma delta) and 650 bp (l delta epsilon) separate the five coding sequences (alpha-epsilon) of the structural gene (cob) for cytochrome b. Its major transcript is an 18S RNA (2200 nucleotides) which is likely to be the functional mRNA. The lengths of a series of larger transcripts and their hybridization with probes specific for different intervening sequences are consistent with their being intermediates in a splicing process which generates 18S RNA from a giant primary transcript (greater than or equal to 7.5 kb) covering the whole cob region. There is no absolute order of splicing. The intervening sequence l alpha beta is excised in two stages. The first generates a stable 10S RNA, coded for by sequences immediately downstream of the 18S RNA coding segment alpha. The function of this RNA is unknown. Its excision is an early step in processing, whereas excision of the remainder of l alpha beta is a late event. We have studied four cytochrome b-deficient mutants. These map in intervening sequences and are splicing-defective. They accumulate 22S-28S RNAs which contain one or more intervening sequences. The l alpha beta mutants synthesize long, novel polypeptides, antigenically related to cytochrome b, possibly as a result of read-through into the intervening sequences. Several cob mutants also display alterations in their transcripts of oxi-3, the locus which codes for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. This indicates that interactions between cob and oxi-3 exist at the level of RNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W121852426,"The ability of the fatty acid binding sites of serum albumin to bind lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus pyogenes was investigated. Initial studies indicated that lipoteichoic acid, but not its deacylated deprivative, protected albumin from being denatured by heat (80C for 1 h) and changed its mobility in an electrical field. Albumin covalently linked to agarose beads bound radiolabeled lipoteichoic acid, and the bound [3H]lipoteichoic acid could be specifically eluted with unlabeled lipoteichoic acid or albumin but not with other proteins tested. After binding to albumins, the lipoteichoic acid also could be quantitatively eluted with 50% ethanol and various detergents but not with up to 1.0 M sodium chloride. Binding of lipoteichoic acid to albumin followed first order kinetics, reaching saturation at 12 h. Analysis of the binding data by a Scatchard plot indicated heterogeneity of the binding sites on the albumin molecule similar to that previously reported for fatty acids. The affinity of binding of lipoteichoic acid to albumin was found to be intermediate between that previously reported for octanoic and palmitic acids, respectively. Based on these findings, we prepared affinity columns of immobilized albumin and were able to separate biologically active lipoteichoic acid from heterogeneous extracts of S. pyogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2082322436,"The yeast virus, ScV, is communicated only by mating. It has two separately encapsidated dsRNAs. One of these, L, codes for the major capsid polypeptide. The other, M, codes for a polypeptide toxic to yeasts without ScV-M particles. Defective interfering particles containing fragments of M (S) displace ScV-M when they arise. We have shown that five independently isolated S dsRNAs are all derived by internal deletion of M. The 3' ends of all the ScV dsRNAs are markedly heterogeneous. For instance, half of the first 35 nucleotides at one 3' end of M and S are variable. Conserved sequences at the 3' ends of M and S are AAACACCCAUCAOH and AUUUCUUUAUUUUUCAOH. Conserved sequences at the 3' ends of L are UAAAAAUUUUUCAOH and AAAAAUXCAOH, where X is variable. We propose that the sequence AUUUUUCAOH is a recognition sequence for the capsid-associated single-stranded RNA polymerase activity. Since all the viral RNAs have pppGp 5' termini, their 3' termini probably extended one nucleotide beyond the terminal pppGp."
https://openalex.org/W2091930611,"By S1 nuclease mapping we have located the intervening sequence in the large ribosomal RNA gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae omega+ strains 570 bp from the 3' end of the rRNA gene. No intervening sequence was detected at this position in S. carlsbergensis, but the sequences of the mature 21S rRNAs of these two strains appear to be identical in this region. By comparing the DNA sequence of the region of the intervening sequence in an omega+ strain with the corresponding sequence in S. carlsbergensis, we have determined the splice points of the 21S rRNA gene. These sequences show no homology with splice points in nuclear and viral genes or with the splice points in the chloroplast 23S rRNA gene of Chlamydomonas. The external borders of the splice points have a complementary sequence in the intervening sequence. The largest transcript hybridizing with the probe of the intervening sequence has a size corresponding to that expected for an rRNA precursor still containing the intervening sequence; the smallest transcript corresponds in size to the intervening sequence itself."
https://openalex.org/W1583809098,"A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been purified to homogeneity from bacteriophage N4 virions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-8 M urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme revealed a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 350,000. The hydrodynamic properties of the enzyme have been determined to be 9.5 S for the sedimentation coefficient and 84 A for the Stokes radius. These two parameters indicate a native molecular weight of 320,000. Enzyme activity is dependent on the presence of Mg2+, the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, and denatured N4 DNA. Under these conditions, initiation of RNA synthesis occurs exclusively with pppG. The enzyme is inhibited by monovalent salts and is resistant to the drugs rifampicin and streptolydigin. The protein is present in 1 to 2 copies per virion; its presence provides an explanation for the independence of N4 early RNA synthesis on the activity of the host RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2102187515,"A high copy number plasmid that carries the promoter PJ, intact rplJ and a deletion of the 3′ terminal portion of rplL is detrimental to the growth of the host bacterium. Six independent point mutations on the plasmid that overcome this detriment have been isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrates that all six mutants are single base pair alterations, occur within the leader region of the rplJ operon and are well removed from the presumed position of the primary promoter, PJ. These mutant plasmids exhibit normal transcription of rplJ-rplL but do not translate rplJ messenger RNA to yield plasmid-specified L10 ribosomal protein. We suggest that these mutations define a regulatory region within the leader sequence of the RNA transcript that serves to modulate the translational efficiency of rplJ messenger RNA."

Measurements were also made of the concentrations of LHRH in these tissue fragments and of luteinizing hormone in serum obtained when the rats were killed. Four groups of immature rats were studied: intact, ovariectomized, ovariectomized and implanted with estradiol-containing capsules, and ovariectomized rats primed with estradiol and injected with progesterone. The release of LHRH from the tissue of ovariectomized animals was significantly less than that of intact females and was not modified when the ovariectomized rats received estradiol. However, there was a four- to fivefold increase in LHRH release from tissue of ovariectomized rats primed with estradiol when they were killed 6 hours after they received an injection of progesterone. The concentrations of LHRH in tissue and of luteinizing hormone in serum varied among groups and with the time of day that the animals were killed. The interactions among luteinizing hormone, gonadal steroids, and the photoperiod seem to set the appropriate conditions for neural processes triggering a complete and normal release of luteinizing hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1601366072,"Avidin can be labeled to high specific radioactivity by introducing 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-propionyl groups into the molecule (pHPP-avidin). 125I-pHPP-avidin binds avidly to rat liver plasma membranes and is not displaced by unlabeled pHPP-avidin. Nonspecific binding of 125I-pHPP-avidin can be substantially reduced by succinoylation of pHPP-avidin with succinic anhydride (SpHPP-avidin). Spectral changes ensuing when the dye 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2'-carboxylic acid binds to avidin cannot be used to assess the binding characteristics of the modified avidins since the absorption coefficients of the complexes are markedly different; however, the modified molecules bind theoretical amounts of [14C]biotin. Biotinylinsulin and biotinylinsulinSpHPP-avidin complexes compete with 125I-insulin for binding to receptor sites on rat liver plasma membranes. Biotinylinsulin complexes with unmodified avidin display anomalous binding behavior attributable to formation of membrane aggregates. In light of this finding, results obtained using unmodified avidin must be interpreted with caution. Biotinylinsulin125I-SpHPP-avidin binds specifically and saturably to rat liver plasma membranes. The biotinylhormoneSpHPP-avidin technique has potential for labeling peptide hormones and other compounds that cannot be iodinated by conventional procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1557540738,"Using a protein synthesizing in vitro system programmed with MS2-RNA, the ability of alanine tRNAs with the anticodons U*GC (U* represents 5-oxyacetic acid uridine monophosphate) and IGC to read the alanine codons in the coat protein cistron of MS2 has been determined both under conditions of no competition, where the alanyl-tRNA used was the only aminoacylated tRNAAla present in the system, and in experiments where the two alanyl-tRNAs were competing against each other. Under conditions of no competition, each of the anticodons can read all four alanine codons. However, when the anticodons compete for the codon GCC, the anticodon IGC, which can read all three positions of the codon according to the rules of Watson-Crick base pairing, is considerably more efficient than U*GC, which misreads the codon by reading only the first two positions and presumably disregards the third nucleotide of the codon. The outcome of the competition experiments also reveals two apparent violations of the wobble restrictions: the anticodon U*GC reads the codon GUU almost as effectively as does the anticodon IGC, and IGC is almost as effective as U*GC in reading the codon GCG."

Approximately 40% of the lipid A precursor synthesized under nonpermissive conditions was recovered in the isolated inner (cytoplasmic) membrane fraction, and the rate of translocation to outer membrane in pulse-chase experiments was only 20% that of lipopolysaccharide. However, integration of the incomplete molecule into the outer membrane appeared to be similar to that of lipopolysaccharide in stability and irreversibility. The ultimate extent of translocation pulse-labeled precursor was comparable to that of lipopolysaccharide and the process was functionally unidirectional. Little or no reverse translocation from outer to inner membrane was detected during conversion of preformed lipid A precursor to lipopolysaccharide following return to permissive conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2001336739,"The region immediately following the structural genes of the tryptophan operon in the E. coli chromosome specifies termination of transcription for RNA polymerase. We have precisely characterized eight mutations in this region which were obtained in a selection for readthrough into distally placed lactose operon genes. These mutations are all ultraviolet-induced deletions, ranging in size from 185–900 nucleotide pairs, and all of them relieve transcription termination at the normal site. Unexpectedly, five of the eight have their proximal end-points 12–73 nucleotides past the point of termination of trp mRNA. This suggests that correct termination requires the participation of sequences located at least 70 nucleotides beyond the endpoint of the transcript. There is no evidence for any secondary mutations in the region between trpA and the deletion junctions, and analysis of the mRNA produced in these strains confirms that the observed increase in lac expression is correlated directly with readthrough transcription at the normal punctuation site, as judged by the yield of a unique readthrough oligonucleotide. Examination of 500 nucleotides of wild-type DNA sequence spanning the deleted regions reveals no unusual features beyond a general tendency to AT richness. Since those features of the trp terminator which are common to other regions of transcription termination are not affected by the five distal deletions, however, we must conclude that sequences distal to the endpoint of transcription can also play a crucial role in the proper functioning of termination signals."

https://openalex.org/W1969570424,"Abstract Mating-type switching in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the transposition of a copy of a or α information from unexpressed library genes, HML or HMR , to replace the sequence at the mating type locus, MAT . In normal homothallic strains, where conversions of MAT may occur as often as every cell division, the switching of MAT alleles does not alter the alleles at HML or HMR . We have discovered that several mutations within or adjacent to MAT that impair the excision of the MAT allele permit conversions of the alleles at HML or HMR in more than 1% of the cells analyzed. The two mutations within the MAT locus ( MAT a- inc and MAT α- inc ) can transpose to HML or HMR without being lost at MAT . Thus a MAT α- inc HML α HMR a HO strain can to MAT α- inc HML α HMR α- inc HO . Even though the α- inc and a- inc alleles prevent their own replacement at MAT , these sequences are efficiently transposed back from HML α- inc or HMLa- inc to replace normal MAT alleles. When these alleles reappear at MAT , they are again blocked in excision. Thus the sequences used to remove an allele from MAT must differ from those used to replicate and transpose it. Two cis-acting stk mutations adjacent to MAT that block switching of MAT a to MATα also induce the conversion of HML α to HML a. However, we have previously shown that these events do not occur in strains carrying a recessive switch mutant ( swi1 ) or in strains carrying a defective allele of the HO gene. In stk1 MAT a HO strains, HML α was converted to HML a in approximately 4% of the subclones examined. In contrast, the HML α- inc sequence was not converted in similar stk1 MAT a HO strains. Thus the excision of the α- inc sequence seems to be prevented at both MAT and HML . These results suggest that the illegal conversions of HML and HMR occur by a mechanism similar to that used for normal conversions of MAT ."
https://openalex.org/W1485845300,"Abstract The irreversible inactivation by heat of the F1 and F2 regions of the beta 2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase (L-serine hydrolyase (adding indole) EC 4.2.1.20) has been studied. By comparing the kinetics of inactivation of the F1 and F2 fragments, either isolated by proteolysis or associated within the beta 2 protein, it is shown that the F1 fragment is protected considerably against heat inactivation by its interactions with the complementary F2 fragment. An important stabilization of the protein conformation by the coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is also observed. By using a hybrid enzyme preparation, it is shown that the stabilization by a single pyridoxal 5'-phosphate molecule of the two protomers within beta 2 is likely to be caused by a strengthening of interdomain interactions upon binding of the coenzyme. These results point to a strong energetic coupling between the two domains of the beta chain."
https://openalex.org/W1512925792,"Sea urchin sperm contain an acrosin-like enzyme with an apparent molecular weight of 53,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals two subunits of 34,000 daltons and 18,000 daltons. The Mr = 34,000 subunit is the catalytic entity as revealed both by labeling with [14C]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate and by proteolytic activity after dissociation of the subunits at pH 2.5. Both the 34,000-dalton and the 53,000-dalton forms of the enzyme catalyze the hydrolysis of N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester and both are inactivated by inhibitors of low molecular weight, whereas only the Mr = 34,000 form is inactivated by large proteinaceous inhibitors. Only the Mr = 34,000 form catalyzes proteolysis of denatured lysozyme or the B chain of insulin. The Mr = 18,000 subunit appears to suppress the proteolytic activity but not the activity toward the small ester substrate. These findings are discussed in terms of possible roles of this enzyme in the control of early events leading to fertilization."

The binding of this synthetic ribosome binding site is absolutely dependent upon initiation factor IF3, and the bound fMet-tRNAf is sensitive to puromycin indicating the formation of a functional initiation complex. A heptadecadeoxyribonucleotide, identical with the icosanucleotide but lacking the terminal A-T-G codon, can also stimulate the stable binding of fMet-tRNAf to the ribosome, suggesting that the selection of the proper A-U-G initiation codon by fMet-tRNAf is subsequent to and a result of the recognition and binding of the fMet-tRNAf . 30 S ribosome complex to the initiation site. The prospect of ligating a similar synthetic ribosome binding site in front of a eukaryotic gene for cloning in an appropriate prokaryotic vector to assure the expresion of the protein is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1535308634,"Replacement of 7-azatryptophan for tryptophan in two positions on the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamylase results in changes in the enzyme's homotropic and heterotropic interactions although there is no change in the enzyme's specific activity. The extent of azatryptophan incorporation was quantitated by amino acid analysis which showed that 85% of the tryptophan residues had been replaced. The substituted enzyme is activated by ATP and inhibited by CTP to a greater extent than is the native enzyme. The aspartate saturation curve in the presence of ATP is identical for the two enzymes, but the curve in the presence of CTP and without effectors is shifted toward higher aspartate concentrations for the azatryptophan-substituted enzyme. At low aspartate concentrations, the native enzyme is activated to a greater extent by the substrate analog succinate. These data suggest that the substitution renders the low substrate affinity conformational state of the enzyme less catalytically efficient. This interpretation is in agreement with possible side chain interactions observed in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1625690739,"The incomplete lipid A precursor produced by a mutant conditionally defective in synthesis of 3-deoxy-D-mannoctulosonate (KDO) is rapidly converted to lipopolysaccharide when the mutant culture is shifted from nonpermissive to permissive conditions (Osborn, M.J., Rick, P.D., and Rasmussen, N.S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4246-4251). An intermediate product which accumulates transiently during this conversion has been isolated and identified as a derivative of the lipid A precursor containing 2 residues of KDO. The intermediate lacks the saturated O-fatty acyl chains of the completed lipid A and is indistinguishable in composition and chromatographic properties from the previously described product obtained by enzymatic addition of KDO to isolated lipid A precursor (Munson, R.S., Jr., Rasmussen, N.S., and Osborn, M.J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 1503-1511). The intermediate produced in vivo is rapidly converted to lipopolysaccharide under conditions in which its continued formation is interrupted by return of the culture to nonpermissive temperature. The results provide direct evidence that transfer of KDO to lipid A precedes addition of the saturated fatty acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W2094380498,"During viral development bacteriophage T4 modifies the valyl-transfer RNA synthetase of its host Escherichia coli, but the function of the modification has remained elusive. A strain of Escherichia coli has now been identified which is nonpermissive for wild-type bacteriophage T4, but permissive for bacteriophage mutants impaired in the modification reaction. A comparison with other bacteria suggests that nonpermissiveness is due to synthesis of a thermolabile valyl-transfer RNA synthetase and relaxed control of RNA accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1636069942,"A specific binding of p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside has been measured by flow dialysis with Escherichia coli ML 308225 membrane vesicles containing the lac carrier protein. The number of binding sites, 0.45 nmol/mg of membrane protein, remains unchanged in the presence or absence of energy. On the other hand, increases the M protein affinity for p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside. The dissociation constant (Kd) is 4 and 21 microM in the presence and absence, respectively, of D-lactate. The same energization effects are found with E. coli A3245 membrane vesicles. p-Nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside can be used as a substrate to study energization effect on binding to the lactose permease M protein. These results corroborate observations that energy increases the lac carrier protein affinity for its substrate, and they also confirm the concentration of the M protein, which corresponds to 1.4% of the membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1560983395,"Monovalent Fab fragments from immunoglobulins, directed against Escherichia coli small ribosomal subunit proteins, were tested for their effect on poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenylalanine by rat liver ribosomes. Of the 18 Fabs tested, 3, anti-S10, anti-S12, and anti-S14, inhibited polyphenylalanine synthesis; antibodies against 3 of the 21 E. coli ribosomal proteins (S1, S16, and S17) were not tested. The others were either without any appreciable effect or, as in the case of anti-S11 and anti-S18, inhibited far less. Antibodies against S12 and S14 (but not against S10) inhibited elongation factor 1-dependent binding of [14C]Phe-tRNA to rat liver 80 S ribosomes. The presumption is that the prokaryotic (E. coli) ribosomal proteins, S10, S12, and S14, possess antigenic determinants also present in eukaryotic (rat liver) ribosomal proteins; the rat liver proteins have not yet been identified."
