https://openalex.org/W2115494288,"The genetics of renal cancer is dominated by inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene in clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the commonest histological subtype. A recent large-scale screen of ∼3,500 genes by PCR-based exon re-sequencing identified several new cancer genes in ccRCC including UTX (also known as KDM6A), JARID1C (also known as KDM5C) and SETD2 (ref. 2). These genes encode enzymes that demethylate (UTX, JARID1C) or methylate (SETD2) key lysine residues of histone H3. Modification of the methylation state of these lysine residues of histone H3 regulates chromatin structure and is implicated in transcriptional control. However, together these mutations are present in fewer than 15% of ccRCC, suggesting the existence of additional, currently unidentified cancer genes. Here, we have sequenced the protein coding exome in a series of primary ccRCC and report the identification of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene PBRM1 (ref. 4) as a second major ccRCC cancer gene, with truncating mutations in 41% (92/227) of cases. These data further elucidate the somatic genetic architecture of ccRCC and emphasize the marked contribution of aberrant chromatin biology."

Essentially no attention was given to their possible effects on the stability of the system as a whole. Drawing analogies with the dynamics of ecological food webs and with networks within which infectious diseases spread, we explore the interplay between complexity and stability in deliberately simplified models of financial networks. We suggest some policy lessons that can be drawn from such models, with the explicit aim of minimizing systemic risk."

https://openalex.org/W2025836692,"Recent studies of transcription have revealed a level of complexity not previously appreciated even a few years ago, both in the intricate use of post-initiation control and the mass production of rapidly degraded transcripts. Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, NET-seq), based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with RNA polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of NET-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the Rpd3S deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2140494588,"The ability to direct functional proteins to specific DNA sequences is a long-sought goal in the study and engineering of biological processes. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) from Xanthomonas sp. are site-specific DNA-binding proteins that can be readily designed to target new sequences. Because TALEs contain a large number of repeat domains, it can be difficult to synthesize new variants. Here we describe a method that overcomes this problem. We leverage codon degeneracy and type IIs restriction enzymes to generate orthogonal ligation linkers between individual repeat monomers, thus allowing full-length, customized, repeat domains to be constructed by hierarchical ligation. We synthesized 17 TALEs that are customized to recognize specific DNA-binding sites, and demonstrate that they can specifically modulate transcription of endogenous genes (SOX2 and KLF4) in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W1964022123,"The mature capsids of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other retroviruses are fullerene shells, composed of the viral CA protein, that enclose the viral genome and facilitate its delivery into new host cells. Retroviral CA proteins contain independently folded amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) that are connected by a flexible linker. The NTD forms either hexameric or pentameric rings, whereas the CTD forms symmetric homodimers that connect the rings into a hexagonal lattice. We previously used a disulphide crosslinking strategy to enable isolation and crystallization of soluble HIV-1 CA hexamers. Here we use the same approach to solve the X-ray structure of the HIV-1 CA pentamer at 2.5 Å resolution. Two mutant CA proteins with engineered disulphides at different positions (P17C/T19C and N21C/A22C) converged onto the same quaternary structure, indicating that the disulphide-crosslinked proteins recapitulate the structure of the native pentamer. Assembly of the quasi-equivalent hexamers and pentamers requires remarkably subtle rearrangements in subunit interactions, and appears to be controlled by an electrostatic switch that favours hexamers over pentamers. This study completes the gallery of substructures describing the components of the HIV-1 capsid and enables atomic-level modelling of the complete capsid. Rigid-body rotations around two assembly interfaces appear sufficient to generate the full range of continuously varying lattice curvature in the fullerene cone."

Glenn Merlino and colleagues now show, in a mouse model, that UVB irradiation induces the recruitment of macrophages that produce interferon-γ to promote melanoma formation. The study suggests that agents that target interferon-γ may have therapeutic potential in patients with melanoma. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure has been implicated in melanoma formation. Here it is shown, in a mouse model, that UVB induces the recruitment of macrophages which produce interferon-γ to promote melanomagenesis. The study suggests that in melanomas, interferon-γ could be targeted therapeutically. Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive and frequently chemoresistant cancer, the incidence of which continues to rise. Epidemiological studies show that the major aetiological melanoma risk factor is ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation, with the highest risk associated with intermittent burning doses, especially during childhood1,2. We have experimentally validated these epidemiological findings using the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor transgenic mouse model, which develops lesions in stages highly reminiscent of human melanoma with respect to biological, genetic and aetiological criteria, but only when irradiated as neonatal pups with UVB, not UVA3,4. However, the mechanisms underlying UVB-initiated, neonatal-specific melanomagenesis remain largely unknown. Here we introduce a mouse model permitting fluorescence-aided melanocyte imaging and isolation following in vivo UV irradiation. We use expression profiling to show that activated neonatal skin melanocytes isolated following a melanomagenic UVB dose bear a distinct, persistent interferon response signature, including genes associated with immunoevasion. UVB-induced melanocyte activation, characterized by aberrant growth and migration, was abolished by antibody-mediated systemic blockade of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), but not type-I interferons. IFN-γ was produced by macrophages recruited to neonatal skin by UVB-induced ligands to the chemokine receptor Ccr2. Admixed recruited skin macrophages enhanced transplanted melanoma growth by inhibiting apoptosis; notably, IFN-γ blockade abolished macrophage-enhanced melanoma growth and survival. IFN-γ-producing macrophages were also identified in 70% of human melanomas examined. Our data reveal an unanticipated role for IFN-γ in promoting melanocytic cell survival/immunoevasion, identifying a novel candidate therapeutic target for a subset of melanoma patients."

https://openalex.org/W1993671841,"The masses of supermassive black holes are known to correlate with the properties of the bulge components of their host galaxies. In contrast, they seem not to correlate with galaxy disks. Disk-grown 'pseudobulges' are intermediate in properties between bulges and disks; it has been unclear whether they do or do not correlate with black holes in the same way that bulges do. At stake in this issue are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve with black holes, possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes. Here we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamically detected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocity dispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies. These data confirm that black holes do not correlate with disks and show that they correlate little or not at all with pseudobulges. We suggest that there are two different modes of black-hole feeding. Black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergers drive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. In contrast, small black holes in bulgeless galaxies and in galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-level Seyfert galaxies. Growth of the former is driven by global processes, so the biggest black holes coevolve with bulges, but growth of the latter is driven locally and stochastically, and they do not coevolve with disks and pseudobulges."

A cell-free ECM was prepared from cultured femoral marrow cells from either 3- or 18-mo-old C57BL/6 mice (young-ECM or old-ECM, respectively). The replication and osteo-genesis of young or old MSCs maintained on young-ECM vs. old-ECM as well as plastic were examined in vitro and in vivo. We found that the frequency of MSCs in marrow from old mice, measured by colony-forming cells, was only marginally lower than that of young mice. In contrast, defects in the self-renewal and bone formation capacity of old MSCs were remarkable. These defects were corrected by provision of a young-ECM but not old-ECM. In parallel cultures maintained on a young-ECM, the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species from both old and young mice were reduced 30–50% compared to those maintained on old-ECM or plastic. We concluded that aging negatively affects the formation of an ECM that normally preserves MSC function, and aged MSCs can be rejuvenated by culture on a young-ECM.—Sun, Y., Li, W., Lu, Z., Chen, Z., Ling, J., Ran, O., Jilka, R.

https://openalex.org/W1988875291,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Inflammatory activity within the stroma of invasive colorectal tumours is known to be a key predictor of disease activity with type, density and location of immune cells impacting on patient prognosis. To date, there has been no report of inflammatory phenotype within pre-malignant human colonic adenomas. Assessing the stromal microenvironment and particularly, inflammatory activity within colorectal neoplastic lesions is central to understanding early colorectal carcinogenesis. Inflammatory cell infiltrate was assessed by immunohistochemistry in paired colonic adenoma and adjacent normal colonic mucosa samples, and adenomas exhibiting increasing degrees of epithelial cell dysplasia. Macrophage phenotype was assessed using double stain immunohistochemistry incorporating expression of an intracellular enzyme of function. A targeted array of inflammatory cytokine and receptor genes, validated by RT-PCR, was used to assess inflammatory gene expression. Inflammatory cell infiltrates are a key feature of sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps with increased macrophage, neutrophil and T cell (specifically helper and activated subsets) infiltration in adenomatous colonic polyps, that increases in association with characteristics of high malignant potential, namely, increasing degree of cell dysplasia and adenoma size. Macrophages within adenomas express iNOS, suggestive of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Several inflammatory cytokine genes (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL20, IL8, CCL23, CCL19, CCL21, CCL5) are dysregulated in adenomas. This study has provided evidence of increased inflammation within pre-malignant colonic adenomas. This may allow potential mechanistic pathways in the initiation and promotion of early colorectal carcinogenesis to be identified."

Spin ensembles, such as those used in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance4,5, have been important for the development of quantum control methods. However, these demonstrations contain no entanglement and ultimately constitute classical simulations of quantum algorithms. Here we report the on-demand generation of entanglement between an ensemble of electron and nuclear spins in isotopically engineered, phosphorus-doped silicon. We combined high-field (3.4 T), low-temperature (2.9 K) electron spin resonance with hyperpolarization of the 31P nuclear spin to obtain an initial state of sufficient purity to create a non-classical, inseparable state. The state was verified using density matrix tomography based on geometric phase gates, and had a fidelity of 98% relative to the ideal state at this field and temperature. The entanglement operation was performed simultaneously, with high fidelity, on 1010 spin pairs; this fulfils one of the essential requirements for a silicon-based quantum information processor."
https://openalex.org/W2021979046,"Supermassive black holes have been detected in all galaxies that contain bulge components when the galaxies observed were close enough so that the searches were feasible. Together with the observation that bigger black holes live in bigger bulges, this has led to the belief that black hole growth and bulge formation regulate each other. That is, black holes and bulges ""coevolve"". Therefore, reports of a similar correlation between black holes and the dark matter halos in which visible galaxies are embedded have profound implications. Dark matter is likely to be nonbaryonic, so these reports suggest that unknown, exotic physics controls black hole growth. Here we show - based in part on recent measurements of bulgeless galaxies - that there is almost no correlation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unless the galaxy also contains a bulge. We conclude that black holes do not correlate directly with dark matter. They do not correlate with galaxy disks, either. Therefore black holes coevolve only with bulges. This simplifies the puzzle of their coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in the galaxy mergers that make bulges."
https://openalex.org/W2015111017,"Background and Aims Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that is induced by dietary wheat gluten proteins (gliadins) in genetically predisposed individuals. The overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and infections has been suggested to contribute to CD pathogenesis. We aimed to study the effects of gliadin and various intestinal bacterial strains on mucosal barrier integrity, gliadin translocation, and cytokine production. Methodology/Principal Findings Changes in gut mucosa were assessed in the intestinal loops of inbred Wistar-AVN rats that were reared under germ-free conditions in the presence of various intestinal bacteria (enterobacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from CD patients and healthy children, respectively) and CD-triggering agents (gliadin and IFN-γ) by histology, scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and a rat cytokine antibody array. Adhesion of the bacterial strains to the IEC-6 rat cell line was evaluated in vitro. Gliadin fragments alone or together with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ significantly decreased the number of goblet cells in the small intestine; this effect was more pronounced in the presence of Escherichia coli CBL2 and Shigella CBD8. Shigella CBD8 and IFN-γ induced the highest mucin secretion and greatest impairment in tight junctions and, consequently, translocation of gliadin fragments into the lamina propria. Shigella CBD8 and E. coli CBL2 strongly adhered to IEC-6 epithelial cells. The number of goblet cells in small intestine increased by the simultaneous incubation of Bifidobacterium bifidum IATA-ES2 with gliadin, IFN-γ and enterobacteria. B. bifidum IATA-ES2 also enhanced the production of chemotactic factors and inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which can contribute to gut mucosal protection. Conclusions Our results suggest that the composition of the intestinal microbiota affects the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and, consequently, could be involved in the early stages of CD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2077522548,"Mediterranean-type ecosystems constitute one of the rarest terrestrial biomes and yet they are extraordinarily biodiverse. Home to over 250 million people, the five regions where these ecosystems are found have climate and coastal conditions that make them highly desirable human habitats. The current conservation landscape does not reflect the mediterranean biome's rarity and its importance for plant endemism. Habitat conversion will clearly outpace expansion of formal protected-area networks, and conservationists must augment this traditional strategy with new approaches to sustain the mediterranean biota. Using regional scale datasets, we determine the area of land in each of the five regions that is protected, converted (e.g., to urban or industrial), impacted (e.g., intensive, cultivated agriculture), or lands that we consider to have conservation potential. The latter are natural and semi-natural lands that are unprotected (e.g., private range lands) but sustain numerous native species and associated habitats. Chile has the greatest proportion of its land (75%) in this category and California-Mexico the least (48%). To illustrate the potential for achieving mediterranean biodiversity conservation on these lands, we use species-area curves generated from ecoregion scale data on native plant species richness and vertebrate species richness. For example, if biodiversity could be sustained on even 25% of existing unprotected, natural and semi-natural lands, we estimate that the habitat of more than 6,000 species could be represented. This analysis suggests that if unprotected natural and semi-natural lands are managed in a manner that allows for persistence of native species, we can realize significant additional biodiversity gains. Lasting biodiversity protection at the scale needed requires unprecedented collaboration among stakeholders to promote conservation both inside and outside of traditional protected areas, including on lands where people live and work."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of S1P receptors in a non-T-cell model of demyelination, the cuprizone (cupr) model in C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) led to attenuated injury to OLGs, myelin, and axons in the corpus callosum (percentage of myelinated fibers was 44.7% in cupr-water and 63% in cupr-FTY720). Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were ameliorated when FTY720 was given from d 1, but astrogliosis was augmented when FTY720 was given from wk 4–9. FTY720 did not promote remyelination in this model. The protective effect of FTY720 was associated with decreased interleukin-1 β and CCL2 transcripts in the corpus callosum, as well as altered S1P1 expression. Targeted deletion of S1P1 in OLG lineage cells did not lead to obvious clinical phenotype, but resulted in subtle abnormalities in myelin and an increased susceptibility to cupr-induced demyelination. We conclude that S1P receptors expressed by neuroglia are involved in regulating the response to injury, and CNS effects of FTY720 could contribute to its favorable therapeutic response in multiple sclerosis.—Kim, H.

https://openalex.org/W2094354684,"O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has been identified as a potential prognostic marker for glioblastoma patients. The relationship between the exact site of promoter methylation and its effect on gene silencing, and the patient's subsequent response to therapy, is still being defined. The aim of this study was to comprehensively characterize cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide methylation across the entire MGMT promoter and to correlate individual CpG site methylation patterns to mRNA expression, protein expression, and progression-free survival. To best identify the specific MGMT promoter region most predictive of gene silencing and response to therapy, we determined the methylation status of all 97 CpG sites in the MGMT promoter in tumor samples from 70 GBM patients using quantitative bisulfite sequencing. We next identified the CpG site specific and regional methylation patterns most predictive of gene silencing and improved progression-free survival. Using this data, we propose a new classification scheme utilizing methylation data from across the entire promoter and show that an analysis based on this approach, which we call 3R classification, is predictive of progression-free survival (HR = 5.23, 95% CI [2.089–13.097], p<0.0001). To adapt this approach to the clinical setting, we used a methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) test based on the 3R classification and show that this test is both feasible in the clinical setting and predictive of progression free survival (HR = 3.076, 95% CI [1.301–7.27], p = 0.007). We discuss the potential advantages of a test based on this promoter-wide analysis and compare it to the commonly used methylation-specific PCR test. Further prospective validation of these two methods in a large independent patient cohort will be needed to confirm the added value of promoter wide analysis of MGMT methylation in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2146233615,"Background The mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is the principal vector of the Dengue and yellow fever viruses. During feeding, an adult female can take up more than its own body weight in vertebrate blood. After a blood meal females excrete large amounts of urine through their excretion system, the Malpighian tubules (MT). Diuresis starts within seconds after the mosquito starts feeding. Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane transporters that regulate the flow of water, glycerol and other small molecules across cellular membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Our aim was to identify aquaporins that function as water channels, mediating transcellular water transport in MTs of adult female Ae. aegypti. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a bioinformatics approach we screened genome databases and identified six putative AQPs in the genome of Ae. aegypti. Phylogenetic analysis showed that five of the six Ae. aegypti AQPs have high similarity to classical water-transporting AQPs of vertebrates. Using microarray, reverse transcription and real time PCR analysis we found that all six AQPs are expressed in distinct patterns in mosquito tissues/body parts. AaAQP1, 4, and 5 are strongly expressed in the adult female MT. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the MT-expressed mosquito AQPs resulted in significantly reduced diuresis. Conclusions/Significance Our results support the notion that AQP1, 4, and 5 function as water transporters in the MTs of adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Our results demonstrate the importance of these AQPs for mosquito diuresis after blood ingestion and highlight their potential as targets for the development of novel vector control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2126176177,"Oxidative stress induces neuronal apoptosis and is implicated in cerebral ischemia, head trauma, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. An early step in this process is the loss of intracellular K(+) via K(+) channels, and evidence indicates that K(v)2.1 is of particular importance in this regard, being rapidly inserted into the plasma membrane in response to apoptotic stimuli. An additional feature of neuronal oxidative stress is the up-regulation of the inducible enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catabolizes heme to generate biliverdin, Fe(2+), and carbon monoxide (CO). CO provides neuronal protection against stresses such as stroke and excitotoxicity, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that CO reversibly inhibits K(v)2.1. Channel inhibition by CO involves reactive oxygen species and protein kinase G activity. Overexpression of K(v)2.1 in HEK293 cells increases their vulnerability to oxidant-induced apoptosis, and this is reversed by CO. In hippocampal neurons, CO selectively inhibits K(v)2.1, reverses the dramatic oxidant-induced increase in K(+) current density, and provides marked protection against oxidant-induced apoptosis. Our results provide a novel mechanism to account for the neuroprotective effects of CO against oxidative apoptosis, which has potential for therapeutic exploitation to provide neuronal protection in situations of oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W1980922145,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by low survival motor neuron (SMN) levels and patients represent a clinical spectrum due primarily to varying copies of the survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) gene. Patient and animals studies show that disease severity is abrogated as SMN levels increase. Since therapies currently being pursued target the induction of SMN, it will be important to understand the dosage, timing and cellular requirements of SMN for disease etiology and potential therapeutic intervention. This requires new mouse models that can induce SMN temporally and/or spatially. Here we describe the generation of two hypomorphic Smn alleles, Smn(C-T-Neo) and Smn(2B-Neo). These alleles mimic SMN2 exon 7 splicing, titre Smn levels and are inducible. They were specifically designed so that up to three independent lines of mice could be generated, herein we describe two. In a homozygous state each allele results in embryonic lethality. Analysis of these mutants indicates that greater than 5% of Smn protein is required for normal development. The severe hypomorphic nature of these alleles is caused by inclusion of a loxP-flanked neomycin gene selection cassette in Smn intron 7, which can be removed with Cre recombinase. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate these as inducible Smn alleles. When combined with an inducible Cre mouse, embryonic lethality caused by low Smn levels can be rescued early in gestation but not late. This provides direct genetic evidence that a therapeutic window for SMN inductive therapies may exist. Importantly, these lines fill a void for inducible Smn alleles. They also provide a base from which to generate a large repertoire of SMA models of varying disease severities when combined with other Smn alleles or SMN2-containing mice."

A variety of HDACi, including sodium butyrate (NaB), valproic acid (VPA), trichostatin A (TSA), and apicidin have been found to reverse the transformed state of cancer cells and inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor types, although little is known about the biological function of individual HDACs (15Ginsburg E.

In this study, we find that HDAC9 and HDAC10 activity is required in HeLa cells for homology-directed repair of DNA double strand breaks. This result was surprising because we had anticipated that HDAC activity would compress chromatin and impede the repair process. The HeLa-DR-13-9 (HeLa-DR) cells have been described before (24Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 25Ransburgh D.J. Chiba N. Ishioka C. Toland A.E. Parvin J.D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the standard culturing methods were used. The HDAC inhibitors were procured as follows: TSA, apicidin, valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid), and NaB were from Sigma-Aldrich. The siRNA sequences for the HDACs are listed in supplemental Table S1. The HDAC9 antibody has been described previously (26Petrie K. Guidez F. Howell L. Healy L. Waxman S. Greaves M. Zelent A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16059-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On day 1, we plated HeLa-DR cells (∼2 × 105 in a 10-cm2 well). The next day, the 50% confluent wells were transfected with 3 μg of pCBASceI plasmid while simultaneously adding the HDAC inhibitors. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as the transfection agent, and Opti-MEM was used as the dilution medium. The inhibitors were added to obtain the following final concentrations: TSA (300 nm), apicidin (10 μm), valproic acid (2 mm), and NaB (10 mm). The transfection medium was replaced 6 h after transfection, and the inhibitors were added again for a total of 24 h. On day 5 (96 h after transfection), the cells were trypsinized, and those among 10,000 total cells that expressed green fluorescence were measured using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur instrument in the Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center Analytical Flow Cytometry core laboratory. For the experiment with HDAC depletion by RNA interference, we performed two rounds of transfection. On day 1, we plated HeLa-DR cells (4 × 104 in a 2-cm2 well). On day 2, we performed the first transfection with 60 pmol of siRNA with 1.5 μl of Oligofectamine. On day 3, the cells were transferred to 10-cm2-well dishes. On day 4, we co-transfected 100 pmol of siRNA with 3 μg of pCBASCeI expression vector. On day 7, the cells were analyzed by FACs as above. For the assay with HDAC inhibitors, the cells were pretreated with the inhibitors at the following final concentrations: TSA (300 nm), apicidin (10 μm), VPA (2 mm), and NaB (10 mm) for a total of 24 h. A total of 2000 cells were plated in triplicate per treatment and subjected to 0, 50, and 100 ng of mitomycin C each for 4 h. Medium was then replaced, and cells were allowed to proliferate into colonies for 2 weeks. At the end of that period, the colonies were stained with 0.01% crystal violet solution and then counted. HeLa-DR cells were pretreated with the inhibitors at the following final concentrations: TSA (300 nm), apicidin (10 μm), VPA (2 mm), and NaB (10 mm), or cells were depleted of HDAC9 or HDAC10 by RNAi. At time intervals of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, cells were harvested and fixed with 70% chilled ethanol for 1 h. Cells were treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) and stained with propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 h. Cell cycle distribution was then measured by FACs, which measures DNA content. Comparison of each treatment with control was tested by applying a pairwise t test. Linear trend analysis across the dose level was performed by applying a linear model. For the mitomycin C (MMC) assay, at the 50 and 100 ng/ml dose levels, comparison of each treatment with control was tested by applying a pairwise t test. All the data were log 2-transformed before applying t tests. We began this study by searching for genes with expression levels in microarray results that would reflect coordinate regulation with BRCA1, BRCA2, and BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1) (27Pujana M.A. Han J.D. Starita L.M. Stevens K.N. Tewari M. Ahn J.S. Rennert G. Moreno V. Kirchhoff T. Gold B. Assmann V. Elshamy W.M. Rual J.F. Levine D. Rozek L.S. Gelman R.S. Gunsalus K.C. Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B.

Genet. 2007; 39: 1338-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We found that many HDACs were among those genes co-regulated in microarray datasets with these three genes important in breast cancer and in DNA double strand break repair (data not shown). We tested the role of HDACs in HDR in a tissue culture-based assay and were surprised to find that one or more HDACs were required for the homologous recombination process. We have cloned a HeLa-derived cell line (25Ransburgh D.J. Chiba N. Ishioka C. Toland A.E. Parvin J.D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that includes the homologous recombination substrate previously developed (24Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 28Nakanishi K. Yang Y.G. Pierce A.J. Taniguchi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z.Q. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The cell line, called HeLa-DR (25Ransburgh D.J. Chiba N. Ishioka C. Toland A.E. Parvin J.D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), contains in its genome two inactive alleles of GFP. One of the alleles has an 18-bp I-SceI restriction endonuclease site. Expression in these cells of the I-SceI endonuclease results in a single double strand break in one inactive GFP allele, and homologous recombination using sequences in the second allele will result in gene conversion to produce a functional GFP gene. Homologous recombination events are readily scored by flow cytometry of cells. We tested the HDAC inhibitors TSA, apicidin, VPA, and NaB. We anticipated that these chemicals would result in hyperacetylation and opening of the chromatin facilitating the repair. To test this, we transfected the endonuclease I-SceI-expressing plasmid in the presence of the HDACi, and 6 h later, we washed out the transfection mix and added back the HDACi for another 18 h. Cells were incubated in the absence of HDACi for an additional 2 days. Contrary to our expectation, we found that treatment of cells with three of these HDACi compounds resulted in potent inhibition of homologous recombination. With the exception of VPA, significant decreases in levels of homologous recombination were detected on treatment with the inhibitors (Fig. 1A). This inhibitory effect of the HDACi was independent of BRCA1 depletion (data not shown). The inhibition of HDR by the HDACi was dosage-dependent and was up to 11-fold decreased in homologous recombination activity. This level of decrease in the HDR assay was comparable with the loss of activity observed after depletion of BRCA1 by RNAi (Fig. 1B). This result clearly shows that HDACs may play a role in homologous recombination and inhibiting them consequently blocks homology-directed repair. It was striking that VPA was not effective in inhibiting homologous recombination, whereas the other three HDACi tested were. The VPA was effective in other assays because treatment of cells with VPA did result in hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 as detected by immunoblotting and by Triton acid urea gel electrophoresis of purified histones (data not shown). We inferred from this specificity of different HDACi in inhibiting the HDR assay that a subset of the different HDACs regulated this process. The next step was to determine which of the HDACs were required for homologous recombination activity. The HDAC inhibitors used broadly inhibit Class I, II, and IV HDACs (28Nakanishi K. Yang Y.G. Pierce A.J. Taniguchi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z.Q. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These classes include HDACs 1 through 11 but do not include the sirtuins (29Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Thus, HDACs 1 through 11 were each depleted by RNA interference. The siRNAs for each of these HDACs were culled from the literature, and the sequences and references are listed in supplemental Table S1. The HDACs most commonly associated with transcriptional corepressor complexes, HDAC1 and HDAC2 (30Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), had a modest inhibitory effect on homologous recombination (Fig. 1B). Depletion of HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC8, and HDAC11 had no significant effect on homologous recombination activity. Of all the HDACs, depletion of HDAC9 and HDAC10 significantly decreased homologous recombination (Fig. 1B). On noting an initial effect, we tested three siRNAs each for HDAC9 and HDAC10. HDAC9 depletion had the stronger effect, with siRNA-1 decreasing homology-directed repair almost 3-fold and HDAC10 siRNA-2 having a 2.5-fold effect. Because we used three siRNAs targeting distinct sequences for each HDAC9 and HDAC10 and all of these resulted in significantly decreased homologous recombination activity, the inhibition is unlikely to be due to any off-target effects of the siRNA. We tested for depletion of the HDAC proteins by immunoblot analysis. In those cases in which the commercial antibody did not stain a specific band on immunoblot analysis, we quantified the HDAC mRNA by RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). We detected decreased HDAC protein or mRNA abundance in each case. In some cases, the depletion in the HDAC was modest, and this included both HDAC9 and HDAC10, both of which had the largest effect on the HDR assay. Because the level of protein or mRNA depletion was not complete in each case, we posit that the inhibition of the HDR assay by the HDACi compounds was more complete and thus inhibited the process more than 10-fold, but the siRNA treatment yielded more modest effects. We also tested whether simultaneous depletion of HDAC9 and HDAC10, or a variety of simultaneous depletions, would additively inhibit homologous recombination. However, in each case, there was no change in the levels of homologous recombination (data not shown). To corroborate the results from the HDR assay, we tested whether inhibition of HDACs or depletion of HDAC9 or HDAC10 decreased the resistance of cells to the interstrand cross-linker, MMC. Sensitivity to MMC often correlates with inhibition of the HDR assay (31Moynahan M.E. Cui T.Y. Jasin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4842-4850PubMed Google Scholar, 32Westermark U.K. Reyngold M. Olshen A.B. Baer R. Jasin M. Moynahan M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7926-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We performed a clonogenic assay upon treatment of HeLa-DR cells with the HDAC inhibitors. Pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitors, apicidin and NaB, significantly sensitized cells as compared with the control. Although TSA strongly inhibited the HDR assay, its effect on sensitizing cells to MMC was modest and not statistically significant. VPA had no effect, and this was consistent with the results obtained in the HDR assay (Fig. 2A). We tested depletion of HDAC9 and HDAC10 on resistance to MMC. After two rounds of siRNA transfections targeting HDAC9 or HDAC10, cells were plated, and MMC was added to the cells for 4 h. As compared with the control siRNA transfection, HDAC9-depleted and also HDAC10-depleted cells were more sensitive to MMC as seen by decreased colony survival. Similar effects on cell survival were seen with all three different siRNAs for both HDAC9 and HDAC10 (Fig. 2, B and C). In each case, the S.E. did not overlap with the control sample, although when applying the pairwise t test, only the results from HDAC9 siRNA-1 at 50 ng/ml MMC were significant. For HDAC10, the results from HDAC10 siRNA-1 and siRNA-3 were significant at 50 ng/ml MMC. As with the HDR assay, the effects of the apicidin and NaB had greater magnitude than did the depletion of the HDAC9 or HDAC10, but the results were consistent. It has been shown in some studies that HDAC inhibitors block the cell cycle in different phases (33Yuan Z. Seto E. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2869-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the effect of the inhibitors and HDAC9 or HDAC10 depletion on homology-directed repair is indirect via a cell cycle block. We treated HeLa-DR cells with the HDAC inhibitors TSA (300 nm), apicidin (10 μm), VPA (2 mm), and NaB (10 mm) for varying intervals of time: 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. At each of these time points, cells were collected, fixed, and then stained with propidium iodide. We note that the 24-h time point correlates with the time at which the HDR assay was done. Flow cytometry results revealed that TSA- and VPA-treated cells had a normal cell cycle progression at all time intervals as compared with control cells. Fig. 3A shows the results from 24 h of HDACi treatment. Apicidin- and NaB-treated cells, at 24 h, had a decrease in S-phase cells as evidenced by a decrease in the numbers of cells with DNA content between the 2n (unreplicated DNA) and 4n (fully replicated DNA) peaks. Because the TSA treatment did not affect the cell cycle but did inhibit the HDR assay, then its effect on the homologous recombination process is not secondary to a cell cycle block. Whether HDAC9 or HDAC10 depletion impacted progression through the cell cycle was tested. Using the same timing as used in the HDR assay, siRNAs specific to HDAC9 and HDAC10 were transfected into HeLa-DR cells; after 48 h, the transfection was repeated, and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the second transfection, cells were collected for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. HDAC9 as well as HDAC10 depletion had no discernible effect on cell cycle progression at 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3, B and C) and at 48, 72, and 96 h (data not shown). Therefore, the effect of HDAC9 and HDAC10 depletions on the double strand break repair process is not attributed to a cell cycle block but to a direct activity required for the repair process. In this study, we have established a role for HDAC9 and HDAC10 in the homologous recombination process. We used a tissue culture-based homology-directed repair assay in which repair of a specific double-stranded break by homologous recombination converts an inactive GFP allele to active GFP. Contrary to our expectation, three of the HDACi reduced homologous recombination levels significantly. Next, we found that only HDAC9 and HDAC10 depletions resulted in a large defect in homologous recombination activity. This effect was observed with multiple siRNAs for each HDAC9 and HDAC10. The requirement for HDAC9 and HDAC10 in the homologous recombination process was not indirect via blocking the cell cycle progression in an inappropriate point in the cycle. Rather, our results suggest that HDAC9 and HDAC10 are direct participants in the process. Initial attempts to test whether HDAC9 localizes at the site of damage were inconclusive. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that HDAC9 protein is diffusely nuclear, and following ionizing radiation, it remained diffusely nuclear and did not relocalize to foci containing γ-H2AX (supplemental Fig. S2). The HDAC9 was present at the DNA repair foci, but it did not concentrate at the foci after DNA damage. Thus, we cannot rule out that it could be acting indirectly, perhaps via transcriptional regulation. We were unable to carry out localization studies on HDAC10 due to lack of an effective antibody. HDAC9 has been described as a co-repressor of myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2), which represses the expression of myocyte-specific genes (34Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). HDAC9 also interacts with the NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor 1) corepressor complex (36Guidez F. Zelent A. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 165-185PubMed Google Scholar). HDAC10 has also been found in complex with transcriptional repressors (37Fischer D.D. Cai R. Bhatia U. Asselbergs F.A. Song C. Terry R. Trogani N. Widmer R. Atadja P. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6656-6666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Lai I.L. Lin T.P. Yao Y.L. Lin C.Y. Hsieh M.J. Yang W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7187-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because we would expect a transcriptional response required for DNA repair to be stimulatory, as opposed to the transcriptional repressive activity of HDAC9 or HDAC10, it is more likely that HDAC9 or HDAC10 is a direct participant at the site of DNA damage in the homologous recombination process rather than indirect via transcriptional control. Because these histone deacetylases are stimulatory to the homologous recombination process rather than repressive, we feel the most likely scenario is that these histone deacetylases execute an important deacetylation reaction at the site of damage. Current experiments are aimed at finding the critical substrate of this reaction. A study had shown that treatment with the HDACi PCI-24781 could inhibit homologous recombination via decreased levels of RAD51 protein (39Adimoolam S. Sirisawad M. Chen J. Thiemann P. Ford J.M. Buggy J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19482-19487Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We tested whether the activities of HDAC9 and HDAC10 affect RAD51 levels. We observed modest increases, not decreases, in levels of RAD51 protein upon HDAC9 or HDAC10 depletion (supplemental Fig. S3). This result is inconsistent with an anticipated indirect effect on homologous recombination of the HDAC9 or HDAC10 proteins via regulation of the expression of other known DNA repair factors. While we were preparing this manuscript, a recent study was published that found a role for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) via specific deacetylations on H3K56 and H4K16 (40Miller K.M. Tjeertes J.V. Coates J. Legube G. Polo S.E. Britton S. Jackson S.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). HDAC1 and HDAC2 depletion increased levels of H3K56Ac at sites of damage and increased DNA damage response signaling. Another study led to the discovery that inhibition of HDAC3 impairs both homologous recombination and NHEJ (41Bhaskara S. Knutson S.K. Jiang G. Chandrasekharan M.B. Wilson A.J. Zheng S. Yenamandra A. Locke K. Yuan J.L. Bonine-Summers A.R. Wells C.E. Kaiser J.F. Washington M.K. Zhao Z. Wagner F.F. Sun Z.W. Xia F. Holson E.B. Khabele D. Hiebert S.W. Cancer Cell. 2010; 18: 436-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, in our study, depletion of HDAC3 did not affect homologous recombination, and this could be attributed to differences in cell lines. Yet another investigation highlighted the importance of SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1), a Class III HDAC, for homologous recombination via Werner syndrome (WRN) helicase (42Uhl M. Csernok A. Aydin S. Kreienberg R. Wiesmüller L. Gatz S.A. DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We did not pursue this because our HDACi do not affect Class III HDACs (29Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). In light of all this recent evidence, it is now becoming increasingly apparent that HDACs regulate DNA repair on chromatin. Different HDACs regulate different repair processes: HDAC1 and HDAC2 regulate NHEJ, and HDAC9 and HDAC10 regulate homologous recombination.

https://openalex.org/W2010313933,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition associated with weakness, fatigue, and reduced functional capacity. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) transcription factors play a critical role in atrophy. Knockout of genes encoding p50 or the NF-κB co-transactivator, Bcl-3, abolish disuse atrophy and thus they are NF-κB factors required for disuse atrophy. We do not know however, the genes targeted by NF-κB that produce the atrophied phenotype. Here we identify the genes required to produce disuse atrophy using gene expression profiling in wild type compared to Nfkb1 (gene encodes p50) and Bcl-3 deficient mice. There were 185 and 240 genes upregulated in wild type mice due to unloading, that were not upregulated in Nfkb1⁻/⁻ and Bcl-3⁻/⁻ mice, respectively, and so these genes were considered direct or indirect targets of p50 and Bcl-3. All of the p50 gene targets were contained in the Bcl-3 gene target list. Most genes were involved with protein degradation, signaling, translation, transcription, and transport. To identify direct targets of p50 and Bcl-3 we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of selected genes previously shown to have roles in atrophy. Trim63 (MuRF1), Fbxo32 (MAFbx), Ubc, Ctsl, Runx1, Tnfrsf12a (Tweak receptor), and Cxcl10 (IP-10) showed increased Bcl-3 binding to κB sites in unloaded muscle and thus were direct targets of Bcl-3. p50 binding to the same sites on these genes either did not change or increased, supporting the idea of p50:Bcl-3 binding complexes. p65 binding to κB sites showed decreased or no binding to these genes with unloading. Fbxo9, Psma6, Psmc4, Psmg4, Foxo3, Ankrd1 (CARP), and Eif4ebp1 did not show changes in p65, p50, or Bcl-3 binding to κB sites, and so were considered indirect targets of p50 and Bcl-3. This work represents the first study to use a global approach to identify genes required to produce the atrophied phenotype with disuse."
https://openalex.org/W2090499182,"The ten mouse and six human members of the Schlafen (Slfn) gene family all contain an AAA domain. Little is known of their function, but previous studies suggest roles in immune cell development. In this report, we assessed Slfn regulation and function in macrophages, which are key cellular regulators of innate immunity.Multiple members of the Slfn family were up-regulated in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) by the Toll-like Receptor (TLR)4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the TLR3 agonist Poly(I∶C), and in disease-affected joints in the collagen-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis. Of these, the most inducible was Slfn4. TLR agonists that signal exclusively through the MyD88 adaptor protein had more modest effects on Slfn4 mRNA levels, thus implicating MyD88-independent signalling and autocrine interferon (IFN)-β in inducible expression. This was supported by the substantial reduction in basal and LPS-induced Slfn4 mRNA expression in IFNAR-1⁻/⁻ BMM. LPS causes growth arrest in macrophages, and other Slfn family genes have been implicated in growth control. Slfn4 mRNA levels were repressed during macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1)-mediated differentiation of bone marrow progenitors into BMM. To determine the role of Slfn4 in vivo, we over-expressed the gene specifically in macrophages in mice using a csf1r promoter-driven binary expression system. Transgenic over-expression of Slfn4 in myeloid cells did not alter macrophage colony formation or proliferation in vitro. Monocyte numbers, as well as inflammatory macrophages recruited to the peritoneal cavity, were reduced in transgenic mice that specifically over-expressed Slfn4, while macrophage numbers and hematopoietic activity were increased in the livers and spleens.Slfn4 mRNA levels were up-regulated during macrophage activation but down-regulated during differentiation. Constitutive Slfn4 expression in the myeloid lineage in vivo perturbs myelopoiesis. We hypothesise that the down-regulation of Slfn4 gene expression during macrophage differentiation is a necessary step in development of this lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2103659710,"Considerable attention has recently been paid to the N-Myc downstream-regulated gene (NDRG) family because of its potential as a tumor suppressor in many human cancers. Primary amino acid sequence information suggests that the NDRG family proteins may belong to the α/β-hydrolase (ABH) superfamily; however, their functional role has not yet been determined. Here, we present the crystal structures of the human and mouse NDRG2 proteins determined at 2.0 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. Both NDRG2 proteins show remarkable structural similarity to the ABH superfamily, despite limited sequence similarity. Structural analysis suggests that NDRG2 is a nonenzymatic member of the ABH superfamily, because it lacks the catalytic signature residues and has an occluded substrate-binding site. Several conserved structural features suggest NDRG may be involved in molecular interactions. Mutagenesis data based on the structural analysis support a crucial role for helix α6 in the suppression of TCF/β-catenin signaling in the tumorigenesis of human colorectal cancer, via a molecular interaction. Considerable attention has recently been paid to the N-Myc downstream-regulated gene (NDRG) family because of its potential as a tumor suppressor in many human cancers. Primary amino acid sequence information suggests that the NDRG family proteins may belong to the α/β-hydrolase (ABH) superfamily; however, their functional role has not yet been determined. Here, we present the crystal structures of the human and mouse NDRG2 proteins determined at 2.0 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. Both NDRG2 proteins show remarkable structural similarity to the ABH superfamily, despite limited sequence similarity.

Mutagenesis data based on the structural analysis support a crucial role for helix α6 in the suppression of TCF/β-catenin signaling in the tumorigenesis of human colorectal cancer, via a molecular interaction. Myc directs numerous biological functions, such as cell proliferation, cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation, via transcriptional regulation of its target genes (1Vervoorts J. Lüscher-Firzlaff J. Lüscher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34725-34729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Among the target genes, Myc-repressed genes have been of particular interest, because several of these genes have been found to possess tumor-suppressive and anti-metastatic properties (2O'Connell B.C.

The human N-Myc downstream-regulated gene family (NDRG) is a novel class of Myc-repressed genes that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. This family consists of NDRG1, NDRG2, NDRG3, and NDRG4 and includes alternative splicing isoforms of NDRG2 and NDRG4. The NDRG family is also found in other multicellular organisms and is highly conserved between species. Studies of the function and regulation of the NDRG family indicate that it plays multiple roles. In particular, recent data suggest that NDRG proteins may function as tumor suppressors and may also play important roles in the development of other diseases. For example, NDRG1 has been recognized as a metastasis suppressor in prostate (3Bandyopadhyay S. Pai S.K. Gross S.C. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Miura K. Saito K. Commes T. Hayashi S. Watabe M. Watabe K.

In addition, NDRG1 is known to be responsible for the demyelinating neuropathy associated with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (6Okuda T. Higashi Y. Kokame K. Tanaka C. Kondoh H. Miyata T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3949-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NDRG2 has also been identified as a potential tumor suppressor. Its expression is negatively correlated with cancer progression, and it was significantly diminished in the cancerous tissues of patients suffering from breast (7Park Y. Shon S.K. Kim A. Kim K.I.

In addition, NDRG2 is recognized to play a role in the development of Alzheimer disease. Up-regulation of this gene is associated with disease pathogenesis of the human brain (16Mitchelmore C.

Thus, members of the NDRG family are considered to be important to tumorigenesis and may be used as biomarkers in many cancers, as well as in other diseases. The human NDRG family members exhibit 53–65% amino acid sequence identity to each other, with most variation in the N- and C-terminal regions. The most notable difference is that NDRG1 contains three decapeptide sequence (GTRSRSHTSE) repeats at its C terminus, whereas the remaining members have only a single repeat, which also lacks the last two residues Ser and Glu (Fig. 1). Although the C-terminal regions of NDRG proteins contain several modified residues that enable phosphorylation by different protein kinases (20Burchfield J.G. Lennard A.J. Narasimhan S. Hughes W.E. Wasinger V.C. Corthals G.L. Okuda T. Kondoh H. Biden T.J. Schmitz-Peiffer C. J. Biol.

McCue L.A. Lawrence C.E. Dordick J.S. Proteins. 2002; 47: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of NDRG proteins are best conserved in the region spanning this ABH domain. Therefore, the ABH domain of the NDRG family may play an important role in its biological activity, although functional motifs within the ABH domain have not yet been identified.FIGURE 2Crystal structure of NDRG2. a, schematic representation of the domain structure of human NDRG2.

In addition, although amino acid sequence analysis suggests that the NDRG members belong to the ABH superfamily, this still needed to be confirmed by an experimentally determined structure. Therefore, to understand the intrinsic structural properties and the molecular basis for the biological function of the NDRG family, we have performed a crystallographic analysis of the human and mouse NDRG2 proteins. Here, we describe the structural details of NDRG2 and suggest its involvement in molecular interactions. Because sequences and structures of mouse and human NDRG2 are virtually identical, our analysis is focused on the human homologue. The gene encoding human NDRG2 isoform (NDRG2b, gi: 42544224, hereafter referred to as hNDRG2) was supplied by Dr. Jae Wha Kim at Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology. The DNA fragment encoding the human NDRG2 protein (residues 23–304) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pPosKJ expression vector (22Kwon S.Y. Choi Y.J. Kang T.H. Lee K.H. Cha S.S. Kim G.H. Lee H.S. Kim K.T. Kim K.J. Plasmid. 2005; 53: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This vector produced NDRG2(23–304) fused to a hexahistidine tag and bacterial hemoglobin (His6-VHb) at its N terminus. To improve crystal quality of the human NDRG2, surface entropy reduction (SER) (23Goldschmidt L. Cooper D.R. Derewenda Z.S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was introduced into the NDRG2(23–304) protein to induce epitopes that favor the formation of crystal contacts. The program SER predicted candidate residues Lys45 and Lys47 for engineering. Double mutations at these positions were introduced by replacing these residues with alanine (K45A/K47A, referred to as K2A) or tyrosine (K45Y/K47Y, referred to as K2Y), using QuikChange (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene encoding mouse NDRG2 (mNDRG2, gi: 15277976) shares 95% amino acid sequence identity with human NDRG2, except for the extra 14 N-terminal residues from 26 to 39. The DNA fragment encoding the mNDRG2 protein (residues 40–313 corresponding to residues 26–299 of hNDRG2) was amplified by PCR from a clone obtained from the IMAGE consortium. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pMH4, which encodes an expression and purification tag (MGSDKIHHHHHH) at the N terminus. The cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) cells harboring the overexpression plasmids of hNDRG2(23–304) and its mutants were grown in LB/ampicillin medium at 37 °C until the cultures reached an A600 between 0.6 and 0.8. The temperature was lowered to 25 °C, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 15 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl), and the cell suspension was ultrasonicated. The crude cell extracts were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysate containing His6-VHb fused proteins was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was intensively washed with buffer A, and the resin-bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The His6-VHb was then released from the protein by incubation with recombinant tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) at 10 °C for 15 h, followed by size-exclusion chromatography and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography. After purification, the recombinant native and mutant proteins contained a three-residue cloning artifact (Gly-His-Met) in their N termini. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, concentrated to 10–20 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C until used. Size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl showed the molecular mass of the proteins to be ∼26 kDa (data not shown), indicating that hNDRG2(23–304) and its mutants exist as monomers in solution. The mNDRG2 expression was performed in a modified Terrific Broth using the E. coli strain GeneHogs® (Invitrogen). Lysozyme was added to the culture at the end of fermentation to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml. Bacteria were lysed by sonication after a freeze-thaw procedure in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.25 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)), and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,400 × g for 60 min. The soluble fraction was applied to a nickel resin (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The nickel resin was washed with wash buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 40 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm TCEP), and the protein was eluted with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm TCEP). Buffer exchange was performed to remove imidazole from the eluate, and the protein in buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm TCEP) containing 50 mm NaCl was applied to a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in buffer Q. The appropriate fractions were pooled, further purified using a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) with elution in crystallization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm TCEP), and concentrated to 17.6 mg/ml for crystallization assays. The initial crystallization of hNDRG2 was performed using commercially available sparse-matrix screening kits, using the sitting drop vapor-diffusion method. Initial crystals of hNDRG2(23–304) were produced using 18% PEG 8000, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and x-ray diffraction-quality crystals appeared using 9% PEG 8000, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.4–7.5. Initial crystals of the K2A mutant appeared using 20% PEG 8000, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, and were further improved with 16% PEG 8000, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.8–7.1. Remarkable results were obtained from the K2Y mutant protein, which produced hits under 13 different coarse screening conditions (data not shown). The best crystals of this mutant were obtained using 1.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.0–8.0. The mNDRG2 protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor-diffusion method (24Santarsiero B.D.

The crystallization reagent consisted of 20% PEG 400, 0.2 m magnesium chloride, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. Diffraction data from a native mNDRG2 crystal were collected at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA) on beamline 8.3.1. Data were integrated and reduced using MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EACBM Newsletter Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and then scaled with the program SCALA (27Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). The diffraction data were indexed in hexagonal space group P3121, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) using the program MOLREP (28Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). A homology model based on an FFAS (29Rychlewski L. Jaroszewski L. Li W. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) alignment between mNDRG2 and the C–C bond hydrolase MhpC from E. coli (PDB code 1U2E) that share 13% sequence identity was constructed with the modeling program WHATIF (30Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar) and was used in the MR searches. Structure refinement was performed using REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The refinement resulted in Rfree and Rcryst factors of 18.3 and 14.5%, respectively. The model contains 278 amino acid residues, 314 water molecules, two magnesium ions, a benzoic acid, and a PEG molecule. The refined structure of mNDRG2 is substantially different from the structure of MhpC used to build the MR search model, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d) of 3.0 Å of the Cα atoms over 244 structurally aligned residues. Diffraction data for the hNDRG2(23–304) crystals were collected at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamline 4A at 2.8 Å resolution. All of the x-ray diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 software package (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the space group P212121, and three molecules are located in the asymmetric unit. The engineered K2A and K2Y crystals resulted in significantly improved diffraction. Diffraction data for K2A were collected at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamline 6C at 2.0 Å resolution. The crystal also belongs to the space group P212121, with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data for K2Y were collected at the same beamline (i.e. 6C) at 2.15 Å resolution. The K2Y crystal was indexed to space group P3121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure of K2Y was solved by the MR method using the mNDRG2 model, with the program MOLREP. The model was manually built into electron density maps with the program COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Translation-libration-screw refinement of the isotropic displacement parameters was carried out with REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) in the final cycles of refinement. The cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement resulted in Rfree and Rcryst factors of 20.8 and 17.3%, respectively. The model contains 281 amino acid residues, 137 water molecules, a chloride ion, and two imidazole molecules. The hNDRG2(23–304) and K2A structures were solved using the K2Y model, with the program MOLREP. The same procedures were performed for refinement of the hNDRG2(23–304) and K2A structures. The refinement of native protein resulted in Rfree and Rcryst factors of 25.9 and 20.1%, respectively. The model contains 843 amino acid residues, 93 water molecules, and 3 acetate molecules. The refinement of K2A resulted in Rfree and Rcryst factors of 23.3 and 18.0%, respectively. The model contains 843 amino acid residues, 399 water molecules, a calcium ion, 4 acetate molecules, and 3 glycerols. All models satisfied the quality criteria limits of the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

LiCl (Sigma) at 20 mm concentration was added to the cell culture for 6–12 h after transfection. The full-length cDNA for a 357-residue-long hNDRG2 was cloned from a Jurkat cDNA library via PCR amplification. The deletion hNDRG2Δ164–175 or site-directed hNDRG2L172D mutants were also generated via PCR. The PCR products were subsequently cloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Cells at 80% confluence were plated 1 day before transfection and then transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA for transfection was used at a 1.5 μg per well in a 6-well plate. To assess the modulation of TCF/β-catenin signaling by introduction of hNDRG2, we used the TOPflash luciferase reporter assay system, which contains a luciferase reporter plasmid with three copies of the optimal T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF)-binding sites upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. To conduct the luciferase reporter assay, the cells were transfected with TOPflash (or FopFlash, which harbors mutant TCF binding sites) luciferase reporter plasmid (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), β-galactosidase plasmid for the quantification of transfection efficiency, and pcDNA3-construct plasmids at a 1.5 μg/well. After 2 days, the cells were lysed with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min. The cleared lysates were then transferred to each of the wells in the 96-well plates, and luciferase assay reagent was added. The light intensity was determined using a plate-reading luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA), and luciferase activity was calculated relative to β-galactosidase activity. Four groups of tissue pairs, including normal and cancerous region from patients with colon cancer, were obtained from tumor tissue bank of a local hospital. Prepared colon cancer tissues were lysed, and total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were quantified, and 5 μg of RNA was used for RT-PCR to generate each cDNAs using a ProStar first-Strand RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). β-Actin product was used as a reaction standard. PCR products of hNDRG2, β-actin, cyclin D1, and fibronectin were obtained from a reaction standard using its specific primer as follows: hNDRG2, sense 5′-ATGGCAGCGCAGAAGGACCAG-3′ and antisense 5′-TCACACGGGTTCCATCTGCAG-3′; β-actin, sense 5′-AGCCGTGGCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAG-3′ and antisense 5′-GCCATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGCTG-3′; cyclin D1, sense 5′-AACTACCTGGACCGCTTCCT-3′ and antisense 5′-CCACTTGAGCTTGTTCACCA-3′; and fibronectin, sense 5′-CGGGAATCTTCTCTGTCAGC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCCATGACAATGGTGTGAAC-3′. To detect the association of β-catenin with hNDRG2, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (10Kim Y.J. Yoon S.Y. Kim J.T. Song E.Y. Lee H.G. Son H.J. Kim S.Y. Cho D.

The atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes of the hNDRG2(23–304), K2A, K2Y, and mNDRG2(40–313) proteins have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (35Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z.

Many trials aimed at the production of soluble protein of the recombinant full-length hNDRG2 or mNDRG2 using various expression systems were unsuccessful. Therefore, we used the truncated constructs hNDRG2 (residues 23–304) and mNDRG2 (residues 40–313) to characterize their structures. mNDRG2 was determined at a resolution of 1.7 Å by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics and provided the first structure for the NDRG family (Pfam database (36Finn R.D.

Subsequently, the structures of the hNDRG2 K2Y and K2A mutants were determined by the MR method at 2.15 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. All NDRG2 structures are essentially identical to each other (Fig. 2b) and consist of two domains: a large canonical α/β-hydrolase fold domain and a small cap-like domain (Fig. 2c). The large domain consists of an archetypal, eight-stranded β-sheet, consisting of a β-hairpin structure (β1 and β2) and a six-stranded, parallel β-sheet (β3–β8). Eight α-helices (α1–α5 and α11–α13) and two 310 helices form the outer solvent-exposed layer surrounding the β-sheets. The small cap-like domain (Ala161 to Arg227) consists of five α-helices (α6–α10). hNDRG2 and its K2A mutant each contain three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2d). Each structure of hNDRG2, K2A, and K2Y in the asymmetric unit is essentially the same, and the r.m.s.d values of their Cα atoms are all less than 0.36 Å (Fig. 2b).

https://openalex.org/W2108051940,"Human and animal cryptococcosis due to an unusual molecular type of Cryptococcus gattii (VGII) emerged recently on Vancouver Island, Canada. Unlike C. neoformans, C. gattii causes disease mainly in immunocompetent hosts, despite producing a similar suite of virulence determinants. To investigate a potential relationship between the regulation of expression of a virulence gene composite and virulence, we took advantage of two subtypes of VGII (a and b), one highly virulent (R265) and one less virulent (R272), that were identified from the Vancouver outbreak. By expression microarray analysis, 202 genes showed at least a 2-fold difference in expression with 108 being up- and 94 being down-regulated in strain R265 compared with strain R272. Specifically, expression levels of genes encoding putative virulence factors (e.g. LAC1, LAC2, CAS3 and MPK1) and genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall assembly, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were increased in strain R265, whereas genes involved in the regulation of mitosis and ergosterol biosynthesis were suppressed. In vitro phenotypic studies and transcription analysis confirmed the microarray results. Gene disruption of LAC1 and MPK1 revealed defects in melanin synthesis and cell wall integrity, respectively, where CAS3 was not essential for capsule production. Moreover, MPK1 also controls melanin and capsule production and causes a severe attenuation of the virulence in a murine inhalational model. Overall, this study provides the basis for further genetic studies to characterize the differences in the virulence composite of strains with minor evolutionary divergences in gene expression in the primary pathogen C. gattii, that have led to a major invasive fungal infection outbreak."

But, the mechanisms of injury and pathogenesis to the fetal brain are not completely understood. The present study addresses potential pathogenic mechanisms by which this virus injures the CNS using a neonatal mouse model that mirrors congenital brain infection. This investigation focused on, analysis of cell types infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and the pattern of injury to the developing brain.We used our MCMV infection model and a multi-color flow cytometry approach to quantify the effect of viral infection on the developing brain, identifying specific target cells and the consequent effect on neurogenesis. In this study, we show that neural stem cells (NSCs) and neuronal precursor cells are the principal target cells for MCMV in the developing brain. In addition, viral infection was demonstrated to cause a loss of NSCs expressing CD133 and nestin. We also showed that infection of neonates leads to subsequent abnormal brain development as indicated by loss of CD24(hi) cells that incorporated BrdU. This neonatal brain infection was also associated with altered expression of Oct4, a multipotency marker; as well as down regulation of the neurotrophins BDNF and NT3, which are essential to regulate the birth and differentiation of neurons during normal brain development. Finally, we report decreased expression of doublecortin, a marker to identify young neurons, following viral brain infection.MCMV brain infection of newborn mice causes significant loss of NSCs, decreased proliferation of neuronal precursor cells, and marked loss of young neurons."

IntroductionOsteoporosis and obesity, major public health problems of body composition, have been prevalent during the last 3 decades. Clinically, an increase in bone mass reduction has been observed in age-associated osteoporosis, which is accompanied by an accumulation of adipose tissue in bone marrow (1Pei L. Tontonoz P. J. Clin.

Disruption of the balance between MSC osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation is associated with various human diseases (3Rosen C.J. Klibanski A. Am. J.

J. 2002; 364: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Wagner E.F. Karsenty G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RUNX2 promotes differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts (8Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). PPARγ-2, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is required for adipogenesis (9Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of PPARγ-2 is sufficient to induce differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar), and no known factors are able to stimulate adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ-2. In addition, multipotent stem cells contain multiple key maternally inherited transcriptional factors that maintain the pluripotency, including epigenetic factors for histone modifications, such as the Polycomb group proteins EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste homolog) and EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development) (11Jaiswal R.K. Jaiswal N. Bruder S.P. Mbalaviele G. Marshak D.R. Pittenger M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9645-9652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar).EZH2, a catalytic subunit of Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is a histone lysine methyltransferase that methylates lysine 27 of histone H3, resulting in gene silencing (12Kuzmichev A.

It has been shown that EZH2 plays a pivotal role in fostering self-renewal and inhibiting the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However, it is not clear whether the molecular events of EZH2-mediated epigenetic silencing may coordinate differentiation between osteoblasts and adipocytes. Because the differentiation of adipogenesis and osteogenesis lineages is mutually exclusive, we hypothesize that if EZH2 binds to pro-osteogenic gene promoters and inhibits pro-osteogenic gene expression, MSCs will differentiate into adipocytes and, vice versa, if EZH2 binds to pro-adipogenic gene promoters, MSCs will differentiate into osteoblasts. Therefore, to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of MSC differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts, we used genome-wide EZH2-ChIP-on-chip assay to identify differential targets of EZH2 in these two differentiation stages. After narrowing down and validating the targets, interestingly, myocyte enhancer factor-2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR) (also named histone deacetylase 9c (HDAC9c)) (15Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was singled out as low expressing in adipocytes and high in osteoblasts. We therefore focused on the EZH2 target gene MITR in adipocytes to further characterize its functions in osteogenesis and adipogenesis of human MSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that MITR plays a crucial role in the acceleration of MSC osteogenesis and attenuation of MSC adipogenesis through interaction with PPARγ-2, which interrupts PPARγ-2 transcriptional activity resulting in attenuation of adipogenesis and acceleration of osteogenesis. Together, our results demonstrated that MITR plays a switch role to balance osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs through regulation of PPARγ-2 transcriptional activity.DISCUSSIONAccumulated evidence has demonstrated a possible role for the polycomb group proteins in regulating tissue development and maintenance of multipotent progenitor cells (26Ringrose L. Paro R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). PRC2, which is composed of EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, is recruited to chromatin where trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (triMeK27-H3) was catalyzed by EZH2 methyltransferase (13Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). We now show that EZH2 targeted and inactivated the MITR promoter in adipocytes resulting in its decreased expression but not in osteoblasts. Furthermore, we found that EZH2-mediated epigenetic regulation of MITR plays an important role over MSC osteogenic and adipogenic lineage allocation. MITR lacks the C-terminal and catalytic domain (22Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); therefore, MITR does not possess intrinsic HDAC activity. MITR is classified into class IIa HDACs and is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Class II HDACs modulate cell differentiation through recruitment of different interacting partners, including NF-AT3c (transcription factor required for cell differentiation and immune response), N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), and HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1 and associated with the methyltransferase) (27Yang X.J. Grégoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, HDACs have a powerful ability to attract partner proteins to regulate cell fate beside their own histone deacetylase function. In addition, previous studies also showed that HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC7 modulate osteoblast differentiation via modification of histone or interaction with RUNX2, respectively (28Lee H.W. Suh J.H. Kim A.Y. Lee Y.S. Park S.Y. Kim J.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2432-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29Schroeder T.M. Kahler R.A. Li X. Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41998-42007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Jensen E.D. Schroeder T.M. Bailey J. Gopalakrishnan R. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2008; 23: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been reported that MITR fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain suppresses transcription in transient transfection assays, indicating MITR is a transcriptional repressor (15Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that MITR interacts with PPARγ-2 in the osteoblastic nucleus to prevent binding of PPARγ-2 to the adipocyte marker gene FABP4 promoter thus repressing its expression, indicating MITR may possibly function as a transcriptional co-repressor to inhibit PPARγ-2 transcription, and therefore it represses adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis of MSCs. However, it remains unclear that how MITR-bound PPARγ-2 loses its ability to bind to the target gene promoters. One of the possible mechanisms may be due to the conformational change of PPARγ-2 after binding with MITR, resulting in sheltering the DNA-binding domain of PPARγ-2, thereby hindering its association with target promoters. In this regard, Suzawa et al. (31Suzawa M. Takada I. Yanagisawa J. Ohtake F. Ogawa S. Yamauchi T. Kadowaki T. Takeuchi Y. Shibuya H. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) also found that NF-κB activated by cytokine signaling interacts with the DNA-binding domain of PPAR-γ, which prevents PPAR-γ binding to target gene promoters, leading to inhibiting adipogenesis. These results further reveal that modulation of the DNA binding ability of PPAR-γ confers another level of PPAR-γ regulation. Further systematic study is required to address this interesting issue.Previous studies have reported that mice lacking both HDAC9 and MITR are hypersensitive to hypertrophic stimuli and spontaneously develop age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy (32Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). These mice are also sensitized to calcineurin signaling-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, and unveiling HDAC9 and MITR acts as transcriptional repressor of signal-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocyte (32Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This phenotypic impact of HDAC9 and MITR is associated with the transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor-2. Interestingly, HDAC4-null mice showed ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy, which results in premature ossification of developing bones, a similar phenotype that is caused by constitutive expression of RUNX2 in chondrocyte (33Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2004; 119: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC4 physically interacts with and suppresses RUNX2 transcriptional activity, leading to inhibitory effects on RUNX2 target gene expression and chondrocyte hypertrophy (33Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2010; 285: 9616-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that MITR enhances osteogenesis but impedes adipogenesis of MSCs by interacting with PPARγ-2 and repressing its transcriptional activity. Together, these studies suggest that class II HDACs may fine-tune a variety of cellular processes through disparate modes of action such as interacting with specific transcription factors. Moreover, multiple HDACs may be involved in the delicate coordination of the same cellular process but contribute to unique functions at the different stages of the cellular process. For example, during bone development, HDAC4 modulates chondrocyte hypertrophy, and MITR regulates osteoblast differentiation.It is worth mentioning that HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A, Scriptaid, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, have been shown to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Nebbioso A. Dell'Aversana C. Bugge A.

However, HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate and valproic acid stimulated adipogenesis of preadipocytes (23Yoo E.J. Chung J.J. Choe S.S. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6608-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sodium butyrate and valproic acid belong to short chain fatty acid chemicals, which have previously been known to enhance adipogenesis. Thus, the opposite effect of HDAC inhibitors on adipogenesis could be attributed to the nature of HDAC inhibitors. Indeed, Olson and co-workers (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) demonstrated that sodium butyrate and valproic acid-enhanced adipogenesis was abrogated although co-treatment with TSA, indicating the augmented adipogenesis resulted from the short chain fatty acid character of sodium butyrate and valproic acid instead of HDAC inhibition. In addition, knocking down HDAC1 using siRNA promoted preadipocyte 3T3-L1 differentiation (23Yoo E.J. Chung J.J. Choe S.S. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6608-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Conversely, genetic deletion of both HDAC1 and -2 together in mouse embryonic fibroblasts blocked adipogenesis (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have shown that HDAC1 and HDAC2 redundantly coordinate gene expression that controls a variety of cellular processes, including differentiation (38Montgomery R.L. Davis C.A. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Fielitz J. Qi X. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1790-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 39Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J.

Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Hence, the discrepancy could be caused by the different methodologies and/or differentiation systems used in the two studies. In addition, redundancy of the two genes might also contribute to the discrepancy. Further experimental delineation is required to clarify these issues.Interestingly, recent studies show that depletion of EZH2 leads to a severe impaired adipogenesis in primary white preadipocytes. Adipogenesis was facilitated by H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2-mediated repression of Wnt genes directly. Thus, consistent with our results, this study also highlights the importance for EZH2-mediated differentiation (41Wang L. Jin Q. Lee J.E. Su I.H. Ge K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7317-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, a 14-3-3-binding protein TAZ, which is a transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif, has been shown to function as a co-activator of RUNX2 and a repressor of PPARγ to inhibit PPARγ-dependent transcriptional events, suggesting TAZ may act as a molecular switch to adjust the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis (42Hong J.H. Hwang E.S. McManus M.T. Amsterdam A. Tian Y. Kalmukova R. Mueller E. Benjamin T. Spiegelman B.M. Sharp P.A. Hopkins N. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2005; 309: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Together with our results, further investigation is required to understand how all these regulators might coordinate the two differentiation fates. Here, studying the mechanisms for MSC lineage allocation exposes the importance of epigenetic regulation and provides an example of how a noncatalytic HDAC protein participates in MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes. IntroductionOsteoporosis and obesity, major public health problems of body composition, have been prevalent during the last 3 decades.

Invest. 2004; 113: 805-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Bone and fat are composed of osteoblasts and adipocytes, respectively, both of which are derived from multipotent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 3The abbreviations used are: MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; MITR, myocyte enhancer factor-2 interacting transcriptional repressor; pMSC, primary human MSC; OPN, osteopontin; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; qChIP, quantitative ChIP; HDAC, histone deacetylase.

Disruption of the balance between MSC osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation is associated with various human diseases (3Rosen C.J. Klibanski A. Am. J.

J. 2002; 364: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Wagner E.F. Karsenty G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RUNX2 promotes differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts (8Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). PPARγ-2, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is required for adipogenesis (9Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of PPARγ-2 is sufficient to induce differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar), and no known factors are able to stimulate adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ-2. In addition, multipotent stem cells contain multiple key maternally inherited transcriptional factors that maintain the pluripotency, including epigenetic factors for histone modifications, such as the Polycomb group proteins EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste homolog) and EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development) (11Jaiswal R.K. Jaiswal N. Bruder S.P. Mbalaviele G. Marshak D.R. Pittenger M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9645-9652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar).EZH2, a catalytic subunit of Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is a histone lysine methyltransferase that methylates lysine 27 of histone H3, resulting in gene silencing (12Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

It has been shown that EZH2 plays a pivotal role in fostering self-renewal and inhibiting the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However, it is not clear whether the molecular events of EZH2-mediated epigenetic silencing may coordinate differentiation between osteoblasts and adipocytes. Because the differentiation of adipogenesis and osteogenesis lineages is mutually exclusive, we hypothesize that if EZH2 binds to pro-osteogenic gene promoters and inhibits pro-osteogenic gene expression, MSCs will differentiate into adipocytes and, vice versa, if EZH2 binds to pro-adipogenic gene promoters, MSCs will differentiate into osteoblasts. Therefore, to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of MSC differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts, we used genome-wide EZH2-ChIP-on-chip assay to identify differential targets of EZH2 in these two differentiation stages. After narrowing down and validating the targets, interestingly, myocyte enhancer factor-2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR) (also named histone deacetylase 9c (HDAC9c)) (15Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was singled out as low expressing in adipocytes and high in osteoblasts. We therefore focused on the EZH2 target gene MITR in adipocytes to further characterize its functions in osteogenesis and adipogenesis of human MSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that MITR plays a crucial role in the acceleration of MSC osteogenesis and attenuation of MSC adipogenesis through interaction with PPARγ-2, which interrupts PPARγ-2 transcriptional activity resulting in attenuation of adipogenesis and acceleration of osteogenesis. Together, our results demonstrated that MITR plays a switch role to balance osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs through regulation of PPARγ-2 transcriptional activity.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was singled out as low expressing in adipocytes and high in osteoblasts. We therefore focused on the EZH2 target gene MITR in adipocytes to further characterize its functions in osteogenesis and adipogenesis of human MSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that MITR plays a crucial role in the acceleration of MSC osteogenesis and attenuation of MSC adipogenesis through interaction with PPARγ-2, which interrupts PPARγ-2 transcriptional activity resulting in attenuation of adipogenesis and acceleration of osteogenesis. Together, our results demonstrated that MITR plays a switch role to balance osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs through regulation of PPARγ-2 transcriptional activity. DISCUSSIONAccumulated evidence has demonstrated a possible role for the polycomb group proteins in regulating tissue development and maintenance of multipotent progenitor cells (26Ringrose L. Paro R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). PRC2, which is composed of EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, is recruited to chromatin where trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (triMeK27-H3) was catalyzed by EZH2 methyltransferase (13Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). We now show that EZH2 targeted and inactivated the MITR promoter in adipocytes resulting in its decreased expression but not in osteoblasts. Furthermore, we found that EZH2-mediated epigenetic regulation of MITR plays an important role over MSC osteogenic and adipogenic lineage allocation. MITR lacks the C-terminal and catalytic domain (22Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); therefore, MITR does not possess intrinsic HDAC activity. MITR is classified into class IIa HDACs and is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Class II HDACs modulate cell differentiation through recruitment of different interacting partners, including NF-AT3c (transcription factor required for cell differentiation and immune response), N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), and HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1 and associated with the methyltransferase) (27Yang X.J. Grégoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, HDACs have a powerful ability to attract partner proteins to regulate cell fate beside their own histone deacetylase function. In addition, previous studies also showed that HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC7 modulate osteoblast differentiation via modification of histone or interaction with RUNX2, respectively (28Lee H.W. Suh J.H. Kim A.Y. Lee Y.S. Park S.Y. Kim J.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2432-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29Schroeder T.M. Kahler R.A. Li X. Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41998-42007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Jensen E.D. Schroeder T.M. Bailey J. Gopalakrishnan R. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2008; 23: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been reported that MITR fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain suppresses transcription in transient transfection assays, indicating MITR is a transcriptional repressor (15Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that MITR interacts with PPARγ-2 in the osteoblastic nucleus to prevent binding of PPARγ-2 to the adipocyte marker gene FABP4 promoter thus repressing its expression, indicating MITR may possibly function as a transcriptional co-repressor to inhibit PPARγ-2 transcription, and therefore it represses adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis of MSCs. However, it remains unclear that how MITR-bound PPARγ-2 loses its ability to bind to the target gene promoters. One of the possible mechanisms may be due to the conformational change of PPARγ-2 after binding with MITR, resulting in sheltering the DNA-binding domain of PPARγ-2, thereby hindering its association with target promoters. In this regard, Suzawa et al. (31Suzawa M. Takada I. Yanagisawa J. Ohtake F. Ogawa S. Yamauchi T. Kadowaki T. Takeuchi Y. Shibuya H. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) also found that NF-κB activated by cytokine signaling interacts with the DNA-binding domain of PPAR-γ, which prevents PPAR-γ binding to target gene promoters, leading to inhibiting adipogenesis. These results further reveal that modulation of the DNA binding ability of PPAR-γ confers another level of PPAR-γ regulation. Further systematic study is required to address this interesting issue.Previous studies have reported that mice lacking both HDAC9 and MITR are hypersensitive to hypertrophic stimuli and spontaneously develop age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy (32Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). These mice are also sensitized to calcineurin signaling-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, and unveiling HDAC9 and MITR acts as transcriptional repressor of signal-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocyte (32Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This phenotypic impact of HDAC9 and MITR is associated with the transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor-2. Interestingly, HDAC4-null mice showed ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy, which results in premature ossification of developing bones, a similar phenotype that is caused by constitutive expression of RUNX2 in chondrocyte (33Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2004; 119: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC4 physically interacts with and suppresses RUNX2 transcriptional activity, leading to inhibitory effects on RUNX2 target gene expression and chondrocyte hypertrophy (33Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2010; 285: 9616-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that MITR enhances osteogenesis but impedes adipogenesis of MSCs by interacting with PPARγ-2 and repressing its transcriptional activity. Together, these studies suggest that class II HDACs may fine-tune a variety of cellular processes through disparate modes of action such as interacting with specific transcription factors. Moreover, multiple HDACs may be involved in the delicate coordination of the same cellular process but contribute to unique functions at the different stages of the cellular process. For example, during bone development, HDAC4 modulates chondrocyte hypertrophy, and MITR regulates osteoblast differentiation.It is worth mentioning that HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A, Scriptaid, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, have been shown to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Nebbioso A. Dell'Aversana C. Bugge A. Sarno R. Valente S. Rotili D. Manzo F. Teti D. Mandrup S. Ciana P. Maggi A. Mai A. Gronemeyer H. Altucci L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 45: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Catalioto R.M. Maggi C.A. Giuliani S. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 3267-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate and valproic acid stimulated adipogenesis of preadipocytes (23Yoo E.J. Chung J.J. Choe S.S. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6608-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sodium butyrate and valproic acid belong to short chain fatty acid chemicals, which have previously been known to enhance adipogenesis. Thus, the opposite effect of HDAC inhibitors on adipogenesis could be attributed to the nature of HDAC inhibitors. Indeed, Olson and co-workers (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) demonstrated that sodium butyrate and valproic acid-enhanced adipogenesis was abrogated although co-treatment with TSA, indicating the augmented adipogenesis resulted from the short chain fatty acid character of sodium butyrate and valproic acid instead of HDAC inhibition. In addition, knocking down HDAC1 using siRNA promoted preadipocyte 3T3-L1 differentiation (23Yoo E.J. Chung J.J. Choe S.S. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6608-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Conversely, genetic deletion of both HDAC1 and -2 together in mouse embryonic fibroblasts blocked adipogenesis (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have shown that HDAC1 and HDAC2 redundantly coordinate gene expression that controls a variety of cellular processes, including differentiation (38Montgomery R.L. Davis C.A. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Fielitz J. Qi X. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1790-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 39Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Qi X. Matsuzaki S. Humphries K.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3588-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 40Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Hence, the discrepancy could be caused by the different methodologies and/or differentiation systems used in the two studies. In addition, redundancy of the two genes might also contribute to the discrepancy. Further experimental delineation is required to clarify these issues.Interestingly, recent studies show that depletion of EZH2 leads to a severe impaired adipogenesis in primary white preadipocytes. Adipogenesis was facilitated by H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2-mediated repression of Wnt genes directly. Thus, consistent with our results, this study also highlights the importance for EZH2-mediated differentiation (41Wang L. Jin Q. Lee J.E. Su I.H. Ge K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7317-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, a 14-3-3-binding protein TAZ, which is a transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif, has been shown to function as a co-activator of RUNX2 and a repressor of PPARγ to inhibit PPARγ-dependent transcriptional events, suggesting TAZ may act as a molecular switch to adjust the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis (42Hong J.H. Hwang E.S. McManus M.T. Amsterdam A. Tian Y. Kalmukova R. Mueller E. Benjamin T. Spiegelman B.M. Sharp P.A. Hopkins N. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2005; 309: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Together with our results, further investigation is required to understand how all these regulators might coordinate the two differentiation fates. Here, studying the mechanisms for MSC lineage allocation exposes the importance of epigenetic regulation and provides an example of how a noncatalytic HDAC protein participates in MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated a possible role for the polycomb group proteins in regulating tissue development and maintenance of multipotent progenitor cells (26Ringrose L. Paro R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). PRC2, which is composed of EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, is recruited to chromatin where trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (triMeK27-H3) was catalyzed by EZH2 methyltransferase (13Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). We now show that EZH2 targeted and inactivated the MITR promoter in adipocytes resulting in its decreased expression but not in osteoblasts. Furthermore, we found that EZH2-mediated epigenetic regulation of MITR plays an important role over MSC osteogenic and adipogenic lineage allocation. MITR lacks the C-terminal and catalytic domain (22Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); therefore, MITR does not possess intrinsic HDAC activity. MITR is classified into class IIa HDACs and is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Class II HDACs modulate cell differentiation through recruitment of different interacting partners, including NF-AT3c (transcription factor required for cell differentiation and immune response), N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), and HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1 and associated with the methyltransferase) (27Yang X.J. Grégoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, HDACs have a powerful ability to attract partner proteins to regulate cell fate beside their own histone deacetylase function. In addition, previous studies also showed that HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC7 modulate osteoblast differentiation via modification of histone or interaction with RUNX2, respectively (28Lee H.W. Suh J.H.

Moreover, it has also been reported that MITR fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain suppresses transcription in transient transfection assays, indicating MITR is a transcriptional repressor (15Zhou X.

In this study, we demonstrate that MITR interacts with PPARγ-2 in the osteoblastic nucleus to prevent binding of PPARγ-2 to the adipocyte marker gene FABP4 promoter thus repressing its expression, indicating MITR may possibly function as a transcriptional co-repressor to inhibit PPARγ-2 transcription, and therefore it represses adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis of MSCs.

These mice are also sensitized to calcineurin signaling-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, and unveiling HDAC9 and MITR acts as transcriptional repressor of signal-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocyte (32Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This phenotypic impact of HDAC9 and MITR is associated with the transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor-2. Interestingly, HDAC4-null mice showed ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy, which results in premature ossification of developing bones, a similar phenotype that is caused by constitutive expression of RUNX2 in chondrocyte (33Vega R.B.

In addition, HDAC4 physically interacts with and suppresses RUNX2 transcriptional activity, leading to inhibitory effects on RUNX2 target gene expression and chondrocyte hypertrophy (33Vega R.B.

In this study, we found that MITR enhances osteogenesis but impedes adipogenesis of MSCs by interacting with PPARγ-2 and repressing its transcriptional activity. Together, these studies suggest that class II HDACs may fine-tune a variety of cellular processes through disparate modes of action such as interacting with specific transcription factors. Moreover, multiple HDACs may be involved in the delicate coordination of the same cellular process but contribute to unique functions at the different stages of the cellular process. For example, during bone development, HDAC4 modulates chondrocyte hypertrophy, and MITR regulates osteoblast differentiation. It is worth mentioning that HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A, Scriptaid, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, have been shown to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation (35Haberland M. Carrer M.

However, HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate and valproic acid stimulated adipogenesis of preadipocytes (23Yoo E.J. Chung J.J. Choe S.S. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6608-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

Sodium butyrate and valproic acid belong to short chain fatty acid chemicals, which have previously been known to enhance adipogenesis. Thus, the opposite effect of HDAC inhibitors on adipogenesis could be attributed to the nature of HDAC inhibitors. Indeed, Olson and co-workers (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) demonstrated that sodium butyrate and valproic acid-enhanced adipogenesis was abrogated although co-treatment with TSA, indicating the augmented adipogenesis resulted from the short chain fatty acid character of sodium butyrate and valproic acid instead of HDAC inhibition. In addition, knocking down HDAC1 using siRNA promoted preadipocyte 3T3-L1 differentiation (23Yoo E.J. Chung J.J. Choe S.S. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6608-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Conversely, genetic deletion of both HDAC1 and -2 together in mouse embryonic fibroblasts blocked adipogenesis (35Haberland M. Carrer M. Mokalled M.H. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14663-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have shown that HDAC1 and HDAC2 redundantly coordinate gene expression that controls a variety of cellular processes, including differentiation (38Montgomery R.L. Davis C.A. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Fielitz J. Qi X. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1790-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 39Montgomery R.L. Potthoff M.J.

Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Hence, the discrepancy could be caused by the different methodologies and/or differentiation systems used in the two studies. In addition, redundancy of the two genes might also contribute to the discrepancy. Further experimental delineation is required to clarify these issues. Interestingly, recent studies show that depletion of EZH2 leads to a severe impaired adipogenesis in primary white preadipocytes. Adipogenesis was facilitated by H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2-mediated repression of Wnt genes directly. Thus, consistent with our results, this study also highlights the importance for EZH2-mediated differentiation (41Wang L. Jin Q. Lee J.E. Su I.H. Ge K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7317-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, a 14-3-3-binding protein TAZ, which is a transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif, has been shown to function as a co-activator of RUNX2 and a repressor of PPARγ to inhibit PPARγ-dependent transcriptional events, suggesting TAZ may act as a molecular switch to adjust the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis (42Hong J.H. Hwang E.S. McManus M.T. Amsterdam A. Tian Y. Kalmukova R. Mueller E. Benjamin T. Spiegelman B.M. Sharp P.A. Hopkins N. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2005; 309: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Together with our results, further investigation is required to understand how all these regulators might coordinate the two differentiation fates. Here, studying the mechanisms for MSC lineage allocation exposes the importance of epigenetic regulation and provides an example of how a noncatalytic HDAC protein participates in MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2084694142,"The mechanisms behind the loss of epithelial barrier function leading to alveolar flooding in acute lung injury (ALI) are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that the tyrosine kinase receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) would be activated in an inflammatory setting and participate in ALI. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) exposure resulted in HER2 activation in human epithelial cells and markedly increased conductance across a monolayer of airway epithelial cells. Upon HER2 blockade, conductance changes were significantly decreased. Mechanistic studies revealed that HER2 trans-activation by IL-1β required a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)-dependent shedding of the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG-1). In murine models of ALI, NRG-1-HER2 signaling was activated, and ADAM17 blockade resulted in decreased NRG-1 shedding, HER2 activation, and lung injury <i>in vivo</i>. Finally, NRG-1 was detectable and elevated in pulmonary edema fluid from patients with ALI. These results suggest that the ADAM17-NRG-1-HER2 axis modulates the alveolar epithelial barrier and contributes to the pathophysiology of ALI."
https://openalex.org/W1972975172,"Background The Gadd45 proteins play important roles in growth control, maintenance of genomic stability, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Recently, Gadd45 proteins have also been implicated in epigenetic gene regulation by promoting active DNA demethylation. Gadd45 proteins have sequence homology with the L7Ae/L30e/S12e RNA binding superfamily of ribosomal proteins, which raises the question if they may interact directly with nucleic acids. Principal Findings Here we show that Gadd45a binds RNA but not single- or double stranded DNA or methylated DNA in vitro. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments demonstrate that Gadd45a is present in high molecular weight particles, which are RNase sensitive. Gadd45a displays RNase-sensitive colocalization in nuclear speckles with the RNA helicase p68 and the RNA binding protein SC35. A K45A point mutation defective in RNA binding was still active in DNA demethylation. This suggests that RNA binding is not absolutely essential for demethylation of an artificial substrate. A point mutation at G39 impared RNA binding, nuclear speckle localization and DNA demethylation, emphasizing its relevance for Gadd45a function. Significance The results implicate RNA in Gadd45a function and suggest that Gadd45a is associated with a ribonucleoprotein particle."

The majority of research examining structural-cognitive relationships in aging focuses on the role of age-related changes to grey matter integrity. In the current study, we examined the relationship between age-related changes in white matter and language production. More specifically, we concentrated on word-finding failures, which increase with age.We used Diffusion tensor MRI (a technique used to image, in vivo, the diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue) to relate white matter integrity to measures of successful and unsuccessful picture naming. Diffusion tensor images were used to calculate Fractional Anisotropy (FA) images. FA is considered to be a measure of white matter organization/integrity. FA images were related to measures of successful picture naming and to word finding failures using voxel-based linear regression analyses. Successful naming rates correlated positively with white matter integrity across a broad range of regions implicated in language production. However, word finding failure rates correlated negatively with a more restricted region in the posterior aspect of superior longitudinal fasciculus.The use of DTI-MRI provides evidence for the relationship between age-related white matter changes in specific language regions and word finding failures in old age."
https://openalex.org/W2148373198,"Even though VEGF-B is a homologue of the potent angiogenic factor VEGF, its angiogenic activities have been controversial. Intrigued by findings that VEGF-B may also affect neuronal cells, we assessed the neuroprotective and vasculoprotective effects of VEGF-B in the skin, in which vessels and nerves are functionally intertwined. Although VEGF-B and its FLT1 receptor were prominently expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating the hindlimb skin, they were not essential for nerve function or vascularization of the skin. However, primary DRG cultures lacking VEGF-B or FLT1 exhibited increased neuronal stress and were more susceptible to paclitaxel-induced cell death. Concomitantly, mice lacking VEGF-B or a functional FLT1 developed more retrograde degeneration of sensory neurons in a model of distal neuropathy. On the other hand, the addition of the VEGF-B isoform, VEGF-B186, to DRG cultures antagonized neuronal stress, maintained the mitochon-drial membrane potential and stimulated neuronal survival. Mice overexpressing VEGF-B186 or FLT1 selectively in neurons were protected against the distal neuropathy, whereas exogenous VEGF-B186, either delivered by gene transfer or as a recombinant factor, was protective by directly affecting sensory neurons and not the surrounding vasculature. Overall, this indicates that VEGF-B, instead of acting as an angiogenic factor, exerts direct neuroprotective effects through FLT1. These findings also suggest a clinically relevant role for VEGF-B in preventing distal neuropathies.—Dhondt, J., Peeraer, E., Verheyen, A., Nuydens, R., Buysschaert, I., Poesen, K., Van Geyte, K., Beerens, M., Shibuya, M., Haigh, J.

We conclude that PaaAC forms a catalytic core with a monooxygenase fold with PaaA being the catalytic α subunit and PaaC, the structural β subunit. PaaAC forms heterotetramers that are organized very differently from other known multisubunit monooxygenases and lacks their conservative network of hydrogen bonds between the di-iron center and protein surface, suggesting different association with the reductase and different mechanisms of electron transport.

https://openalex.org/W2052776499,"Background TWEAK (Tumor necrosis factor like WEAK inducer of apoptosis) is highly expressed by different immune cells and triggers multiple cellular responses, including control of angiogenesis. Our objective was to investigate its role in the human endometrium during the implantation window, using an ex-vivo endometrial microhistoculture model. Indeed, previous results suggested that basic TWEAK expression influences the IL-18 related uNK recruitment and local cytotoxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings Endometrial biopsies were performed 7 to 9 days after the ovulation surge of women in monitored natural cycles. Biopsies were cut in micro-pieces and cultured on collagen sponge with appropriate medium. Morphology, functionality and cell death were analysed at different time of the culture. We used this ex vivo model to study mRNA expressions of NKp46 (a uNK cytotoxic receptor) and TGF-beta1 (protein which regulates uNK cytokine production) after adjunction of excess of recombinant IL-18 and either recombinant TWEAK or its antibody. NKp46 protein expression was also detailed by immunohistochemistry in selected patients with high basic mRNA level of IL-18 and either low or high mRNA level of TWEAK. The NKp46 immunostaining was stronger in patients with an IL-18 over-expression and a low TWEAK expression, when compared with patients with both IL-18 and TWEAK high expressions. We did not observe any difference for TWEAK expression when recombinant protein IL-18 or its antibody was added, or conversely, for IL-18 expression when TWEAK or its antibody was added in the culture medium. In a pro-inflammatory environment (obtained by an excess of IL-18), inhibition of TWEAK was able to increase significantly NKp46 and TGF-beta1 mRNA expressions. Conclusions/Significance TWEAK doesn't act on IL-18 expression but seems to control IL-18 related cytotoxicity on uNK cells when IL-18 is over-expressed. Thus, TWEAK appears as a crucial physiological modulator to prevent endometrial uNK cytotoxicity in human."
https://openalex.org/W1968325234,"Human laminin receptor acts as both a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit to mediate cellular translation and as a cell surface receptor that interacts with components of the extracellular matrix. Due to its role as the cell surface receptor for several viruses and its overexpression in several types of cancer, laminin receptor is a pathologically significant protein. Previous studies have determined that ribosomes are associated with components of the cytoskeleton, however the specific ribosomal component(s) responsible has not been determined. Our studies show that laminin receptor binds directly to tubulin. Through the use of siRNA and cytoskeletal inhibitors we demonstrate that laminin receptor acts as a tethering protein, holding the ribosome to tubulin, which is integral to cellular translation. Our studies also show that laminin receptor is capable of binding directly to actin. Through the use of siRNA and cytoskeletal inhibitors we have shown that this laminin receptor-actin interaction is critical for cell migration. These data indicate that interactions between laminin receptor and the cytoskeleton are vital in mediating two processes that are intimately linked to cancer, cellular translation and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2045812032,"Background The putative promoter of the holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) gene on chromosome 21 is hypermethylated in placental tissues and could be detected as a fetal-specific DNA marker in maternal plasma. Detection of fetal trisomy 21 (T21) has been demonstrated by an epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach where the amount of hypermethylated HLCS in maternal plasma is normalized using a fetal genetic marker on the Y chromosome as a chromosome dosage reference marker. We explore if this method can be applied on both male and female fetuses with the use of a paternally-inherited fetal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele on a reference chromosome for chromosome dosage normalization. Methodology We quantified hypermethylated HLCS molecules using methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by real-time or digital PCR analyses. For chromosome dosage analysis, we compared the amount of digestion-resistant HLCS to that of a SNP allele (rs6636, a C/G SNP) that the fetus has inherited from the father but absent in the pregnant mother. Principal Findings Using a fetal-specific SNP allele on a reference chromosome, we analyzed 20 euploid and nine T21 placental tissue samples. All samples with the fetal-specific C allele were correctly classified. One sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were misclassified when the fetal-specific G allele was used as the reference marker. We then analyzed 33 euploid and 14 T21 maternal plasma samples. All but one sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were correctly classified using the fetal-specific C allele, while correct classification was achieved for all samples using the fetal-specific G allele as the reference marker. Conclusions As a proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that the epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach can be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 for both male and female fetuses."
https://openalex.org/W2013252344,"Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain 2.4.1 is a widely studied bacterium that has recently been shown to cleave the abundant marine anti-stress molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) into acrylate plus gaseous dimethyl sulfide. It does so by using a lyase encoded by dddL, the promoter-distal gene of a three-gene operon, acuR-acuI-dddL. Transcription of the operon was enhanced when cells were pre-grown with the substrate DMSP, but this induction is indirect, and requires the conversion of DMSP to the product acrylate, the bona fide co-inducer. This regulation is mediated by the product of the promoter-proximal gene acuR, a transcriptional regulator in the TetR family. AcuR represses the operon in the absence of acrylate, but this is relieved by the presence of the co-inducer. Another unusual regulatory feature is that the acuR-acuI-dddL mRNA transcript is leaderless, such that acuR lacks a Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal binding site and 5'-UTR, and is translated at a lower level compared to the downstream genes. This regulatory unit may be quite widespread in bacteria, since several other taxonomically diverse lineages have adjacent acuR-like and acuI-like genes; these operons also have no 5' leader sequences or ribosomal binding sites and their predicted cis-acting regulatory sequences resemble those of R. sphaeroides acuR-acuI-dddL."
https://openalex.org/W2087085487,"The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met is implicated in oncogenesis and is the target for several small molecule and biologic agents in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Binding of the hepatocyte growth factor to the cell surface receptor of c-Met induces activation via autophosphorylation of the kinase domain. Here we describe the structural basis of c-Met activation upon autophosphorylation and the selective small molecule inhibiton of autophosphorylated c-Met. MK-2461 is a potent c-Met inhibitor that is selective for the phosphorylated state of the enzyme. Compound 1 is an MK-2461 analog with a 20-fold enthalpy-driven preference for the autophosphorylated over unphosphorylated c-Met kinase domain. The crystal structure of the unbound kinase domain phosphorylated at Tyr-1234 and Tyr-1235 shows that activation loop phosphorylation leads to the ejection and disorder of the activation loop and rearrangement of helix αC and the G loop to generate a viable active site. Helix αC adopts a orientation different from that seen in activation loop mutants. The crystal structure of the complex formed by the autophosphorylated c-Met kinase domain and compound 1 reveals a significant induced fit conformational change of the G loop and ordering of the activation loop, explaining the selectivity of compound 1 for the autophosphorylated state. The results highlight the role of structural plasticity within the kinase domain in imparting the specificity of ligand binding and provide the framework for structure-guided design of activated c-Met inhibitors."

Direct acid extraction of whole adipocytes was more efficient, yielding about 100 µg of protein with histone content of 60% –70% from 10 mL of fat cells. Differential proteolysis of the protein extracts by trypsin or ArgC-protease followed by nanoLC/MS/MS with alternating CID/ETD peptide sequencing identified 19 histone variants. Four variants were found at the protein level for the first time; particularly HIST2H4B was identified besides the only H4 isoform earlier known to be expressed in humans. Three of the found H2A potentially organize small nucleosomes in transcriptionally active chromatin, while two H2AFY variants inactivate X chromosome in female cells. HIST1H2BA and three of the identified H1 variants had earlier been described only as oocyte or testis specific histones. H2AFX and H2AFY revealed differential and variable N-terminal processing. Out of 78 histone modifications by acetylation/trimethylation, methylation, dimethylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, identified from six subjects, 68 were found for the first time. Only 23 of these modifications were detected in two or more subjects, while all the others were individual specific. The direct acid extraction of adipocytes allows for personal epigenetic analyses of human fat tissue, for profiling of histone modifications related to obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, as well as for selection of individual medical treatments."

https://openalex.org/W2080060589,"Background Asymmetric zygotic division in higher plants results in the formation of an apical cell and a basal cell. These two embryonic cells possess distinct morphologies and cell developmental fates. It has been proposed that unevenly distributed cell fate determinants and/or distinct cell transcript profiles may be the underlying reason for their distinct fates. However, neither of these hypotheses has convincing support due to technical limitations. Methodology/Principal Findings Using laser-controlled microdissection, we isolated apical and basal cells and constructed cell type-specific cDNA libraries. Transcript profile analysis revealed difference in transcript composition. PCR and qPCR analysis confirmed that transcripts of selected embryogenesis-related genes were cell-type preferentially distributed. Some of the transcripts that existed in zygotes were found distinctly existed in apical or basal cells. The cell type specific de novo transcription was also found after zygotic cell division. Conclusions/Significance Thus, we found that the transcript diversity occurs between apical and basal cells. Asymmetric zygotic division results in the uneven distribution of some embryogenesis related transcripts in the two-celled proembryos, suggesting that a differential distribution of some specific transcripts in the apical or basal cells may involve in guiding the two cell types to different developmental destinies."

The one-electron reduced semiquinone forms transiently during the reaction, and the enzyme has been demonstrated to stabilize the semiquinone. The semiquinone is also formed in the D75E mutant, where the mutation has little influence on the catalytic activity, and in the D75H mutant, which is virtually inactive. In this work, wild-type cytochrome bo(3) as well as the D75E and D75H mutant proteins were prepared with ubiquinone-8 (13)C-labeled selectively at the methyl and two methoxy groups. This was accomplished by expressing the proteins in a methionine auxotroph in the presence of l-methionine with the side chain methyl group (13)C-labeled. The (13)C-labeled quinone isolated from cytochrome bo(3) was also used for the generation of model anion radicals in alcohol. Two-dimensional pulsed EPR and ENDOR were used for the study of the (13)C methyl and methoxy hyperfine couplings in the semiquinone generated in the three proteins indicated above and in the model system. The data were used to characterize the transferred unpaired spin densities on the methyl and methoxy substituents and the conformations of the methoxy groups. In the wild type and D75E mutant, the constraints on the configurations of the methoxy side chains are similar, but the D75H mutant appears to have altered methoxy configurations, which could be related to the perturbed electron distribution in the semiquinone and the loss of enzymatic activity."

In rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, CREB-dependent transcription is mediated by the cAMP-initiated CaMKII-sensitive and Ca(v)1.2-initiated CaMKII-insensitive mechanisms. The latter microdomains show a tendency to exhibit periodic behavior correlated with spontaneous contraction of myocytes suggestive of frequency-dependent CREB-dependent transcriptional regulation in the heart."
