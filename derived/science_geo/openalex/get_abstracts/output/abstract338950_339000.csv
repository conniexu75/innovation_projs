https://openalex.org/W2086220442,"American mathematical psychologists have developed computer-based methods for constructing representations of the psychological structure of a set of stimuli on the basis of pairwise measures of similarity or confusability. Applications to perceptual and semantic data illustrate how complementary aspects of the underlying psychological structure are revealed by different types of representations, including multidimensional spatial configurations and nondimensional tree-structures or clusterings."

By itself, the traditional engineering approach to the problem is no longer adequate. Genetic science offers the possibility of developing salt-tolerant crops, which, in conjunction with environmental manipulation, could improve agricultural production in saline regions and extend agriculture to previously unsuited regions."
https://openalex.org/W2035103376,Under stable meteorological conditions the effect of ship-stack exhaust on overlying clouds was detected in daytime satellite images as an enhancement in cloud reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers. The exhaust is a source of cloud-condensation nuclei that increases the number of cloud droplets while reducing droplet size. This reduction in droplet size causes the reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers to be greater than the levels for nearby noncontaminated clouds of similar physical characteristics. The increase in droplet number causes the reflectivity at 0.63 micrometer to be significantly higher for the contaminated clouds despite the likelihood that the exhaust is a source of particles that absorb at visible wavelengths. The effect of aerosols on cloud reflectivity is expected to have a larger influence on the earth's albedo than that due to the direct scattering and absorption of sunlight by the aerosols alone.
https://openalex.org/W2067286097,"Most knowledge about crime and criminals derives from cross-sectional analyses that link crime rates in a community with a community's attributes. The criminal-career approach focuses on individual offenders and considers their crime-committing patterns as a longitudinal stochastic process. This approach, which invokes parameters characterizing participation rate, initiation rate, termination rate and the associated career length, and individual offending frequency, offers some important new insights. For example, annual offending frequency appears to be reasonably constant with age for those offenders who stay criminally active, termination rates are relatively low for active offenders in their 30s, and offending frequencies seem to be relatively insensitive to demographic attributes for active offenders. All these observations are opposite to those that would be derived from cross-sectional analysis."

Both of these events occurred in August and were only 2 years apart. Data show that the period of deepest mixing and lake turnover also occurs during late summer in this region of tropical Africa. In addition, recent trends of decreases in both air temperatures and effective insolation relative to long-term means suggest that weakening of stratification, coupled with a predictable seasonal interval of reduced stability in August, may be responsible for the timing of these events."

https://openalex.org/W1994764232,"In February, 1927, on the Lucien Higgins ranch in Carpinteria in southern Santa Barbara County, California, a steam-shovel which was taking out road material over a deposit of asphalt disclosed some bones. These were brought to the attention of Mr. Norton Stuart, curator of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Mr. Stuart at once began an investigation of the field and after several attempts to locate the source of the earlier finds, at last discovered a mass of material which extends to a depth that has not yet been measured. Here, Mr. Stuart found a great number of bones of birds, mammals and rodents, together with pine cones, leaves and other plant material."
