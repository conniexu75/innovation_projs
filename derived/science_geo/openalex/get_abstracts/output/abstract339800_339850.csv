The construction of this apparatus for demonstration purposes will well repay the teacher and student. The sharp-coloured interference rings, obtained by using luminous gases in vacuum tubes as sources are extremely beautiful. The D lines from a sodium burner are easily separable. If the interference pattern, using a copper or iron arc, is focussed on a wide slit of a single-prism spectrometer, a section of the interference rings is seen in the various spectrum lines, illustrating the method of Fabry and Buisson, and Eversheim, for the determination of the new standard table of wave-lengths. The Zeeman effect can also be easily shown with this apparatus."
