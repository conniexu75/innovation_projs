https://openalex.org/W2113142309,"The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in a form that allows it to be integrated with other data. One approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved."
https://openalex.org/W2169494000,"Variants in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene are associated with increased body mass index in humans. Here, we show by bioinformatics analysis that FTO shares sequence motifs with Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent oxygenases. We find that recombinant murine Fto catalyzes the Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent demethylation of 3-methylthymine in single-stranded DNA, with concomitant production of succinate, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. Consistent with a potential role in nucleic acid demethylation, Fto localizes to the nucleus in transfected cells. Studies of wild-type mice indicate that Fto messenger RNA (mRNA) is most abundant in the brain, particularly in hypothalamic nuclei governing energy balance, and that Fto mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus are regulated by feeding and fasting. Studies can now be directed toward determining the physiologically relevant FTO substrate and how nucleic acid methylation status is linked to increased fat mass."

The miR-21 microRNA is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers and has been causally linked to cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Inhibition of mir-21 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells causes reduced cell growth. Using array expression analysis of MCF-7 cells depleted of miR-21, we have identified mRNA targets of mir-21 and have shown a link between miR-21 and the p53 tumor suppressor protein. We furthermore found that the tumor suppressor protein Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) is regulated by miR-21 and demonstrated that PDCD4 is a functionally important target for miR-21 in breast cancer cells.

In animals, miRNAs bind to partly complementary sequence motifs present predominantly within the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) and mediate translational repression, sometimes involving degradation of the target mRNA (7Bagga S.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6176-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Accordingly, aberrant miRNA expression has been linked to diseases, including cancer (13Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. Downing J.R. Jacks T. Horvitz H.R. Golub T.R.

Croce C.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6521) Google Scholar). Evidence for the causal involvement of miRNAs in cancer comes from several sources. First, mapping of fragile sites and chromosomal regions lost or amplified in cancer displays an intriguing overlap with the localization of miRNA genes (16Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Sevignani C. Calin G.A. Nnadi S.C. Shimizu M. Davuluri R.V. Hyslop T. Demant P. Croce C.M. Siracusa L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Second, genetic studies in model organisms have led to the identification of miRNAs with relevance for human cancer. This is exemplified by the analysis of let-7, which in Caenorhabditis elegans targets let-60/RAS and in humans is lost in some lung cancers, leading to overexpression of N-RAS (23Johnson S.M.

Third, forward genetic studies have demonstrated a role for the miR-17-92 cluster in lymphoma development in mice predisposed to cancer (24He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D.

Interestingly, miR-21 stands out as the miRNA most often found overexpressed in solid tumors (27Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Ambs S. Cimmino A. Petrocca F. Visone R. Iorio M. Roldo C. Ferracin M.

Furthermore, causal links between miR-21 expression and cancer-related processes such as proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and tumor growth have been demonstrated in human hepatocellular and breast cancer cells (11Meng F.

The widespread occurrence of miR-21 overexpression in cancer and the relatively few experimentally defined targets prompted us to perform expression array analyses of breast cancer cells transfected with miR-21 inhibitors to identify and functionally validate additional targets of miR-21.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Western Blot Analysis—MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected the following 2 days. The cells were harvested 5 days after the first transfection, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 1× Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate. 15 μg of protein/lane was separated on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The PDCD4 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Iwata Ozaki, Japan. The p53 and CDK6 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cofilin 2 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling and the vinculin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich.miRNA Precursors, Anti-miRNA Oligonucleotides, and siRNAs—The locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide inhibitors used for miRNA knock down were purchased from Exiqon. The miRNA precursor hairpins were purchased from Ambion. The PDCD4 SMARTpool siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon.Cell Culture—HEK293 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MCF-7 cells expressing an ecotropic receptor were transduced with pRetroSuper-shp53 (34Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar) or the empty pRetroSuper virus to obtain the MCF-7 shp53 and MCF-7 EV cell lines, respectively. For proliferation assays, MCF-7 cells were transferred to 1.0% fetal bovine serum prior to transfections with miRNA inhibitors.Vector Construction and Reporter Assays—A multiple cloning site was inserted into the pGL3 control vector (Invitrogen) at the XbaI site 3′ of the luciferase gene (hereafter pGL3). Six different fragments were PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3. The primer sequences used for PCR amplification were as follows (restriction sites are underlined).

Cells were fixed at indicated time points in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained in a 0.1% crystal violet solution, and resuspended in 10% acetic acid. Sample absorbance was measured at 620 nm. For cell viability assays, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected the following day with 50 nm LNA or siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. After 5-6 days of growth, cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation, supernatants were discarded and formazan crystals were dissolved in a 10% formic acid, 90% isopropanol solution. Sample absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm.Affymetrix Microarray—MCF-7 wells were seeded in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and triplicate independent transfections performed the following day with either 50 nm LNA-miR-21 or scrambled control LNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Total RNA was harvested 24 h post-transfection using TRIzol reagent. Affymetrix microarray analysis (HG-U133 Plus 2.0 human) was performed at the Microarray Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA using Superscript® Choice System (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The cDNA was subsequently used as template for an “in vitro” transcription reaction generating biotin-labeled antisense cRNA (BioArrayTM High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit; Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). After fragmentation at 94 °C for 35 min in 40 mm Tris, 30 mm MgOAc, 10 mm KOAc, samples were hybridized for 16 h to Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 human arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were washed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE), and the arrays were scanned in the Affymetrix GeneArray® 2500 scanner, exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip® protocol.Bioinformatic Analyses—The expression data were processed using the “affy” package in BioConductor. Probe set intensities were summarized using the Robust Multichip Average method and then transformed to generalized log values (approaches the natural logarithm for high values) with the variance stable VSN method (35Huber W. von Heydebreck A. Sultmann H. Poustka A. Vingron M. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: S96-S104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). In a final step, the six arrays were qspline-normalized. Differentially expressed genes were selected by a t test (p < 0.05), and two sets of probe sets were defined, the up and down-regulated, by additionally requiring reasonable average expression intensities (>2.87, 1st quartile) and high -fold changes (>± 0.168, mean ± 2 × S.D.) (supplemental Table S1, a and b). A third set of probe sets that do not change from control to experiment was defined by selecting probe sets with stable expression intensities (p > 0.95 and expression intensity S.D. < 0.06) and reasonable expression (>2.87) (supplemental Table S1c). The up, down, and no-change sets comprised 339, 258, and 195 probe sets, respectively.The probe sets were subsequently mapped to Ensembl transcripts (version 45) using the mappings provided at BioMart. Probe sets that mapped to two different Ensembl genes were discarded. Transcripts with 3′-UTR sequences shorter than 50 nucleotides and copies of transcript isoforms of the same gene with matching 3′-UTR sequences were discarded. The up, down, and no-change sets comprised 402, 335, and 262 transcripts, corresponding to 272, 215, and 164 genes. For the analysis of seed site enrichment, miRNA sequences from miRBase version 9.2 were used (36Griffiths-Jones S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 342: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTRs of the transcripts were scanned for matching 6-, 7-1A, 7-, and 8-mer (perfect 8-nucleotide match) miRNA seed sites (37Grimson A. Farh K.K. Johnston W.K. Garrett-Engele P. Lim L.P. Bartel D.P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). In the definition used, seed sites are contained in each other, that is, a given 6-mer site always also corresponds to a 7 mer and 8 mer. Note that this definition is different from the seed sites reported at TargetScan. The difference in the fraction of transcripts having seed sites in the up, down, and no-change sets was evaluated using one-sided p values from Fisher's exact test. When comparing all miRBase miRNAs, the -fold enrichment for a given miRNA is calculated by dividing the fraction of transcripts with a 7-mer seed site in the up set with the same fraction in the down (or no-change) set.In an unbiased word analysis, all words of length 7 were investigated for over-representation in the up versus the down sets.

Inhibition of miR-21 leads to growth suppression and apoptosis in glioblastoma and breast cancer cell lines, and loss of miR-21 can inhibit MCF-7 cell-derived tumor growth in vivo (30Chan J.A. Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar, 31Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y.

MCF-7 cells express substantial amounts of miR-21 (supplemental Fig. S1), and consistent with previous findings, we observed a dose-dependent suppression of MCF-7 cell growth upon inhibition of miR-21 with an LNA-derived oligonucleotide inhibitor (Fig. 1A). Co-transfection of the LNA inhibitor with a luciferase reporter containing perfect complementarity to the mature miR-21 sequence (pmiR-21-luc) results in marked de-repression of luciferase activity, demonstrating a highly effective inhibition of endogenous miR-21 mediated by the LNA inhibitor (supplemental Fig. S2). The underlying mechanism of the role of miR-21 in tumorigenesis remains unclear, as only few targets for this miRNA have been experimentally verified (11Meng F. Henson R. Wehbe-Janek H. Ghoshal K.

Given the importance of PTEN in regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway and the frequency of PTEN mutations or silencing in a variety of cancers (38Chow L.M. Baker S.J. Cancer Lett. 2006; 241: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), this constitutes an appealing explanation for the overexpression of miR-21 observed in many cancer types (27Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Ambs S. Cimmino A. Petrocca F. Visone R. Iorio M. Roldo C. Ferracin M. Prueitt R.L. Yanaihara N. Lanza G. Scarpa A. Vecchione A. Negrini M. Harris C.C. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl.

To investigate the role of the PTEN-miR-21 interaction in breast cancer cells, we transfected MCF-7 cells with a miR-21 precursor, a miR-21 inhibitor, and appropriate controls. Interestingly, these treatments caused only subtle changes in PTEN protein levels (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that cell- and tissue type-specific differences may result in different functional miR-21 targets.Identification and Validation of miR-21 Targets by Microarray Analysis—To identify targets of miR-21 that can explain the proliferation defect observed upon miR-21 inhibition in breast cancers cells, we performed microarray expression analyses using total RNA harvested from MCF-7 cells 24 h after transfection with either LNA-miR-21 or a scrambled control LNA not affecting cellular proliferation (Fig. 1B). We reasoned that cellular mRNAs subjected to increased degradation due to binding of endogenous miR-21 would be up-regulated upon miR-21 inhibition and that specific inhibition of the endogenous miR-21 may cause fewer off-target effects than transfection with exogenous miRNA. Following normalization and statistical analysis we found 737 transcripts with significantly different expression between the LNA-miR-21-transfected cells and the controls, of which 402 (55%) were up-regulated and 335 (45%) down-regulated upon miR-21 inhibition (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). To verify the array analysis, 18 up-regulated mRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of RNA from an independent experiment. Ten of the genes chosen for validation contained at least one miR-21 7-mer seed match, two contained a 6-mer, and six did not contain miR-21 seed matches in their 3′-UTR. All 18 genes showed, to varying degrees, increased mRNA expression levels upon miR-21 inhibition (Fig. 2B). It is unclear whether the mRNAs without matches to the miR-21 seed sequence are direct targets or whether their regulation is a result of secondary effects.FIGURE 2Identification of miR-21 targets.A, cluster heat map of Affymetrix microarray analyses of six independent biological samples showing the 402 transcripts significantly up-regulated by miR-21 inhibition in red and the 335 significantly down-regulated transcripts in blue. B, quantitative reverse transcription PCR validation of 18 up-regulated transcripts from an independent transfection experiment. CDKN1A, FAS, FAM3C, HIPK3, PRRG4, and ACTA2 do not contain matches to the miR-21 seed region, BTG2 and SESN1 contain a 6-mer seed match, and the remaining mRNAs harbor at least one 7-mer seed match. For each transcript the values are normalized to the LNA-scrambled control samples, and error bars represent ± S.D. of three replicates.

D, frequency distribution of 7-mer seed matches for all miRNAs in miRBase showing a marked over-representation of the miR-21 seed match in the up-versus down-regulated genes. miR-590 and miR-21 have identical seed sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To get a qualitative assessment of the data, we analyzed for the presence of different types of miR-21 seed matches among the genes regulated by miR-21 inhibition. Notably, we found very significant over-representations of all miR-21 seed match categories among the genes up-regulated by miR-21 inhibition relative to gene sets that exhibited no change or down-regulated expression, strongly suggesting that inhibition of endogenous miRNAs can be used to identify bona fide targets (Fig. 2C). In effect, the motif complementary to a 7-mer miR-21 seed sequence (or miR-590, holding the exact same seed sequence) is by far the most prevalent motif when analyzing the 3′-UTRs of the up-regulated transcripts against all seed sequences present in miRBase (36Griffiths-Jones S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 342: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). In addition, an unbiased analysis for the frequency of all possible 7-mer sequence motifs, regardless of whether these match known mi-RNAs, shows that the miR-21 complementary motif is very highly enriched (p < 4 × 10-12) and represents the most frequently occurring sequence motif in the 3′-UTRs of the up-regulated versus the down-regulated transcripts.

https://openalex.org/W2004155851,"We report the first successful use of irreversible electroporation for the minimally invasive treatment of aggressive cutaneous tumors implanted in mice. Irreversible electroporation is a newly developed non-thermal tissue ablation technique in which certain short duration electrical fields are used to permanently permeabilize the cell membrane, presumably through the formation of nanoscale defects in the cell membrane. Mathematical models of the electrical and thermal fields that develop during the application of the pulses were used to design an efficient treatment protocol with minimal heating of the tissue. Tumor regression was confirmed by histological studies which also revealed that it occurred as a direct result of irreversible cell membrane permeabilization. Parametric studies show that the successful outcome of the procedure is related to the applied electric field strength, the total pulse duration as well as the temporal mode of delivery of the pulses. Our best results were obtained using plate electrodes to deliver across the tumor 80 pulses of 100 µs at 0.3 Hz with an electrical field magnitude of 2500 V/cm. These conditions induced complete regression in 12 out of 13 treated tumors, (92%), in the absence of tissue heating. Irreversible electroporation is thus a new effective modality for non-thermal tumor ablation."
https://openalex.org/W2060441844,"Production of type I interferon (IFN-I) is a critical host defense triggered by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system. Deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA), an ovarian tumor domain-containing deubiquitinating enzyme, was discovered in a small interfering RNA–based screen as a regulator of IFN-I production. Reduction of DUBA augmented the PRR-induced IFN-I response, whereas ectopic expression of DUBA had the converse effect. DUBA bound tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3 (TRAF3), an adaptor protein essential for the IFN-I response. TRAF3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that preferentially assembled lysine-63–linked polyubiquitin chains. DUBA selectively cleaved the lysine-63–linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3, resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signaling complex containing TANK-binding kinase 1. A discrete ubiquitin interaction motif within DUBA was required for efficient deubiquitination of TRAF3 and optimal suppression of IFN-I. Our data identify DUBA as a negative regulator of innate immune responses."

We show that asymmetric mating interactions between closely related but previously allopatric genetic groups of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a haplodiploid species, have been a driving force contributing to widespread invasion and displacement by alien populations. We conducted long-term field surveys, caged population experiments, and detailed behavioral observations in Zhejiang, China, and Queensland, Australia, to investigate the invasion process and its underlying behavioral mechanisms. During invasion and displacement, we found increased frequency of copulation leading to increased production of female progeny among the invader, as well as reduced copulation and female production in the indigenous genetic groups. Such asymmetric mating interactions may be critical to determining the capacity of a haplodiploid invader and the consequences for its closely related indigenous organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2114350791,"Defects in Niemann-Pick, Type C-1 protein (NPC1) cause cholesterol, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and glycolipids to accumulate in lysosomes of liver, spleen, and brain. In cultured fibroblasts, NPC1 deficiency causes lysosomal retention of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol after uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. NPC1 contains 1278 amino acids that form 13 membrane-spanning helices and three large loops that project into the lumen of lysosomes. We showed earlier that NPC1 binds cholesterol and oxysterols. Here we localize the binding site to luminal loop-1, a 240-amino acid domain with 18 cysteines. When produced in cultured cells, luminal loop-1 was secreted as a soluble dimer. This loop bound [3H]cholesterol (Kd, 130 nm) and [3H]25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC, Kd, 10 nm) with one sterol binding site per dimer. Binding of both sterols was competed by oxysterols (24-, 25-, and 27-HC). Unlabeled cholesterol competed strongly for binding of [3H]cholesterol, but weakly for [3H]25-HC binding. Binding of [3H]cholesterol but not [3H]25-HC was inhibited by detergents. We also studied NPC2, a soluble protein whose deficiency causes a similar disease phenotype. NPC2 bound cholesterol, but not oxysterols. Epicholesterol and cholesteryl sulfate competed for [3H]cholesterol binding to NPC2, but not NPC1. Glutamine 79 in luminal loop-1 of NPC-1 is important for sterol binding; a Q79A mutation abolished binding of [3H]cholesterol and [3H]25-HC to full-length NPC1. Nevertheless, the Q79A mutant restored cholesterol transport to NPC1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, the sterol binding site on luminal loop-1 is not essential for NPC1 function in fibroblasts, but it may function in other cells where NPC1 deficiency produces more complicated lipid abnormalities.

The clinical spectrum in patients with this lipid storage disorder is wide. Most subjects manifest in childhood with a devastating syndrome that includes enlargement of liver and spleen, lung disease, and neurological degeneration manifested by ataxia, dysarthria, gaze palsies, and progressive dementia, usually resulting in death before age 20 (5Vanier M.T. Millat G. Clin. Genet. 2003; 64: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The liver and spleen accumulate unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and a variety of phospholipids and glycosphingolipids. Brain tissue does not contain a gross excess of cholesterol or sphingomyelin, but there is a distinct elevation of glycosphingolipids (5Vanier M.T. Millat G. Clin. Genet. 2003; 64: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Recent studies of a mouse model of NPC1 disease indicate that neurons may accumulate excess cholesterol, but this accumulation is masked at a gross level by a decline in the amount of cholesterol in myelin (6Xie C.

Acta. 2004; 1685: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These cells exhibit a striking defect in the disposal of cholesterol that has entered the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis initiated by binding to low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. After uptake in coated vesicles, ingested LDL is delivered to lysosomes where the cholesteryl esters, which constitute the bulk of its cholesterol, are hydrolyzed. The unesterified cholesterol exits the lysosome and is transported to other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the cholesterol exerts two regulatory actions that maintain cholesterol homeostasis: 1) it blocks the ER exit and subsequent proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that increase cholesterol synthesis (8Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), and 2) it activates acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), an enzyme that re-esterifies cholesterol for storage as cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester droplets (9Brown M.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fibroblasts from NPC patients, LDL enters cells normally, and the cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed in lysosomes, but the liberated cholesterol remains trapped as free cholesterol in lysosomes. As a result of this exit block, LDL-derived cholesterol fails to inhibit SREBP processing (11Infante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A. Dale J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a 1278-amino acid integral membrane protein, now known as NPC1, which resides in late endosomes and lysosomes of cultured cells. Mutations in the murine version of NPC1 are responsible for the defect in BALB/c npcnih mice, and the hamster version is defective in CT 60 cells. Evidence indicates that NPC1 is a polytopic membrane protein with 13 membrane-spanning helices (16Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The protein has a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence, which targets the protein for insertion into membranes, three large luminal loops, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal segment that includes a dileucine sequence, which targets the protein to lysosomes (17Watari H.

The similarity in phenotypes between NPC1 and NPC2 mutations strongly suggests that the two proteins function sequentially in a pathway that releases cholesterol from lysosomes, but the order of their actions has not been determined (30Sleat D.E.

Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 11Infante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A. Dale J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 1052-1063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, oxysterols do not traverse lysosomes, and there is no evidence that they require the actions of NPC1 or NPC2 to reach the ER. We were therefore surprised to find that a purified membrane-bound, oxysterol-binding protein turned out to be NPC1. In further studies we showed that recombinant human NPC1 bound cholesterol as well as oxysterols, but cholesterol binding occurred only when the detergent concentration was reduced below micellar levels (11Infante R.E.

In the current studies we localize the sterol binding site in human NPC1 to luminal loop-1. Using recombinant DNA technology, we prepare luminal loop-1 as a soluble protein of 240 amino acids that is secreted by cells. Purified luminal loop-1 binds oxysterols and cholesterol with high affinity. We characterize this binding reaction and provide evidence that luminal loop-1 contains the majority, if not all, of the cholesterol-binding activity of NPC1.

Plasmid Constructions—pCMV-NPC1-His8-FLAG encodes wild-type human NPC1 followed sequentially by eight histidines and a FLAG tag under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This plasmid was constructed as described in the accompanying report (11Infante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A. Dale J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Each dish was transfected with one of the following plasmids: 5 μg of pCMV-NPC1-His8-FLAG, 5 μg of pCMV-NPC1-(1-307;1254-1278)-His8-FLAG, 5 μg of pCMV-NPC1-(1-264)-His8-FLAG(wild-typeor the indicated mutant versions), or 5 μg of pCMV-NPC2-His8. After 16 h, the transfected cells were used for purification of NPC1 proteins as described below. Mutant CHO 4-4-19 cells, defective in NPC1 (31Dahl N.K. Reed K.L. Daunais M.S. Faust J.R. Liscum L.

The defective NPC1 in 4-4-19 cells results from an amino acid substitution (Gly-660 to Arg). 6L. Liscum, personal communication. On day 0, 4-4-19 cells were set up in medium A containing 5% fetal calf serum at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. On day 2, each dish was transfected in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) with the indicated plasmid, using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions. After 5 h, the medium was switched to medium A containing 5% newborn calf LPDS. After 16 h, the cells were used for assays of ACAT and SREBP-2 processing. Purification of Full-length NPC1 and Internally Deleted NPC1-(1-307;1254-1278) from Transfected CHO Cells—Recombinant NPC1 proteins were overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells as described above and purified in buffer A or B by nickel and M2 anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography as previously described (11Infante R.E.

Purification of Secreted Forms of NPC1-(25-264) and NPC2 from Medium of Transfected CHO Cells—Recombinant NPC1 and NPC2 proteins were overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells as described above. On day 3, the medium was switched to medium A containing 1% (v/v) Cellgro® ITS (Fisher Scientific). After 24 h, the medium was collected and fresh medium A containing 1% Cellgro® ITS was added. This was done for 3 consecutive days for each group of transfected cells. After each collection, the medium was subjected to centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and then filtered through an Express PLUS 0.22-μm filter apparatus (Millipore). Medium was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminum foil. Gravity columns were each filled with a 20-ml slurry of Ni-NTA-agarose beads, after which each column was pre-equilibrated with 4 column volumes of buffer C. Filtered medium (1 liter per column) was then passed overnight at 4 °C through each Ni-NTA-agarose column ∼1 ml/min. Each column was washed sequentially with 50 ml of buffer C containing 20 mm and 40 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 50 ml of buffer C containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction containing NPC1-(25-264)-His8-FLAG or NPC2-His8 was concentrated to 0.5 ml by using a spin concentrator with an Amicon Ultracel 30K or 10K Filter Device (Millipore), respectively. The concentrated material was then subjected to gel-filtration chromatography on a 24-ml Superdex-200 column that was pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The fractions containing the peak A280 activity and eluting between 12.5 and 15 ml (for NPC1-(25-264)-His8-FLAG) or between 16 and 18 ml (for NPC2-His8) were pooled, and their protein content was quantified by either the BCA kit (Pierce) or the Lowry method (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining to determine purity. Ni-NTA-Agarose Assay for 3H-Sterol Binding—For the standard assay of wild-type and mutant versions of NPC1 and NPC2, each reaction contained, in a final volume of 80 μl of buffer A, either [3H]25-HC (165-180 dpm/fmol) or [3H]cholesterol (132 dpm/fmol) delivered in ethanol (final [3H]sterol concentration, 10-400 nm), 1 μg of BSA as indicated, and varying amounts of NPC1 or NPC2 protein. After incubation for 4 or 16 h at 4 °C, the mixture was loaded onto a column packed with 0.3 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated with the appropriate assay buffer. Each column was washed for ∼15 min with 5-6 ml of buffer B, except for the experiments described in Fig. 6. The protein-bound [3H]sterol was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer B and quantified by scintillation counting as previously described (Radhakrishnan et al. (21Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)). For competition experiments with unlabeled sterols, the standard assays were carried out in the presence of the indicated unlabeled sterol (0-3 μm) delivered in ethanol (final ethanol concentration, 1-4%). In each experiment, all tubes received the same amount of ethanol. Glycosidase Treatments—Each reaction, in a final volume of 42 μl, was carried out according to the manufacturer's directions (New England Biolabs) for 16 h at 37 °C with the indicated amount of purified protein in the presence or absence of 4000 units of EndoH or 5000 units of peptide N-glycosidase F. SREBP-2 Processing in Cultured Cells—Mutant CHO 4-4-19 cells (defective in NPC1) were transfected as described above. On day 3, the medium was switched to medium A containing 5% newborn calf LPDS, 5 μm compactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate. On day 4, the cells received fresh medium A supplemented with 5% newborn calf LPDS, 50 μm compactin, 50 μm sodium mevalonate, and various concentrations of β-VLDL or 25-HC. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml of N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal for 1 h and then harvested. Duplicate dishes were pooled for preparation of nuclear extract and 100,000 × g membrane fractions, which were then analyzed by immunoblotting for SREBP-2 (described below). Immunoblot Analysis—The procedure for immunoblot analysis and the concentrations of antibodies used are exactly as described in the accompanying report (11Infante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A.

Epitope-tagged SREBP-2 was detected with 0.2 μg/ml IgG-HSV-Tag™, a monoclonal antibody directed against the glycoprotein D epitope of HSV (Novagen, Inc). ACAT Assay—The rate of incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesterol [14C]oleate and [14C]triglycerides by intact cell monolayers was measured as previously described (33Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K.

To localize the region in NPC1 that binds 25-HC, we created plasmids encoding the first 307, 644, 809, or 1178 amino acids of the protein fused to a fragment comprising the C-terminal 24 amino acids, which contains the lysosomal targeting signal.

https://openalex.org/W2070085283,"Previous work on intact thylakoid membranes showed that transient formation of a zeaxanthin radical cation was correlated with regulation of photosynthetic light-harvesting via energy-dependent quenching. A molecular mechanism for such quenching was proposed to involve charge transfer within a chlorophyll-zeaxanthin heterodimer. Using near infrared (880-1100 nm) transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that carotenoid (mainly zeaxanthin) radical cation generation occurs solely in isolated minor light-harvesting complexes that bind zeaxanthin, consistent with the engagement of charge transfer quenching therein. We estimated that less than 0.5% of the isolated minor complexes undergo charge transfer quenching in vitro, whereas the fraction of minor complexes estimated to be engaged in charge transfer quenching in isolated thylakoids was more than 80 times higher. We conclude that minor complexes which bind zeaxanthin are sites of charge transfer quenching in vivo and that they can assume Non-quenching and Quenching conformations, the equilibrium LHC(N) ⇆ LHC(Q) of which is modulated by the transthylakoid pH gradient, the PsbS protein, and protein-protein interactions.

Higher plant photosynthesis is initiated by absorption of light in pigment-binding (antenna) proteins that transfer absorbed solar energy to the reaction centers of photosystems (PS) 3The abbreviations used are: PSphotosystemLHClight-harvesting complexesNPQnon-photochemical quenchingZzeaxanthinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineVviolaxanthinAantheraxanthinTAtransient absorptionNIRnear infrared region.

The PSII-associated light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) bind chlorophylls and carotenoids that are involved in both the harvesting and transfer of energy to the reaction center, and the harmless dissipation of excitation energy in excess of photosynthetic capacity (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Thus, the PSII LHCs are critical branch-points for energy partitioning during photosynthesis. The peripheral antenna consists of trimeric complexes composed of LHCII proteins, the major LHC of higher plant antennae. In between the peripheral LHCII and the reaction center there are three minor LHCs referred to as CP24, CP26, and CP29 (1Green B.R. Durnford D.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The predominant component of NPQ is referred to as energy-dependent quenching, or qE, and it is rapidly reversible and correlated with zeaxanthin (Z) formation (4Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys.

The PsbS protein has been subsequently proposed to be involved in controlling qE by sensing thylakoid lumen pH (7Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Golan T. Kramer D. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol.

The xanthophyll cycle consists of the enzymatic and reversible conversion of the thylakoid-associated pigment violaxanthin (V) to antheraxanthin (A) and Z (8Yamamoto H.Y. Nakayama T.O. Chichester C.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Very little qE is exhibited in the A. thaliana mutant referred to as npq1 which is impaired in its ability to convert V to Z as a result of a lesion in the gene encoding the thylakoid lumen-localized enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase (5Niyogi K.K.

Conversely, the npq2 mutant of A. thaliana constitutively accumulates Z and lacks V and neoxanthin because of a lesion in the gene encoding Z epoxidase (5Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Bjorkman O.

Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These results, along with the spectral signature (13Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), imply that the Car.+ transiently formed in the wild type thylakoids is a Z.+ species. The quenching of bulk chlorophyll by transfer of energy to a [Chl-Z] quenching complex that undergoes charge separation and subsequent recombination to the ground state provides a simple model for qE (13Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Initiation of qE invokes a conformational change of at least one of the LHCs, triggered by contributions from ΔpH, PsbS, and Z (16Horton P. Wentworth M. Ruban A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4201-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This implies that an equilibrium exists between non-quenching (N) and quenching (Q) forms: LHC(N) ⇆ LHC(Q). Indeed the presence of distinct N and Q conformations in detergent solution has been reported on the basis of spectroscopic measurements (17Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and confirmed by biochemical methods (19Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At low light (i.e. in the absence of significant ΔpH, Z, etc.), the equilibrium must lie well to the left (non-quenching form). However, if Z becomes a major xanthophyll that is present, it is possible that a small fraction of the complexes are in the LHC(Q) configuration and may be detectable, e.g. Z alone can shift the equilibrium somewhat to the right. In this article, we present evidence using the Z.+ signal as a diagnostic that this is indeed the case for the minor LHCs (CP24, CP26, and CP29). Using the Z.+ signature to infer CT quenching, we estimate that ∼80 times more of the minor complexes undergo CT quenching in thylakoids engaged in steady-state qE in comparison to isolated complexes. Taken together our results are suggestive of the minor complexes being sites of CT quenching in vivo. Isolation of Antenna LHCs with Specific XanthophyllsUn-stacked thylakoids were isolated from leaves of dark-adapted wild type, conditions under which V accumulates, and npq2 strains of A. thaliana as previously described (20Bassi R. Hoyer-Hansen G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized samples were then fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a 0.1-1 m sucrose gradient containing 0.06% α-DM and 10 mm HEPES at a pH of 7.5 (22 h at 280,000 g, 4 °C). This procedure yields distinct bands from which monomeric (Band 2) and trimeric LHCII (Band 3) complexes can be separated (19Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of Bands 2 and 3 from dark-adapted wild type and npq2 mutant strains was performed with a Tris-Tricine buffer system as described in Ref. 21Schagger H. von Jagow g. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar. Pigments were extracted from the isolated antenna complexes with 80% acetone, then separated and quantified by HPLC as described in Ref. 22Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and by fitting analysis of the spectrum of the acetone extract with the spectra of individual pigments as described in Ref. 23Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar. Trimeric LHCII and monomeric complexes were resuspended in buffer solution (5 mm HEPES and 0.06% α-DM at pH 7.6) to an OD of ∼0.3/mm (all samples were adjusted to the same O.D. at 650 nm) and ∼0.05/cm at 650 nm for TA and time-resolved fluorescence analyses, respectively. The genes for the three monomeric LHCII polypeptides (Lhcb 1-3) were individually expressed in E. coli, the apoproteins were isolated, followed by in vitro re-constitution with chlorophylls (a and b), lutein and either V or Z. NIR Transient AbsorbanceThe NIR TA laser system has been previously described (13Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Briefly, the repetition rate was 250 kHz and the pump pulses were tuned to ∼650 nm (i.e. the chlorophyll b Qy transition). The maximum pump energy and FWHM of the pulse auto-correlation trace were ∼48 nJ/pulse (±2% S.D.) and ∼40 fs, respectively. We chose 650 nm as our excitation wavelength because the output power of our OPA was higher than that at 680 nm, yielding higher signal/noise ratios. Chlorophyll b to a energy transfer occurs on the 100-200 fs and tens of ps time scale (24Croce R. Muller M.G. Bassi R. Holzwarth A.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2508-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), making results on the time scale studied here insensitive to whether chlorophyll b or chlorophyll a is initially excited. White light continuum probe pulses were generated in a 1-mm quartz plate. The observation of the cross-correlation function of the pump and probe over-lap was ∼85 fs. The diameters of the pump and probe beams at the sample holder were 141 μm and 81 μm, respectively. The mutual polarizations of the pump and probe beams were set to the magic angle (54.7 °). The time resolution of our TA measurements was 5ps/point (-60 ps to -10 ps), 0.5 ps/point (-10 ps to 60 ps), and 5 ps/point (65 ps to 600 ps). A monochromator (Spectra Pro 300i, Acton Research Corp., Acton, MA) with a spectral resolution of 2 nm and a InGaAs photodiode (DET410, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) was used to monitor transmission. A sample cell for isolated LHCs with a path length of 1 mm was chilled by a circulating water bath (VWR Scientific 1160, Poly-Scientific, Niles, IL), which was set at 7 °C during the data acquisition to prevent sample degradation. The path length of the cuvette used for isolated thylakoids was 2 mm and was continuously rotated (0.2 Hz) during experiments to avoid sample degradation. Measurements of Fluorescence LifetimesTime-resolved fluorescence was detected using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. A Ti:sapphire oscillator (1.1 watts at 910 nm, 76 MHz Coherent MIRA 900) pumped an optical parametric oscillator (Coherent MIRA OPO). Output pulses with 110 milliwatt average power at 1300 nm were frequency doubled in a 1-mm BBO crystal to generate 650-nm pulses with an average power of ∼7 milliwatt. Using a home-made pulse picker driven by a RF frequency generator (CAMAC CD 1000), the repetition rate of the excitation laser beam was reduced to 3.8 MHz. Fluorescence signals were detected by a temperature-controlled microchannel plate photomultiplier (Hamamatsu, R2809U-01) and amplified by a preamplifier (Becker & Hickl GmbH, HFAC-26dB). Triggering pulses were obtained by partial reflection of the excitation beam with a silicon photodiode (Newport, 818-BB-20) and a 1 GHz preamplifier (EG&G ORTEC, 9306). A personal computer with a TCSPC module (Becker and Hickl GmbH, SPC-600) was used for data collection and processing. The resulting instrument function had a FWHM of ∼40 ps. The timing card for our TCSPC set up possessed 6.1 ps/channel resolution. The maximum amplitude of the signals was greater than 15,000-20,000 counts. PAM Chlorophyll a Fluorescence of Isolated ThylakoidsA pulsed amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll a fluorimeter, as described in Ref. 13Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, was used to measure modulated fluorescence in intact, stacked A. thaliana thylakoids that were isolated as in Ref. 13Holt N.E.

Isolation of PSII LHCs Containing Specific Xanthophyll SpeciesOur aim was to determine whether CT quenching could be supported in isolated LHCs with specific xanthophyll compositions. Fig. 1 shows SDS-PAGE analysis of whole thylakoids (lane A) and Bands 2 (monomeric complexes) and 3 (trimeric LHCII complexes) from dark-adapted wild type (lanes B and C) and npq2 (lanes D and E) strains. Band 2 from both wild type and npq2 consist of all three minor complexes as well the all three monomeric isoforms of LHCII (Lhcbs 1-3). Band 3 from npq2 and wild type proved to be trimeric LHCII. We could not detect PsbS in Bands 2 and 3 from either wild type or npq2 (data not shown). The LHCs isolated from dark-adapted wild type and npq2 are expected to be specifically enriched in V and Z, respectively. We performed HPLC to analyze the xanthophyll content of Bands 2 and 3 of npq2 and wild-type strains (Table 1). Consistent with the npq2 phenotype, Band 2 (monomers) from this strain possessed 9.3 Z molecules per 100 chlorophylls, whereas A and V were not detected. Conversely, Band 2 from dark-adapted wild-type thylakoids exhibited no detectable Z/A, while there were 5.2 V molecules per 100 chlorophylls. LHCII trimeric complexes (Band 3) from wild-type and npq2 strains contained no detectable Z and 6.6 Z molecules/100 chlorophylls, respectively. These data are consistent with the LHCs isolated from dark-adapted wild type and npq2 strains binding V and Z, respectively. The LHCs isolated from dark-adapted wild-type thylakoids are referred to throughout as MLHC-V (Monomeric LHCs enriched with V) and LHCII-V (trimeric LHCII complexes binding V), whereas the complexes isolated from npq2 thylakoids are referred to as MLHC-Z (monomeric LHCs that bind Z) and LHCII-Z (trimeric LHCII complexes that bind Z).TABLE 1HPLC analyses of sucrose gradient Bands 2 and 3 from wild type and npq2SampleVaV, violaxanthin.AbA, anteraxanthin.LutcLut, lutein.ZdZ, zeaxanthin.Wt B25.2ePigment numbers are on a per 100 chlorophyll basis.0.011.50.0Wt B33.20.015.50.0npq2 B20.00.010.79.3npq2 B30.00.016.26.6a V, violaxanthin.b A, anteraxanthin.c Lut, lutein.d Z, zeaxanthin.e Pigment numbers are on a per 100 chlorophyll basis. Open table in a new tab Evidence for Transient Z.+Formation Solely in Minor ComplexesTo explore whether or not transient Car.+ formation could be supported in isolated LHCII and MLHC complexes, NIR TA kinetic traces were measured by photoexcitation of the monomeric (Fig. 2A) and LHCII trimeric (Fig. 2B) complexes at 650 nm. The MLHC-V NIR TA kinetic profile at 1000 nm (black trace) exhibited two decay components with time constants of 60 ps and 1087 ps (Table 2). These pure decay features (i.e. no slow rise component) originate solely from chlorophyll excited state absorbance (ESA) dynamics (13Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and are therefore inconsistent with Car.+ formation.TABLE 2Transient absorption time constants and amplitudes of monomeric complexesMLHC-VMLHC-ZDifferenceτr/ps2.9 ± 0.35.2 ± 0.7τ1/ps60 ± 3 (49%)69 ± 7 (35%)238 ± 22τ2/ps1087 ± 61 (51%)358 ± 31 (65%) Open table in a new tab Similarly, the LHCII-V and LHCII-Z TA traces at 1000 nm exhibit bi-exponential decays without any rise component (Fig. 2B), consistent with recent observations (15Amarie S. Standfuss J. Barros T. Kulbrandt W. Dreuw A. Wachtveitl J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 3481-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), yielding time constants of 43 ps and 799 ps for LHCII-V complexes and 67 ps and 954 ps for the counterparts that bind Z (Table 3). These pure decay kinetics in LHCII correspond to chlorophyll ESA dynamics, rather than transient Car.+ formation, even when LHCII binds Z. To explore the slight differences between the NIR TA traces of the LHCII-V and LHCII-Z complexes, we generated a difference kinetic trace (blue curve), obtained by subtracting the LHCII-V kinetics from those of the LHCII-Z complexes, and found differences which were of the same amplitude as the noise level before time 0. Furthermore, the convoluted rise time constant (∼50 ps) seems to be equal to the fastest decay components of the LHCII-V or -Z kinetics, which likely originates from a slight difference in chlorophyll ESA, or singlet-singlet annihilation, between the two types of complexes.TABLE 3Transient absorption time constants and amplitudes of LHCII-V and -Z complexesLHCII-VLHCII-Zτ1/ps43 ± 2 (49%)67 ± 7 (46%)τ2/ps799 ± 49 (51%)954 ± 130 (54%) Open table in a new tab In contrast, the 1000-nm TA kinetic of the MLHC-Z sample (Fig. 2A, red trace) shows a small rise component with a time constant of 2.9 ps (the amplitude was less than 5%), followed by bi-exponential decay of 69 ps and 358 ps (Table 2). The differences between the MLHC-V and MLHC-Z kinetics are emphasized in the NIR TA difference profile (Fig. 2A, blue trace) that was characterized by 5.2 ps and 238 ps rise and decay components, respectively (Table 2). The time constants of the difference profile from the MLHCs are comparable to those of the corresponding rise and decay time constants of the difference TA kinetics acquired using isolated thylakoids, providing evidence for CT quenching in isolated complexes. The modest differences between the MLHCs and thylakoids in the rise and decay time constants may reflect differences in the dynamics of singlet-singlet annihilation and influences of the protein environment on charge recombination within the [Chl-Z] complex. The MLHC-Z sample contains several monomeric complexes (Fig. 1) from which the Car.+ signal could originate. Fig. 3 shows NIR TA kinetics for all three of the individual LHCII monomers that were re-constituted in vitro with either V or Z (Table 4). Whether bound by Z or V, the TA kinetics for all three LHCII monomers correspond solely to chlorophyll ESA dynamics, inconsistent with Car.+ formation in these complexes. These combined results imply that the transient Car.+ signal observed in the MLHC-Z sample most likely originates within the minor complexes that bind Z.TABLE 4Pigment composition of recombinant proteins obtained by in vitro-reconstitution with purified pigments of apoproteins for Lhcb 1, 2, 3 genes encoding the components of trimeric LHCIISample# ChlaChl, chlorophyll.Chl a/bChl/CarbCar, carotenoid.NeocNeo, neoxanthin.VdV, violaxanthin.AeA, anteroxanthin.LutZfZ, zeaxanthin.Beta caroteneCar totalLhcb1-Z12.01.55.10.00.00.01.41.00.02.4Lhcb2-Z12.01.55.20.00.00.01.31.00.02.3Lhcb3-Z12.01.55.10.00.00.01.41.00.02.4Lhcb1-V12.01.43.80.80.30.02.00.00.03.1Lhcb2-V12.01.43.80.80.30.02.00.00.03.2Lhcb3-V12.01.43.80.70.40.02.10.00.03.2a Chl, chlorophyll.b Car, carotenoid.c Neo, neoxanthin.d V, violaxanthin.e A, anteroxanthin.f Z, zeaxanthin. Open table in a new tab The Car.+ species observed in the MLHC-Z sample could be either a lutein radical cation (Lut.+) or aZ.+(Table 1). Fig. 4 shows a TA spectrum that was reconstructed from the maximum amplitude (i.e. at ∼15 ps) of a series of NIR TA difference profiles that were obtained by probing from 880 to 1080 nm. The spectrum exhibits broad absorption with a peak centered at ∼980 nm (Fig. 4), a blue shift of ∼20 nm relative to the Z.+ spectrum previously obtained in spinach thylakoids (13Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), possibly representing species-dependent differences in Z.+ absorption. However, the peak of the Z.+ spectrum in the protein environment was recently shown to be centered at ∼980 nm (15Amarie S. Standfuss J. Barros T. Kulbrandt W. Dreuw A. Wachtveitl J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 3481-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results imply that the observed transient Car.+ signal in the MLHC-Z sample represents Z.+ formation. Nonetheless, since the MLHC-V and MLHC-Z samples contain 11.5 lutein molecules/100 chlorophylls (Table 1), an alternative interpretation is that the observed Car.+ signal is a Lut.+. The spectrum of the Lut.+ peaks at ∼920 and ∼950 nm depending upon the solvent used (25Edge R. Land E.J. McGarvey D. Mulroy L. Truscott T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4087-4090Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Galinato M.G. Niedzwiedzki D. Deal C. Birge R.R. Frank H.A. Photosynth.

Food Chem. 1997; 45: 2970-2977Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and has recently also been reported to peak at 880 nm (15Amarie S. Standfuss J. Barros T. Kulbrandt W. Dreuw A. Wachtveitl J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 3481-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), significantly blue-shifted relative to the peak of the spectrum in Fig. 4. We cannot exclude the possibility that a small Lut.+ signal is present on the blue shoulder of the Z.+ spectrum. Therefore, we conclude that the observed transient Car.+ signal is mainly due to Z.+ formation specifically in minor complexes that bind Z, consistent with CT quenching of chlorophyll excited states therein. Z-dependent Quenching of Chlorophyll Excited States in Isolated Antenna LHCsTo obtain direct information about the quenching of chlorophyll excited states, chlorophyll a fluorescence quantum yields were estimated using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence decay profiles for MLHC and LHCII (panels A and B, respectively) complexes. The amplitude of a 0.63 ns component increased from 8.8% in the MLHC-V complexes (panel A) to 22.8% in the corresponding MLHCs that were shown to bind Z (Table 5). The amplitude of a 2.18-ns component was 27 and 32.9% in the MLHC-V and MLHC-Z complexes, respectively. A 5-ps component indicative of CT quenching (Fig. 2A, blue trace) was not observed in the fluorescence kinetics. Convolutions using our instrument response function demonstrated that unless a 5-ps component was greater than 10% (data not shown), it would not be observable, implying that very few of the MLHC-Z complexes assume the CT quenching configuration when isolated from the intact system. The fluorescence quantum yield in the MLHC-Z complexes was estimated to be 18% lower than that of MLHC-V.TABLE 5Fluorescence decay lifetime constants and amplitudes of monomeric complexesTime\sampleMLHC-VMLHC-Z0.073 ns11.6%10.1%0.63 ns8.8%22.8%2.18 ns27.0%32.9%4.14 ns52.6%34.2%ΦFaRelative fluorescence quantum yield = Φ/ΦF(MLHC-V).1.000.82a Relative fluorescence quantum yield = Φ/ΦF(MLHC-V). Open table in a new tab The fluorescence kinetics of the LHCII trimeric complexes (Fig. 5B) also exhibited multi-exponential decay (Table 6). An increase in a 2.5-ns component from 30.7 to 55.5% and a concomitant decrease in the amplitude of a 3.9-ns component accounts for the 11% lower fluorescence quantum yield in the LHCII-Z complexes relative to LHCII-V complexes. These data demonstrate Z-dependent quenching of chlorophyll excited states in LHCII, essentially as has been previously reported (19Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi"

Despite intense scientific interest, the mechanism by which cholesterol is transported from one membrane compartment to another in animal cells remains obscure. One transport pathway begins in lysosomes where cholesterol is liberated from plasma lipoproteins that have entered the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar).

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and it has been called the sterol-sensing domain (9Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whether this sequence binds cholesterol in NPC1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, or Patched has not yet been determined. The mechanism by which NPC1 facilitates cholesterol transport is unknown. The protein has never been purified from native membranes, and recombinant forms of the protein have never been studied in vitro. In one study, a photoactivated cholesterol derivative was shown to cross-link to the NPC1 protein when added to intact cells, but the characteristics and specificity of the binding reaction were not determined (12Ohgami N. Ko D.C. Thomas M. Scott M.P. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the current report, we describe the purification of a membrane-bound protein that binds 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). 25-HC belongs to a class of sterols called oxysterols, because they contain, in addition to the hydroxyl group on the 3-position, another hydroxyl group, usually on the iso-octyl side chain. We were searching for such a protein because 25-HC and related oxysterols mimic the regulatory actions of cholesterol in the ER of animal cells. Thus, 25-HC blocks the ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBPs, which are transcriptional activators for synthesis of cholesterol and other lipids (13Adams C.M. Reitz J. DeBrabander J.K. Feramisco J.D.

Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4025-4027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Working with membranes from rabbit liver, we purified a protein that binds 25-HC with high affinity. We designated this protein as “membrane-bound oxysterol-binding protein” (MOBP) to distinguish it from the “soluble oxysterol-binding protein” (OSBP-1), which was purified and its cDNA cloned in our laboratory 20 years ago (16Dawson P.A.

We purified recombinant human NPC1 and confirmed that it binds 25-HC. We also found that the recombinant protein binds cholesterol, but only when the detergent is reduced to submicellar concentrations. We here describe the initial purification of rabbit NPC1 and an analysis of the sterol binding properties of the rabbit and human proteins. This work provides a beginning for the eventual analysis of the mechanism by which NPC1 transports cholesterol from lysosomes to ER. Materials—We obtained [26,27-3H]25-HC (75-80 Ci/mmol), [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesterol (60 Ci/mmol), [3β-3H]7,7-azocholestan-3β, 25-diol (20 Ci/mmol) (photo-[3H]25-HC), and [1-14C]oleic acid (54.6 mCi/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; Fos-Choline 13 from Anatrace; anti-FLAG M2-Agarose affinity beads and 6-methylcholesterol from Sigma; all other sterols from Steraloids; FuGENE 6 and Nonidet P-40 from Roche Applied Sciences; and Hybond C nitrocellulose filters and all chromatography products (unless otherwise mentioned) from GE Healthcare Biosciences.

Buffers—Buffer A contained 50 mm Tris-chloride at pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm sodium EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml pep-statin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride). Buffer B contained 50 mm Tris-chloride at pH 7.4, 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT. Buffer C contained 50 mm Tris-chloride at pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT. Buffer D contained 50 mm MES-chloride at pH 5.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT.

Plasmid Construction—pCMV-NPC1-His8-FLAG encodes wild-type human NPC1 followed sequentially by eight histidines and a FLAG tag under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This plasmid was constructed from pCMV-NPC1 (Origene Technologies) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL kit, Stratagene). The coding region of pCMV-NPC1-His8-FLAG was sequenced to ensure integrity of the construct. Solubilization of Sterols in Detergent or Ethanol—For solubilization of sterols in detergent, an ethanol solution containing 4-5 nmol of [3H]25-HC at 75-80 Ci/mmol was evaporated to dryness on the sides of a microcentrifuge tube in a SpeedVac concentrator. Detergent-containing buffer G or buffer H (0.5 ml) was then added to the tube, after which it was agitated for 4 h on a vortex mixer and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. As determined by scintillation counting, the concentration of solubilized [3H]25-HC in the supernatant ranged from 0.4-1.5 μm. Stock solutions of [3H]cholesterol at 60 Ci/mmol were prepared in a similar manner. Saturated solutions of unlabeled sterols in buffer G or buffer H were prepared by evaporating an ethanolic solution of each sterol (50 μg) in a microcentrifuge tube in a SpeedVac concentrator. The dried sterol was solubilized by the same procedure as above. The recovery was estimated by adding tracer amounts of [3H]25-HC or [3H]cholesterol, which allowed calculation of the concentrations of various sterol solutions. The choice of the labeled tracer sterol was based on structural similarity to the bulk sterol. Sterols not solubilized in detergent were dissolved in 100% ethanol and delivered to reaction mixtures at a final ethanol concentration of 1-4%. In a given experiment, all reactions received the same amount of ethanol. Filter Assay for [3H]25-HC Binding—Each reaction, in a final volume of 120 μl of buffer C, contained 50 nm [3H]25-HC (165-180 dpm/fmol) delivered in ethanol and the indicated amount of liver extract, column fraction, or purified protein. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the mixture was loaded onto a pretreated glass-fiber filter (G4, Fisher) placed on a vacuum apparatus that contained 1 ml of buffer F. The filter was pretreated by soaking in 0.3% (w/v) polyethyleneimine for at least 1 h. After application of the vacuum, the free [3H]25-HC was removed by washing with 2.5 ml of buffer F. The filter was then dried and immersed in 8 ml of scintillation fluid (3a70B, Research Products International). Bound [3H]25-HC was measured by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating a duplicate reaction with 10 μm unlabeled 25-HC delivered in ethanol. Ni-NTA Agarose Assay for [3H]Sterol Binding—Each reaction was carried out in a final volume of 80-140 μl of buffer G, buffer H, or buffer I containing the indicated amount of purified NPC1-His8-FLAG and 10-400 nm [3H]25-HC (165-180 dpm/fmol) or [3H]cholesterol (130 dpm/fmol) delivered in buffer G, buffer H, or ethanol. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the mixture was loaded onto a column packed with 0.3 ml of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen). Each column was washed for ∼15 min with 6 ml of buffer G. The protein-bound [3H]sterol was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in buffer G and quantified by scintillation counting as previously described (11Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.-P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For competition experiments with unlabeled sterols, the standard assays were carried out in the presence of buffer G, buffer H, or ethanol containing the indicated unlabeled sterol (0-10 μm). Solubilization of MOBP from Rabbit Liver Membranes—All operations were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Frozen rabbit liver (200-300 g, Pel-Freez Biologicals) was thawed in 300 ml of cold buffer A supplemented with 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN). The thawed tissue was shredded into small pieces in an Oster blender, homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer, and filtered through a triple-layered cheese cloth. The filtrate was again homogenized with a 100-ml Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting 100,000 × g pellet was washed in three sequential steps, each followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The first and third steps employed 300 ml of buffer A supplemented with 450 mm KCl and protease inhibitors; the second step employed 300 ml of 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.3) and protease inhibitors. The final washed membrane pellet was resuspended in 300 ml of buffer C containing the protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (Pierce), and the final detergent (Nonidet P-40) to protein ratio was adjusted to 4.5 (w/w) with buffer B. This mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, after which the supernatant was collected. Purification of MOBP from Detergent-solubilized Rabbit Liver—All operations were carried out at 4 °C. The filter binding assay described above was used to follow [3H]25-HC-binding activity through each of the seven steps in the purification (Table 1). The content of OSBP-1 was followed by immunoblotting. A solubilized extract of rabbit liver membranes was prepared as described above (Step 1). As described in Fig. 1, the soluble extract was loaded onto a 20-ml Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Hi Prep 16/10 Q FF, pH 7.4) (Table 1, Step 2). Active fractions that were devoid of immunoblot reactivity for OSBP were pooled from multiple runs and frozen at -80 °C. Pooled material was thawed and dialyzed against buffer D for 6-12 h and then loaded onto a 20-ml SP-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Hi Prep 16/10 SP FF) pre-equilibrated with buffer D (Step 3). The flow-through was collected and loaded onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose ion exchange column (HiTrap Q HP, pH 5.5) pre-equilibrated with buffer D (Step 4). The column was washed with 8 column volumes of buffer D, and bound proteins were eluted with a continuous KCl gradient (0-500 mm) in buffer D. The fractions containing-binding activity were dialyzed against buffer E for 6-12 h. The dialyzed material was loaded onto 5-10 2-ml RCA Lectin columns (EY Laboratories) pre-equilibrated with buffer E (Step 5). Each column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer E, and proteins were eluted with buffer E plus 250 mm α-Lactose. The eluted fractions containing-binding activity were pooled, dialyzed into buffer C, and concentrated by loading onto a 1-ml Mono-Q ion-exchange column pre-equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with 8 column volumes of buffer C and eluted with a continuous KCl gradient (0-500 mm). The fractions containing-binding activity were loaded onto a 320-ml Sephacryl 300 gel filtration column (HiPrep 26/60 S-300) pre-equilibrated with buffer C containing 100 mm KCl (Step 6). The fractions eluting between 112 and 140 ml (containing peak-binding activity) were pooled and mixed with an equal volume of buffer C to decrease the salt concentration. The diluted fractions (containing ∼50 mm KCl) were concentrated over a 1-ml Mono-Q ion-exchange column. After washing with 8 column volumes of buffer C, proteins were eluted with a continuous KCl gradient (0-500 mm). The eluted fractions containing 25-HC-binding activity were pooled and loaded onto a 2-ml Reactive Blue Dye 72 column (Sigma) that was pre-equilibrated with buffer C (Step 7). The column was washed with 4 column volumes of buffer C, and the bound protein was eluted with a step KCl gradient (100, 250, and 500 mm KCl) in buffer C. Binding activity was found primarily in the 250-mm KCl fraction.TABLE 1Purification of MOBP from rabbit liverStepFractionProteinaProtein concentration of the various fractions was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1.Specific activityTotal activityPurificationRecoverymgpmol/mgpmol-fold%1Solubilized membranesbThis starting fraction contains two proteins that bind [3H]25-HC: MOBP (∼25% of total binding) and OSBP-1 (∼75% of total binding).29,0080.013001002Q-Sepharose (pH 7.4)1,7270.1933219 (74)cNumbers in parenthesis denote the -fold purification of MOBP when the contribution of OSBP-1 binding in the starting fraction is subtracted.1103SP-Sepharose8460.3529534 (135)984Q-Sepharose (pH 5.5)921.6144150 (601)485RCA Lectin → Mono-Q93.631347 (1,388)106S-300 gel filtration → Mono-Q93.229309 (1,237)107Reactive Blue 720.737.4253618 (14,471)8a Protein concentration of the various fractions was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1.b This starting fraction contains two proteins that bind [3H]25-HC: MOBP (∼25% of total binding) and OSBP-1 (∼75% of total binding).c Numbers in parenthesis denote the -fold purification of MOBP when the contribution of OSBP-1 binding in the starting fraction is subtracted. Open table in a new tab Photoaffinity Labeling of MOBP—All experiments were performed in the dark. Each reaction, in a final volume of 3 ml, contained 0.133 mg of purified protein (fraction eluting from Reactive Blue 72 column (Table 1) and 500 nm of photo-[3H]25-HC in the absence or presence of 10 μm unlabeled 25-HC. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, each reaction was subjected to 20 min of UV irradiation (13Adams C.M. Reitz J. DeBrabander J.K. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono-Q ion-exchange column pre-equilibrated with buffer C. After washing with 12 column volumes of buffer C, bound protein was eluted with a salt gradient (0-500 mm KCl). Radioactivity of each fraction was quantified by applying 20-μl aliquots into a scintillation vial filled with 8 ml of scintillation fluid 3a70b. Samples with the highest radioactivity were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Individual gel lanes were cut into 3-mm slices and placed into scintillation vials. 2 ml of tissue solubilizer (TS-2, Research Products International) was added to each vial. After incubation overnight at 50 °C, each sample received 400 μl of glacial acetic acid, after which it was shaken and then filled with 8 ml of scintillation fluid. The vials were stored in the dark for 6 h before radioactivity was measured. Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Photo-[3H]25-HC-labeled Proteins—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion followed by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis as previously described (22Chen Y. Kwon S.W. Kim S.C. Zhao Y. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Purification of Epitope-tagged NPC1 from Transfected CHO Cells—Stock cultures of CHO-K1 cells were grown in monolayer at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 8-9% CO2 and maintained in medium A (1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). On day 0, CHO-K1 cells were set up for experiments in medium A containing 5% FCS at 6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. On day 2, each dish was transfected with 4-5 μg of pCMV-NPC1-His8-FLAG in medium A with 5% FCS, using FuGENE 6 reagent as described (23Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A containing 25 μg/ml ALLN. Cells were homogenized with a 15-ml or 40-ml Dounce homogenizer and then subjected to 100,000 × g centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in buffer C containing the protease inhibitor mixture and 25 μg/ml ALLN (4 dishes of cells per 1 ml of buffer), incubated overnight at 4 °C to solubilize membrane proteins, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting 100,000 × g supernatant (containing detergent-solubilized membranes) was dialyzed against buffer G for 6-12 h at 4 °C, after which imidazole was added at a final concentration of 20 mm. This material was then loaded onto a 1-ml His Trap HP nickel column pre-equilibrated with buffer G. The column was washed sequentially with 10 column volumes of buffer G, 10 column volumes of buffer G plus 25 mm imidazole, and 20 column volumes of buffer G plus 50 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted in 1.5-ml fractions with buffer G plus 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions containing anti-FLAG (NPC1) immunoblot reactivity were then loaded onto a column containing 1-ml anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma), which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer G. The column was washed with either 10 column volumes of buffer G (1% Nonidet P-40) or 25 column volumes of buffer H (0.1% Fos-Choline 13). Bound protein was eluted with 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide in 9 column volumes of either buffer G or buffer H. Protein concentration of purified NPC1 was estimated by silver staining and densitometric scanning of an 8% SDS-PAGE gel in which known amounts (50 to 400 ng) of bovine serum albumin (Pierce) was used as a reference. Preparation of Epitope-tagged NPC1 at Low Detergent Concentration—The fractions containing eluted protein (in 1% Nonidet P-40) from the His Trap HP nickel column as described in the above section were loaded onto a 1-ml anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity column and then washed with 6 column volumes of buffer I (in 0.004% Nonidet P-40). Bound protein was eluted with 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide in 9 column volumes of buffer I. SREBP-2 Processing in Cultured Cells—Skin fibroblasts from a normal subject and a patient with NPC1 disease (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, ATTC no. GM3123) were immortalized with the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) by retroviral infection of the cells with the Babe-puro-hTERT vector as previously described (24Ouellette M.M.

The resulting immortalized cell lines are designated hTERT-Control and hTERT-NPC1. The cells were grown in monolayer at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and maintained in medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% FCS. On day 0, hTERT-Control and hTERT-NPC1 fibroblasts were set up in medium B containing 10% FCS at 6 × 104 and 7 × 104 cells/60-mm dish, respectively. On day 2, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and switched to medium B containing 5% human LPDS. On day 4, cells were switched to medium C (medium B containing 50 μm compactin, 50 μm sodium mevalonate) supplemented with 5% human LPDS and various concentrations of 25-HC or β-VLDL. After incubation for 5 h, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml ALLN for 1 h and then harvested. Six dishes for each condition were pooled for preparation of nuclear extract and membrane fractions, which were analyzed by immunoblotting for SREBP (described below). Primary fibroblast cultures from a wild-type BALB/c mouse and a mutant BALB/c npcnih mouse (6Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K.

https://openalex.org/W2088014572,"Chronic use of cocaine is associated with impairment in response inhibition but it is an open question whether and to which degree findings from chronic users generalize to the upcoming type of recreational users. This study compared the ability to inhibit and execute behavioral responses in adult recreational users and in a cocaine-free-matched sample controlled for age, race, gender distribution, level of intelligence, and alcohol consumption. Response inhibition and response execution were measured by a stop-signal paradigm. Results show that users and non users are comparable in terms of response execution but users need significantly more time to inhibit responses to stop-signals than non users. Interestingly, the magnitude of the inhibitory deficit was positively correlated with the individuals lifetime cocaine exposure suggesting that the magnitude of the impairment is proportional to the degree of cocaine consumed."
https://openalex.org/W2050373296,"ORP8 is a previously unexplored member of the family of oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORP). We now report the expression pattern, the subcellular distribution, and data on the ligand binding properties and the physiological function of ORP8. ORP8 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via its C-terminal transmembrane span and binds 25-hydroxycholesterol, identifying it as a new ER oxysterol-binding protein. ORP8 is expressed at highest levels in macrophages, liver, spleen, kidney, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed ORP8 in the shoulder regions of human coronary atherosclerotic lesions, where it is present in CD68(+) macrophages. In advanced lesions the ORP8 mRNA was up-regulated 2.7-fold as compared with healthy coronary artery wall. Silencing of ORP8 by RNA interference in THP-1 macrophages increased the expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and concomitantly cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I but had no significant effect on ABCG1 expression or cholesterol efflux to spherical high density lipoprotein HDL(2). Experiments employing an ABCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter confirmed that ORP8 silencing enhances ABCA1 transcription. The silencing effect was partially attenuated by mutation of the DR4 element in the ABCA1 promoter and synergized with that of the liver X receptor agonist T0901317. Furthermore, inactivation of the E-box in the promoter synergized with ORP8 silencing, suggesting that the suppressive effect of ORP8 involves both the liver X receptor and the E-box functions. Our data identify ORP8 as a negative regulator of ABCA1 expression and macrophage cholesterol efflux. ORP8 may, thus, modulate the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2067346106,"Phosphorylation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf1 kinase activation loop is determined by the integration of two reaction rates: the rate of phosphorylation by upstream kinases and the rate of dephosphorylation by Glc7. The activities of the Snf1-activating kinases do not appear to be glucose-regulated, since immune complex kinase assays with each of the three Snf1-activating kinases show similar levels of activity when prepared from cells grown in either high or low glucose. In contrast, the dephosphorylation of the Snf1 activation loop was strongly regulated by glucose. When de novo phosphorylation of Snf1 was inhibited, phosphorylation of the Snf1 activation loop was found to be stable in low glucose but rapidly lost upon the addition of glucose. A greater than 10-fold difference in the rates of Snf1 activation loop dephosphorylation was detected. However, the activity of the Glc7-Reg1 phosphatase may not itself be directly regulated by glucose, since the Glc7-Reg1 enzyme was active in low glucose toward another substrate, the transcription factor Mig1. Glucose-mediated regulation of Snf1 activation loop dephosphorylation is controlled by changes in the ability of the Snf1 activation loop to act as a substrate for Glc7. Phosphorylation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf1 kinase activation loop is determined by the integration of two reaction rates: the rate of phosphorylation by upstream kinases and the rate of dephosphorylation by Glc7.

The Snf1 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a founding member of a family of protein kinases that includes the mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 2The abbreviations used are:AMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseSAKSnf1-activating kinasesHAhemagglutinin (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) and is present in all eukaryotes. Interest in this family has been increased by the finding that the medications used to treat type 2 diabetes activate AMPK (2Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E. Olsen G.S. Hardie D.G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Indeed, the metabolic consequences of AMPK activation, which include increased glucose uptake and oxidation, increased fatty acid oxidation, inhibition of anabolic reactions, and stimulation of reactions that regenerate ATP (3Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S. Yamashita S. Noda M. Kita S. Ueki K. Eto K. Akanuma Y. Froguel P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Carling D. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kahn B.B. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), are beneficial to patients experiencing hyperglycemia. With the rise in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Western cultures, a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the activity of the Snf1/AMPK enzymes is needed. AMP-activated protein kinase Snf1-activating kinases hemagglutinin The Snf1/AMPK enzymes function as heterotrimers with a catalytic α subunit associated with regulatory β and γ subunits. The α subunit contains a canonical kinase domain in its N terminus and an autoinhibitory domain in its C terminus (4Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35347-35354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of the Snf1/AMPK enzymes are regulated in a complex manner. First, subunit interactions within the Snf1/AMPK heterotrimer regulate enzymatic activity in response to the cellular energy status. Although not all agree on the mechanism, the γ subunit appears to play an important role in the regulation of Snf1/AMPK catalytic activity. The mammalian γ subunit can bind AMP (5Scott J.W.

Invest. 2004; 113: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and can interact with the α subunit autoinhibitory domain to abrogate its inhibitory potential (4Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An alternative but not necessarily exclusive model posits the presence of a pseudosubstrate sequence in the γ subunit (7Scott J.W. Ross F.A. Liu J.K. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, Snf1/AMPK kinases require phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in their activation loops by a distinct upstream kinase (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, LKB1 is the primary activating kinase of AMPK under conditions of energy stress (15Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U.

It was hoped that the identification of the activating kinases for Snf1 and AMPK would rapidly lead to an understanding of the means by which cellular energy status controlled the activity of the Snf1/AMPK pathway. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the Snf1/AMPK activating kinases are not themselves regulated by energy status. First, LKB1, the primary activator of AMPK (14Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), is the activation loop kinase for at least 12 other kinases that are responsive to different stimuli (16Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). If LKB1 were in fact regulated by cellular energy status, one would predict increased activity toward all of its substrates under conditions of nutrient limitation. This is not observed. Furthermore, when LKB1 was expressed in yeast in place of the SAKs, Snf1 activation loop phosphorylation responded normally to changes in glucose levels (21Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21804-21809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Either LKB1 could sense energy status in both yeast and mammalian cells or the phosphorylation status of the Snf1 activation loop was not regulated at the level of phosphate addition. Third, reactions with purified components showed that the addition of AMP did not stimulate LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK but rather inhibited its dephosphorylation (22Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32207-32216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2006; 403: 139-148Crossref Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Fourth, mutations in the γ subunit of AMPK affect the ability of the PP2C α phosphatase to dephosphorylate the AMPK activation loop (23Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2006; 403: 139-148Crossref Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Finally, one of the three SAKs, Elm1, is required for normal cell morphology (24Sreenivasan A. Kellogg D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7983-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Bouquin N. Barral Y. Courbeyrette R. Blondel M. Snyder M. Mann C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lacking Elm1 display the characteristic elongated morphology for which Elm1 was named. Since yeast cells display normal morphology in both glucose-rich and glucose-limited media, the Elm1 kinase must be active in both growth conditions. However, the Snf1 kinase activation loop shows a much greater degree of phosphorylation when cells are grown in limiting glucose conditions (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The fact that Snf1 is not phosphorylated in glucose-rich media even when Elm1 is active suggests that the phosphorylation status of the Snf1 activation loop might not be regulated by phosphate addition, but rather by dephosphorylation. All of these data taken together suggest that the dephosphorylation reaction may be the regulated step in determining the phosphorylation status of the Snf1/AMPK activation loop. Genetic studies have long indicated that the dephosphorylation of the Snf1 activation loop was mediated by the yeast PP1 protein phosphatase Glc7 (26Tu J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Deletion of the GLC7 gene is lethal, thus complicating study of the PP1 phosphatase in yeast. Glc7 can bind to several alternative regulatory subunits that are thought to direct the phosphatase to different substrates (27Wu X. Tatchell K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7410-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The accessory subunit that directs Glc7 to the Snf1 signaling pathway is Reg1 (28Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Deletion of the REG1 gene results in constitutive activation of Snf1 and hyperphosphorylation of its activation loop (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Models for the Snf1/AMPK pathway in which dephosphorylation is the key to regulation have been lacking, perhaps because the laboratories studying AMPK and Snf1 (ours included) tend to have a kinase-centric world view. The experiments in this report are designed to directly test whether the SAKs, the deactivating phosphatase, or both are regulated by glucose. Media and Strains—Strains used in this study are presented in Table 1. Yeast were grown at 30 °C in standard media. Glucose was present at 2 or 0.05% (g/100 ml), as indicated in the relevant figure legends. Raffinose medium contained 2% (g/100 ml) raffinose, 0.05% (g/100 ml) glucose, and 1 μg/ml antimycin A. In order to create a complete deletion of the REG1 gene, a reg1Δ::HIS3 allele was created using the HIS3 gene from pRS403 (1622-bp SspI fragment) flanked by the sequences from the REG1 locus. The upstream sequences from REG1 were the 824-bp EcoRI-BsaAI fragment representing nucleotides –953 to –129 relative to the REG1 ATG codon. The downstream sequences from REG1 were the 237-bp BsaAI-XbaI fragment representing sequences 143–380 downstream from the REG1 stop codon. REG1 gene replacement was confirmed by PCR.TABLE 1S. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeMSY857MATα ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 sak1Δ::KAN tos3Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KANMSY923MATα ura3 leu2 his3 sak1Δ::KAN tos3Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN snf1Δ10MSY955MATα ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 SNF1-3HAMSY963MATα ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 trp1Δ63 SNF1-3HA reg1Δ::HIS3MSY951MATα ura3 leu2 his3 sak1Δ::KAN tos3Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN SNF1-3HAMSY966MATα ura3 leu2 his3 sak1Δ::KAN tos3Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN SNF1-3HA reg1Δ::HIS3MSY961MATα ura3 leu2 his3 tos3Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN SNF1-3HAMSY983MATα ura3 leu2 his3 tos3Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN SNF1-3HA reg1Δ::HIS3MSY958MATa ura3 leu2 trp1Δ63 his3 sak1Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN SNF1-3HAMSY965MATa ura3 leu2 trp1Δ63 his3 sak1Δ::KAN elm1Δ::KAN SNF1-3HA reg1Δ::HIS3MSY956MATα ura3 leu2 trp1Δ63 his3 lys2Δ0 sak1Δ::KAN tos3Δ::KAN SNF1-3HAMSY964MATα ura3 leu2 trp1Δ63 his3 lys2Δ0 sak1Δ::KAN tos3Δ::KAN SNF1-HA reg1Δ::HIS3MSY987MATα ura3-52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 his3Δ200 snf1Δ10 reg1Δ::HIS3FY1193MATα ura3-52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 his3Δ200 snf1Δ10 Open table in a new tab Plasmids and Mutagenesis—All Snf1-activating kinases were expressed from their own cognate promoters, tagged with five copies of the V5 epitope at the C terminus, and introduced to cells on low copy plasmids based on pRS315 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations in the ATP-binding pockets of Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 were introduced with the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). TAP-tagged versions of the three SAKs have been described previously (30Elbing K. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A low copy plasmid expressing the Mig1 protein tagged with the HA epitope at the C terminus has been previously described (31Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4936-4943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Screen for Altered Sensitivity Alleles—Overnight saturated yeast cultures (200 μl) grown at 30 °C were suspended in 3 ml of 47 °C top agar (containing 0.07% (g/100 ml) Bacto Agar, synthetic complete media lacking uracil with 2% (g/100 ml) sucrose, 1 μg/ml antimycin A, and 0.01% (g/100 ml) glucose). The mixture was carefully mixed and poured onto agar plates containing synthetic complete media lacking uracil with 2% (g/100 ml) sucrose, 0.01% (g/100 ml) glucose, and 1 μg/ml antimycin A. The top agar mixture was allowed to cool and harden. Sterile filter discs were gently placed on the surface of the top agar. 3 μl of 2.5 or 25 μm candidate inhibitor drugs (in Me2SO) were applied to the filter discs. Me2SO alone was used as a negative control. Plates were incubated at 30 °C overnight and photographed. The design and use of the altered sensitivity allele of Snf1 will be described in detail elsewhere. 3M. K. Shirra, R. R. McCartney, C. Zhang, K. M. Shokat, M. C. Schmidt, and K. M. Arndt, manuscript in preparation. Invertase Assay—Invertase activity of midlog cells grown in high and low glucose was determined quantitatively using a colorimetric assay coupled to glucose oxidase (32Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Three independent cultures were assayed, and the mean and S.E. values are plotted. The units of invertase activity used were milliunits/OD where one unit equals 1 μmol of glucose released/min. Western Blotting—Protein extracts were prepared using the NaOH cell lysis method as described previously (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To detect Snf1 activation loop (Thr210) phosphorylation, 600–1200 μgof protein was immunoprecipitated in radioimmune precipitation buffer as previously described (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated Snf1 T210 was used as the primary antibody (1:1000) to detect phosphorylated Snf1. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as secondary antibody (1:15,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For Snf1-HA detection, 20–40 μgof protein extract was used. Snf1-HA was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000) recognizing the HA epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Snf1-activating Kinase Assay—Protein extracts were prepared from cells expressing a single SAK as a C-terminal TAP fusion (30Elbing K. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or without any SAK. SAKs were collected from 300 μg of protein extract by immunoprecipitation with IgG beads. Precipitates were washed five times in radioimmune precipitation buffer and two times in kinase assay buffer as described (30Elbing K. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Precipitates were then incubated in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer with 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) and purified recombinant Snf1 kinase domain as the substrate. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Snf1-activating Kinases Are Active in High and Low Glucose—If the phosphorylation status of the Snf1 activation loop were regulated by phosphate addition, then one would predict that the SAKs would be inactive in high glucose and activated by low glucose. We have described above several lines of evidence that suggest the opposite, that the SAKs may be active in both high and low glucose. Three different experiments were conducted to assess whether glucose regulates the activity of one or more of the SAKs. First we measured invertase activity in cells expressing a single SAK with and without the PP1 regulatory subunit Reg1. When Reg1 is absent, Snf1-dependent invertase expression is elevated in both high and low glucose (28Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the Snf1 activation loop becomes phosphorylated in high glucose (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior observations, strains expressing Reg1 and all three SAKs exhibit normal, glucose-regulated invertase induction (Fig. 1). In the absence of Reg1, cells with all three SAKs display elevated invertase activity independent of glucose, indicating that one or more of the SAKs is active in high glucose. In the absence of all three SAKs, invertase activity is minimal regardless of the glucose concentration or the presence or absence of Reg1, confirming previous work indicating that Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 represent the complete complement of SAKs (12Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1299-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In order to determine if any of the SAKs were responsive to changes in glucose levels, Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 were each expressed as the only SAK in the presence and absence of Reg1. In the absence of Reg1, invertase is elevated in both high and low glucose regardless of which SAK is present (Fig. 1), indicating that each of the three SAKs is capable of activating Snf1 in high glucose. When Reg1 is present, glucose regulation of invertase activity is restored. These results support the idea that the SAKs are active regardless of the glucose concentration. Earlier work has suggested that Sak1 is the primary SAK. Of the three SAKs, only Sak1 is found in stable complex with Snf1 (30Elbing K. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sak1 most efficiently activates all three β subunit-specific isoforms of Snf1 under multiple conditions (33McCartney R.R. Rubenstein E.M. Schmidt M.C. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is the only SAK that can promote nuclear localization of the Gal83 isoform of Snf1 (34Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, Sak1 most robustly induces invertase activity, particularly in the absence of Reg1 (Fig. 1). The reduced induction of invertase in cells expressing Elm1 as the only SAK may be a reflection of sequestration of Elm1 at the bud-neck for its role in regulating cell cycle and morphogenesis (25Bouquin N. Barral Y. Courbeyrette R. Blondel M. Snyder M. Mann C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second measure of SAK activity is the measurement of activation loop phosphorylation using a phosphopeptide antibody specific for Snf1 phosphorylation on the activation loop threonine 210 (PT210) (8McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this experiment, cells were grown in high glucose in the presence or absence of Reg1, protein extracts were prepared, and total Snf1 and Thr210 phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting with either HA antibodies (Fig. 2, bottom) or PT210 antibodies (top), respectively. In multiple independent experiments, the presence or absence of Reg1 affected the phosphorylation status of the Snf1 activation loop but did not affect the level of total Snf1 protein. Results from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 2. In wild type cells, phosphorylation of the Snf1 activation loop is regulated in response to changes in glucose levels (lanes 1 and 2). In high glucose, cells expressing all three SAKs show low but detectable Thr210 phosphorylation when Reg1 is present and distinctly elevated phosphorylation when Reg1 is absent (lanes3 and 4). In the absence of all three SAKs, no phosphorylation of Thr210 is detected, regardless of whether Reg1 is present or not (lanes 5 and 6). When the SAKs are expressed individually, the level of Thr210 phosphorylation is increased by the absence of Reg1, regardless of which SAK is present (lanes 7–12). Some variation is observed between the individual SAKs. Sak1 and Elm1 show higher basal phosphorylation (lanes 7 and 11) compared with Tos3 (lane 9). Nonetheless, the conclusion we reach is that the SAKs are capable of phosphorylating Snf1 in high glucose, supporting the idea that the SAKs are active in both high and low glucose conditions. However, these two experiments do not exclude the possibility that the Glc7-Reg1 complex regulates the SAKs. Therefore, our next experiment was designed to measure SAK activity without disrupting the Glc7-Reg1 complex. Previously, we have used the tandem affinity purification protocol to isolate the three SAKs, Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 (30Elbing K. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In that study, we also showed that the Sak1 complex constituents and activity were not affected by carbon source (glucose versus sucrose). The activity of Tos3 and Elm1 prepared from different carbon sources was not measured. In the third experiment to measure the activity of the SAKs, we conducted in vitro kinase assays with each SAK isolated from cells grown in high glucose or 2 h after a shift to low glucose. The SAKs were collected by immunoprecipitation and assayed for the ability to phosphorylate purified recombinant Snf1 kinase domain (Fig. 3). In earlier experiments, we have shown that the SAKs phosphorylate the Snf1 kinase domain exclusively on threonine 210 (30Elbing K. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to be certain that we were in the linear range of the assay, immune complexes were collected from increasing quantities of extract (0–300 μg). The reaction depended on exogenous substrate, since no incorporation was observed when recombinant Snf1 kinase domain was omitted from the reaction. For each SAK, a similar level of activity was observed in reactions using extracts prepared from cells grown in high and low glucose. The first three experiments described here all support the idea that the SAKs are active in both high and low glucose. Since the phosphorylation status of the Snf1 activation loop is regulated by glucose, the simplest model remaining is that the dephosphorylation of Snf1 is regulated by glucose. Identification of an Altered Sensitivity Allele of TOS3—To monitor the rate of Snf1 activation loop dephosphorylation, we sought to develop a means to rapidly and selectively inactivate the SAKs. In the absence of de novo phosphate addition, changes in Snf1 phosphorylation status may be attributed to the phosphatase, enabling us to determine if the activity of Glc7-Reg1 is regulated by changes in glucose concentration. A chemical genetic method has been developed for specifically inactivating protein kinases (35Bishop A.C. Shah K. Liu Y. Witucki L. Kung C. Shokat K.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). By changing the “gatekeeper” residue in the ATP binding pocket from a bulky hydrophobic residue to glycine or alanine, kinases can be engineered that are selectively inhibited by adenine analogues. An analogue-sensitive variant of the SAK Elm1 (T200G) has been reported (36Sreenivasan A. Bishop A.C. Shokat K.M. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6327-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the primary role of Elm1 seems not to be Snf1 activation but rather participation in cell morphology signaling, we sought to identify analogue-sensitive alleles of the other SAKs, Sak1 and Tos3, whose only described role is activation of Snf1. The gatekeeper residues of Sak1 (Leu223) and Tos3 (Leu135) were changed to glycine and alanine. Plasmids encoding these kinase variants were introduced to cells that lacked the genes for all three SAKs. A library of adenine analogues was screened for the ability to block Snf1 signaling in cells expressing analogue-sensitive variants of the SAKs without affecting signaling in cells expressing the wild-type kinase. All attempts to identify a specific inhibitor for the altered sensitivity alleles of Sak1 were unsuccessful. However, we were successful with Tos3, using the Tos3-L135G allele in combination with the adenine analogue CZ22 (Fig. 4). In a screen to identify specific inhibitors for our mutant kinases, cells were grown as a lawn with sucrose as the carbon source and antimycin to prevent aerobic metabolism. Under these conditions, Snf1 signaling is required for growth. Adenine analogues suspended in Me2SO were spotted onto filter discs. Formation of a halo around the disc was indicative of compromised Snf1 signaling, an outcome expected when the only SAK present in cells is inhibit"

(2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 11476-11481). In this study, we use the Xenopus oocyte expression system to study the role of phospholemman phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C in the modulation of different Na,K-ATPase isozymes present in the heart. Phosphorylation of phospholemman by protein kinase A has no effect on the maximal transport activity or on the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase α1/β1 and α2/β1 isozymes but increases their apparent Na+ affinity, dependent on phospholemman phosphorylation at Ser68. Phosphorylation of phospholemman by protein kinase C affects neither the maximal transport activity of α1/β1 isozymes nor the K+ affinity of α1/β1 and α2/β1 isozymes. However, protein kinase C phosphorylation of phospholemman increases the maximal Na,K-pump current of α2/β1 isozymes by an increase in their turnover number. Thus, our results indicate that protein kinase A phosphorylation of phospholemman has similar functional effects on Na,K-ATPase α1/β and α2/β isozymes and increases their apparent Na+ affinity, whereas protein kinase C phosphorylation of phospholemman modulates the transport activity of Na,K-ATPase α2/β but not of α1/β isozymes. The complex and distinct regulation of Na,K-ATPase isozymes by phosphorylation of phospholemman may be important for the efficient control of heart contractility and excitability.

Phospholemman (PLM) 2The abbreviations used are:PLMphospholemmanPKAprotein kinase APKCprotein kinase CIBMXisobutylmethylxanthinePDBu4-β-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate or FXYD1 is one of the seven members of the FXYD protein family (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), which are small single span membrane proteins exposing their C terminus to the cytoplasmic side. Based on the observation that PLM can form ion-selective channels, it was suggested that PLM might be implicated in cell volume regulation (2Moorman J.R. Ackerman S.J. Kowdley G.C. Griffin M.P. Mounsey J.P. Chen Z.H. Cala S.E. Obrian J.J. Szabo G. Jones L.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, however, PLM, similar to other FXYD proteins, was identified as a tissue-specific regulator of Na,K-ATPase (3Garty H. Karlish S.J. Annu. Rev.

These results suggested that regulation of Na,K-ATPase by PLM might be important to control intracellular Na+ concentrations and in turn intracellular Ca2+ concentrations necessary for appropriate muscle contractility. phospholemman protein kinase A protein kinase C isobutylmethylxanthine 4-β-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate The reduced Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase induced by PLM in certain expression systems indicates an inhibitory effect on Na,K-ATPase. This is supported by the observation that Na,K-ATPase activity increases in myocytes of PLM knock-out mice (11Han F. Bossuyt J. Despa S. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Pavlovic D. Fuller W. Shattock M.J. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Despa S. Bossuyt J. Han F. Ginsburg K.S. Jia L.-G. Kutchai H. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ.

Mounsey J.P. Tucker A.L. Chan Y. Rothblum L.I. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Cheung J.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2006; 100: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In some reports, however, inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by PLM is attributed to an effect of PLM on the apparent Na+ affinity (13Despa S. Bossuyt J. Han F. Ginsburg K.S. Jia L.-G. Kutchai H. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas in other studies, PLM produced no effect on the apparent Na+ affinity but only on maximal pump rates (Vmax) of Na,K-ATPase (14Zhang X.-Q. Moorman J.R. Ahlers B.A. Carl L.L. Lake D.E. Song J. Mounsey J.P. Tucker A.L. Chan Y. Rothblum L.I. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Cheung J.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2006; 100: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, when expressed in Pichia pastoris together with Na,K-ATPase, PLM increases the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase (10Lifshitz Y. Lindzen M. Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15790-15799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The matter is complicated further by reports that show a reduced rather than increased Na,K-ATPase activity in PLM-deficient cardiac sarcolemma (15Jia L.-G. Donnet C. Bogaev R.C. Blatt R.J. McKinney C.E. Day K.H. Berr S.S. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. Sweadner K.J. Tucker A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H1982-H1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the apparently conflicting results on the effect of PLM on Na,K-ATPase activity may lie in the fact that PLM is subjected to phosphorylation by different protein kinases, which may differ in different experimental conditions. PLM has long been known as the main sarcolemmal substrate for protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC) in heart and skeletal muscle (16Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates Ser68, and PKC phosphorylates both Ser63 and Ser68 in the cytoplasmic domain of PLM (17Walaas S.I. Czernik A.J. Olstad O.K. Sletten K. Walaas O. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In myocytes, PLM becomes phosphorylated on Ser68 upon forskolin treatment (9Silverman B.Z. Fuller W. Eaton P. Deng J. Moorman J.R. Cheung J.Y. James A.F. Shattock M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Despa S. Bossuyt J. Han F. Ginsburg K.S. Jia L.-G. Kutchai H. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and on Ser63 and Ser68 upon PKC activation (11Han F. Bossuyt J. Despa S. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by activation of PKA and PKC has been described in various tissues (18Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it has remained unclear whether this occurs by direct phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase or of an accessory protein. Recent experimental evidence suggests that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLM rather than of Na,K-ATPase α1 subunits stimulates α1-specific Na,K-ATPase activity in cardiac myocytes (9Silverman B.Z. Fuller W. Eaton P. Deng J. Moorman J.R. Cheung J.Y. James A.F. Shattock M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, isoproterenol treatment phosphorylates PLM and increases Na,K-ATPase activity in cardiac myocytes of wild type mice but not of PLM-deficient mice (13Despa S. Bossuyt J. Han F. Ginsburg K.S. Jia L.-G. Kutchai H. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The increase in Na,K-ATPase activity is mainly attributed to an increase in the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase with little effect on Vmax (13Despa S. Bossuyt J. Han F. Ginsburg K.S. Jia L.-G. Kutchai H. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Pavlovic et al. (12Pavlovic D. Fuller W. Shattock M.J. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of PLM by PKA stimulates Na,K-ATPase to a level above that seen in the absence of PLM, suggesting an important effect on Vmax. Sympathetic stimulation of cardiac myocytes not only involves PKA activation via β-adrenergic receptors but also PKC activation via α-adrenergic receptors. A recent study reports that PKC activation of myocytes leads to phosphorylation of PLM at Ser63 and Ser68 and increases the maximal Na,K-ATPase-mediated Na+ extrusion rate without changing the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase (11Han F. Bossuyt J. Despa S. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PKC activation of myocytes from PLM-deficient mice had no effect on Na,K-ATPase activity, suggesting that PKC-dependent effects are due to PLM rather than phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase. Interestingly, the effects on Na,K-ATPase of PKA and PKC phosphorylation of PLM are additive (11Han F. Bossuyt J. Despa S. Tucker A.L. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), opening the possibility that PKA and PKC phosphorylation of PLM regulates different Na,K-ATPase isozymes. Finally, studies on a shark phospholemman-like protein (FXYD10) also show that its phosphorylation by PKC stimulates Na,K-ATPase activity (19Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To contribute to the clarification of the role of PKA and PKC phosphorylation of PLM in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity, we have used, in this study, the Xenopus oocyte expression system to address some open questions, which have not been or cannot easily be answered in cardiac myocytes or have produced contradictory results. In particular, we have investigated the effect of PKA and PKC phosphorylation of PLM on the apparent Na+ and/or K+ affinity and on Vmax of Na,K-ATPase and have explored the possibility that PLM phosphorylation might have differential effects on different Na,K-ATPase isozymes.

The mutated PLM cDNAs were amplified from dog PLM using a sense primer tailed with an EcoRI site (5′-GCCGAATTCATGGCACCTCTCCACCACATCTTGGTTCTC-3′) and antisense primers tailed with a NotI restriction site.

Oocytes were injected with rat α1 or α2 subunit cRNA (10 ng) and β1 subunit cRNA (1 ng) alone or together with wild type or mutant phospholemman cRNAs (3 ng). To study protein expression and PLM association, cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution in the presence of 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Easy Tag Express [35S]Protein Labeling Kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h and subjected to 24- and 48-h chase periods in modified Barth's solution containing 10 mm unlabeled methionine. After the pulse and chase periods, microsomes were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitations under nondenaturing conditions as described (26Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with an antibody against the Na,K-ATPase α subunit (27Girardet M. Geering K. Frantes J.M. Geser D. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Bron C. Biochem. J. 1981; 20: 6684-6691Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and revealed by fluorography. Phosphorylation by PKA and PKC and Detection of PLM—Phosphorylation of wild type and mutant PLM after PKA or PKC activation was studied after incubation of cRNA-injected oocytes for 48 h at 19 °C. PKA was activated by incubation of oocytes in modified Barth's solution containing 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX for 4 h or by incubation of oocytes expressing the β2-adrenergic receptor in modified Barth's solution containing 0.1 mm epinephrine for 2 min. Preliminary experiments showed that removal of PKA activators led to dephosphorylation of PLM within 1 h (data not shown). Therefore, long term experiments, such as measurements of the apparent Na+ affinity (see below), were performed in the continuous presence of epinephrine, which maintained phosphorylation. PKC was activated by incubation of oocytes in modified Barth's solution containing 100 nm PDBu for 3 or 10 min. In some experiments, oocytes were continuously incubated with PDBu over a period of 15 min. The phosphorylation state of PLM was assessed before and after PKA or PKC activation and at the end of electrophysiological measurements by preparing oocyte microsomes with buffers containing 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases. The protein content was determined by the method of Lowry. Microsomal proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10-50 μg) or to immunoprecipitations (100 μg) under nondenaturing conditions with a Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody and then transferred overnight at 40 V to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: 1) a PLM antibody recognizing PLM, which is not phosphorylated at Ser68 (10Lifshitz Y. Lindzen M. Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Karlish, Weizmann Institute, Israel) (we show in this study that this antibody recognizes the S68A and S68D PLM mutants, suggesting that it is the phosphate moiety that impedes recognition of PLM by this antibody); 2) a PLM antibody CP68 recognizing PLM phsphorylated at Ser68 (28Rembold C.M.

After binding of the primary antibody, peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences) were bound, and the complex was revealed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated PLM was performed with an ultrascan laser densitometer (LKB Bromma). Determination of the Apparent K+and Na+Affinity of Na,K-ATPase—Electrophysiological measurements were performed 2 days after oocyte injections with rat α1 (10 ng) or ouabain-resistant α2 (12 ng) and β1 (1 ng) cRNAs with or without wild type (3 ng) or mutant PLM (3 ng) cRNAs by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Oocytes were loaded with Na+ by overnight incubation in a K+-free medium (30Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen.

The apparent K+ affinity (K½K+) measured in the presence of external Na+ (100 mm) was obtained by fitting the Hill equation to the data using a Hill coefficient of 1.6 (30Jaisser F. Jaunin P.

The apparent Na+ affinity (K½Na+) was obtained by fitting the Hill equation by using a Hill coefficient of 3 (31Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test. For the determination of effects of PKA stimulation on the apparent external K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were incubated for 4 h in modified Barth's solution containing 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX before measurements. For the determination of effects of PKA stimulation on the apparent K+ and Na+ affinities of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were injected with Na,K-ATPase cRNA alone or together with wild type or mutant PLM plus β2 adrenergic receptor cRNA, and the β2 adrenergic receptor signaling pathway was activated by incubation of oocytes for 2 min with 0.1 mm epinephrine before electrophysiological measurements. Epinephrine was present during the duration of electrophysiological measurements (e.g. for about 3 min for K+ affinity measurements and about 1 h for Na+ affinity measurements). For the determination of effects of PKC stimulation on the apparent external K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were incubated for 3 min in modified Barth's solution containing 100 nm PDBu before measurements. Maximal Na,K-ATPase Current Measurements—Measurements of maximal Na,K-pump currents (Imax) were performed by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique 2 days after oocyte injection with human Na,K-ATPase α1 or α2 cRNAs and β1 cRNA in the presence or absence of wild type or mutant PLM cRNAs. Oocytes were loaded with Na+ by overnight incubation in a K+-free medium (30Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The membrane potential was set at -50 mV, and the Na,K-pump current was measured at room temperature as the outward current induced by the addition of 10 mm K+. For the determination of effects of PKA stimulation on Imax of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were treated for 4 h with 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX before measurements. Imax measurements were performed within less than 1 min. Moreover, the effect of PKA activation on Imax of Na,K-ATPase α1/β1 isozymes was determined by the following protocol. Imax was determined on oocytes by the addition of 10 mm K+ until plateau values were reached. K+ was removed, 0.1 mm epinephrine was added, and K+-induced currents were measured after 2, 5, 10, and 15 min in the continuous presence of epinephrine. For the determination of effects of PKC stimulation on Imax of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were treated for 3 or 10 min with 100 nm PDBu before measurements or in the continuous presence of PDBu over a 15-min time period. In separate experiments, it was verified that the K+-induced currents corresponded to ouabain-inhibitable Na,K-pump currents (data not shown). [3H]Ouabain Binding on Intact Oocytes—Two days after injection of oocytes with human α1 or α2 cRNAs and β1 cRNA in the presence or absence of wild type or mutant PLM cRNAs, the total number of Na,K-ATPase isozymes expressed at the cell surface was determined by [3H]ouabain binding essentially as described (26Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were loaded with Na+ in a K+-free solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 19 °C. Oocytes were then incubated at room temperature in a K+-free solution containing 0.3 μm [21,22-3H]ouabain (Amersham Biosciences; specific activity 15 Ci/mmol) and 0.7 μm of cold ouabain for 30 min. Oocytes were extensively washed with a buffer containing 90 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, individually transferred to scintillation tubes, and solubilized with 100 ml of 5% SDS. Solubilized oocytes were counted after the addition of 2 ml of Scintillator 299 (Packard). Ouabain binding measured in noninjected oocytes was subtracted from values obtained in cRNA-injected oocytes. Previous experiments have shown that non-specific binding determined in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of cold ouabain amounts to 3-7% of total [3H]ouabain binding (26Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For the determination of effects of PKA stimulation on cell surface expression of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were treated for 4 h with 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX before incubation with [3H]ouabain. For the determination of effects of PKC stimulation on cell surface expression of Na,K-ATPase, oocytes were treated for 3 or 10 min before incubation with [3H]ouabain. Turnover Number of Na,K-ATPase—The turnover number of Na,K-ATPase α1/β1 and α2/β1 was calculated as the ratio between the maximal Na,K-pump current and the number of ouabain binding sites. To study the role of PLM phosphorylation on Na,K-ATPase expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we have produced the following PLM mutants: 1) a S68A mutant in which the PKA phosphorylation site (17Walaas S.I. Czernik A.J. Olstad O.K. Sletten K. Walaas O. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was abolished; 2) a S63A/S68A mutant in which the two PKC phosphorylation sites (17Walaas S.I. Czernik A.J. Olstad O.K. Sletten K. Walaas O. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were abolished; and 3) a S63D/S68D mutant that mimics constitutive phosphorylation of PLM. To test whether these mutants associate with Na,K-ATPase, they were expressed in Xenopus oocytes together with Na,K-ATPase and metabolically labeled. Oocyte microsomes were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with a Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody under nondenaturing immunoprecipitation. Similar to wild type PLM (Fig. 1, lanes 4-6), all three mutants could be co-immunoprecipitated with a Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody over prolonged chase periods (lanes 7-15), indicating that they can stably associate with Na,K-ATPase. PLM Phosphorylated by PKA Remains Associated with Na,K-ATPase—We first studied the effect of PKA phosphorylation of PLM on Na,K-ATPase expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Forskolin treatment of Xenopus oocytes expressing Na,K-ATPase α1/β1 isozymes and PLM increased the phosphorylation of PLM, as reflected by 1) the increased signal for PLM (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 1 and 2) detected by an antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated Ser68 (28Rembold C.M. Ripley M.L. Meeks M.K. Geddis L.M. Kutchai H.C. Marassi F.M. Cheung J.Y. Moorman J.R. J. Vasc. Res. 2005; 42: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and 2) the decreased signal for PLM (Fig. 2A, bottom, lanes 1 and 2) detected by an antibody that recognizes PLM, which is not phosphorylated at Ser68 (10Lifshitz Y. Lindzen M. Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15790-15799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody revealed that nonphosphorylated (lane 3) as well as phosphorylated (lane 4) PLM was associated with Na,K-ATPase. PKA Phosphorylation of PLM Does Not Influence the Apparent K+Affinity of Na,K-ATPase α1/β1 and α2/β1 Isozymes—Based on the observation that the effect of PKA and PKC phosphorylation of PLM on Na,K-ATPase activity in myocytes was additive, despite shared phosphorylation sites, it was suggested that PKA and PKC regulation may target different Na,K-ATPase isozymes (11Han F.

Although these inhibitory effects of TIMP-2 are mediated by α3β1 integrin, the cell membrane receptor that mediates the mitogenic activity of TIMP-2 remains unclear. The MT1-MMP capacity to act as a cell membrane binding site for TIMP-2, a protein with growth factor activity, and the presence in MT1-MMP of a cytoplasmic domain prompted us to test the hypothesis that MT1-MMP generates intracellular signaling upon binding of TIMP-2. Here we show that TIMP-2 binding to MT1-MMP rapidly activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, which up-regulates cell proliferation and migration by a mechanism independent of the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP. Materials—Human recombinant TIMP-2 was a kind gift from Dr. R. Fridman (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) or was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); human TIMP-1, proMMP-2, the recombinant soluble catalytic domain of human MT1-MMP, mouse anti-human TIMP-2 antibody (MAB13441), the TIMP-2 murine monoclonal antibody IM11L, donkey anti-rabbit and donkey anti-mouse IgG (both conjugated with horseradish peroxidase), the chromogenic TMB/E (3,3′, 5-5′-tetramethybenzidine) peroxidase substrate, and Ilomastat (GM6001) were purchased from Chemicon International; rabbit antibody to the hinge region of MT1-MMP (AB815) was from Triple Point Biologics (Forest Grove, OR); rabbit antibody to total ERK2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and phospho-c-Raf (Ser338, 56A6) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was from GE Healthcare-Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ), UO126 was from Promega (Madison, WI); UO124 was from Calbiochem; and doxycycline (DOX) was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to the Escherichia coli-derived catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was generated in our laboratory and purified by protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. Cells and Media—Human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), primary embryonic fibroblasts from mice genetically deficient in MT1-MMP, or their wt counterparts (a kind gift from Dr. Suneel Apte, Cleveland Clinic) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 4 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Generation of Stable Tet-On and Tet-Off Transfectants—MCF-7 cells stably transfected with a cDNA for the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (Tet-On and Tet-Off, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) were cotransfected with human MT1-MMP cDNA in the pTRE vector (Clontech) and with the pTRE2hyg hygromycin resistance vector (Clontech) in both Tet-On and Tet-Off MCF-7 cells. Stable cotransfectants were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Pools of hygromycin-resistant cells were subcultivated overnight in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml DOX and characterized for MT1-MMP expression by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting. One pool of Tet-Off cells and one pool of Tet-On cells with the highest MT1-MMP expression levels were selected and used for the experiments (Fig. 1A). TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP Constructs—Catalytically inert (E240A), soluble MT1-MMP consisting of the catalytic (CAT) and hemopexin (PEX) domains was C-terminally tagged with V5 and Hisx6 (MT1-E240A-CAT-PEX). After sequencing, the construct was cloned into pET101 (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The transformed bacteria were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 37°C, collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g; 15 min), and sonicated (30-s pulse, 30-s interval; 8 pulses total) on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysozyme (5 mg/ml). Following centrifugation (15,000 × g; 20 min), the pellet containing the inclusion bodies (10 mg of total protein) was washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol.

The protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient (10–500 mm, 100 ml) in PBS, 1 m NaCl, concentrated with a 30-kDa cutoff concentrator and dialyzed against PBS containing 0.005% Brij35. The soluble MT1-MMP hemopexin domain-cytoplasmic tail construct (MT1-PEX-CT) consisted of the Leu282–Ser538 sequence of the PEX domain and the hinge region of MT1-MMP spliced to the Arg563–Val582 sequence of the cytoplasmic tail (CT). The construct was expressed in Pichia pastoris as described (18Rozanov D.V. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

Ras Activation Assay—Ras activation was measured by the EZ-Detect Ras Activation Kit (Pierce). TIMP-2-MT1-MMP Binding Assay—To measure TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 binding to MT1-MMP, the wells of a 96-well plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with either purified MT1-E240A-CAT-PEX or MT1-CAT or MT1-PEX-CT, or with BSA as a control (3 μg/ml of each protein in 125 μl of 15 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) at 4 °C for 18 h. The wells were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 for 90 min at 37 °C. TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2 (2 μg/ml in 75 μl of PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20; ∼100 nm) were added for 2 h at room temperature. An equivalent amount of BSA was added as a control instead of TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2. After washing five times with PBS, 0.005% Tween 20, murine antibody to TIMP-2 (IM11L, 0.5 μg/ml in 75 μl of PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20) was added for 2 h at room temperature. The unbound antibody was removed by washing with PBS-0.005% Tween 20, and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 in 75 μl of PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20) was added for 1 h. Following extensive washing with PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and with H2O, TMB/E substrate (100 μl) was added to the wells. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 1 m H2SO4, and A450 was measured with a plate reader. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. To measure TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 binding to the MT1-MMP catalytic domain (MT1-CAT) the wells of a 96-well plate (Nunc) were coated at 4 °C for 18 h with TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2, or with BSA as a control (2 μg/ml each in 125 μl of 15 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 for 90 min at 37 °C, purified MT1-CAT (2.5 μg/ml in 75 μl of PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20; ∼125 nm) was added into the wells for 2 h at room temperature. An equivalent amount of BSA was added as a control instead of MT1-CAT. The wells were washed five times with PBS-0.005% Tween 20, and rabbit antibody against the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (0.5 μg/ml in 75 μl PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20) was added for 2 h at room temperature. The unbound antibody was removed by washing with PBS, 0.005% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 in PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20) was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Following extensive washing with PBS, 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and with H2O, TMB/E substrate (100 μl) was added to the wells. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 ml 1 m H2SO4, and A450 was measured with a plate reader. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Cell Migration Assays—MCF-7 cells grown overnight in 0.5% FCS in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml DOX were seeded in the upper compartment of modified blind wells with 8-μm pore polyvinyl pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (2.5 × 104 cells/200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FCS). Purified TIMP-2 or TIMP-1 (100 ng/ml) and the MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126, or UO124 as a control (10 μm), were added to the upper compartment. After 6-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells on the lower aspect of the membrane were fixed-stained with Diff-Quick (Dade-Behring, Newark, DE) and counted under a light microscope. The data are presented as the mean number of migrated cells per five 20× fields. To measure the migration of MT1-MMP+/+ or MT1-MMP–/– fibroblasts, confluent cells grown in 6-well plates and incubated overnight with medium containing 0.5% FCS were scraped with the edge of a sterile razor blade in one to three areas measuring ∼1.5 × 0.3 cm. Following wounding, the cells were incubated for 24 h with either control medium (Control) or TIMP-2 (100 ng/ml) or, as positive controls, FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) or FCS (10%). Fixed cells were stained with crystal violet, and cells migrated beyond 0.8 mm into the denuded areas of triplicate wells were counted in a blinded fashion using an ocular grid (26Pintucci G. Moscatelli D. Saponara F. Biernacki P.R. Baumann F.G. Bizekis C. Galloway A.C. Basilico C. Mignatti P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells grown overnight in 0.5% FCS in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml DOX were seeded into 96-well plates (5,000 cells/well) in the same medium. After 24-h incubation TIMP-2 (100 ng/ml) and/or GM6001 (50 μm) or the MEK inhibitor UO126 (10 μm, Promega) were added to the medium, and the incubation was continued. Doxycycline, TIMP-2, GM6001, and UO126 were added again every 48 h. Cell number was measured daily by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide staining method using the Cell Titer 96 Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega). Each sample was assayed in triplicate. To measure MT1-MMP+/+ and MT1-MMP–/– fibroblast proliferation bromodeoxyuridine (10 μm) was added to the culture medium of cells incubated overnight in 0.5% FCS. Following 20 min incubation at 37 °C, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was detected by immunocytochemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Tumor Growth in Vivo—Confluent MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the indicated MT1-MMP mutants or empty vector (27Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P.

Fifty microliters of cell suspension (5.0 × 106 cells) were injected subcutaneously in the mammary fat pad of 4-week-old female athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice (Benton & Kingman, San Francisco, CA). Five to six animals per group were used. Tumor growth was monitored every 6–8 days by caliper measurements of two perpendicular diameters (D1 and D2) of the xenografts. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula: π /6 (D1 × D2)3/2. Immunohistochemistry—Five-micrometer frozen sections were immunostained with anti-Ki67 (Dako MIB-1), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology #9664S), or anti-CD31 (Dako JC70A) antibodies using the M.O.M. Vectastain Elite ABC and Vectastain Elite Kits (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described (28Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Bergman M.R. Mahimkar R. Cheng S. Jin Z.Q. Karliner J.S. Lovett D.H. Am. J.

Peroxidase-positive cells were counted in 20 random 400× microscopic fields. Densitometry—Quantitative analysis of immunoreactive bands was performed by scanning densitometry with Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and ImageJ 10.2 (National Institutes of Health). The results are presented as the ratio between the readings of the sample and that of the corresponding loading control. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t test with SigmaStat and Stata 8, and data were interpolated using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Corp., Corte Madera, CA). p values < 0.05 were considered significant. MT1-MMP Expression and Exogenous TIMP-2 Induce ERK1/2 Activation with a Dose-dependent Effect—To test the hypothesis that TIMP-2 binding to MT1-MMP triggers intracellular signaling, we used MCF-7 cells transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA under control by the tetracycline-controlled transactivator. Parental MCF-7 cells express no, or very low levels of MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 (27Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Addition to, or removal of DOX (1 μg/ml) from the culture medium of Tet-On or Tet-Off transfectants, respectively, resulted in strong induction of MT1-MMP expression (Fig. 1, A and B). The recombinant MT1-MMP expressed by the transfected cells was active and was inhibited by human TIMP-2 (100 ng/ml) or by the hydroxamate inhibitor Ilomastat (27Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). TIMP-2 (100 ng/ml) was then added to the medium of Tet-On transfectants in the presence or absence of DOX, and the cells were analyzed for ERK1/2 activation after 5–30 min of incubation (Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with previous reports (30Gingras D. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Langlois S. Lachambre M.P. Annabi B. Beliveau R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), MT1-MMP expression resulted in constitutive ERK1/2 activation. Addition of TIMP-2 to MT1-MMP-expressing cells induced rapid (5–15 min) up-regulation of ERK1/2 activation but had a much lower, non-significant effect on cells that did not express MT1-MMP. Comparable results were obtained with either Tet-On or Tet-Off transfectants (Fig. 1, A and B), showing that ERK1/2 activation did not result from a nonspecific effect of DOX. In addition, TIMP-2 induced ERK1/2 activation in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells that constitutively express MT1-MMP, as well as in primary wild-type (wt) mouse fibroblasts but had a dramatically lower, non-significant effect in fibroblasts from mice genetically deficient in MT1-MMP (Fig. 2). These results indicated that TIMP-2 up-regulates ERK1/2 activation in MT1-MMP-expressing cells. To investigate the mechanism of ERK1/2 activation we analyzed the effect of TIMP-2 on phosphorylation of Ras and c-Raf, upstream activators of the ERK1/2 pathway. The results (Fig. 3) showed that TIMP-2 addition to MT1-MMP-expressing cells induced rapid (5 min) up-regulation of Ras and c-Raf activation but had no such effect on cells devoid of MT1-MMP. Thus, TIMP-2 interaction with MT1-MMP induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation through the Ras-Raf-1-MEK1/2 pathway. To characterize the relative contribution of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 to ERK1/2 activation, we incubated MT1-MMP Tet-On transfectants with increasing DOX concentrations (0.1 to 1 μg/ml). This treatment induced MT1-MMP expression and ERK1/2 activation in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of TIMP-2 (100 ng/ml) to the culture medium dramatically up-regulated ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4, A and B). In a second set of experiments (Fig. 4, C and D) increasing concentrations of TIMP-2 (0 to 300 ng/ml) were added to the culture medium of cells that either expressed or did not express MT1-MMP, and the levels of both cell-associated TIMP-2 and active ERK1/2 were characterized. With cells that expressed MT1-MMP the levels of both cell-associated TIMP-2 and active ERK1/2 increased in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, with cells that did not express MT1-MMP the levels of cell-associated TIMP-2 and active ERK1/2 did not increase significantly. To characterize the cellular binding site of TIMP-2 MT1-MMP Tet-Off transfectants grown in the presence or absence of DOX were incubated with 100 ng/ml TIMP-2. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with MT1-MMP antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to TIMP-2. Induction of MT1-MMP expression directly correlated with the amount of TIMP-2 that coimmunoprecipitated with MT1-MMP, and caused a concomitant decrease of soluble TIMP-2 in the culture medium. No MT1-MMP or TIMP-2 was detected in the immunoprecipitation supernatant, showing that all TIMP-2 in the cell extract was associated with MT1-MMP (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, in our transfected cells MT1-MMP is the only, or at least the major, binding site for TIMP-2. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports showing the existence on several cell types of one TIMP-2 binding site identified as MT1-MMP (9Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L.

To test the specificity of TIMP-2 in inducing ERK1/2 activation, we analyzed the effect of TIMP-1, whose binding constant for MT1-MMP (k is five orders of magnitude lower than that of TIMP-2 (kon = 4.2 ± 0.22 (m ·s–1) × 10–6) (32Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 did not activate ERK1/2 in MT1-MMP-expressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B; compare the intensity of the band in the MT1-MMP plus TIMP-1 sample, rightmost lane, to that of its control, MT1-MMP minus TIMP, second lane from left). Thus, altogether these results indicated that TIMP-2 binding to MT1-MMP up-regulates ERK1/2 activation. TIMP-2 Induction of ERK1/2 Activation Does Not Require the MMP Inhibitory Activity and Occurs in the Absence or Presence of MMP-2—To investigate whether TIMP-2 activation of ERK1/2 results from inhibition of MT1-MMP (or other MMPs) we characterized the effect on ERK1/2 activation of Ala+TIMP-2, a mutant TIMP-2 devoid of MMP inhibitory activity (23Hoegy S.E. Oh H.R. Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3203-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 5, C and D) showed that Ala+TIMP-2 induced ERK1/2 activation as efficiently as wt TIMP-2 in MT1-MMP-expressing cells but had no such effect on cells that did not express MT1-MMP. Because Ala+TIMP-2 does not bind to the catalytic domain of MMPs we investigated potential interactions of Ala+TIMP-2 with other domains of MT1-MMP. For this purpose we used the binding assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” The"

The S. epidermidis fibrinogen (Fg)-binding adhesin SdrG is necessary and sufficient for the attachment of this pathogen to Fg-coated materials. Based largely on structural analyses of the ligand binding domain of SdrG as an apo-protein and in complex with a Fg-like peptide, we proposed that SdrG follows a “dock, lock, and latch” mechanism to bind to Fg. This binding mechanism involves the docking of the ligand in a pocket formed between two SdrG subdomains followed by the movement of a C-terminal extension of one subdomain to cover the ligand and to insert and complement a β-sheet in a neighboring subdomain. These proposed events result in a greatly stabilized closed conformation of the MSCRAMM-ligand complex. In this report, we describe a biochemical analysis of the proposed conformational changes that SdrG undergoes upon binding to its ligand. We have introduced disulfide bonds into SdrG to stabilize the open and closed forms of the apo-form of the MSCRAMM. We show that the stabilized closed form does not bind to the ligand and that binding can be restored in the presence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol. We have also used Förster resonance energy transfer to dynamically show the conformational changes of SdrG upon binding to its ligand. Finally, we have used isothermic calorimetry to determine that hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the protein are responsible for re-directing the C-terminal extension of the second subdomain required for triggering the β-strand complementation event.

The attachment of microbes to host tissues represents the initial step in the pathogenesis of most infections, with specificity and tissue tropism being defined by precise adhesin-ligand interactions. For bacteria that are not obligatory intracellular pathogens, extracellular matrix proteins appear to be preferred targets for bacterial adhesion. The adhesins mediating these interactions have been termed MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules). 2The abbreviations used are:MSCRAMMsmicrobial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix moleculesMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolFRETFörster resonance energy transferFgfibrinogen Multiple MSCRAMMs have been found in many organisms. On Gram-positive bacteria, a family of MSCRAMMs might have arisen from a common ancestor, as indicated by their amino acid sequence relatedness, similar modular design, and common binding domain organization. In general, these structurally related MSCRAMMs (Fig. 1A) contain an N-terminal ∼40 amino acid long signal sequence (S), and C-terminal features that are required for sorting the proteins to the cell wall including a proline-rich wall-spanning region (W), the wall anchoring LPXTG motif, a hydrophobic transmembrane region (M), and a positively charged cytoplasmic tail (C). The ligand binding activity of most of these MSCRAMMs is localized to the N-terminal A regions, which in the staphylococcal proteins are ∼500 amino acids long. microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol Förster resonance energy transfer fibrinogen The blood plasma protein fibrinogen is targeted by many MSCRAMMs. In the cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, fibrinogen-binding proteins that share a common structure have been reported to mediate bacterial attachment to fibrinogen-covered surfaces (1McDevitt D.

SdrG binds to a site at the N terminus of the fibrinogen β-chain that covers the thrombin cleavage site and the MSCRAMM has anticoagulant properties (6Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W.

The A-regions of the four fibrinogen-binding staphylococcal MSCRAMMs are very similar. Each A-region is predicted to contain three subdomains with IgG-like folds (12Ponnuraj K.B. Bowden M.G. Davis S.

Fibrinogen binding involves subdomains two and three. For SdrG, ClfA, and FnbpA, synthetic peptides have been described corresponding to the respective binding sites in fibrinogen; these peptides bind to the respective MSCRAMMs with relatively high affinity. We reported the crystal structures of the ligand binding region of SdrG as an apo-protein and in complex with a synthetic peptide ligand (12Ponnuraj K.B. Bowden M.G. Davis S. Gurusiddappa S. Moore D.

The apo-protein folds as an open structure where a ligand binding trench formed between two subdomains (N2 and N3) is accessible for the docking of the peptide. The protein-peptide complex structure has a closed conformation where the ligand binding trench is no longer exposed. Based largely on these structures we proposed a dynamic multistep ligand binding mechanism that we called “dock, lock and latch.” We envisioned that the ligand peptide would first dock in the binding trench exposed in the open conformation. The peptide-MSCRAMM interaction would then induce a redirection of the C-terminal extension of the second subdomain (N3). This segment covers the bound peptide, effectively locking the ligand in place. We proposed a final latching event, where a short segment C-terminal of the locking residues would insert through a β-strand complementation in a trench on the surface of the N2 subdomain (Fig. 1B). In the present study we have experimentally examined the dock, lock and latch model. Construction and Purification of SdrG Point Mutants—Recombinant SdrG-(273-597) point mutants were generated with hexahistidine tags at their N termini using the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Each construct was amplified by PCR using SdrG-(273-597) DNA as the template and Pfu (Stratagene) as the polymerase. To obtain the desired point mutations, the primers listed in Table 1 were used. The PCR fragments were purified and cloned into pQE30 at the sites indicated for each primer in Table 1, and the resulting plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Large-scale expression and preparation of recombinant proteins using HiTrap nickel chelating chromatography were described previously (6Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W. Perkins S. Hook M. J.

Synthetic Peptides—The synthesis and purification procedures of the peptides were described previously (6Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W. Perkins S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For the following peptides the amino acid residue numbers are given and the sequence follows: peptide β6-20 (NEEGFFSARGHRPLD), peptide β6-20(F3) (NEEGFFFSARGHRPLD), and a scrambled version of peptide β6-20 (GADSHEPFRDNERFL). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out with a VP-isothermal titration calorimetry microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. In a typical experiment the cell contained 20 μm rSdrG and the syringe contained 200 μm peptide. Both solutions were in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and were degassed at 25 °C for 20-30 min. The titration was performed as follows: one preliminary injection of 5 μl and 29 injections of 10 μl with an injection speed of 0.5 μl/s. The stirring speed was 540 rpm and the delay time between the injections was 5 min. To take into account the heats of dilution, two blank titrations were performed: one injecting peptide into buffer and another injecting buffer into the rSdrG solution. The averaged heats of dilution were subtracted from the main experiment. Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software (version 5.0) and fitting them to a single binding site model. Fluorescence Polarization—Fluorescence polarization was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of rSdrG (6Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W. Perkins S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with peptide β6-20. The peptide was labeled with fluorescein, and increasing concentrations of rSdrG in PBS, pH 7.5, were incubated with 10 nm labeled peptide for 3 h in the dark at room temperature. The reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium. Polarization measurements were taken with a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B using FL WinLab software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression used to fit a binding function as defined by the following equation: Δp =ΔPmax(protein)/KD + (protein), where ΔP corresponds to the change in fluorescence polarization, ΔPmax is the maximum change in fluorescence polarization, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the interaction. A single binding site was assumed in this analysis. SdrG Fluorescent Labeling—SdrG(E381C,P595W) and SdrG(S483C,P595W) (120 nm) were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) (20 mm, final concentration) and in HBS-EDTA (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) at 26 °C. The proteins were then run through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove the excess DTT. The protein concentration was calculated, and was then incubated with a 10-fold concentration of IAEDANS (Molecular Probes) solubilized in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 26 °C, shaking. The labeling reaction was terminated adding DTT to a final concentration of 5 mm, and free dye was removed by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with HBS-EDTA buffer. The eluted protein concentration was quantitated reading the SdrG absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient Σ= 37,015 m-1 cm-1), and the concentration of the dye was determined measuring the absorbance of the AEDANS at 336 nm (Σ= 5,700 m-1 cm-1). Labeling stoichiometries were 0.80-0.89 mol of AEDANS/mol of SdrG. The AEDANS label was assumed to bind to the thiol groups in S381C and E483C, this was confirmed by the inability to label the wild-type version of SdrG, which has no C residues in its amino acid sequence. Energy Transfer Measurements—Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was measured using an SLM 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Rochester, NY) and repeated in a PerkinElmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50 B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All samples were examined at room temperature (20-23 °C) in HBS-EDTA. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 348 nm for Trp and 295 and 515 nm for IAEDANS, respectively, with 4-nm band pass widths. Shutters were closed except during measurements to minimize photodegradation of the sample. The spectral overlap integral, quantum yield, and R0 were determined as described (18Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Four samples were prepared in parallel for each energy transfer experiment: microcells D (donor containing, 300 nm SdrG unlabeled) and DA (containing donor and acceptor, 300 nm SdrG labeled) received 3 μm (final concentration) of ligand peptide, whereas microcells B (blank) and P (3 μm peptide) contained HBS-EDTA buffer alone (B) or buffer plus peptide (P). The net emission intensity of a sample was obtained by subtracting the signal of the background B from D and peptide P from DA, and then correcting all volumes for the protein dilution after the addition of peptide. The donor-acceptor distance calculation is given by r = (E-1 - 1)1/6R0, where E = 1 - ((FDA - FD(1 - fA))/FDfA) and R0 for Trp as a donor and IAE-DANS as an acceptor is 22 Å. FDA = fluorescence of sample DA, FD = fluorescence of sample D, and fA) = fractional occupancy of the acceptor site (given by the labeling efficiency). The distance between residues was calculated using the κ2 = 2/3 value, assuming a random orientation. For the peptide titration experiments, 500 nm SdrG was mixed with increasing concentrations of peptide (0-10 μm), and the fluorescent emission of Trp (at 348 nm) and IAEDANS (at 515) is given by F=Fcorr-Fpcorr, where Fscorr=(Fs(V/V0)-Fb(V/V0)) and Fpcorr=(Fp(V/V0)-Fb(V/V0)); V = volume at the point of titration, V0 = initial volume, F = fluorescence intensity sample, Fp = fluorescence intensity of the peptide, Fb = fluorescence intensity of the buffer, and F = fluorescence of the sample minus the contribution of the peptide in the buffered solution. SdrG-(273-597) Can Be Constrained into an Open or Closed Conformation—A key feature of the dock, lock and latch model of ligand binding is the transition of the MSCRAMM from an open apo-protein form to the closed form of the MSCRAMM peptide complex (Fig. 1B). To explore if these proposed dynamics are critical for ligand binding, we decided to construct versions of the MSCRAMM that are constrained in one or the other conformation and test their ability to participate in the postulated conformational rearrangements. The strategy we chose for this experiment was to introduce, through site-directed mutagenesis, two Cys residues that could form a disulfide bond and lock the C-terminal extension of N3 on top of the N3 module, preventing the extension from participating in the lock and latch steps. This disulfide bond would constrain the molecule in an open conformation. Alternatively, the Cys residue in the C-terminal strand could be partnered with a Cys residue introduced at the bottom of the N2 domain, hopefully locking the latch segment in the latching trench and stabilizing a closed conformation. Careful examination of the solved open and closed crystal structures allowed us to identify candidate residues to be replaced with Cys and subsequently form disulfide bonds. SdrG(S483C,P595C) and SdrG(E381C,P595C) are predicted to form an open and a closed conformation, respectively, stabilized by their individually introduced disulfide bonds (Fig. 1C, Table 1). The designed mutated forms of SdrG were constructed, expressed, and purified. Analyses of the two Cys mutants and wild-type proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed that when the protein samples were treated with DTT as a reducing agent, all the proteins appeared as a single band with very similar migration behavior (Fig. 2A) demonstrating their purity. In the absence of reducing agent, the wild-type protein still migrated as a single band at the distance seen for the reduced protein form. However, a major portion of both SdrG(E381C,P595C) and SdrG(S483C,P595C) protein migrated significantly faster than the wild-type protein under non-reducing conditions. This behavior could indicate that the formation of disulfide bonds stabilizes a compact form of the protein. Furthermore, under nonreducing conditions, both protein mutant preparations contain several higher molecular weight species; these presumably represent dimers and oligomers. These higher molecular forms were confirmed to be SdrG in Western blots, using anti-SdrG antibodies (not shown). We further purified the compact form of SdrG(E381C,P595C) and were able to crystallize it. The structure of SdrG(E381C,P595C) was solved by molecular replacement methods using the structure of the rSdrG-(276-596) component of the peptide-protein complex as a starting model. The SdrG(E381C,P595C) structure was solved at a 2.8-Å resolution, with 2 molecules in an asymmetric unit of a P212121 cell (Table 2). Structurally, SdrG(E381C,P595C) is very similar to the previously reported structure of rSdrG in complex with the ligand peptide, with the exception of the absence of the peptide and the presence of the Cys residues, which are shown to form a disulfide bond (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we concluded that a re-direction of the C-terminal extension of N3 and insertion of the “latch” segment into the latching trench events, that we proposed occurs after ligand binding, can also occur in the absence of ligand bringing residues 381 and 595 close enough to form a disulfide bond.TABLE 2Crystallographic and refinement data of SdrG(E381C, P595C)Dataa61.507 Åb94.172 Åc129.583 Åα90°β90°γ90°Space groupP212121Resolution2.8 ÅCompleteness97.3Rsym6.2 (11.2)%No. molecules in the asymmetric unit2Resolution range20-2.8 ÅRfactor/Rfree (all data with 0 σ cutoff)0.249/0.301No. of non-hydrogen protein atoms4930No. of water molecules0Overall B-factor27.8Ramachandran plotCore94.5%Allowed regions4.5%Generously allowed2.0%Disallowed regions0.0%Protein data base code2RAL Open table in a new tab The Double Cys Mutant Monomers Do Not Bind to Fg, but the Multimers Do—We observed that the Cys mutant proteins appear as a mix of monomers, dimers, and multimers in solution, resulting from intra- or inter-molecular disulfide bond formation. As indicated above, these multiple forms can be detected by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The multimeric forms can be reduced to monomers when the proteins are treated with reducing agents such as DTT or β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2A). We tested the ability of these multiple forms to bind to soluble Fg when the proteins are immobilized onto a membrane. As shown in the ligand blot in Fig. 2B, the dimers and multimers present in the double Cys mutants preparation bind Fg avidly, whereas the locked monomers do not react to the soluble Fg. Adding DTT to the proteins presumably reduces the intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bridges, restoring the gel migration characteristics and ability to bind Fg to wild-type levels. To evaluate the ability of the disulfide-stabilized monomers to bind to Fg, it was necessary to obtain a pure monomer preparation, free of any multimeric forms. To separate the monomers from the multimers, we purified the monomer fraction of each double Cys mutant using gel permeation chromatography. After this treatment, the monomer preparation contains a minor percentage of protein that apparently has not formed the predicted disulfide bond, because it still migrates as the wild-type protein in SDS-PAGE. This undesired fraction was eliminated by running the monomer mixture through a column packed with Activated Thiol Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), where the proteins that had reduced SH-groups were retained in the column, and the disulfide-bonded forms were washed through. Once pure disulfide-bonded monomer preparations were obtained, their ability to bind to Fg and the β6-20 peptide was tested. The Constrained Conformations Do Not Bind to Fibrinogen—Binding of the locked SdrG monomers to immobilized Fg was initially measured in enzyme-linked immunosorbent-type assays (not shown). Disulfide-stabilized forms of SdrG do not bind to immobilized Fg, regardless of whether these are locked in an open or closed conformation. However, the ability of the disulfide-stabilized proteins to bind to Fg was restored by preincubating the SdrG constructs with DTT. To rule out the possibility that immobilizing Fg on a solid surface could perturb the ability of the SdrG constructs to access the ligand, we examined the ability of a fluorescein-labeled peptide to bind to both forms of SdrG. Using fluorescence polarization, where both the protein and the ligand peptide are in solution, the stabilized closed and open conformations do not bind to the Fg β6-20 peptide (Fig. 2C). The inability of these constructs to bind to the ligand can be explained using our previous genetic and structural data. The constrained open conformation displays binding kinetics similar to those observed in a C-terminal truncation mutant, where the ligand could access the binding trench, but is not stably bound. On the other hand, the constrained closed conformation does not bind the β6-20 peptide presumably because the ligand binding trench is covered by the amino acids that constitute the locking region (581-586), blocking access of the peptide to the binding trench. When the disulfide-bonded proteins were pre-treated with DTT, their ability to bind to the β6-20 peptide was restored, showing KD values similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that the capability to freely transition from open to closed conformation of the MSCRAMM regulates the affinity of SdrG for the ligand, and that locking SdrG in either conformation abolishes its ability to bind to Fg. Conformational Changes upon β6-20 Ligand Binding—To probe the relative motion of the C terminus G″ strand between the apo-protein and the protein-peptide complex in solution, we used FRET spectroscopy (19Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. Eur. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, the rSdrG C-terminal residue Pro595 was mutated to tryptophan (Trp), which can act as an energy donor. Recombinant SdrG does not contain any other Trp residues. Another strategically positioned residue (either Ser483 or Glu381) was substituted with a Cys and its sulfhydryl moiety was covalently modified with a fluorophore (IAEDANS). If these two moieties are localized within a short distance, energy transfer from the donor (Trp) to the acceptor (AEDANS) results in measurable emission changes. The structural integrity of the point mutants was confirmed by circular dichroism (14Sillanpaa J. Xu Y. Nallapareddy S.R. Murray B.E. Hook M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2069-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), comparing the spectra of the mutant proteins to those of the unmodified SdrG; whereas the binding capability of the labeled proteins was validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent-type assays. After ensuring that the binding properties of the protein were not compromised by the mutagenesis and/or labeling, the spectral properties of the Trp residue and the AEDANS group were monitored, both before and after the addition of the β6-20 peptide. Introducing the acceptor at the bottom of the latching trench (Glu381) or within the N3 domain (Ser-483) and the donor Trp at the C terminus (Pro595) allowed us to monitor intramolecular movements in the presence or absence of the ligand. These molecular movements can be detected as changes in the relative distances of the C terminus to the N2 or N3 subdomains. If the fluorophore present at the bottom of the N2 latching trench (position 381) is in proximity of the Trp residue at the C terminus (position 595), we can clearly detect energy transfer (Fig. 3A)"

Here, we demonstrate that CXCR4 was co-immunoprecipitated with cyclophilin A (CyPA) from the lysate of HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4. Although both the glutathione S-transferase-CXCR4 N- and C-terminal fusion proteins were associated with the purified CyPA, truncation of the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 robustly inhibited the receptor co-immunoprecipitation with CyPA in intact cells, thereby suggesting a critical role of the receptor C terminus in this interaction. Ligand stimulation of CXCR4 induced CyPA phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, both of which were inhibited by truncation of the C-terminal domain of CXCR4. CyPA was associated with transportin 1, and knockdown of transportin 1 by RNA interference (RNAi) blocked CXCL12-induced nuclear translocation of CyPA, thereby suggesting a transportin 1-mediated nuclear import of CyPA. CyPA formed a complex with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2, which underwent nuclear export in response to activation of CXCR4. Interestingly, the CXCR4-mediated nuclear export of hnRNP A2 was blocked by RNAi of CyPA. Moreover, CXCR4-evoked activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was attenuated by CyPA RNAi, by overexpression of a PPIase-deficient mutant of CyPA (CyPA-R55A), and by pretreatment of the immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporine A and sanglifehrin A.

Chemokines comprise a large family of low molecular mass (8-10 kDa) proteins with chemoattractant properties whose main function is leukocyte recruitment in inflammatory sites. Chemokines mediate their biological effects by binding to specific seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors, designated CXCR1 through CXCR6, CCR1 through CCR11, CX3CR1, and XCR1, based on their specific preference for certain chemokines. Among these chemokines and chemokine receptors, the stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4 have attracted much attention because this receptor/ligand pair play important roles in human immunodeficiency virus infection, development of immune and central nervous systems, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and metastasis of many cancer types (1Aiuti A.

Recently, the CyPA-binding molecule sanglifehrin (SfA) was shown to inhibit macrophage colony stimulatory factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 and cell proliferation (32Sanchez-Tillo E. Wojciechowska M. Comalada M. Farrera C. Lloberas J. Celada A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and CsA was shown to inhibit chemokine-induced dendritic cell chemotaxis (33Chen T. Guo J. Yang M. Han C. Zhang M. Chen W. Liu Q. Wang J. Cao X. Blood. 2004; 103: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting involvement of CyPA in the MAPK signaling pathway and in chemotaxis. Here, we provide evidence that CyPA interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 after ligand-induced internalization of the receptor in endosomal compartments. Ligand stimulation of CXCR4 induced CyPA phosphorylation and translocation to nucleus, where it formed a complex with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2. CyPA plays a role in CXCR4-mediated nuclear export of hnRNP A2, activation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, and chemotactic cell migration. These data indicate critical role of CyPA in CXCR4 signaling involved in cell proliferation and migration. Plasmids and siRNAs—Plasmids encoding HA-CXCR4, HA-CXCR4 (Δ34), Myc-CXCR4, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated CXCR4 C terminus were obtained from Dr. Gang Pei (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). The GST-conjugated CXCR4 N terminus was constructed previously (22Li R. Luo C. Mines M. Zhang J. Fan G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37616-37627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the construction of CyPA in pcDNA3.1, the cDNA of CyPA was amplified by PCR from the cDNA library of HEK293 cells, and the amplified fragment was inserted into BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1. The CyPA siRNA, which is a pool of three target specific 20-25 nucleotide siRNAs (number 5478), and a scramble siRNA that does not lead to the specific degradation of any cellular message (number 4616) were purchased from Ambion, Inc. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of specific Arg55 to Ala (R55A) on CyPA was conducted by use of the GeneEditor site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The mutation was generated with the indicated primer: tagaataattgcgtgaaagca. The CyPA-R55A mutant was screened by restriction analysis. Once the mutation was confirmed, the cDNAs encoding the open reading frame for the CyPA-R55A mutant were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CXCR4 or CyPA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 were selected with 560 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) and evaluated for receptor expression by the radioligand binding assay using 125I-CXCL12. Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extraction—HeLa cells (5 × 107) were harvested and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cytoplasmic and nuclear samples were isolated using a Nuclear Extraction Kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were suspended in ice-cold buffer A (hypotonic) (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche) for 20 min in ice. Cell swelling was monitored by microscope (×400 lens). Cells were then transferred to a pre-cooled Dounce homogenizer and homogenized with 20 strokes (type B pestle) in ice. Cell extract was centrifuged at 4 °C and 400 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatant (cytoplasmic sample) was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. The nuclei pellets were washed in buffer A, suspended in ice-cold buffer B (hypertonic) (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche) for 30 min in ice and centrifuged at 4 °C and 9,300 × g for 15 min. Supernatant (nuclear extract) was then diluted with the appropriate amount of buffer B without NaCl to make it 150 mm NaCl final, before the addition of the antibodies. Purification of GST-CXCR4 Tail and His-CyPA Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Protein Binding Assay—The GST, GST-CXCR4 C terminus fusion proteins, or GST-CXCR4 N terminus fusion proteins were purified from the bacteria strain DH5α transformed with plasmids encoding the above proteins. Briefly, after incubation of the Escherichia coli at 37 °C for 12 h, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added and incubation was continued for another 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacteria were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and then sonicated on ice for 10 s. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with RIPA buffer, the purified GST or GST fusion protein-bound beads were resuspended in RIPA buffer. The His-tagged CyPA fusion proteins were purified from bacteria strain DH5α transformed with plasmids encoding His-CyPA. Briefly, the E. coli were cultured at 37 °C for 12 h, then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added and incubation continued for another 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacteria were resuspended in TMP buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then sonicated. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was applied to equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose by gravity flow, and His-CyPA was eluted with elution buffer containing TMP and 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. For the in vitro binding assay, aliquots of the glutathione-Sepharose bound GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with equal amounts of His-CyPA fusion proteins at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 2 min), and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min and detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—For the co-immunostaining of CXCR4 and CyPA, HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 were treated with carrier buffer or CXCL12 for various time intervals and fixed with methanol. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with an antibody mixture containing a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-CyPA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min. Cells were washed and incubated with a secondary antibody mixture containing a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) and a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. For co-localization between CyPA and EGFP-Rab5, HeLa cells transiently transfected with EGFP-Rab5 plasmids were treated with or without CXCL12 for different time intervals and immunostaining of CyPA was performed as described above. After the immunostaining of CyPA, the cells were counterstained with DAPI for 5 min. For the co-immunostaining of CyPA and ERK1/2, HeLa cells treated with CXCL12 for different time intervals were incubated with an antibody mixture containing a mouse monoclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-CyPA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min, followed by a secondary antibody mixture containing a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min. After the immunostaining of CyPA, the cells were counterstained with DAPI for 5 min. Confocal microscopy was performed on a LSM-510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion lens using dual excitation (488 nm for FITC, 568 nm for Cy3) and emission (515-540 nm for FITC, 590-610 nm for Cy3) filter sets. All digital images were captured at the same settings to allow direct quantitative comparison of staining patterns. Final images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The percentage of CyPA co-localized with EGFP-Rab5 was analyzed by calculating the colocalized CyPA fluorescence from the total EGFP-Rab5 fluorescence. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 or HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removal of the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 min), the cleared supernatant was collected and 10 μl of affinity purified anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-CyPA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads were then added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was collected by washing three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer. The final pellet was re-suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. 20 μl of this preparation was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins on the gel were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis. CyPA Phosphorylation Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals before being lysed in RIPA buffer. CyPA proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated CyPA proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphoserine/threonine antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with a CyPA antibody to confirm equal loading. MAPK Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals before being lysed in RIPA buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The blots were stripped and reprobed with an ERK2 antibody to confirm equal loading. Densitometric Analysis of Western Blots—The relative amount of the Western blot bands was measured by densitometric analysis using NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). The relative density of the protein bands was calculated in the area encompassing the immunoreactive protein band and subtracting the background of an adjacent nonreactive area in the same lane of the protein of interest. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 were transfected with control siRNA or CyPA-specific siRNA. Cells were incubated in Hepes (20 mm)-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of CXCL12 (10 nm) for 30 min. Cells were washed in ice-cold medium followed by continued incubation in ligand-free medium at 37 °C for 60 min. Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 60 min, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at 4 °C for 60 min. Cells were washed and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Chemotactic Cell Migration (Chemotaxis) Assay—The migration of HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 was evaluated using the Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay. Briefly, polycarbonate filters (10-μm pore size) coated with 20 μg/μl human collagen type IV were placed between the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD). The lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with 400-μl aliquots of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (chemotaxis buffer) or CXCL12 diluted in the chemotaxis buffer (0.001-10 nm). Cells (5 × 105/100 μl) were loaded into the upper compartments and incubated for 240 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells migrated toward media or CXCL12 gradients were counted under the microscope (×20 objective) after being stained with a Diff-Quik kit. The migration index was calculated based on the ratio of the number of cells crossing the filter toward CXCL12 gradients to the number of cells migrating toward media (control). Each experiment was performed at least three times. In a recent proteomic study by immunoprecipitating CXCR4 and analyzing the co-immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry, we identified a number of CXCR4-interacting proteins and characterized some of them (22Li R. Luo C. Mines M. Zhang J. Fan G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37616-37627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Ding Y. Li M. Zhang J. Li N. Xia Z. Hu Y. Wang S. Fan G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One of these proteins that attracted our attention was CyPA. To replicate the co-immunoprecipitation of CyPA with CXCR4, we stimulated HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals (0, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min), immunoprecipitated CXCR4 from the cell lysate, and detected the co-precipitated CyPA by Western blotting. The immunoprecipitation revealed a weak basal association of CyPA with CXCR4 prior to ligand treatment. CXCL12 (10 nm) stimulation resulted in a time-dependent association of CyPA with CXCR4, which peaked at 10-30 min and returned to near basal level after 120 min of incubation (Fig. 1A). The association of CyPA with CXCR4 appears to be specific because a pre-immune serum did not pull down any CyPA proteins (Fig. 1A). CyPA binds to target proteins containing X-Pro motifs (where X is any amino acid) (35Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because both the C- and N-terminal domains of CXCR4 contain the X-Pro motifs, we examined the possible direct binding of CyPA to the C- and/or N-terminal domains of CXCR4. Purified GST (control), GST-CXCR4 N terminus fusion proteins, or GST-CXCR4 C terminus fusion proteins were incubated with the purified CyPA and the co-precipitated CyPA was detected by Western blot analysis. We observed that the purified CyPA was co-precipitated with both the GST-conjugated C- and N-terminal domains of CXCR4 but not with the GST alone (Fig. 1B), thereby suggesting a physical interaction between CyPA and CXCR4. Previous studies have shown that CXCR4 undergoes rapid internalization in response to ligand stimulation (23Luo C. Pan H. Mines M. Watson K. Zhang J. Fan G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30081-30093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Ding Y. Li M. Zhang J. Li N. Xia Z. Hu Y. Wang S. Fan G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The same time frame for the receptor internalization and its association with CyPA raises an interesting question regarding the role of CXCR4 internalization in its interaction with CyPA. To address this question, we evaluated the association of CyPA with a C-terminal 34-amino acid deletion mutant of CXCR4 (Δ34), which has exhibited reduced internalization (11Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, CXCL12 (10 nm) stimulation for 10 min induced a robust increase in the association of CyPA with the full-length CXCR4. By contrast, the ligand-induced association of CyPA with CXCR4 (Δ34) was significantly reduced. These data suggest that the intact C-terminal domain of CXCR4 is critical for the receptor association with CyPA in intact cells. We also examined the effect of pertussis toxin (PTX) on CXCR4 interaction with CyPA. HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 were pretreated with or without PTX (200 ng/ml) for 24 h before being treated with or without CXCL12 (10 nm) for 10 min. The HA-CXCR4 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using an anti-HA antibody, and co-precipitated CyPA was detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D, PTX pretreatment did not affect the association of CyPA with CXCR4, thereby suggesting that activation of G proteins is not involved in this interaction. To visualize the association between CyPA and CXCR4 in intact ce"
https://openalex.org/W2053710327,"Site-specific methylation of cytosines is a key epigenetic mark of vertebrate DNA. While a majority of the methylated residues are in the symmetrical (meC)pG:Gp(meC) configuration, a smaller, but significant fraction is found in the CpA, CpT and CpC asymmetric (non-CpG) dinucleotides. CpG methylation is reproducibly maintained by the activity of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) on the newly replicated hemimethylated substrates (meC)pG:GpC. On the other hand, establishment and hereditary maintenance of non-CpG methylation patterns have not been analyzed in detail. We previously reported the occurrence of site- and allele-specific methylation at both CpG and non-CpG sites. Here we characterize a hereditary complex of non-CpG methylation, with the transgenerational maintenance of three distinct profiles in a constant ratio, associated with extensive CpG methylation. These observations raised the question of the signal leading to the maintenance of the pattern of asymmetric methylation. The complete non-CpG pattern was reinstated at each generation in spite of the fact that the majority of the sperm genomes contained either none or only one methylated non-CpG site. This observation led us to the hypothesis that the stable CpG patterns might act as blueprints for the maintenance of non-CpG DNA methylation. As predicted, non-CpG DNA methylation profiles were abrogated in a mutant lacking Dnmt1, the enzymes responsible for CpG methylation, but not in mutants defective for either Dnmt3a or Dnmt2."
https://openalex.org/W1998652199,"Accumulating evidence indicates a functional crosstalk between immune and endocrine mechanisms in the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. However, the impact of thyroid hormones (THs) in the initiation of adaptive immune responses has not yet been examined. Here we investigated the presence of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and the impact of THs in the physiology of mouse dendritic cells (DCs), specialized antigen-presenting cells with the unique capacity to fully activate naive T cells and orchestrate adaptive immunity. Both immature and lipopolysaccharide-matured bone marrow-derived DCs expressed TRs at mRNA and protein levels, showing a preferential cytoplasmic localization. Remarkably, physiological levels of triiodothyronine (T3) stimulated the expression of DC maturation markers (major histocompatibility complex II, CD80, CD86, and CD40), markedly increased the secretion of interleukin-12, and stimulated the ability of DCs to induce naive T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production in allogeneic T cell cultures. Analysis of the mechanisms involved in these effects revealed the ability of T3 to influence the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-kappaB on primed DCs. Our study provides the first evidence for the presence of TRs on bone marrow-derived DCs and the ability of THs to regulate DC maturation and function. These results have profound implications in immunopathology, including cancer and autoimmune manifestations of the thyroid gland at the crossroads of the immune and endocrine systems."
https://openalex.org/W2131820158,"Isoenzymes of phosphoglycerate kinase in Trypanosoma brucei are differentially expressed in its two main life stages. This study addresses how the organism manages to make sufficient amounts of the isoenzyme with the correct localization, which processes (transcription, splicing, and RNA degradation) control the levels of mRNAs, and how the organism regulates the switch in isoform expression. For this, we combined new quantitative measurements of phosphoglycerate kinase mRNA abundance, RNA precursor stability, trans splicing, and ribosome loading with published data and made a kinetic computer model. For the analysis of regulation we extended regulation analysis. Although phosphoglycerate kinase mRNAs are present at surprisingly low concentrations (e.g. 12 molecules per cell), its protein is highly abundant. Substantial control of mRNA and protein levels was exerted by both mRNA synthesis and degradation, whereas splicing and precursor degradation had little control on mRNA and protein concentrations. Yet regulation of mRNA levels does not occur by transcription, but by adjusting mRNA degradation. The contribution of splicing to regulation is negligible, as for all cases where splicing is faster than RNA precursor degradation.

The contribution of splicing to regulation is negligible, as for all cases where splicing is faster than RNA precursor degradation. The flux through a metabolic pathway depends on the kinetic characteristics and concentrations of the constituent enzymes, on the levels of co-enzymes, and on their compartmentation. The concentrations of the enzymes in turn depend on the rates of transcription, processing, nuclear export, translation, degradation of the mRNA, and protein processing and degradation. Because each of these levels can in principle be regulated, the challenge is how to analyze the behavior of such a complex system in terms of the underlying processes. Metabolic control analysis (MCA) 4The abbreviations used are: MCAmetabolic control analysisUTRuntranslated regionPGKphosphoglycerate kinasentnucleotideSLspliced leaderESTexpressed sequence tag. 4The abbreviations used are: MCAmetabolic control analysisUTRuntranslated regionPGKphosphoglycerate kinasentnucleotideSLspliced leaderESTexpressed sequence tag. and extensions that include gene expression is a powerful approach for the analysis of complex biochemical networks (1Kacser H.

Schuster S. The Regulation of Cellular Systems. Chapman & Hall, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). In MCA, the control exerted by an enzyme on a concentration of any substance X (5Westerhoff H.V. Van Dam K. Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987Google Scholar) is quantified by its concentration control coefficient, which is defined as the percentage increase of the steady-state concentration of X that results from a 1% activation of the enzyme of interest. The sum of the concentration control coefficients of all the enzymes in the network is 0. This reflects that (i) activation of some enzymes increases the concentration of X, whereas activation of other enzymes should reduce the concentration of X (these enzymes have negative concentration control coefficients), and (ii) the positive controls together are equal to the negative controls. The principles of MCA do not only apply to metabolic pathways; they can also be used and extended to dissect the control distribution in regulatory pathways beyond steady state (for example see Refs. 6Kahn D.

Earlier MCA, as also applied to trypanosomes, has looked more at the control of fluxes, showing that usually flux control coefficients are smaller than 1, because several enzymes partially control the flux (for example see Refs. 9Teusink B.

In this study we shall focus on the control of mRNA and protein concentrations. metabolic control analysis untranslated region phosphoglycerate kinase nucleotide spliced leader expressed sequence tag. metabolic control analysis untranslated region phosphoglycerate kinase nucleotide spliced leader expressed sequence tag. Questions about control (used strictly in the MCA sense) may be considered as what if questions. If the cell were to increase the concentration of a controlling enzyme or if a scientist were to add an inhibitor of this enzyme, the control coefficient indicates the extent to which a flux or concentration should change. Control coefficients may be viewed as the potential to regulate. To understand how a flux is actually regulated when the cell copes with a certain challenge, a complementary concept is required. To this aim regulation analysis has been developed. In its original form (12ter Kuile B. Westerhoff H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Rossell S. van der Weijden C. Kruckeberg A. Bakker B. Westerhoff H. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it dissects to what extent a metabolic flux is regulated by metabolism and to what extent by gene expression. An enzyme rate v is usually the mathematical product of the enzyme capacity Vmax, which depends on the enzyme concentration e, and a metabolic function, which depends on metabolite concentrations M and affinity constants K as shown in Equation 1, v=Vmax(e)×f(M,K)(Eq. 1) Taking the logarithm of both sides of this equation and comparing two different conditions, one obtains Equation 2, Δlogv=ΔlogVmax(e)+Δlogf(M,K)(Eq. 2) Dividing by Δlogv yields Equation 3, 1=ΔlogVmax(e)Δlogv+Δlogf(M,K)Δlogv≡ρhierarchical+ρmetabolic(Eq. 3) in which ρhierarchical and ρmetabolic are the hierarchical (i.e. gene expression) and metabolic regulation coefficients. The hierarchy of gene expression can be further dissected to analyze regulation at the levels of transcription, precursor splicing and degradation, mRNA degradation, translation, and protein degradation (14Daran-Lapujade P. Rossell S. van Gulik W.M. Luttik M.A. de Groot M.J. Slijper M. Heck A.J. Daran J.M. de Winde J.H. Westerhoff H.V. Pronk J.T. Bakker B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T. brucei multiplies as “bloodstream form” in the blood and tissue fluids of mammals and as “procyclic form” in the midgut of tsetse flies. Both forms can be maintained indefinitely in culture. In bloodstream trypanosomes, glycolysis is simple but has unique features: pyruvate is excreted as the dominant end product; nine enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and glycerol metabolism are compartmentalized in a microbody (the glycosome); and gluconeogenesis is absent. In the procyclic form, energy metabolism is more diverse, with major contributions from the mitochondrion (16van Weelden S.W. van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12451-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). T. brucei bloodstream form glycolysis is an attractive model to initiate quantitative studies of control and regulation, because both the glycolytic pathway and the mechanisms available for regulating gene expression are simpler than in other eukaryotes, including yeasts. The kinetic characteristics and activities of all of the (known) enzymes, and the concentrations of all the (known) metabolites, have been determined. We have previously used this information to develop a robust model of bloodstream trypanosome glycolysis, which not only explained known pathway characteristics but also predicted consequences of perturbations of the system that have since been verified experimentally (10Bakker B.M.

Similarly, the T. brucei gene expression cascade is simpler than that of other organisms, because transcription by RNA polymerase II appears to be constant for all genes during exponential growth. The protein-encoding genes are organized in polycistronic transcription units that may contain 100 or more open reading frames; promoters for these have previously proven elusive (22Martinez-Calvillo S. Nguyen D. Stuart K. Myler P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Martinez-Calvillo S. Yan S. Nguyen D. Fox M. Stuart K. Myler P.J. Mol.

Parasitol. 1998; 90: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mature mRNAs are formed through co-transcriptional 5′-trans splicing of a capped 39-nucleotide spliced leader (SL), and coupled 3′-polyadenylation (25Liang X. Haritan A. Uliel S. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to nearly all other organisms from prokaryotes to man, trypanosome gene organization precludes the differential regulation of expression of individual protein-coding genes at the level of transcription initiation. Alternative regulation points are RNA processing, export from the nucleus, translation, and degradation. So far, there is strong evidence only for regulation of mRNA degradation and translation (26Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), but the strength of this regulation is unclear. There are three PGK genes in the trypanosome genome, i.e. PGKA, PGKB, and PGKC. They are adjacent to each other in a single transcriptional unit (27Gibson W.C. Swinkels B.W. Borst P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the three PGK genes are co-transcribed, they have different expression patterns (27Gibson W.C. Swinkels B.W. Borst P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The PGKA protein and mRNA are present at low levels in the glycosomes of all life stages of the parasite (28Alexander K. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Alexander K. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PGKB and PGKC have distinct expression patterns as follows. The cytosolic PGKB protein and its mRNA are predominantly expressed in the procyclic form, and the glycosomally localized PGKC isoenzyme (and the PGKC mRNA) is the predominant isoenzyme in the bloodstream form (27Gibson W.C. Swinkels B.W. Borst P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Misset O. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The total cellular PGK activity does not differ much between bloodstream- and insect form trypanosomes. However, correct localization of PGK activity, and hence regulation of PGKB and PGKC expression, are vital, because cytosolic PGK activity causes growth arrest of bloodstream form trypanosomes (31Blattner J. Helfert S. Michels P. Clayton C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11596-11600Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Qualitatively, the expression patterns of the isoenzymes can be explained by the different stabilities of their mature mRNAs, depending on their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) (32Blattner J. Clayton C.E. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Colasante C. Robles A. Li C.-H. Schwede A. Benz C. Voncken F. Guilbride D.L. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem.

Guerra-Giraldez C. Drozdz M. Irmer H. Clayton C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There might be additional regulation at the levels of splicing (37Kapotas N. Bellofatto V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Siegel T. Tan K. Cross G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), translation (39Parsons M. Hill T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and variations in protein stability, but the quantitative importance of these processes is unknown, and there has not been a methodology even to establish this. In this study we developed this methodology and applied it to the PGK isoenzyme expression in T. brucei. We measured accessible properties of the expression of the PGKB and PGKC genes and analyzed the distribution of control and regulation of the expression of the PGK locus. We built a quantitative computer model of the bloodstream form to help us do this. We found that in bloodstream form trypanosomes the control of the PGK mRNA concentrations is distributed between transcription, splicing, and mRNA degradation, whereas T. brucei only uses mRNA degradation to regulate the PGK mRNA concentrations when it differentiates from the bloodstream to the insect form. Cell Culture—Bloodstream form cell line BF449 (40Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was cultivated in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin (Cayla) in an air-saturated incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Procyclic PF449 was cultivated in SDM-79 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin in closed culture flasks at 30 °C (41van Deursen F.J. Shahi S.H. Turner C.M.R. Hartmann C. Guerra-Giraldez C. Matthews K.R. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Quantification of Mature TUBA and PGK mRNA—Total RNA was isolated in the exponential phase of growth (bloodstream forms maximally 2 × 106 cells/ml and procyclic cells maximally 5 × 106 cells/ml), using peqGOLD-Trifast (peqLab) or TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tracer RNAs were made from a 983-bp fragment of the α-tubulin (TUBA) gene (positions 3–986) cloned into pGEMTeasy (pHD1792), and gPGK44-1, which contains the PGKC coding region plus 33 bp of its 5′-UTR (42Dovey H.F. Parsons M. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of a single length product. The plasmid DNAs were linearized with SpeI or XhoI, respectively, and transcribed by T7 polymerase or, alternatively, linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T3 polymerase. To measure the yield of mRNA, the tubulin tracer was added to either the Trifast solution or the purified RNA; the relative intensities of the tubulin signals were measured after Northern blotting. The average yield of this RNA was 55%. Total RNA was denatured in formamide at 95 °C and separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde/formamide-agarose gels. The RNA was blotted onto neutral nylon membranes (Nytran), stained with methylene blue to check for even transfer, and then hybridized with the PGK or TUBA probe tracer fragments that had been labeled by random priming or PCR with 32P-labeled nucleotides. SRP RNA (43Liu L. Liang X. Uliel S. Unger R. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47348-47357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used as a loading control. Signals were detected and measured by phosphorimaging. To quantify the absolute amounts of PGK or TUBA mRNA in trypanosomes, various known amounts of the pure tracer mRNAs (see above) were added to the lysate before mRNA isolation. To calculate the amounts back into molecule numbers, we used mature and precursor RNA lengths and assumed a mean nucleotide monophosphate mass of 339 g/mol. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—To quantify kinetics of precursor splicing and degradation, exponentially growing cell cultures with a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml were incubated either with Sinefungin (1 or 2 μg/ml) for 30 min with subsequent incubation with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) for 0–25 min or with actinomycin D alone. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, after which supernatant was removed and pellet was taken up in TRIzol (Invitrogen) for total RNA isolation. The RNase protection probe for measurement of PGKB/C processing was a BamHI-SpeI fragment subcloned from pHD1417 (34Haile S. Estévez A.M. Clayton C. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1491-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) into pBluescript KS (pHD1402). The fragment contains the regions from the PGKB stop codon to the PGKC start codon, without the regulatory U-rich element. As a control for product identification, a similar construct with the U-rich element present was also used (pHD1402). RNase protection assays with the full-length probe yielded multiple products, presumably because of “breathing” of A-U rich hybrids. The full-length probe therefore could not be used for quantification of precursor. The plasmids were cut with SalI, and probes were transcribed by T7 polymerase (MAXIscript, Ambion) in the presence of ATP, CTP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP. RNase protection analysis was performed using RNase protection analysis III kit (Ambion). Each RNase protection reaction included 10 μgof trypanosome RNA and 8 × 104 cpm of probe (Cerenkov counts). If twice as much probe was used, the signals were similar indicating that probe was in excess. A 32P-labeled 10-bp Invitrogen DNA ladder served as a size marker. Products were run on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gels for 4–6 h, removed from the glass plates, put onto a piece of Whatman paper, and vacuum-dried overnight. Controls contained only 1 × 104 cpm of probe. Signals were detected and measured by phosphorimaging. Degradation curves were analyzed using the Kaleidagraph program. To check the precursor status of band “a,” we used RNA prepared from trypanosome with inducible RNA interference against SMD1 (44Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF30 (45Hendriks E.F. Abdul-Razak A. Matthews K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26870-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The identities of bands were confirmed by using shorter probes specific for the 5′ end of the PGKC mRNA and the spacer region, and by assessing stage specificity (not shown). Polysome Analysis—Polysomes were isolated as described in Ref. 46Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Shen S. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. RNA was purified as described above, and the distribution of different RNAs was analyzed by Northern blotting. Purification of TbPGKC—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (a kind gift of Prof. P. Michels) containing the plasmid TbPGKC (47Zomer A.W. Allert S. Chevalier N. Callens M. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were grown, treated with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce TbPGKC expression, and harvested according to the published protocol. In short, cells were harvested and lysed, and nucleic acids were digested, and lysates were treated with protamine sulfate. The supernatant was then concentrated with a YM-10 filter and applied to a Resource S column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an Akta Explorer fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl in the loading buffer. Peak fractions from column purification were tested enzymatically for PGK activity, and the samples with activity were evaluated on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All fractions that had PGK activity were >90% pure (as judged from Coomassie Blue and Silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels; data not shown). This was pure enough to enable us to use the fractions as standards on Western blots. Protein concentration was determined with a BCA (Pierce) assay using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as a standard. Quantitative Immunoblotting—For each sample 3 × 106 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and finally resuspended in 15 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 15 μl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were stored at –80 °C before analysis. Protein samples and purified TbPGKC were boiled for 5–10 min at 95 °C and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%). As gel and transfer inhomogeneities are the major source of correlated errors in immunoblotting (48Schilling M. Maiwald T. Bohl S. Kollmann M. Kreutz C. Timmer J. Klingmuller U. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6400-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we randomized samples on every blot. Proteins were transferred to a methanol-activated polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by blotting overnight at 4 °C and 20V. Membranes were subsequently placed for 1 h in block buffer, containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80)). After five wash steps in TBST the blot was submerged in block buffer with PGKC antibody Do425 (kind gift from Prof. Paul Michels; raised against recombinant PGKC (47Zomer A.W. Allert S. Chevalier N. Callens M. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) (1:10,000) for 1 h. After washing, blots were put in block buffer with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO A/S, Denmark) (1:2000) for 1 h and washed in TBST, and horseradish peroxidase activity was measured after a 2-min incubation with LumilightPLUS Western blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science). Quantitation was done with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) by total surface scan, which was corrected for differences in spot width. With different dilutions of cell lysate and standard it was checked if the appearing bands were in the linear range of the blot. Background was subtracted from the PGKC bands, and for each separate blot, the PGKC band was compared with the standards so as to obtain the mass of the PGKC in the cell lysate lanes. From the number of cells in the lysate (determined by cell count), the molecular weight of the protein (47 kDa), and Avogadro's number, we calculated the number of PGKC molecules per cell. Calculations and Graphs—Steady-state calculations were done in Excel (Microsoft). Data were plotted with Sigmaplot or Kaleidograph. The transcription model for PGK was constructed in Jarnac 2.0 (49Sauro H.M. Hofmeyr J.H.S. Rohwer J.M. Snoep J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2034456929,"Melanin pigments are synthesized within specialized organelles called melanosomes and polymerize on intraluminal fibrils that form within melanosome precursors. The fibrils consist of proteolytic fragments derived from Pmel17, a pigment cell-specific integral membrane protein. The intracellular pathways by which Pmel17 accesses melanosome precursors and the identity of the Pmel17 derivatives within fibrillar melanosomes have been a matter of debate. We show here that antibodies that detect Pmel17 within fibrillar melanosomes recognize only the luminal products of proprotein convertase cleavage and not the remaining products linked to the transmembrane domain. Moreover, antibodies to the N and C termini detect only Pmel17 isoforms present in early biosynthetic compartments, which constitute a large fraction of detectable steady state Pmel17 in cell lysates because of slow early biosynthetic transport and rapid consumption by fibril formation. Using an antibody to a luminal epitope that is destroyed upon modification by O-linked oligosaccharides, we show that all post-endoplasmic reticulum Pmel17 isoforms are modified by Golgi-associated oligosaccharide transferases, and that only processed forms contribute to melanosome biogenesis. These data indicate that Pmel17 follows a single biosynthetic route from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex and endosomes to melanosomes, and that only fragments encompassing previously described functional luminal determinants are present within the fibrils. These data have important implications for the site and mechanism of fibril formation.

These data have important implications for the site and mechanism of fibril formation. Melanin pigments function in photoprotection in the skin and ocular development and visual acuity in the eye. They are synthesized and stored within specialized lysosome-related organelles of melanocytes and ocular pigment epithelia called melanosomes (1Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Hearing V.J. Pigm. Cell Res. 2000; 13: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Melanosomes bearing brown and black melanins, or eumelanins, develop within melanocytes through four morphologically distinct stages. Stage I and II melanosomes lack melanins and are characterized by the progressive development of intraluminal fibrillar striations, upon which melanins are deposited as they are synthesized in stages III and IV. The fibrils likely serve to detoxify oxidative melanin intermediates and concentrate them for storage (in ocular pigment cells) or for transfer to keratinocytes (in epidermal melanocytes) (3Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The fibrils resemble amyloid both morphologically and structurally (4Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Alory-Jost C. Marks M.S. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Plos Biol. 2006; 4: e6Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the nature of their formation may help to decipher mechanisms controlling pathological amyloid biogenesis. The major biogenetic component of the melanosome fibrils is the pigment cell-specific protein, Pmel17 (also known as gp100 or SILV; referred to here as Pmel). 3The abbreviations used are: PmelPmel17CSproprotein convertase cleavage siteEndoHendoglycosidase HERendoplasmic reticulumIFMimmunofluorescence microscopyKLDKringle-like domainNTRN-terminal regionPEphycoerythrinPKDpolycystic kidney disease-1 repeat-like regionPNGase Fprotein N-glycanase FRPTregion of internal repeatsWTwild-typeCHOCHO-K1 cellsFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyERGICER-Golgi intermediate compartment. 3The abbreviations used are: PmelPmel17CSproprotein convertase cleavage siteEndoHendoglycosidase HERendoplasmic reticulumIFMimmunofluorescence microscopyKLDKringle-like domainNTRN-terminal regionPEphycoerythrinPKDpolycystic kidney disease-1 repeat-like regionPNGase Fprotein N-glycanase FRPTregion of internal repeatsWTwild-typeCHOCHO-K1 cellsFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyERGICER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Pmel is the only pigment cell-specific protein required for fibril formation, as its ectopic expression in non-pigment cells is sufficient to induce the formation of melanosome-like fibrils (5Berson J.F.

Although Pmel is clearly a critical component of melanosome fibrils, the mechanism by which Pmel adopts a fibrillar conformation in vivo remains unknown. To define this mechanism, it is critical to clearly understand Pmel biosynthetic trafficking within melanocytes to compartments in which fibrils form. Human Pmel is synthesized as a type I integral membrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence, a large luminal domain, a single 24-residue membrane-spanning domain, and a 45-residue cytoplasmic domain (18Kwon B.S.

Although these aspects of Pmel biosynthesis are well accepted, the proposed fate of the majority of Pmel has remained controversial (3Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Pigm.

Cell Res. 2006; 19: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Two different fates have been proposed. One model posits that fibril formation initiates on the internal membranes of multivesicular endosomes, subsequent to Pmel traversing the secretory pathway, including the Golgi complex, and accessing the early endosomal system (3Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Tenza D. Hurbain I. Harper D.C. Berson J.F. Thomas P.C.

This model assumes that all Pmel isoforms that exit the ER are processed by Golgi enzymes and cleaved by a proprotein convertase, such that only processed forms of the luminal Mα fragment accumulate in fibril-containing subcellular compartments. Although full-length, immature Pmel, unprocessed by the Golgi, is the predominant form detected in whole cell lysates by immunoblotting, and Golgi-modified and proteolytically processed forms of Pmel are not recovered stoichiometrically by various methods, these features can be explained as follows: (i) a slow rate of folding (and hence slow ER release to downstream secretory compartments) balanced by (ii) a rapid loss of extractable Golgi-processed Pmel fragments to insoluble fibrils (15Berson J.F. Theos A.C. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. J.

Biochem. 1995; 232: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The model is supported by quantitative immunoelectron microscopy analyses, in which uncleaved Pmel forms are detected throughout the Golgi and endosomes, but not in stage II melanosomes (5Berson J.F.

Res. 1969; 26: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) showing melanosome fibrils forming in compartments contiguous with smooth tubular membranes in chick feather melanocytes. Although Maul (35Maul G.G. J. Ultrasctruct. Res. 1969; 26: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) interpreted these membranes at the time to correspond to “smooth endoplasmic reticulum,” the study predated a morphologic characterization of the endocytic pathway and the trans Golgi network, and the results would be more appropriately interpreted today to support either of these membrane systems as precursors to premelanosomes. The second model posits that the majority of Pmel is targeted directly from the ER to immature stage I melanosomes, bypassing the Golgi complex (16Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Valencia J. Matsunaga J.

This model, stemming initially from a literal interpretation of the 1969 conclusion by Maul (35Maul G.G. J. Ultrasctruct.

A recent study showed that Pmel is modified by O-linked oligosaccharides, a modification that occurs in the Golgi complex (37Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

These conclusions were supported by immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) analyses in which labeling by antibodies that react with immature forms of Pmel, but not with Mα, overlapped with labeling by HMB45/HMB50/NKI-beteb and by adaptor complexes, respectively (16Kushimoto T.

Many of the data supporting the second model are based on subcellular fractionation, the results of which might reflect impurities in isolated fractions. Several conclusions, however, seem incompatible with the first model, including the following: (i) the epitope reactivity of several of the antibodies; (ii) the inferred detection of Pmel isoforms modified by some Golgi oligosaccharide transferases but not others; and (iii) the overlap of epitopes for immature Pmel isoforms with stage II melanosomes by IFM. Here we present data that counter these conclusions and suggest that the data supporting them might warrant reevaluation. We show that immature forms of Pmel are found only in pre-Golgi compartments of melanocytic cells and that stage II melanosomes harbor only Golgi-modified Pmel fragments that are derived from Mα and that bear sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides. The results do not support a model in which a distinct cohort of Pmel accesses melanosomes either directly from the ER or with unmodified oligosaccharides. Nevertheless, we show that neither N- nor O-linked glycans are required for trafficking of Pmel through the conventional biosynthetic pathway to melanosome precursor compartments, and we discuss the potential roles of different types of glycosylation in fibrillogenesis.

Designing potent and selective inhibitors of ADAMTS-5 as a potential osteoarthritis therapeutic is an ongoing effort but has been difficult because ADAMTS members share little sequence homology with the well studied and related matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) (9Lovejoy B.

The limited expression levels and low solubility of catalytic domain constructs of ADAMTS proteins has thus far precluded the determination of a crystal structure of any member of this family. To overcome these obstacles, we used site-directed mutagenesis, high pressure refolding, and thermal unfolding studies to prepare pure and active catalytic domain of ADAMTS-5 (cataADAMTS-5) from Escherichia coli and determined its crystal structure at 1.4 Å resolution in the presence of an inhibitor. Although the fold of the protein resembles other metalloproteases, the shape of its substrate binding site is unique, and a novel structural calcium binding site was discovered for this family. In our structure, a pan-protease inhibitor binds at the catalytic site and protrudes into the unique S1′-subsite of the enzyme. Elucidation of a high resolution three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of an ADAMTS metalloproteinase enables detailed study of substrate specificity and the potential for rational design of selective inhibitors of this important class of enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression of the Catalytic Domain of ADAMTS-5—A full-length cDNA clone identical to the published sequence of human ADAMTS-5 (SwissProt/TrEMBL accession number NM 007038) was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. Using the ADAMTS-5 cDNA clone as a template, the DNA sequence for the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-5 (amino acids Ser262 to Ile480) was amplified by PCR, causing the addition of Met-Ala residues at the amino terminus of the protein. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to incorporate the L282K mutation. The resulting coding region was inserted into an expression vector (Preclac, specR) downstream of a modified recA promoter/lac operator. A 10-liter fermentation was performed using the resulting plasmid and E. coli host strain MON208 (W3310, rpoH358, lacIQ, ompT::kan). Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation 4 h after induction. The cell paste was resuspended in 5.0 ml of 10 mm Tris/15 mm EDTA per gram of cell paste. The cell suspension was passed through a chilled microfluidizer twice at 10,000–15,000 psi. Inclusion bodies were isolated from the cell lysate by centrifugation.Refolding and Purification of the Catalytic Domain of ADAMTS-5—Isolated inclusion bodies were resuspended to a final concentration of ∼5 mg/ml in buffer A containing 50 mm glycine, pH 10.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 500 μm ZnCl2, 2% protease inhibitor mixture (P-8849; Sigma), 50 mm arginine, 100 mm reduced glutathione. The suspension was delivered to the cavity of a High Hydrostatic Pressure Apparatus (11St. John R. Carpenter J. Randolph T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following depressurization, the inclusion body extract was directly exchanged into a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm oxidized glutathione, 50 mm arginine, 10 mm CaCl2, 200 μm ZnCl2, and 1% protease inhibitors. The protein was allowed to refold at room temperature until catalytic activity peaked. The refolded material was then clarified by filtration, concentrated, and passed over a 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare). CataADAMTS-5 fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE purity greater than 95% and size exclusion chromatography migration as a monomeric protein.ADAMTS-5 Activity Assay—Direct kinetic analysis of ADAMTS-5 catalytic domain activity was determined using the 6-Fam/QSY-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein, QSY-9-maleimide; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorescently quenched peptide K(6-Fam)-DVQEFRGVTAVIRC(Qsy-9)-KGK (13Hills R.

Briefly, a 1 μm solution of peptide in buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij, pH 7.5) was incubated with ∼450 nm of cataADAMTS-5 at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. Fluorescence at 519 nm was monitored over a 60-min period with an excitation of 495 nm. Fitting of dose-response data for titration and inhibitor potency determinations was done using commercial non-linear curve-fitting software (GraFit version 5; Erithacus Software, Ltd.). The supplied 4-parameter equation for determining IC50 was modified to allow the inclusion of no enzyme controls, and the Morrison equation for tight binding inhibitors (14Copeland, R. A. in Enzymes (Copeland, R. A., ed) 2nd Ed., pp. 310-313, Wiley-VCH Publishers, Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar) was added as a user-defined equation.Thermal Stability Assay—The Tm of cataADAMTS-5 in complex with various inhibitors and substrate peptides was assessed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) and monitoring Sypro Orange fluorescence at 540 nm (15Pantoliano M.W.

For these studies, 105 μm concentration of known ligands was added to the protein samples, and the Tm values and curve shapes were compared across samples.Crystallization and Structure Determination of the Catalytic Domain of ADAMTS-5—Crystals of the complex were grown by vapor diffusion using 10 mg/ml protein and a well solution of 25% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Needle crystals appeared in 1 day and matured to a size of 0.3 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm by 7 days. Diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Quantum-210 detector at APS (Argonne, IL) beamline 17-ID. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 306-326Google Scholar).

In addition, traditional methods for refolding proteins from inclusion bodies that succeeded for metalloproteases, including members of the MMP and ADAM families, have not succeeded to date for aggrecanases. We designed several point mutants and variations of the length of the catalytic domain constructs to improve both expression yield and solubility. These studies led us to focus on optimizing the expression of cataADAMTS-5 in E. coli inclusion bodies using a construct containing residues 262–480 with a single point mutation (L282K), converting a surface hydrophobic residue into a charged amino acid (Fig. 1). This protein accumulated in inclusion bodies and was successfully made soluble using the new technology of high hydrostatic pressure refolding (11St. John R. Carpenter J. Randolph T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12St. John R. Carpenter J. Balny C. Randolph T. J. Biol.

The pure cataADAMTS-5 protein efficiently cleaved the peptide substrate K-(6FAM)-DVQE↓FRGVTAVIRC-(Qsy9)-KGK; (↓ indicates the cleavage site, Fig. 2b) (13Hills R. Mazzarella R. Fok K. Liu M.

The addition of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (Fig. 3a, TIMP-3), the natural inhibitor of ADAMTS-5 activity (24Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M.D. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol.

Tight binding inhibitor analysis of these data yielded a Ki of 38 nm and an active enzyme concentration of 332 nm. This active concentration was 73% of the protein concentration established by absorbance at 280 nm suggesting that most of the cataAD-AMTS-5 protein is catalytically competent. A hydroxamic acid-based small molecule inhibitor of ADAMTS-5, Compound 1 (Fig. 3b), had an IC50 of 0.29 μm.FIGURE 2Expression, refolding, and purification of cataADAMTS-5. a, SDS-PAGE gel showing insoluble cataADAMTS-5 run under reducing conditions (lane 1) compared with the purified, active cataAD-AMTS-5 protein (lane 2) run in non-reducing conditions.

We and others have observed that a number of proteins are more prone to crystallize with inhibitors that produce a significant increase in protein unfolding temperature (Tm). Analysis of the shift in protein unfolding temperature (Tm) as a function of different buffer components and known ligands identified a combination of conditions that increased the thermal stability of the protein. The most significant change in its Tm, an increase of 27 °C (Tm = 43° → Tm = 70 °C), was observed when cataAD-AMTS-5 was in complex with Compound 1 (Fig. 4). Addition of this inhibitor enabled crystals of the complex to be grown. The crystal belongs to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 53.06, b = 44.49, c = 76.38 Å, and β = 90.07° and two protein molecules in each asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement methods, using a searching model of a combination of five metalloproteinase structures including ADAM-17, ADAM-33, atrolysin-C, acutolysin-A, and adamalysin II, led to an unambiguous solution. The three-dimensional structure was refined at 1.4 Å resolution with an Rfree value of 21.4% (Table 1).FIGURE 4Thermal unfolding assay identifies stabilization for cataADAMTS-5 in the presence of an inhibitor. Addition of Compound 1 to the protein raises the Tm from 43 °C in its absence (○) to 70 °C in its presence (•). At elevated temperatures the dye bound to the protein is diminished as a result of protein aggregation/precipitation occurring as the temperature is increased, and therefore the fluorescence is decreased.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural Analysis—Amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of the catalytic domains of various members of three metalloproteinase families, including MMP, venom matrix metalloproteinase, and ADAM, are known (10Orth P.

An amino acid sequence alignment of members of these families reveals that outside its own family, ADAMTS-5 is most homologous to ADAM-33 with a sequence identity of ∼30%, followed by several venom matrix metalloproteinases, including acutalysin-A 25%, atrolysin-D 23%, adamalysin-II 22%, and atrolysin-C 19%, and MMPs <10% (MMP-3 8%, MMP-13 6%, and MMP-8 5%). Although TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, ADAM-17) only has 17% sequence identity with cataADAMTS-5, like ADAM-33 it shows notable similarities in the defined secondary structural regions within cataADAMTS-5.The overall fold of the cataADAMTS-5 protein resembles the α/β structure of other metalloproteases with their characteristic central five-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 5) formed by four strands (II, I, III, V) in a parallel configuration and a short fifth one (IV) in an antiparallel configuration. The central β-sheet is flanked with two helices, A and C, on its concave side and one long helix, B, on its convex side. Although helices A and C are shared with other metalloproteases, such as venom matrix metalloproteinase, ADAM, and MMP structures, known MMP structures totally lack the long helix B. In addition, cataADAMTS-5 distinguishes itself from all other metalloprotease structures reported to date in having the helix B tether itself to the strand V by a novel disulfide bond between residues 342 and 394 in the sequence (Fig. 5). In total, the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-5 contains four disulfide linkages, compared with three in ADAM33 as well as ADAM17 and zero in all known MMP structures.FIGURE 5Ribbon representation in stereo of cataADAMTS-5. The inhibitor, Compound 1, is present in this structure. It chelates with the catalytic Zn2+ ion and extends into the S1′-pocket. One Zn2+ (silver) and three calcium ions (orange) are found in the cataADAMTS-5 structure. Two calcium ions form a coordination cluster near the C-terminal end. The secondary structures are numbered sequentially based on the sequence. The structural portion representing the catalytic site is colored gold. Four disulfide linkages in cataADAMTS-5 are shown in yellow. The mutation site, L282K, is indicated in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The central β-sheet and its flanked α-helices constitute the N-terminal part of the protein chain. The remaining 65 C-terminal residues harbor the last Zn2+-chelating His420 residue, enclose the S1′-pocket, and allow residue Asp474 to complete a unique calcium cluster site. The surface flexible loop comprising residues Gly322-Asp323-Lys324-Asp325-Lys326 (highlighted in red and shown in Fig. 5) is the only flexible area in this structure as well as other cataADAMTS-5 structures that we determined and shows little or no electron density in the Fourier maps. It may represent an antibody recognition site.Recently, the structure of the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-1 was reported at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society (26Gerhardt S. Hassall G. Hargreaves D. Ting A. Hawtin P. Flavell L. McCall E. Minshull C. Barker W. Abbott W.M. Pauptit R. Parker A.E. Transactions of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society. 32. Elsevier, AmsterdamFebruary 11–14, 2007Google Scholar). The coordinates of the ADAMTS-1 structure have not been made available to the public; thus, an exact comparison with cataADAMTS-5 is not possible. However, judging from the abstract by Gerhardt et al. (26Gerhardt S. Hassall G. Hargreaves D. Ting A. Hawtin P. Flavell L. McCall E. Minshull C. Barker W. Abbott W.M. Pauptit R. Parker A.E. Transactions of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society. 32. Elsevier, AmsterdamFebruary 11–14, 2007Google Scholar) and comparing the printed structure of ADAMTS-1 with our structure of ADAMTS-5, it can be concluded that the secondary structures of both enzymes are similar. This is expected, because both the catalytic domain and the residues around the active site of these two enzymes share 60% sequence identity.The mutation site of the present cataADAMTS-5 structure, L282K, highlighted in red in Fig. 5, is located near the end of the first short helix A1, which is at the surface and sits in a water channel. Its polar side chain of the first molecule, molecule-A, of the asymmetric unit forms a charged interaction directly with Asp469 of a neighboring molecule, whereas the polar side chain of the molecule-B of the asymmetric unit forms a hydrogen bond with a bridged water, which in turn interacts with Asp469 of a neighboring molecule. This site is quite far from the active site and likely has minimal impact on catalytic activity but may contribute to the packing of the lattice in this crystal form. In addition, mutation of this site is crucial for crystallization as the wild-type cataADAMTS-5, refolded and purified under the same conditions used for the mutated one, has failed to yield any crystals under a wide range of crystallization conditions, including the one producing crystals for the L282K mutant.A superposition of representative structures from three different families of metalloproteases, i.e. cataADAMTS-5 for ADAMTS, ADAM-33 (protein code 1r55) for ADAM, and MMP-3 (1d7x) for MMP, is shown in Fig. 6. ADAMTS-5 and ADAM-33 show significant overlap in the secondary structure (sheets and helices) but to a much lesser extent in the loop regions. In contrast, the MMP-3 structure loosely overlays in the 5-strand sheet and central helices A and C, whereas the rest of the structure is quite deviated when compared with ADAMTS-5 or ADAM-33. The flexible S1′-loops in all three structures are quite different, and this family-dependent specificity is further illustrated below.FIGURE 6A superposition of the structures for three representive metalloprotease family members.

The side chain of Leu433 forms the roof of the channel, but this residue is solvent-exposed and may be flexible. Three key interactions between the inhibitor and the protein define their binding mode. The hydroxamate head group chelates to the Zn2+ ion and hydrogen bonds to Glu411, the sulfone group hydrogen bonds to the backbone of Leu379, and the phenyl-O-phenyl group has a strong hydrophobic interaction with the highly lipophilic and specific S1′-pocket. The pocket can be defined by three elements: the base of the strand IV defined by amino acids 379–382 with Leu379 as a marker, a portion of the helix C including amino acids Leu402 to Glu411, and the loop conpocket will undergo a certain degree of conformational change upon binding to inhibitors of different sizes and shapes.

The role of phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in the mechanism of EGF-mediated protection of tight junction from acetaldehyde was evaluated in Caco-2 cell monolayers. EGF-mediated prevention of acetaldehyde-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and an increase in inulin permeability, and subcellular redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 was attenuated by reduced expression of PLCgamma1 by short hairpin RNA. EGF induced a rapid activation of PLCgamma1 and PLC-dependent membrane translocation of PKCepsilon and PKCbetaI. Inhibition of PKC activity or selective interference of membrane translocation of PKCepsilon and PKCbetaI by RACK interference peptides attenuated EGF-mediated prevention of acetaldehyde-induced increase in inulin permeability and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1. BAPTA-AM and thapsigargin blocked EGF-induced membrane translocation of PKCbetaI and attenuated EGF-mediated prevention of acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight junctions. EGF-induced translocation of PKCepsilon and PKCbetaI was associated with organization of F-actin near the perijunctional region. This study shows that PLCgamma-mediated activation of PKCepsilon and PKCbetaI and intracellular calcium is involved in EGF-mediated protection of tight junctions from acetaldehyde-induced insult."
https://openalex.org/W2118984441,"Northeast India, the only region which currently forms a land bridge between the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, has been proposed as an important corridor for the initial peopling of East Asia. Given that the Austro-Asiatic linguistic family is considered to be the oldest and spoken by certain tribes in India, Northeast India and entire Southeast Asia, we expect that populations of this family from Northeast India should provide the signatures of genetic link between Indian and Southeast Asian populations. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed mtDNA and Y-Chromosome SNP and STR data of the eight groups of the Austro-Asiatic Khasi from Northeast India and the neighboring Garo and compared with that of other relevant Asian populations. The results suggest that the Austro-Asiatic Khasi tribes of Northeast India represent a genetic continuity between the populations of South and Southeast Asia, thereby advocating that northeast India could have been a major corridor for the movement of populations from India to East/Southeast Asia."

However, none of these catalytic antibodies have been developed into a therapeutic agent. Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative spiral bacteria (6Marshall B.J. Goodwin C.S. Warren J.R. Murray R.

H. pylori produces a large amount of urease, which is essential for the colonization of the stomach and pathogenesis. Although H. pylori infection can currently be treated with antibiotics (8Goodwin C.S. Blake P. Blincow E. Chemotherapy. 1986; 17: 309-314Google Scholar, 9Nagata K. Satoh H. Iwahi T. Shimoyama T.

H. pylori urease enables the bacterium to colonize the human stomach by neutralizing the acidic condition, through the conversion of urea into ammonium (bicarbonate is also produced as a by-product). Therefore, a monoclonal catalytic antibody capable of destroying urease has a potential to be an effective therapeutic strategy to protect the stomach from the infection of H. pylori. We have already prepared HpU-9-L catalytic antibody light chain (10Hifumi E. Hatiuchi K. Okuda T. Nishizono A. Okamura Y. Uda T. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which was obtained by the immunization of whole molecules of the urease. One of the most important subjects in the study on catalytic antibody is whether or not we are able to prepare the catalytic antibody for the designated portion, which possesses the crucial function of the protein. Such catalytic antibody can erase the crucial function of targeting protein. In this study, a designed antigen (UreB), whose sequence is essential for the active site of the urease, was prepared and a catalytic antibody, UA15-L, was derived. The urease of H. pylori is a multimeric enzyme, which consists of an α-subunit and a β-subunit. The active site resides in the latter subunit. The crucial region to exhibit the enzymatic activity of the urease is considered to locate from aa 201–338 in the sequence of β-subunit of the urease (see the underlining in Fig. 1a). The polypeptide, referred as UreB, having the 138 amino acids was prepared in the following method. Genomic DNA extracted from H. pylori (ATCC 43504) was used as a template for PCR with oligonucleotide primers, in which the following primers were employed: forward primer (5′-AAGGATCCGCTTCTAACGATGCGAGC-3′), which contains a BamHI site (underlined), and the reverse (5′-GGGAATTCCCTTGAATCAGCGAACTG-3′), which contains an EcoRI site (underlined). An aliquot of the PCR mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To construct a plasmid for the expression of recombinant UreB fused with the GST protein, the PCR-amplified DNA fragment was ligated to the expression vector, pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Escherichia coli BL21 was transformed and induced the recombinant UreB protein by an addition of a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. BALB/c mice were primed subcutaneously using 100 μg/mouse of the recombinant UreB-GST emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Two weeks after the first immunization, a booster dose composed of an equal amount of the recombinant UreB-GST in Freund's incomplete adjuvant was given. A final booster dose without adjuvant was administered 2 weeks after the second immunization. Three days after the final booster, splenocytes were fused with NS1/1.Ag4.1 or X63-Ag8.635 myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), followed by hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine selection and screening. Hybridomas were screened using the culture supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using UreB-GST and GST as the coated antigens. The mAbs reacting with UreB-GST but not with GST were picked up. Positive hybridomas were subcloned more than thrice by the limited-dilution method. The class and subclass of each mAb were determined with a mouse mAb isotyping kit (Amersham Biosciences). For obtaining the polyclonal antibodies, rabbits were immunized subcutaneously as follows. One milligram of the UreB was dissolved in 1 ml of PBS, which was emulsified with 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant. The emulsified mixture (totally 2 ml) was immunized into one rabbit. The rabbits were given boosters at 2-week intervals in the same manner except Freund's incomplete adjuvant instead of Freund's complete adjuvant. The immunized rabbit was bled after the fourth booster immunization. The resultant antiserum was purified using affinity chromatography (Sepharose 4B coupled with H. pylori urease) for the experiment of immunohistochemical staining. Messenger RNA was isolated from the hybridoma secreting UA15 mAb using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA of the light and heavy chain were synthesized by a first-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Science Inc.). The VH and VL fragments were amplified directly by adding them to a mixture containing PCR components and Mouse Ig primers specific for IgG (Mouse Ig primer kit, Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The amplified DNA was visualized on 2.0% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. A band of ∼450 bp was observed, which corresponds to the size of the variable fragment of the antibody gene with little or no extraneous product. The PCR product was cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequencing was conducted using the Auto Read Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an automated DNA sequencer (OpenGene System, Long-Read Tower, Amersham Biosciences). Computational analysis of the antibody structures was performed using the deduced VL and VH amino acid sequences by a workstation (Octane 2, Silicon Graphics Inc., PA) running AbM software (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, UK), which is used for building models of three-dimensional molecules. The resulting Protein Data Bank data were applied to minimize the total energy by using DS-Modeling (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA). This software uses the CHARMm algorithm for minimizing the energy of a molecule (11Anchin J.M. Mandal C. Culberson C. Subramaniam S. Linthicum D.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1994; 12: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein Adviser v. 3.5 (FQS Ltd., Fukuoka, Japan) was employed to visualize, analyze, and draw the structures. Formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded human gastric tissues infected with H. pylori were used. The sections (2 μm thick) were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in graded ethanol, and then endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 3% H2O2. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated with the antiserum (which was purified by affinity chromatography using Sepharose 4B coupled with H. pylori urease) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature for 60 min, and then washed three times with PBS for 5 min each. The slides were incubated with EnVision+ (horseradish peroxidase rabbit) reagent (Dako Japan Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) for 60 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. Staining was performed using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Nichirei Co., Tokyo, Japan). Gimenez staining was performed as follows. The gastric biopsy specimens were deparaffinized and hydrated in distilled water. The sections were filtered in a carbol fuchsin solution for 1 min. After washing in water, the slides were stained with 1% malachite green for 5 s, then washed again in water and dried in air. UA15 mAb (IgG1(κ)) was purified according to the purification protocol from Bio-Rad Protein A MAPS-II kit (Nippon Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) according to the purification protocol recommended in the Bio-Rad Protein A MAPS-II kit (Nippon Bio-Rad). Detailed procedures were described in the reference (10Hifumi E. Hatiuchi K. Okuda T. Nishizono A. Okamura Y. Uda T.

To avoid contamination, most glassware, plastic ware, and buffer solutions used in this experiment were sterilized by heating (180 °C, 2 h), autoclaving (121 °C, 20 min), or filtration through a 0.20-μm sterilized filter as far as possible. The experiments were mostly performed in a biological safety cabinet to avoid air-borne contamination. In the cleavage assay for UreB, the expressed UreB-GST protein was digested by trypsin for the purpose of recovery of UreB. Then the UreB was purified using UA-15 mAb-fixed affinity chromatography. The purity was over 99% in SDS-PAGE analysis. The whole antibody of UA15 does not have a catalytic activity. Hence, the purification could be performed without trouble (see under “Results”). Prior to the cleavage test for UreB protein and the purified urease of H. pylori, a peptide, TPRGPDRPEGIEEEGGERDRD (TP41-1), which has mostly been used for monitoring the catalytic activity of the antibody and/or its subunits (3Hifumi E.

By this reaction, the catalytic activity of UA15-L was held constant, showing no induction time (3Hifumi E. Mitsuda Y. Ohara K. Uda T. J. Immunol.

Bioeng. 1998; 84: 485-493Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the cleavage assay of UreB and the urease, the UA15-L mentioned above was used. Cleavages of recombinant UreB (10.7 μm) and purified H. pylori urease (57 nm) were carried out using UA15-L in a 15 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 25 °C. The reactions were measured with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and silver-stained SDS-PAGE for UreB and urease, respectively, under non-reduced conditions. For the cleavage assay using living H. pylori cells, the surviving number of H. pylori cells was first counted after 0 to 48 h in phosphate buffer. The number of the cells (108 cells were prepared) remained almost constant during the incubation without the catalytic antibody. The cleavage reaction was monitored by Western blot analysis using HpU-17 (16Ikeda Y. Fujii R. Ogino K. Fukushima K. Hifumi E. Uda T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 2003; 86: 271-276Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) labeled with POD. For UreB and the urease, the reaction solution at 7–8 h of incubation was recovered and concentrated up to 15- and 10-fold, respectively, using a ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon Ultra-4 5000MWCO, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Then the samples were submitted to a 12% gel SDS-PAGE (reduced condition for UreB and non-reduced for the urease). The bands were transferred for 1 h at 112 mA onto an Immobilon-PQS PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp.) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.19 m glycine, 5% methanol at pH 8.7. After being stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, visible bands were cut and subjected to the N-terminal sequence analysis (Automated Protein Sequencer, Prosize 494 HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the amount of protein used ranging from 2 to 40 pmol. For 0.5–2 pmol of the fragment, an automatic protein microsequencer Prosize 494 cLC (Applied Biosystems) was used. After SDS-PAGE was carried out without staining, the proteins were transferred from the gel onto an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked with TBS containing 3% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), it was incubated with mAb HpU-17 (16Ikeda Y. Fujii R. Ogino K. Fukushima K. Hifumi E. Uda T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 2003; 86: 271-276Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), conjugated with peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, the color development was performed by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). For H. pylori cells, 7% SDS-PAGE at 20 mA in a nonreducing condition was employed for detection of the fragments of H. pylori urease. H. pylori of the Sydney strain (SS1) was cultured on a Brucella broth (BBL, Cockeysville, MD) agar medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 4 days under a microaerophilic environment (5% O2, 10% CO2, 85% N2). Detailed purification methods of the H. pylori urease from the harvested pellet were described in the literatures (16Ikeda Y. Fujii R. Ogino K. Fukushima K. Hifumi E. Uda T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 2003; 86: 271-276Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Animals—Specific pathogen-free, 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and were allowed free access to food and water. Experiments were performed according to the guideline of the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments at the Faculty of Medicine of Oita University (Oita, Japan) and Prefectural University of Hiroshima (Hiroshima, Japan). Infection—Mice were orally challenged two times at 1-day intervals with 0.5 ml of H. pylori SS1 (1 × 108 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml). Seventeen days after the last inoculation, 2 of 29 mice were sacrificed to confirm the colonization of H. pylori in the stomach. Oral Administration of UA15-L—Each mouse (n = 9) was orally administered with a 0.5 ml of UA15-L (20 μg/ml) containing solution in which Meyron (7% sodium bicarbonate, 833.2 mm, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan) was added with one-tenth of the volume in order to neutralize the gastric acidity. In this study, nine mice were used for the administration. The nine mice were used for the control experiment in which the same solution containing Meyron without UA15-L was orally delivered. The administered UA15-L was prepared as described in the section of cleavage assay under “Experimental Procedures.” Assessment of Eradication of H. pylori—All mice were sacrificed, and the stomach of each mouse was isolated a day after the oral administration for bacterial and histological examination. The stomach was washed in sterile 0.8% NaCl and cut longitudinally into two pieces. One half was homogenized in 500 μl of Brucella broth by using a glass homogenizer (Iwaki Glass Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Fifty microliters of gastric homogenate was serially diluted with Brucella broth and inoculated onto Helicobacter-selective agar plates (NISSUI pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 4 days under microaerobic conditions. Colonies were counted, and expressed as CFU/gram stomach tissue. The numbers of bacterial colony were analyzed and compared by the t test. p values of <0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. The other half of the stomach was used for the histological examination. Histological examination of gastric mucosa included longitudinal sections of the stomach, from the esophageal-cardiac junction through the duodenum, which were fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections 5 μm in length were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (gastric sections were scored and evaluated by the presence of inflammation characterized by the intensity of neutrophilic and/or lymphocytic infiltration in blind fashion by two independent examiners.) For the accuracy, some data were confirmed by repeated experiments. Design of the Immunizing Antigen UreB—H. pylori urease is a hexamer consisting of α- and β-subunits, with molecular sizes of 26.4 and 61.6 kDa, respectively (17Hu L.T. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the β-subunit, the amino acid residues number (aa) from aa 201 to 338 are essential for its activity. Cys321 (violet colored character in Fig. 1a) strongly interacts with two nickel ions (bi-nickel center) and His221, His248, and His274 also coordinate the ions (18Ha N-H. Oh S-T. Sung J.Y. Cha K.A. Lee M.H. Oh B-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 19Fujii R. Morihara F. Fukushima K. Oku T. Hifumi E. Uda T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 86: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to these, other amino acid residues including His271, His282, His314, His322, and His323 are conserved among many bacteria such as Helicobacter felis, Bacillus sp., Jack bean, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Ureaplasma urealiticum. Cys321 is conserved in all of these bacteria. Thus we decided to target this region (UreB) for the catalytic antibody in this study. The sequence of the UreB region is shown in Fig. 1a (solid underline), and the location of UreB in the structure of urease is indicated with a red ribbon in Fig. 1b. Expression of UreB and the Production of the mAb—UreB was expressed in E. coli (BL21) as a fusion protein with GST (UreB-GST). After the immunization of UreB-GST into BALB/c mice, a monoclonal antibody (mAb: UA15) was established using the conventional hybridoma generation technique (16Ikeda Y. Fujii R. Ogino K. Fukushima K. Hifumi E. Uda T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 2003; 86: 271-276Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mAb obtained specifically reacted with UreB and the intact H. pylori urease but not with GST, bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, and human γ-globulin. However, it slightly cross-reacted with Jack bean urease. Molecular Modeling—Sequencing of cDNAs of variable region of the light (UA15-L) and heavy chain of UA15 mAb was conducted, and the amino acid sequences were deduced. Five aa residues at the N terminus of UA15-L were determined, and the sequence (Asp1-Val2-Val3-Met4-Thr5) was agreed with those deduced by the cDNA sequencing. The germ line gene of UA15-L was identified as bd2. The three-dimensional structure of the variable region of UA15-L was created by molecular modeling according to the method as described in Refs. 14Mitsuda Y. Hifumi E. Tsuruhata K. Fujinami H.

Three aa residues (Asp1, Ser27a, and His93) locate in a close position, which are assumed to form a catalytic triad in such catalytic antibody light chains as VIPase (vaso-intestinal peptide) (20Gao Q.S.

Features of the Immunological Binding of UA-15 mAb and Its Light Chain (UA15-L)—Lane 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 show the results of SDS-PAGE of H. pylori urease purified from the Sydney strain (SS1) and the lysate of the cells, respectively. In lane 1, the monomers of both the β- and the α-subunits were clearly observed at 66.0 (±2.8 kDa) and 31.0 (±0.8 kDa), respectively. Some partially dissociated forms (αmβn) at high molecular sizes (over 96.4 kDa) were also observed. (We confirmed them to be derived from the urease by a Western blotting analysis using the mAbs (HpU-2 and -17) against the α- and the β-subunits, respectively (16Ikeda Y. Fujii R. Ogino K. Fukushima K. Hifumi E. Uda T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 2003; 86: 271-276Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The natural form of this enzyme is α6β6.) In lane 2, neither the β-subunit nor the α-subunit of urease was detected, due to the presence of other bacterial proteins. The Western blots using UA15 mAb demonstrated that this mAb specifically reacted with the β-subunit as shown in lane 3 with the purified urease and lane 4 with the lysate of the bacteria. Interestingly, the light chain (UA15-L) by itself showed a similar reactivity as the native UA15 mAb (in lane 5 for purified urease and lane 6 for the bacteria). The mAb and the light chain slightly bound to the α-subunit, which were hardly detected in lanes 4 and 6, because of relatively low content of the subunit in the lysate compared with the purified urease. Fig. 3 shows the results of the immunohistochemical staining of the formalin-fixed section of the human gastric tissues infected with H. pylori. As previously reported (19Fujii R. Morihara F. Fukushima K. Oku T. Hifumi E. Uda T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 86: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), an anti-UreB polyclonal antibody (pAb) produced by the immunization of UreB into rabbit specifically reacted with H. pylori, and the infected sites were clearly observed on the mucosal surface of human stomach (Fig. 3a), Fig. 3b shows the result using a commercially available pAb (DAKO Japan Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) as a positive control. It is considered that the antibodies mainly reacted to the surface urease of H. pylori. Interestingly, the UA-15 mAb reacted similarly with H. pylori (a different specimen from the experiment using pAb) as shown in Fig. 3 (c and d), although it had been known that monoclonal antibodies tend not to react with the formalin fixed specimens. Cleavage Activity against UreB—Because the epitope of UA15 mAb is not determined, a peptidase activity of UA15-L was examined by using a TP41-1 peptide (TPRGPDRPEGIEEEGGERDRD), which has been used to monitor the peptidase activity of the catalytic antibody or its subunits (3Hifumi E.

The degradation of TP41-1 peptide by UA15-L followed the Michaelis-Menten equation, and its kinetic parameters were obtained as kcat = 0.24 min–1 and Km = 6.2 × 10–5m (see supplemental Appendix S1). These values were similar to those of other catalytic antibodies reported so far (3Hifumi E. Mitsuda Y. Ohara K. Uda T. J. Immunol.

In addition, the light and heavy chains of UA11 mAb, which specifically binds to UreB, hardly showed the catalytic activity when they were monitored up to 200-h incubation. According to the experimental protocol under “Experimental Procedures,” highly purified UreB (>99%; 10.7 μm) was mixed with UA15-L (0.6 μm) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 25 °C, and the degradation of UreB was monitored by SDS-PAGE under reduced condition with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, as shown in Fig. 4a. The band of UreB (19 ± 0.4 kDa) became gradually faint with an increased incubation time, with its complete disappearance after 24 h. At 4- and 8-h time points, a novel fragment with a size of 14.4 (±0.2) kDa was observed, which became faint with further incubation. At 24-h incubation, this 14.4-kDa band disappeared as well as that of UreB, suggesting that the consecutive degradations took place. No other fragment was visible. UreB was not degraded without UA15-L (Fig. 4b). We characterized the cleavage sites of UreB by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. From the 14.4-kDa fragment, a sequence of DVQVA was detected (the detection intensity = 33 pmol), indicating that the bond between Tyr46 and Asp47 was cleaved. The sequence of this scissile bond is indicated with a red arrow in Fig. 1a. Cleavage of Purified Urease—The cleavage of H. pylori urease (57 nm) by UA15-L (0.4 μm) was performed under the same reaction condition. The reaction was monitored by SDS-PAGE under a non-reduced condition with silver staining at 0.5, 5, 10, and 24 h of incubation (Fig. 4c). H. pylori urease is a heterohexamer of the α- and the β-subunits with a size of 528 kDa ((26.4 kDa × 6) + (61.6 kDa × 6)). In a control experiment with the SDS-PAGE under non-reduced condition, we detected the monomers and the multimers of the urease subunits (Fig. 4d). The bands at 31.0 (±0.5) kDa and at 66.0 (±2.8) kDa appeared to be the monomers of the α- and"
https://openalex.org/W2113544380,"Androgens play a central role in prostate development and prostate cancer proliferation. Induction of telomerase is an early event in prostate carcinogenesis and is considered as a marker for both primary tumors and metastases. Interestingly, several reports suggest that telomerase activity is regulated by androgens in vivo. Here, we show that the wild-type (WT) human androgen receptor (AR) inhibits the expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and telomerase activity via inhibition of hTERT promoter activity in the presence of androgen receptor agonists. However, pure androgen antagonists failed to repress hTERT transcription. The androgen-mediated repression of hTERT is abrogated in a human prostate cancer cell line exhibiting hormone-dependent growth, which expresses a mutant AR (T877A) frequently occurring in prostate cancer. We reveal that this single amino acid exchange is sufficient for the lack of transrepression. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggest that, in contrast to the WT AR, the mutant AR is recruited less efficiently to the hTERT promoter in vivo, indicating that loss of transrepression results from reduced chromatin recruitment. Thus, our findings suggest that the WT AR inhibits expression of hTERT, which is indicative of a protective mechanism, whereas the T877A mutation of AR not only broadens the ligand spectrum of the receptor but abrogates this inhibitory mechanism in prostate cancer cells. This novel role of AR mutations in prostate cancer development suggests the benefit to a search for new AR antagonists that inhibit transactivation but allow transrepression."
https://openalex.org/W2077061070,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) can participate in the induction of apoptosis or, alternatively, provide a survival signal that minimizes cellular injury. We previously demonstrated that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. In this report, we show that sorafenib activates GSK-3β in multiple subcellular compartments and that this activation undermines the lethality of the drug. Pharmacologic inhibition and/or down-modulation of the kinase enhances sorafenib-induced apoptosis as determined by propidium iodide staining and by assessing the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor and Smac/DIABLO. Conversely, the forced expression of a constitutively active form of the enzyme (GSK-3βS9A) protects the cells from the apoptotic effects of the drug. This protective effect is associated with a marked increase in basal levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin and a diminution in the degree to which these anti-apoptotic proteins are down-modulated by sorafenib exposure. Sorafenib down-modulates the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Noxa in cells with high constitutive GSK-3β activity. Pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3β prevents the disappearance of Noxa induced by sorafenib and enhances the down-modulation of Mcl-1. Down-modulation of Noxa largely eliminates the enhancing effect of GSK-3 inhibition on sorafenib-induced apoptosis. These data provide a strong rationale for the use of GSK-3β inhibitors as adjuncts to sorafenib treatment and suggest that preservation of Noxa may contribute to their efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2061323719,"Degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a prominent feature in osteoarthritis (OA), which is mainly because of the imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes in chondrocytes resulting in cartilage and bone destruction. Various proteases act in concert to degrade matrix components, e.g. type II collagen, MMPs, ADAMTS, and cathepsins. Protease-generated collagen fragments may foster the destructive process. However, the signaling pathways associated with the action of collagen fragments on chondrocytes have not been clearly defined. The present data demonstrate that the N-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II enhances expression of cathepsins B, K, and L in articular chondrocytes at mRNA, protein, and activity levels, mediated at least in part through extracellular calcium.

The key event in arthritic lesions is the degradation of cartilage matrix proteins, predominantly consisting of collagen type II and aggrecan. Therefore, the regulation of matrix-degrading protease activities in resting and in activated chondrocytes has been extensively studied during the past two decades.

Because osteoarthritis is a chronic disease, the question remains for the reason of the persistence of degradative processes outside of inflammatory episodes, the so-called “chondrocytic chondrolysis” (17Riede U.N.

Degradation products of collagen type II are secreted into the urine and into the synovial fluid. Collagen-derived peptides, mainly the C-terminal telopeptide, are used as diagnostic tools to follow progressive cartilage breakdown (22Hein G. Franke S. Muller A. Braunig E. Eidner T. Stein G. Clin.

In this context it is important to note that not only inflammatory reactions but also mechanical injuries may lead to an enhanced release of such peptides (27Thibault M. Poole A.R. Buschmann M.D. J. Orthop. Res. 2002; 20: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). According to literature data, about 1-3% of the total collagen dry mass in normal cartilage occurs as partially degraded collagen peptides (21Jennings L. Wu L. King K.B. Hammerle H. Cs-Szabo G.

Those peptides are not only diagnostic markers of cartilage degradation but may also initiate a cascade of matrix-degrading proteolytic activities (20Fichter M. Korner U. Schomburg J. Jennings L.

Tissue Res. 2001; 42: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fichter et al. have shown levels of MMPs-2, -3, -9, and -13 mRNA, and protein to be elevated after stimulation by collagen degradation products and, in particular, by a sequence from the N-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II (Ntelo). Thus, collagen peptides may contribute to the regulation of matrix turnover (20Fichter M. Korner U. Schomburg J. Jennings L. Cole A.A. Mollenhauer J. J. Orthop. Res. 2006; 24: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) contribute substantially to the liberation of matrix-degrading enzymes from OA chondrocytes (30Goldring S.R. Goldring M.B. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2004; 427: S27-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 31Fernandes J.C. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the biological effects initiated by these pro-inflammatory cytokines are mediated by MAP kinases (p38 and JNK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (32Liacini A. Sylvester J. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), little is known of the signaling cascade triggered by collagen type II degradation products. In this report, we show that besides MMPs the biosynthesis of some cysteine proteases may also be selectively stimulated by the N-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II. Moreover, our findings also indicate that at least one member of the protein kinase C family and the p38 MAP kinase are involved in Ntelo-dependent signaling events in articular chondrocytes.

Chondrocytes were extracted from tissue by sequential pronase/collagenase digestion (34Kuettner K.E.M.V. Pauli B.U. Wrobel N.C. Thonar E.J. Daniel J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cells—For stimulation experiments, chondrocytes were precultured in DMEM (containing 1 mm CaCl2, Sigma) plus 5% FCS for 24 h in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 105 cells per well. Subsequently, chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM plus 1% FCS in the presence of varying concentrations (0; 0.2; 0.4; 0.6; 0.8; 1; 4 mg/ml) of the synthetic 29-mer N-telopeptide of type II collagen (Ntelo) for 24 or 72 h. The culture media were collected and analyzed for released procathepsins by immunoblotting, mRNA levels of cathepsins were analyzed by Real-Time PCR, and the enzyme activities were measured by an in vivo cathepsin activity assay (35Ruettger A. Mollenhauer J. Loeser R. Guetschow M. Wiederanders B. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of extracellular Ca2+ on the Ntelo effect, chondrocytes were cultured with essentially calcium-free DMEM (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) or the same medium containing 1 mm CaCl2. For the experiments with the pan PKC inhibitor, BIM I, human OA chondrocytes were preincubated in the absence or presence of BIM I (240 nm) for 1 h. Thereafter, the cells were stimulated with PDBu (100 ng/ml) or Ntelo (0.5 mg/ml) for different periods of time. The cathepsin activities were measured as described below. For inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, chondrocytes were precultured in DMEM plus 5% FCS for 24 h. Subsequently, chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM plus 1% FCS in the presence of Ntelo (0.5 mg/ml, 24 h) and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (1 μm, 24 h). cDNA Synthesis and Real-Time (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from human chondrocytes was extracted with the Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instruction. RNA was redissolved in RNase-free water. The quality of the isolated RNA was controlled using non denaturing 1.25% agarose gel electrophoresis and the determination of the A260/A280 ratio (SmartSpec 3000 Spectrophotometer, Bio-Rad). Only samples exhibiting no RNA degradation and showing an A260/A280 ratio equal or above 1.8 were used for further application. 1 μg of total RNA was used for transcription into complementary DNA (cDNA) using OmniScript Reverse Transcriptase kit (Quiagen), oligo-dT primer (Amersham Biosciences), and RNAseOUT (Invitrogen). 1 μl of the cDNA was used as template to specifically amplify CB, CK, and CL messages. RT-PCR was carried out using a MyiQ Cycler with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix, as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Normalization of the signal was based on the expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin. A standard curve was prepared by serial dilutions of the respective PCR products. All samples that had to be compared for expression differences were run in the same assay as duplicates together with the standards. After completion of PCR amplification, data were analyzed by MyiQ Software, version 1.0. After amplification was complete, the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers used and the resulting PCR product sizes are given in the following as previously published (36Schuler S. Wenz I. Wiederanders B. Slickers P. Ehricht R. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For MAPK13 and MAPK14, we designed specific oligonucleotide primers using the public domain Primer3 program. β-Actin (resulting in a 635-bp fragment): forward: 5′-acc acg gcc gag cgg gaa atc-3′, reverse: 5′-gag ccg ccg atc cac acg gag ta-3′.

Proteinase Analysis—The human proteinase DNA microarray in the ArrayTube® format (36Schuler S. Wenz I. Wiederanders B. Slickers P. Ehricht R. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), representing 45 genes of proteinases and proteinase inhibitors, plus two housekeeping genes and three controls, was used to analyze the effects of extracellular calcium and/or Ntelo on proteinase gene expression in human articular chondrocytes. Total RNA from differently stimulated human chondrocytes (calcium-free media: with or without Ntelo; calcium-containing media: with and without Ntelo) was extracted with the Trizol® reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's manual. The following steps generating double-stranded cDNA according to the Eberwine protocol, labeling during the linear amplification reaction, and hybridization were previously described in detail (36Schuler S. Wenz I. Wiederanders B. Slickers P. Ehricht R. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The peroxidase precipitation reaction (100 μl peroxidase substrate, Clondiag, Jena, Germany) was monitored by the ATR01 array tube reader (Clondiag) at 25 °C. Data analysis was carried out using IconoClust software, version 2.2 (Clondiag) determining the signal intensity and the local background value of each spot. Only the average values of spot hybridization signals with amounts above 0.05 (1 minus mean divided by local background values) were considered as positive. Both spotted oligos of an examined gene had to be “positive.” If these conditions were met, the signal resulting from the hybridization with the oligo sequence situated closer to the 3′-end of the RNA sequence was used for calculation. MAP Kinase Signaling Analysis—The RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array Human MAP Kinase Signaling Pathway (SuperArray, Biomol GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), representing 84 genes related to the MAP kinase signaling pathways, plus five housekeeping genes and three controls, was used to analyze the effect of Ntelo on signaling related gene expression in human articular chondrocytes. Total RNA from differently treated human chondrocytes (unstimulated and stimulated with Ntelo) was extracted with the Trizol® reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's manual. The DNase treatment was performed by Amplification Grade I DNase I (AMPD1, Sigma-Aldrich) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Each total RNA preparation (5 μg) was digested with 1 μl of DNase I (1 unit/μl) and 1 μl of 10× reaction buffer in a volume of 10 μl. After incubation and adding the Stop Solution, the DNase I was denatured by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. The RNA samples were kept on ice for another 5 min, then converted with the RT2 PCR Array First Strand Kit (SuperArray) in accordance with the manual. The template was combined with the RT2 SYBR Green/Fluorescein PCR master mix (SuperArray). Equal amounts of this mixture (25 μl) were added to each well of the RT2 Profiler™ PCR plate containing the predispensed gene-specific primer sets, and the reaction was started. Data analysis was based on the ΔΔCt method with normalization to β-actin. Western Blot Analysis—For detection of procathepsins, cell culture media were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in MES buffer using 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen). After protein transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) by electroblotting, membranes were blocked with 1% soy proteins (Alpro Soja, Düsseldorf, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and probed overnight with one of the following polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology): goat anti-human cathepsin B (S-12), goat anti-human cathepsin K (C-16), and goat anti-human cathepsin L (C-18) antibody, respectively, on separate blots each. Secondary antibody was rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detection was performed by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Pierce SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany). For detection of PKC, cell lysates were isolated with the radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described in the manual. Protein content was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE as mentioned above and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Merck) in TBST (TBS plus Tween-20, Santa Cruz) for 1 h. Both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated PKC levels were detected by monoclonal rabbit anti-human phospho-PKC (pan) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; Beverly, MA) and monoclonal mouse anti-human PKC (pan: α,β,γ) antibody (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Perbio Science). Detection was performed by enzymelinked chemiluminescence (see above) or 4-chloronaphthol staining (Sigma). Assay for Cathepsin B, K, and L Activities—Cathepsin activity determination was performed as previously published (35Ruettger A. Mollenhauer J. Loeser R. Guetschow M. Wiederanders B. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells (about 105 cells per well) were seeded in black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well microtiter plates. The culture medium was replaced by 100 μl of serum-free and phenol red-free medium, and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 mm nitrosalicylaldehyde and the following substrate or substrate/inhibitor mixtures: 1 mm Z-RR-4MβNA with or without 1 μm CA-074Me for cathepsin B; 1 mm Z-GPR-4MβNA with or without 1 μm Z-LG-ψ (C≡N) for cathepsin K; 0.1 mm Z-FR-4MβNA with or without 1 μm Z-FF-CHN2 for cathepsin L. After 2 h, cells were covered with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C). The generated fluorescent product was read using a microplate reader (Fluor-S™ MultiImager, Bio-Rad) at λ488 nm for excitation and λ520-530 nm for emission. Controls were run without substrates. Activity was calculated using the Quantity One® software version 4.2.1 by subtracting the fluorescence in the presence of inhibitor from the fluorescence in the absence of inhibitor resulting in “artificial fluorescence units” (AFU). Statistical Analysis—Analyses were performed with statistical software SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered significant. Some results are indicated as “fold increase,” which means the activities/mRNA concentrations of the stimulated cultures divided by the activities/mRNA concentrations of the non-stimulated controls. Ntelo Induces Cathepsins B, K, and L in a Dose-dependent Manner—The potential of type II collagen fragments, especially of the N-terminal telopeptide, to activate the cathepsin metabolism in articular chondrocytes was tested based on two different observations. On the one hand Morko et al. and others showed that at least CK is enhanced in arthritic cartilage (14Morko J.P. Soderstrom M. Saamanen A.M. Salminen H.J. Vuorio E.I. Ann. Rheum.

We show here that PEP-19 decreases the degree of cooperativity of Ca2+ binding to sites III and IV, and we present a model showing that this could increase Ca2+ binding rate constants. Comparative sequence analysis showed that residues 28 to 58 from PEP-19 are conserved in other proteins.

In contrast, a peptide encoding only the core IQ motif does not modulate Ca2+ binding, and binds to multiple sites on CaM. A peptide that includes only the acidic region does not bind to CaM. These results show that PEP-19 has a novel acidic/IQ CaM regulatory motif in which the IQ sequence provides a targeting function that allows binding of PEP-19 to CaM, whereas the acidic residues modify the nature of this interaction, and are essential for modulating Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM.

Means A.R. Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). This daunting task requires that CaM interact with a large number of proteins and that it properly sense Ca2+ signals that vary greatly in frequency and amplitude (for review see Refs. 2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 517-525Crossref Scopus (4052) Google Scholar and 3Bootman M. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 114: 2213-2222Crossref Google Scholar). To effectively fulfill its diverse roles, mechanisms have evolved to regulate, or fine-tune CaM activity over short time frames. For example, phosphorylation of a small protein called ARPP-21 promotes high affinity binding to Ca2+-CaM, (neurogranin or Ng) thereby competitively inhibiting activation of other CaM-dependent enzymes (4Rakhilin S.V.

PEP-19 (Purkinje cell protein 4 or pcp4) and RC3 (neurogranin or Ng) are small proteins expressed primarily in neuronal tissues, but with no known activity other than binding to CaM in the presence or absence of Ca2+. We found that both PEP-19 and RC3 have profound effects on the rate-limiting kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM. Specifically, PEP-19 accelerates the rates of both association and dissociation of Ca2+ without greatly affecting the overall KCa of the C-domain (5Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49667-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RC3 accelerates the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from CaM, but has a lesser effect on the association rate, thereby decreasing the affinity of binding Ca2+ to the C-domain of CaM (6Gaertner T.R. Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9374-9382Google Scholar). Importantly, both PEP-19 and RC3 exert these effects even when CaM is bound to CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CKIIα) (5Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol.

These results suggest that PEP-19 and RC3 could have broad extrinsic effects on CaM-related signaling pathways by modulating the Ca2+ binding properties of free or enzyme-bound CaM. This is consistent with the phenotype of RC3 knock-out mice, which show defects in synaptic plasticity (7Pak J.H. Huang F.L. Li J. Balschun D. Reymann K.G. Chiang C. Westphal H. Huang K.-P. Proc.

These intriguing structure-function relationships of IQ motifs led us to identify amino acids in PEP-19 that are required to modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM. We show here that the consensus IQ CaM binding motif is necessary, but not sufficient to mimic the effect of intact PEP-19 on CaM. An adjacent highly acidic amino acid sequence acts in synergy with the IQ motif to modulate Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM. We propose that this acidic/IQ sequence constitutes a new CaM regulatory motif. Recombinant Proteins and Peptides—Recombinant CaM, CaM(K75C), CaM(T110C), CaM(T34C), CaM(T34C,T110C), PEP19, and RC3 were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (5Putkey J.A.

The expression plasmid for the C-domain of CaM (residues 78-148) was a generous gift from Dr. Madeline Shea (University of Iowa). Synthetic peptides purchased from Sigma Genosys had greater than 90% purity, and were further purified as necessary by C4 reverse phase HPLC using 0-60% acetonitrile gradient in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. NMR Methodology—NMR spectra of isotope-labeled CaM and PEP-19 were generated using Varian Inova 800 MHz and Bruker DRX800 MHz spectrometers with room temperature triple resonance probes, as well as a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with 5-mm TXI CryoProbe.

Titration of [15N]Ca2+-CaM with PEP-19 or peptides was performed in a buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.3, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% D2O at 310 or 320 K. Amide chemical shifts in the 15N,1H-heteronuclear single quantrum coherence spectra for [15N]Ca2+-CaM exhibited fast exchange characteristics during titration with PEP-19, PEP(28-62), or PEP(39-62), which allowed assignments to be made by following chemical shift changes from the free to bound forms of CaM. All titrations were conducted at a CaM concentration of 50 μm. To eliminate dilution and pH effects, titrations were made from a stock solution of concentrated unlabeled PEP-19 or peptides containing 50 μm Ca2+-CaM in the appropriate buffer. At each titration point a measured amount of sample was removed from the NMR tube and replaced with the identical volume from the stock solution. Titrations were carried out until a 10-fold excess of ligand was added. The data were processed using the Autoscreen module in FELIX 2002 software (19Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2004; 34: 16733-16752Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The average amide chemical shift change was calculated using the following formula: Δδavg=(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/5)22(Eq. 1) where ΔδH = change in 1H chemical shift and Δδn = change in 15N chemical shift. Chemical shift changes for CaM backbone amide 1H and 15N nuclei were analyzed separately to derive Kd values for binding PEP-19 to CaM because the relative contribution of change in each dimension can vary significantly. In general, backbone 15N chemical shifts experienced the greatest change relative to the spectral window. Generation of Fluorescently Labeled Proteins—Labeling of CaM(K75C) or CaM(T110C) with either acylodan or IAEDANS was previously reported (18Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Waxham M.N. Tsai A.-L. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17579-17584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To obtain the fluorescent CaM used in the FRET study, a double Cys CaM mutant, CaM(T34C,T110C), was labeled with IAEDANS (donor) and DDPM (accepter) to generate CaMD/A. CaM(T34C,T110C) was first reacted with 0.4 mol of IAEDANS/mol of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and 100 mm KCl for 2 h at 20 °C in the dark. Free IAEDANS was removed using a Bio-Gel P-6DG (Bio-Rad) desalting column. The IAEDANS-labeled CaM averaged 0.3 mol of IAEDANS/mol of protein. A portion of this partially labeled protein was saved as the donor-alone protein (CaMD), whereas the rest was labeled with excess DDPM to give CaMD/A. Free DDPM was removed by desalting. PEP-19 and PEP(39-62) with C-terminal Gly-Cys extensions were labeled with DDPM as described for CaM, but free DDPM was removed using a semi-prep C4 reverse phase HPLC column with a 0-60% acetonitrile gradient. Protein and peptide concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay with a bovine serum albumin standard and color developed at 60 °C. Equilibrium Binding of PEP-19 to CaM—Solutions of fluorescently labeled CaM derivatives were prepared in a buffer of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Concentrated stock solutions of PEP-19, PEP(39-62), or their DDPM-labeled derivatives, were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein or peptide in the labeled CaM solution to eliminate dilution of CaM during titration. The increase in volume was less than 10%. We assessed potential nonspecific FRET effects using DDPM coupled to free Cys, and found a linear, 5% decrease in fluorescence from donor-labeled CaM per increment of 25 μm Cys-DDPM. The FRET effect between donor-labeled CaM and acceptor-labeled PEP-19 or PEP(39-62) was corrected for this nonspecific effect, and the upper concentration of DDPM-labeled ligands was limited to 50 μm. Dissociation constants (Kd) were derived from fluorescence or NMR data by fitting titration curves to the following equation, which does not require measurement of free ligand concentrations, S=Si+(Sf-Si)(L+Ct+Kd)-(L+Ct+Kd)2-4CtL2Ct(Eq. 2) Where S = fluorescence or NMR signal at a given titration point; Si = initial signal in the absence of ligand; Sf = final signal in the presence of excess ligand; L = total ligand added at a given titration point; Ct = total CaM concentration; and Kd = dissociation constant. The equation was used to fit plots of S versus L with Si, Sf, and Kd as fitted variables. Equilibrium Ca2+ Binding—Macroscopic equilibrium Ca2+ binding constants were determined using the competitive binding assay described by Linse et al. (21Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium was removed from buffers by passage over a Calcium-Sponge column (Molecular Probes). Residual Ca2+ detected using Indo-1 was typically <10-7 m. CaM was decalcified by adding 1-5 mm BAPTA followed by desalting into Ca2+-free buffers. This effectively removed greater than 95% of Ca2+ from CaM as determined by Tyr fluorescence. All pipette tips, cuvettes, and other labware were rinsed with 0.1 m HCl and MilliQ water to remove Ca2+. Samples used for equilibrium binding studies contained 30 μm CaM, 30 μm 5,5′-dibromo-BAPTA (Br2BAPTA; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen; Kd = 1.59 μm), with or without 60 μm PEP-19 polypeptides, in a buffer of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl. Calcium was added from a stock solution prepared in a buffer that contained both CaM and Br2BAPTA such that only the Ca2+ concentration varied during the titration. Titrations were performed by addition of 2-, 3-, 5-, or 10-μl aliquots of the Ca2+ stock, to an initial sample volume of 0.7 ml. The decrease in absorbance of Br2BAPTA at 263 nm was monitored using a Cary/Varian 100 spectrophotometer. The number and volume of aliquots was adjusted to achieve an even distribution of data points on the binding isotherm. The total Ca2+ concentration was then calculated based on the initial volume and total added volume at each titration point. Macroscopic calcium binding constants were calculated essentially as described by Linse et al. (21Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following equations, [Ca]F=Kd(BAP)×(AbsMAX-Abs)(Abs-AbsMIN)(Eq. 3) [Ca]T=[Ca]F+[Ca]F×[BAP][Ca]F+Kd(BAP)+F×[Pro]×NΣk=1k×[Ca]Fk×kΠj=1Kj1+NΣk=1[Ca]Fk×kΠj=1Kj(Eq. 4) Where [Ca]T = total Ca2+; [Ca]F = concentration of free Ca2+; [Pro] = concentration of CaM; [BAP] = concentration of Br2BAPTA; Kd(BAP) = Ca2+ dissociation constant for Br2BAPTA; K = macromolecular binding constants for N number of sites (K1 through K4); and AbsMAX, AbsMIN, and Abs are the absorbance of Br2BAPTA in the absence, at saturating, and at intermediate concentrations of Ca2+, respectively. Because the stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding is very sensitive to small errors in protein concentration, we incorporated factor F to compensate for slight errors in CaM protein concentrations as done by Linse et al. (21Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plots of [Ca]T versus Abs were fit directly to Equation 4 by least squares using Kaleidagraph software. The fitted variables were the macroscopic binding constants, F, AbsMAX, and AbsMIN. Values for F were typically greater than 0.8. The Ca2+ binding constant for Br2BAPTA of 1.59 × 10-6 was experimentally determined at the same pH and ionic strength used in the binding assay. Stopped-flow Measurements—Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed at 23 °C using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) Model SX.18 MV sequential stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with a 150 watt Xe/Hg lamp, and a dead time of 1.7 ms. All solutions contained a base buffer of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl. The concentration of other reagents in stopped-flow mixing solutions A and B are defined in the figure legends. The final concentration of these reagents in the optical chamber was one-half of these values, because the mixing ratio was 1:1. Calcium koff rates were determined using 2 μm CaM, 20 μm Ca2+, and 300 μm Quin-2. Fluorescence from Quin-2 was detected using an excitation wavelength of 334.5 nm and Oriel emission cut-off filter 51282. A stopped-flow experiment to measure Ca2+ kon rates was devised using the Ca2+-sensitive chromophore Br2BAPTA as a buffer to maintain free Ca2+ levels in the range of 0.5 to 5 μm, and as a chromophore to monitor Ca2+ binding. The kinetics of binding Ca2+ to Br2BAPTA and the N-domain of CaM are very fast and thus, the increase in absorbance observed upon mixing apo-CaM with Ca2+/Br2BAPTA solutions is due to the release of Ca2+ from Ca2+/Br2BAPTA as Ca2+ binds to the C-domain of CaM. The observed change in absorbance was fitted to a single exponential equation. All buffers contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl. The assay was performed at 20 °C. Typically, Buffer A contained 5 μm BAPTA with or without 2 to 4 μm decalcified CaM or EGTA, whereas Buffer B contained 250 μm Br2BAPTA and sufficient Ca2+ to achieve a desired free Ca2+ upon mixing equal volumes of Buffers A and B. This allows less than a 3% change in the concentrations of Br2BAPTA and Ca2+-Br2BAPTA as Ca2+ binds to CaM, thereby maintaining a reasonably constant level of free Ca2+. Free Ca2+ levels of Ca2+/Br2BAPTA solutions were calculated from the absorbance at 263 nm (Absobs) versus controls in the absence (Absmin) or presence (Absmax) of excess Ca2+ using the following equation. CaFree2+=1.59μM×(Absobs-Absmin)(Absmax-Absobs)(Eq. 5) Free Ca2+ levels in the optical chamber of the stopped-flow instrument at 20 °C and pH 7.5 were determined from the observed rates of binding Ca2+ to EGTA present in solution A (Kd = 0.038 μm, koff = 0.53 s-1, kon = 13.8 μm-1 s-1). Free Ca2+ levels were in close agreement when calculated based on Br2BAPTA absorbance or observed rates of binding Ca2+ to EGTA. Microscopic Kinetic Model for Ca2+ Binding to the C-domain of CaM—Linked differential equations for the forward and reverse microscopic binding events illustrated in Fig. 6A were incorporated into a computational model using Berkeley Madonna software. Initial parameter values were taken from the current study and literature reports. The overall average apparent dissociation constant (Kd or KCa50) of 2.3 ± 0.3 μm was derived from Table 2 and other reports using a variety of techniques at pH 7.4 to 7.5 with 90 to 100 mm KCl (5Putkey J.A.

The macroscopic dissociation constants, Kd1 and Kd2, correspond to sequential binding of the first and second Ca2+ ions, regardless of which site is filled first. Starting values for Kd1 and Kd2 given in Table 2 are very close to those reported with others (21Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The microscopic dissociation constants KdIII and KdIV correspond to binding the first Ca2+ to site III or IV, respectively, whereas KdIII/IV and KdIV/III correspond to binding the second Ca2+ when the other site is already occupied. The model includes algebraic relationships that relate macroscopic and microscopic association constants (Ka; Ka = 1/Kd) as follows, where c is the coupling factor (31Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.-C. 173 Ed. Calcium-binding Protein Protocols. II. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 25-42Google Scholar). K1=KIII+KIVc=(K1×K2)/(×KIII×KIV) KIII/IV=c×KIIIKVI/III=c×KIV These relationships allow for the calculation of microscopic equilibrium binding constants if K1, K2, and the magnitude of difference between microscopic binding constants is known. K1 and K2 are reported in Table 2, and Evenas et al. (32Evanas J. Thulin E. Malmendal A. Forsen S. Carlstrom G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) who used Ca2+ binding mutants to show that the relative Ca2+ binding affinity of site IV is ∼6.3-fold greater than site III in both the 0-Ca2+ and 1-Ca2+ states of the C-domain.TABLE 2Effect of PEP-19, PEP(28–62), and PEP(39–62) on calcium binding affinity and cooperativity The macroscopic dissociation constants were derived as described in Material and Methods. All values are the average mean ± S.E. of (n) independent titrations. The square root of the product of macroscopic dissociation constants for each domain is equivalent to the KCa50 for binding to each domain. The precision of this value is greater than the individual dissociation constants. The overall decrease in free energy from binding two Ca2+ ions to the N- or C-domains (ΔGtot) was calculated as ΔGtot = –RTln(K1 × K2). The upper limit for the change in free energy due to cooperative Ca2+ binding (ΔΔGc) was calculated as ΔΔGc = –RTln(4 × K2/K1). Free energy values are in kcal/mole. Open table in a new tab Microscopic rate constants were constrained by the results of Malmendal et al. (32Evanas J. Thulin E. Malmendal A. Forsen S. Carlstrom G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) who used NMR relaxation methods to conclude that the first Ca2+ ion binds preferentially to site IV, and that the koff of site IV (koffIV) was 5100 s-1. If the 6.3-fold difference in affinity of binding Ca2+ to sites IV and III were due exclusively to koff rates, then koffIII would be = 32,000 s-1, which is consistent with an exchange rate of 27,000 s-1 determined for transition between the open and closed conformation of the C-domain in which site IV was mutated (33Evenas J. Malmendal A. Akke M. Structure. 2001; 9: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These koff values would correspond to konIV and konIII rates of around 300 μm-1 s-1, which is consistent with a diffusion-limited event, and similar to the kon for Ca2+ binding to the N-domain of CaM. Microscopic rate constants for binding the second Ca2+ ion were constrained by the fact that the observed koff (koff,Obs) for dissociation of both Ca2+ ions from the C-domain measured using stopped-flow experiments described as above and best fits a single exponential rate between 8.5 s-1 and 12.6 s-1 (5Putkey J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because NMR relaxation data show that the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from the 1-Ca2+ state is very fast, then koff,Obs reflects the rate-limiting dissociation of the first Ca2+ from either site III or IV of the 2-Ca2+ state, followed by very rapid release of the second Ca2+. This means that koff,Obs = koff,IV/III + koff,III/IV, and it allows constraint of microscopic rate constants using the following relationships. koff,III/IV=koff,Obs-koff,IV/III kon,III/IV=(koff,Obs-koff,IV/III)/kd,III/IV kon,IV/III=koff,IV/III/Kd,IV/III Thus, kdIII/IV and kdIV/III are calculated if koff,Obs is defined within an experimentally observed range, and koff,IV/III is varied between 0 and the defined koff,Obs. The model includes a Ca2+ buffer based on Br2BAPTA with Kd = 1.59 μm, a diffusion limited kon = 500 μm-1 s-1 and koff = 795 s-1. This allowed simulation of stopped-flow experiments described above to measure the rate of association of Ca2+ with the C-domain of CaM, and to use the built-in curve fit function of Berkeley Madonna to optimize parameter sets against experimental data. Global parameter optimization and error analysis were also performed in the MATLAB computing environment (The MathWorks). Although the computational model (Fig. 1) has 8 kinetic parameter values, the experimental data and algebraic constraints described above and under “Results” reduced the unknown parameters to kon,III and koff,IV/III. However, to take into account the different reported values of koff,Obs, we also treated koff,III/IV as an additional unknown parameter for the global optimization. We set the maximum values of kon,III, koff,IV/III, and koff,III/IV (500"
https://openalex.org/W2083688091,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate differentiation and development in many organisms and play an important role in cancer.Using a public database of mapped retroviral insertion sites from various mouse models of cancer we demonstrate that MLV-derived retroviral inserts are enriched in close proximity to mouse miRNA loci. Clustered inserts from cancer-associated regions (Common Integration Sites, CIS) have a higher association with miRNAs than non-clustered inserts. Ten CIS-associated miRNA loci containing 22 miRNAs are located within 10 kb of known CIS insertions. Only one CIS-associated miRNA locus overlaps a RefSeq protein-coding gene and six loci are located more than 10 kb from any RefSeq gene. CIS-associated miRNAs on average are more conserved in vertebrates than miRNAs associated with non-CIS inserts and their human homologs are also located in regions perturbed in cancer. In addition we show that miRNA genes are enriched around promoter and/or terminator regions of RefSeq genes in both mouse and human.We provide a list of ten miRNA loci potentially involved in the development of blood cancer or brain tumors. There is independent experimental support from other studies for the involvement of miRNAs from at least three CIS-associated miRNA loci in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2026152488,"Previously, we have demonstrated that major histocompatibility class II trans-activator (CIITA) is crucial in mediating interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced repression of collagen type I gene transcription. Here we report that CIITA represses collagen transcription through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between its proline/serine/threonine domain and co-repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase (HDAC2) and Sin3B. Mutation of a serine (S373A) in CIITA, within a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) consensus site, decreases repression of collagen transcription by blocking interaction with Sin3B. In vitro phosphorylation of CIITA by GSK3 relies on a casein kinase I site three amino acids C-terminal to the GSK3 site in CIITA. Both GSK3 and casein kinase I inhibitors alleviate collagen repression and disrupt IFN-gamma-mediated recruitment of Sin3B and HDAC2 to the collagen start site. Therefore, we have identified the region within CIITA responsible for mediating IFN-gamma-induced inhibition of collagen synthesis."

Interestingly, recent sequence analysis of the tyrosine kinome in colorectal cancers has revealed five point mutations in the trkC gene, both within its kinase-encoding domain (9Marchetti D. Menter D. Jin L. Nakajima M. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The effect of the trkC mutations on kinase function remains to be determined, but their positions within each protein suggest that many of them may be activating in nature.TrkC is activated by cell surface ligand-mediated oligomerization, which facilitates autophosphorylation of TrkC cytoplasmic tyrosine residues 516, 705, 709, 710, and 820 and subsequent kinase activation (31Barbacid M.

Phosphorylated TrkC tyrosine 516 binds the adaptor protein Src-homology/collagen (SHC) via the SH2 domain of the latter (34Guiton M. Gunn-Moore F.J. Glass D.J. Geis D.R. Yancopoulos G.D. Tavare J.M.

Resultant ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcripts encode the helix-loop-helix (HLH) dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain of NTRK3. Expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein is associated with constitutively high levels of phosphorylated Mek1 and Akt, even in the absence of serum. Moreover, ETV6-NTRK3-expressing cells show serum-independent elevation of cyclin D1 protein. Inhibition of either the Ras-Erk1/2 MAP kinase or the PI3K-Akt pathway alone completely blocks colony formation of ETV6-NTRK3-expressing cells in soft agar assays. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of cyclin D1 protein in ETV6-NTRK3-expressing cells can be down-regulated by MEK1 or PI3K inhibition. However, only inhibition of the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway led to persistent down-regulation of cyclin D1 levels in cells expressing ETV6-NTRK3 (42Tognon C. Garnett M. Kenward E. Kay R. Morrison K. Sorensen P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8909-8916PubMed Google Scholar).c-Src is known to activate the PI3K/Akt and the Ras-MAPK cascades through both FAK-dependent and FAK-independent pathways (43Jones R.J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Src has also been implicated, in PC12 cells, in NGF-induced down-regulation of EGF receptors. Expression of dominant-negative c-Src blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (45Kremer N.E. D'Arcangelo G. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These results prompt us to examine whether TrkC activates Ras-MAPK and PI3K/Akt through the activation of c-Src. Here we show that TrkC binds to and activates c-Src, and that inhibition of c-Src activation blocks TrkC transforming activity and activation of the PI3K/Akt and the Ras-MAPK cascades.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Antibodies and Reagent—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in c-Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF) as well as c-Src (SYF cells deficient for Yes and Fyn but overexpressing c-Src) cells were obtained from the ATCC. 67NR, 4T1, 293T, and SYF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression of Src was frequently assessed by Western blot analysis. Antibodies were obtained from the following companies: Anti-c-Src, anti-TrkC, anti-HA(Y-11), anti-cyclin D1, and anti-Myc(9E10) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-V5 from Invitrogen; anti-phospho-Src, anti-phospho-MEK1/2, and anti-phospho-AKT from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-β-actin from Sigma-Aldrich. Pharmacological inhibition was performed with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm) and c-Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU6656, both from Calbiochem.Plasmids—Three siRNA-coding oligos against mouse c-Src and IRS-1 were designed and verified to be specific to c-src and IRS-1 by Blast search against the mouse genome. To construct hairpin-type single RNAi vectors, 5 μl (100 mm) of the synthesized sense and antisense oligonucleotides (Table 1) were combined with 1 μl of 1 m NaCl and annealed by incubation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by rapid cooling to 72 °C, and ramp cooling to 4 °C over a period of 2 h. The c-src-siRNA-1 and c-src-siRNA-2 insert were subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI sites of the pFG12 lentivirus vector. A control siRNA, which does not match any known mouse coding cDNA, was used as a control.TABLE 1siRNAs sequences for the mouse c-src gene and the mouse IRS-1 geneMouse c-Src-1 (pFG12 vector)5′-CTAGACCAGCCGCCAATATCCTAGTATTCAAGAGATACTAGGATATTGGCGGCTTTTTGGAAAC-3′Mouse c-Src-2 (pFG12 vector)5′-CTAGACCAAGATCACTAGACGGGAATCATTCAAGAGATGATTCCCGTCTAGTGATCTTTTTTTGGAAAC-3′Mouse IRS-1 515 (pFG12 vector)5′-CTAGACCAGAACCTGATTGGCATCTATTCAAGAGATAGATGCCAATCAGGTTCTTTTTTGGAAAC-3′Mouse IRS-1 1539 (pFG12 vector)5′-CTAGACCTAACCGGTTTCGAAAGAGATTCAAGAGATCTCTTTCGAAACCGGTTATTTTTGGAAAC-3′ Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were used for the detection of protein-protein interaction in vivo. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. After a 24-h transfection, cells were switched to 0.2% serum overnight. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science, Gipf-Oberfrick, Switzerland). Extracts were separated by SDS/PAGE followed by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with polyclonal or monoclonal antisera, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse IgG, respectively, and visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody (Ab) for 1 h, followed by incubation with Gamma-bind beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed four times with the buffer used for cell solubilization. Immune complexes then were eluted by boiling for 3 min in 2× Laemmli buffer (pH 6.8), and then extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above.Soft Agar Assays—Soft agar assays were performed according to established protocols (29Hisaoka M. Sheng W.Q. Tanaka A. Hashimoto H. J. Pathol. 2002; 197: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 67NR and 4T1 and 67NR expressing activated c-Src or 4T1 cells carrying siRNA-coding oligos against mouse c-Src and IRS-1 were seeded in triplicate at a concentration of 8 × 103 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Bottom layers were made up of 0.4% agar in 9% fetal bovine serum and DMEM. Cells were resuspended in a top layer of 0.2% agar in 9% fetal bovine serum and DMEM. Cells were fed every other day by placing 2 drops of medium on the top layer. After 3 weeks at 37 °C, colonies were then stained with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (1 mg/ml stock diluted at 1:500) for 16 h, and macroscopic colonies were counted (in quadruplicate). Each determination was done in triplicate.Anchorage-independent Cell Growth—67NR and 4T1 were seeded into an Ultra Low Cluster plate (ULC plate) (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) at 1 × 106 cells and photographed at 96 h.Viral Production and Infection of Target Cells—293T cells were transfected with the transfer vector plasmid pCAG (empty) or pCAG-TrkC plasmid and pCAG-v-Src with the envelope-encoding plasmid pHCMVG, the packaging plasmid pMDLg/pRRE, and the Rev-expression plasmid pRSV-Rev using the calcium phosphate method. The supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection, pooled, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g in a SW28 rotor, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and the lentiviral stocks were stored in small aliquots at –80 °C for titration and cell infection. SYF and SYF-Src cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and were cultured overnight. Lentiviruses were diluted in 2 ml of DMEM containing polybrene (8 μg/ml) and then centrifuged for 30 min at 1,500 rpm. After 24 h of infection, polybrene-DMEM was replaced with fresh DMEM medium, and the cells were cultured for other assays.Reverse Transcription-PCRs—Mouse c-src RT-PCR forward primer is GCATCATCCCAGCCAACTAT, and its RT-PCR reverse primer is CAGCTGCATGAGGTTCTCAA. Mouse IRS-1 RT-PCR forward primer is GGTGCTGCAGCTGATGAATA, and its RT-PCR reverse primer is CGAGATCTCCGAGTCAGTCC. Mouse GAPDH RT-PCR forward primer is AAGGTCATCCCAGAGCTGAA, and its RT-PCR reverse primer is CCCTGTTGCTGTAGC CGTAT. Total RNA was extracted using a Quizol reagent (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was done using a one step RT-PCR kit at the suggested conditions (Qiagen, Inc.). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide techniques.RESULTSTrkC Directly Binds to c-Src—We examined the possibility that TrkC may interact directly with c-Src in vivo in a mouse mammary model that consists of three distinct tumor cell lines, 67NR, 4TO7, and 4T1. These cell lines are derived from a single mammary tumor that arose spontaneously in a wild-type BALB/c mouse. 67NR cells form primary tumors, but no tumor cells are detectable in any distant tissue. 4TO7 cells are able to spread to the lung, but cannot establish visible metastatic nodules, whereas 4T1 cells are able to complete all steps of metastasis and form visible metastatic nodules in the lung efficiently (46Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). The 67NR cell line had negligible TrkC expression, but TrkC is expressed in the 4TO7 and 4T1 cell lines (Fig. 1a). We have recently demonstrated that TrkC was expressed 5–10-fold higher in 4T1 tumor cells compared with 4TO7 cells and that TrkC proteins in 4TO7 and 4T1 cells are tyrosine-phosphorylated, indicating an activated state. 3S.-J. Kim, submitted for publication. We determined the endogenous interaction of TrkC and c-Src in 4T07 and 4T1 cells, which express endogenous TrkC. To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in 4T07 and 4T1 cells. Extracts prepared from 67NR cells were used as negative controls. Endogenous TrkC was able to interact with c-Src (Fig. 1a). We also examined the endogenous interaction between TrkC and c-Src in Hs578T human breast cancer cells which express TrkC. MCF7 human breast cancer cells, which do not express TrkC, were used as a control. Endogenous c-Src was able to interact with endogenous TrkC (Fig. 1b). To confirm this finding in a transient transfection system, V5-tagged TrkC and HA-tagged c-Src were transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1c, TrkC interacted strongly with c-Src. We then determined whether expression of TrkC correlates with certain pathological phenotypes in clinical breast tumor samples, and wished to confirm that the above findings are relevant to human breast tumors expressing TrkC. To do so, we examined TrkC expression in invasive human breast tumors by immunoblotting. Elevated expression of both TrkC and c-Src was observed in infiltrating ductal carcinomas compared with normal breast tissue samples (Fig. 1d), suggesting that expression of both TrkC and c-Src may contribute to the pathogenesis of human invasive breast carcinomas. We therefore screened for the presence of TrkC-c-Src complexes in human breast tumors positive for the TrkC gene. Total tissue extracts were isolated from primary tumors and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-c-Src antibody followed by immunoblotting with the anti-TrkC antibody. As shown in Fig. 1d, TrkC-c-Src complexes were found in the human breast tumor samples, but not in control breast tissue samples. TrkC expression was associated with a strong increase in phosphorylation of c-Src. These results clearly demonstrate that the interaction between TrkC and c-Src occurs in vivo in human breast cancer tissues expressing the TrkC gene.SU6656 Treatment Suppresses TrkC Transformation Activity—We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of TrkC expression completely blocks colony formation of 4T1 cells in soft agar.3 This finding suggests that TrkC may induce the colony formation of 4T1 cells through the activation of c-Src. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of c-Src kinase activity blocks the colony formation of 4T1 cells using SU6656 (47Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of c-Src kinase. Upon the addition of 2 μm SU6656, the colony formation of 4T1 cells was almost completely suppressed indicated by the failure to form microscopic or macroscopic colonies in soft agar when scored after 16 days (Fig. 2a). Most tumor cell lines form multicellular spheroids through cell-cell adhesion on non-adhesive agar-coated dishes. Under these conditions, non-malignant cells generally fail to do so and undergo massive cell death in culture (48Bates R.C. Edwards N.S. Yates J.D. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 36: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 4T1 cells readily form multicellular spheroids (49Günther S. Ruhe C. Derikito M.G. Böse G. Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Cancer Lett. 2006; 250: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, SU6656 treatment suppressed formation of multicellular spheroids (Fig. 2b). This result suggested that TrkC and c-Src affect the survival of 4T1 cells.FIGURE 2Inhibition of c-Src activation blocks soft agar colony formation of 4T1 cells. a, soft agar colony-forming assay of mouse breast cancer cell lines. Monolayer cells were trypsinized, washed, and plated in medium containing 0.2% agar to assess anchorage-independent growth in the presence or absence of SU6656 (1 μm). Results are presented as the number of macroscopic colonies formed at 3 weeks after plating. b, 4T1 mouse breast cell line as well as the control 67NR cell line were grown in medium containing 9% serum and were treated with vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide) and SU6656 (1 μm) for 3 days. Anchorage-independent spheroid growth of 67NR and 4T1 cells was then photographed in time at ×200 magnifications.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To see whether activation of c-Src can induce the colony forming ability, we generated the stable 67NR cells expressing v-Src, which is the constitutively active form of Src. Expression of v-Src in 67NR cells was verified by immunoblotting using the anti-V5 antibody (Supplemental Fig. S1a). And then we investigated whether v-Src increased the colony forming ability in these cells. Expression of v-Src markedly increased formation of microscopic or macroscopic colonies in soft agar when scored after 20 days (Supplemental Fig. S1b).Characterization of the c-Src/TrkC Interaction—c-Src is a multidomain protein containing an unique N-terminal domain: UD (residues 1–80), SH3 (residues 83–144), SH2 protein interaction domains (150–247), a catalytic region (269–522), and a negative-regulatory tyrosine located near the C terminus (residue 523) (50Funakoshi-Tago M.

To identify the functional domain of c-Src responsible for the interaction with TrkC, we used a series of c-Src deletion constructs. The c-Src mutant lacking the N-terminal domain (1–249) still interacted with TrkC (Fig. 3b). This indicates that the c-Src C-terminal region (250–535) is directly involved in this interaction. Next, we tested the interaction of TrkC with a series of C-terminal deletion mutants. The c-Src ΔC, which does not have a negative-regulatory tyrosine in the C-terminal region, still interacted with TrkC. While the deletion of amino acid residues 361–535 (ΔKD-1 and ΔKD-2) also interacted with TrkC, the deletion of amino acid residues 275–360 abrogated the TrkC interaction (Fig. 3c). These results clearly indicate that the region including amino acids 275–360 of c-Src, which includes the ATP binding domain, is required for TrkC interaction.FIGURE 3Identification of c-Src region responsible for the interaction with TrkC. a, schematic representation of full-length and truncated c-Src proteins. b, V5-tagged TrkC was cotransfected into 293T cells with the HA-tagged c-Src constructs.

https://openalex.org/W2022419731,"This laboratory has advanced a model whereby retinol is transported around the body bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP), is transferred across the membrane of cells by a specific receptor/transporter, and is picked up from the membrane by an intracellular homolog, cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). This process involves a number of protein-protein interactions, and we hypothesized that conformational changes were an integral part of the retinol transfer mechanism. Previously we identified the potential interaction site on RBP for its membrane receptor. Here we confirm by the analysis of chimera containing a grafted CD loop from RBP that this is indeed the receptor interaction site and go on to demonstrate that the conformational changes that occur to this region on the apo to holo transition in RBP also take place in a chimera binding a quite different ligand, thus establishing the concept. We have also gone on to support the hypothesis that CRBP may also bind to a receptor in the membrane. Previous evidence has indicated that one such receptor might be lecithin:retinol acyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes retinol esterification. Here we provide the first evidence that the plasma membrane receptor for RBP could be the same as that for CRBP. This observation offers support for the intracellular phase of the uptake process for retinol, providing an efficient and highly unique mechanism in eukaryotic biology."
https://openalex.org/W2075596304,"Heterotrimeric stimulatory GTP-binding protein (G(s)) stimulates adenylate cyclases to activate the cAMP signaling pathway. Although the cAMP pathway has been reported to be involved in apoptosis, the role of the G(s)-cAMP signaling pathway during reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis, which is involved in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation, is not clearly understood. Thus, in this study we aimed to investigate the role of the alpha subunit of G(s) (Galpha(s)) in the ROS-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. The stable expression of constitutively active Galpha(s) (Galpha(s)QL) inhibited the hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and reduced the hydrogen peroxide-induced increase in Bak and the decrease in Bcl-x(L) protein expression. Exogenous Bak expression abolished these inhibitory effects of Galpha(s)QL, but Bak small interfering RNA decreased hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. Galpha(s) repressed hydrogen peroxide-induced Bak expression by inhibiting the transcription of Bak mRNA, which resulted from the inhibition of the hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of transcription factors such as AP1, NF-kappaB, and NFAT. Moreover, Galpha(s) also inhibited the hydrogen peroxide-induced binding of AP1, NF-kappaB, and NFAT to the Bak promoter. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis was reduced by treating cells with prostaglandin E(2), which activates Galpha(s), but this was augmented by CCPA, which activates Galpha(i) causing a decrease in cAMP levels. From the results, we conclude that Galpha(s) protects neuroblastoma cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis by repressing Bak induction, which is mediated by the inhibition of the hydrogen peroxide-induced activations of AP1, NF-kappaB, and NFAT through cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling system."

The contribution of the AGC kinase family, including protein kinase B, protein kinase C, p90kDa ribosomal S6 kinase, and S6 kinase, has been little investigated because the probable redundancy among their isoforms makes their study difficult. We took advantage of the fact that all these kinases are regulated by the upstream master kinase 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Here we analyze various properties of DC from mice expressing ∼10% of normal PDK1 (PDK1fl/–). DC populations in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues appeared normal in PDK1fl/– mice, and some in vitro responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) such as cytokine production were normal in cultured bone marrow DC. However, LPS-induced expression of class II major histocompatibility complex and CD86 were elevated in PDK1fl/– BMDC and PDK1fl/– spleen DC produced more interleukin-10 and -12, implying an attenuating role for PDK1. Unexpectedly, PDK1fl/– DC had a significantly reduced capacity for LPS-stimulated macropinocytosis and phagocytosis that correlated with a lowered F-actin/G-actin ratio, apparently because of increased actin depolymerization. Several PDK1-regulated kinases, some of which feed into actin regulators, showed reduced activation in PDK1fl/– DC. Reintroduction of PDK1 restored S6 kinase activity, increased levels of F-actin, and boosted macropinocytosis thus linking PDK1 and its downstream effectors to the unusual phenotype of PDK1fl/– DC.

This crucial process involves a transient increase in antigen uptake and processing, the production of cytokines, the migration from the site of infection to the secondary lymphoid organs, antigen presentation, and up-regulation of class II MHC, as well as co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40 and CD86/80 (1Banchereau J.

These events are regulated by complex signaling pathways downstream of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR). Whereas the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases, NFκB, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) in regulating the different aspects of DC maturation, especially cytokine production, is under investigation (5O'Neill L.A.

Studies performed in macrophages, neutrophils, and T and B lymphocytes showed that these kinases, once activated by extracellular stimuli, control a broad range of processes such as cell survival, gene transcription, migration, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and phagocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 8Vanhaesebroeck B.

Biol. 2000; 10: 839-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but to date, the role of AGC kinases has been investigated only in the context of cytokine production. For instance, PKCϵ has been shown to regulate IL-12 production (20Aksoy E. Amraoui Z. Goriely S. Goldman M. Willems F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3040-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas GSK3, a downstream effector of Akt/PKB, controlled the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (21Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 22Rodionova E. Conzelmann M. Maraskovsky E. Hess M. Kirsch M. Giese T. Ho A.D. Zoller M. Dreger P. Luft T. Blood. 2006; 109: 1584-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One difficulty in studying AGC Ser/Thr kinases is the presence of many different isoforms, for instance there are 11 PKC isoforms (23Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and three PKB isoforms (8Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Therefore, deletion or inhibition of a single isoform could miss or underestimate the role of a particular kinase. To circumvent this problem, we took advantage of the fact that several members of the AGC kinases such as PKB, PKC, PRK1, RSK, S6K, and SGK require an upstream activatory “master” kinase, named PDK1 (7Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Therefore, by manipulating PDK1 expression, we were able to have a more general view of the role of AGC kinases in DC functions. Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is itself a member of the AGC kinase family and consists of a kinase domain, a hydrophobic pocket (known as the PDK1-interacting fragment (PIF) pocket) involved in substrate recognition, and a PH domain specific for phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol (3,4) biphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) (24Biondi R.M.

Prescott A.R. Peter Downes C. Safrany S.T. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PDK1 activates its target kinases through the phosphorylation of their T loop. Under basal conditions, PDK1 exists in an active, phosphorylated form. Because this characteristic could result in a noncontrolled activation of the substrates, PDK1 recognizes its targets only when they are phosphorylated at a Ser/Thr residue in a hydrophobic motif. This preactivation step is achieved by stimulation with extracellular agonists. For example, PKB requires prior phosphorylation by mTor/rictor together with its binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (26Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5081) Google Scholar), whereas RSK isoforms need prior phosphorylation by Erk1/2 (27Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to become activated by PDK1. In contrast with RSK and PKB, PKC isoforms are constitutive targets of PDK1. Indeed, phosphorylation by PDK1 stabilizes their conformation after synthesis (28Balendran A. Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the past few years, the crucial role of PDK1 in embryo development (30Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) as well as in the normal functions of the liver (31Mora A. Lipina C. Tronche F. Sutherland C. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the heart (32Mora A. Sakamoto K. McManus E.J. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3632-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have been well studied using specific tissue deletion in mice. Recently, several studies have addressed the role of PDK1 in T lymphocytes. Hinton et al. (33Hinton H.J. Alessi D.R. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that, in vivo, PDK1 was required for the transition from the DN to the DP stages during thymocytes development. Using in vitro models, Nirula et al. (34Nirula A. Ho M. Phee H. Roose J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that PDK1 was involved in the production of IL-4 by Th2 cells. Here we investigate whether PDK1 and its AGC kinase substrates were involved in different aspects of DC behavior. To perform this study, we took advantage of the fact that although the loss of PDK1 is embryonic lethal, mice expressing only 10% of PDK1 activity are viable (30Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The analysis of DC derived from these mice showed that despite normal development of DC in vivo, several aspects of their in vitro biology were disturbed. These included abnormal cytokine production by spleen-derived DCs and defects in both phagocytic function and TLR-induced macropinocytosis. The latter defects appeared to be due to reduced levels of polymerized actin in DC that could be due to the fact that several AGC kinase substrates of PDK1 are weakly activated by TLR stimuli. Our results have highlighted the importance of the fine tuning/balance of AGC kinase activity in controlling different aspects of DC biology. Mice and Cell Culture—Wild type, PDK1+/fl and PDK1–/fl mice in either C57BL/6 (backcrossed for at least five generations into C57BL/6) or in mixed C57BL/6 × Balb/c backgrounds were described previously (30Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PDK1fl allele in PDK1+/fl and PDK1–/fl mice has a neomycin resistance gene in the intron between exons 2 and 3. This allele is not expressed effectively resulting in a 80–90% decrease of PDK1 expression in several PDK1fl/– tissues (supplemental Fig. S1). For each experiment, age- and sex-matched wild type or PDK1+/fl mice were used as littermate controls for PDK1–/fl. All of the mice were housed and maintained according to appropriate national and institutional guidelines. Dendritic cells were expanded from either mouse spleen (SDC) or bone marrow (BMDC) using complete RPMI supplemented with 10 ng/ml recombinant granulocyte macrophate-colony-stimulating factor (Peprotech) and 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor β (R & D Systems) or 10 ng/ml recombinant granulocyte macrophate-colony-stimulating factor, respectively, as described in Ref. 18West M.A. Wallin R.P.

Unless otherwise stated, the experiments were performed in complete RPMI with 5% fetal calf serum without cytokines. The 5B12 T cell hybridoma specific for tetanus toxin C-fragment (TTFC) antigen was cultured as described in Ref. 35Moss C.X. Matthews S.P. Lamond D.J. Watts C. J. Biol.

CD4+ T cells specific for ovalbumin peptide 323–339 were purified using the CD4+ T cell isolation kit from Miltenyi (negative selection) from the spleen of OT-II mice (provided by P. Crocker, University of Dundee). FACS Analysis of Surface Markers—Spleen, lymph nodes, and lungs were cut into pieces and digested in RPMI with 1 mg/ml collagenase A and 200 μg/ml DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C. Tissues were disaggregated through a 70-μm filter, red blood cells were lysed, and the cells were co-stained with APC- or PE-labeled anti-CD11c and either PE-labeled anti-CD4, FITC-labeled anti-CD8, APC-labeled anti-CD11b, and PE-labeled anti-CD45RA (BD biosciences), and the fluorescence was analyzed on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). The epidermal sheets were prepared from ears. The ears were split in two, and each half was incubated for 1 h in PBS with 20 mm EDTA at 37 °C to allow the separation of the epidermis from the dermis. Epidermal sheets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The sheets were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and then stained with anti-class II MHC (M5/114, ATCC) followed by Alexa 594 donkey anti-rat Ab (Molecular Probes). The images were collected on a LSM 510 microscope (Zeiss). To measure up-regulation of class II MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, DC were either untreated or stimulated for 24 h with 50 ng/ml LPS and then co-stained with APC-labeled anti-CD11c and either PE-labeled antibodies against CD40, CD86 or CD54 Abs (Southern Biotech) or anti-class II MHC Ab followed by PE labeled goat anti-rat IgG Abs (Southern Biotech). The fluorescence was analyzed by FACS. Cytokine Production—Five × 104 BMDC or SDC were either untreated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS for 1, 3, 6, or 12 h at 37 °C in a 96-well plate. IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-1β productions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a cytokine 10-plex bead kit from BioSource according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Microscopy and Flow Cytometry Staining of F- and G-Actin—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.5 μg/ml TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma), and analyzed on a LSM510 microscope as described in Ref. 18West M.A. Wallin R.P. Matthews S.P. Svensson H.G. Zaru R. Ljunggren H.G. Prescott A.R. Watts C. Science. 2004; 305: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar. For flow cytometry analysis of actin content, 2 × 105 DC were plated in 48-well plate for 1 h at 37 °C. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were stained with PE-labeled anti-CD11c Ab, then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with 5 μg/ml FITC-DNase I and phalloidin Alexa 633 (1:100) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The G-actin/F-actin ratio was calculated using the median fluorescent intensity measured by FACS on the CD11c-positive cell population. DC plated as above were treated with 2 μm latrunculin A (Calbiochem) for 20 min at 37 °C. After two washes with warm RPMI, the cells were incubated for 5, 15, and 30 min either in complete RPMI or in fetal calf serum-free medium with or without calcium at 37 °C, then fixed, and stained with Alexa633-phalloidin as described above. Dextran Uptake—Dextran uptake was performed as described previously (18West M.A. Wallin R.P. Matthews S.P. Svensson H.G. Zaru R. Ljunggren H.G. Prescott A.R. Watts C. Science. 2004; 305: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 DC were either untreated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS (Calbiochem), 5 μg/ml CpG (OD1668, MWG), or 50 ng/ml Pam3CSK (EMC Microcollections) for the indicated period of time, and then 1 mg/ml FITC or (in the case of retrovirally infected, GFP-positive cells) Alexa 633 dextran (Invitrogen) was added for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed four times at 4 °C with PBS/0.2% fetal calf serum, stained with APC- or PE-labeled anti-CD11c Abs, and analyzed by FACS. Note that Alexa 633-dextran bound to the cell surface to a greater extent than FITC-dextran partially masking LPS-stimulated endocytosis, which was reduced under these conditions to an apparent value of 1.5–2-fold in wild type cells and less in PDK1+/fl cells. T Cell Assays—Wild type, PDK1+/fl, and PDK1–/fl BMDC or SDC (5 × 105) were pulsed with the indicated concentrations of either ovalbumin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) or TTFC (35Moss C.X.

After three washes, 5 × 105 5B12 T cell hybridomas or OT-II T cells were added to a final volume of 200 μl of complete RPMI in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the supernatants were collected, and the amount of IL-2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the IL-2 OptEIA kit (BD Biosciences). In other experiments, DC were stimulated for 24 h with 50 ng/ml LPS at 37 °C and then pulsed with TTFC peptide 900–915 (35Moss C.X. Matthews S.P. Lamond D.J. Watts C. J. Biol.

Red Blood Cell Phagocytosis—Sheep red blood cells (RBC, 108 cells) (Diagnostics Scotland) were opsonized with rabbit anti-sheep IgG (1:50; Harlan Sera-Lab) for 45 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of RPMI-Hepes and then labeled with 0.5 μm CFSE (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C. RBC were washed with RPMI-Hepes once and added at a 40:1 ratio to 2.5 × 105 DC previously plated in 24-well plates. The plate was centrifuged for 1 min at 500 × g at 37 °C and then cells incubated for 10 or 25 min at 37 °C. After two washes with RPMI, excess extracellular RBC were lysed in RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) for 1 min at room temperature, and then cells were washed again twice. DCs were harvested with 5 mm EDTA/PBS and stained at 4 °C with APC-labeled anti-CD11c Abs, and CFSE fluorescence reflecting RBC uptake DC was measured by FACS. The results are expressed either as median fluorescent value (MFI) or as the percentage of CD11c+ cells that are CFSE-positive. RBC phagocytosis was also assessed by microscopy after fixation and staining with TRITC-phalloidin as described above. Cell Lysis and Immunoblot—SDC (106 cells) were either untreated or treated with 50 ng/ml LPS for 30 min at 37 °C in 6-well plates, harvested from the wells, and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of proteins (10–20 μg) were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the following antibodies against: RSK2, Erk1/2, WASP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cofilin, PDK1 (Cell Signaling), Arp3 (kind gift of M. Welch, UC Berkeley, CA), and actin (ICN). Phospho-specific antibodies against RSK S227 (R & D Systems) and p42/44 (Erk1/2), p38, cofilin S3, PKB T308, and GSK3α/β S9/21 were purchased from Cell Signaling. For some experiments, secondary antibodies coupled to IRDye800 (LI-COR Biosciences) or to Alexa 680 (Molecular Probes) were used and detected by LI-COR Odyssey infrared detection system (Rockland). Band intensity was quantitated using LI-COR software. Flow Cytometry Analysis of S6 Phosphorylation—PDK1fl/+ or PDK1fl/– SDC or BMDC (2 × 105) were untreated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were stained on ice with APC-labeled anti-CD11c abs. After washing, the cells were fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 90% cold methanol on ice for 15 min. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the cells were stained with anti-phospho-S6 abs (Cell Signaling) followed by goat anti-Rabbit PE abs (Jackson Immunoresearch) and then analyzed by FACS (33Hinton H.J. Alessi D.R. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The MFI was measured on CD11c+-gated cells. [Ca2+]i Measurement—SDC (2 × 105) were labeled with 5 μm Indo-1 (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed. Calcium flux in DC was recorded for 2 min on a LSR machine (BD biosciences). After 30 s 100 ng/ml MIP1α (Peprotech) was added. Emission was measured at 405 and 525 nm. The 405/525 ratio gives a measure of [Ca2+]i increase in stimulated cells. Retroviral Constructs and BMDC Retroviral Infection—Moloney murine leukemia virus-based pBMN-IRES-GFP retroviral vector was provided by G. Nolan (Stanford). Mouse PDK1 cDNA was isolated from pME18-FL3 vector (provided by D. Alessi, University of Dundee) and cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pBMN-I-GFP by Advantagen Ltd., (Dundee, UK). The virus was produced by transfecting Phoenix Eco 293T packaging cell line as previously described in Ref. 18West M.A. Wallin R.P. Matthews S.P. Svensson H.G. Zaru R. Ljunggren H.G. Prescott A.R. Watts C. Science. 2004; 305: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar. Viral supernatant was concentrated five times in a Beckman centrifuge (rotor JA 25.50) at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h. BMDC were infected at days 2 and 3 with viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene as described in Ref. 18West M.A. Wallin R.P. Matthews S.P. Svensson H.G. Zaru R. Ljunggren H.G. Prescott A.R. Watts C. Science. 2004; 305: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar. The cells were used after 8 days. GFP expression was assessed by flow cytometry. To assess PDK1 overexpression, BMDC were lysed, and equal amounts were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was immunoblotted with anti-PDK1 Ab. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired Student's t test. Differences with p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. DC Development Appears Normal in PDK1–/fl Mice—PDK1–/fl mice carry an insertion of a neomycin cassette into the single functional PDK1 allele (fl), which results in the expression of ∼10% of wild type levels of the enzyme (Fig. 1C, supplemental Fig. S1) (30Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). After backcrossing, PDK1–/fl mice were not born at the expected Mendelian ratio, indicating a more penetrating effect of the fl allele in the pure B6 background during embryonic development. Nonetheless, a limited number of mice were obtained for analysis. DC derived from both genetic backgrounds were used for all of the experiments, and the results were similar. We first investigated whether low levels of PDK1 expression could affect the development of DC in vivo as well as their homing to immune and nonimmune tissues. We used CD11c as a general marker to identify DC populations. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), the percentage of CD11c+ cells in the spleen and in the lymph nodes of PDK1–/fl mice was normal. Several DC subsets have been characterized based on their expression of CD4 and CD8 (conventional DC) or CD8 and CD45RA (plasmacytoid DC) (36Shortman K. Liu Y.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 37Villadangos J.A. Heath W.R. Semin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using different combinations of these markers, we found that the different subsets of CD11c+ D"

Regulation of myosin II activity can occur through modulation of filament assembly and by targeting to appropriate cellular sites. Here we show, using salt-dependent solubility and a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, that assembly of the Drosophila non-muscle myosin II heavy chain, zipper, is mediated by a 90-residue region (1849-1940) of the coiled-coil tail domain. This filament assembly domain, transiently expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, does not localize to the interphase cortex or the cytokinetic cleavage furrow, whereas a 500-residue region (1350-1865) that overlaps the NH(2) terminus of the assembly domain localizes to the interphase cortex but not the cytokinetic cleavage furrow. Targeting to these two sites appears to utilize distinct localization mechanisms as the assembly domain is required for cleavage furrow recruitment of a truncated coiled-coil tail region but not targeting to the interphase cortex. These results delineate the requirements for zipper filament assembly and indicate that the ability to form filaments is necessary for targeting to the cleavage furrow but not to the interphase cortex."

The crystal structure of PPAT from Mesorhizobium loti has been solved in space group P43212 and was refined to an R factor of 15.6% (Rfree = 20.6%) at 2.0Å resolution. In addition, the structures of PPAT in complexes with pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxyl-l-alanine have been refined to R factors of 15.6, 15.4, and 14.5% (Rfree = 18.6, 18.1, and 18.4%) at 1.7, 1.7, and 2.0Å resolution, respectively. PPAT is a homotetramer and each subunit is composed of a large N-terminal domain, consisting of seven β-sheets and eight α-helices, and a smaller C-terminal domain, consisting of three β-sheets and four α-helices. The substrate pyridoxal is bound through an aldimine linkage to Lys-197 in the active site. The α-carboxylate group of the substrate amino/keto acid is hydrogen-bonded to Arg-336 and Arg-345. The structures revealed that the bulky side chain of Glu-68 interfered with the binding of the phosphate moiety of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and made PPAT specific to pyridoxal.

PPAT is involved in a degradation pathway for PM, one of six natural vitamin B6 compounds (1Nelson M.J. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15115-15120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been purified from Pseudomonas sp. and characterized (2Wada H. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 133-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Recently, we first identified the gene encoding PPAT in a nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium, Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, characterized with the recombinant PPAT overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and found that it belonged to the class V aminotransferases of fold type I of PLP-dependent enzymes (14Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), although it does not use PLP as a coenzyme. pyridoxamine-pyruvate aminotransferase pyridoxamine pyridoxal pyridoxal 5′-phosphate pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase root mean square deviation pyridoxyl-l-alanine. pyridoxamine-pyruvate aminotransferase pyridoxamine pyridoxal pyridoxal 5′-phosphate pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase root mean square deviation pyridoxyl-l-alanine. The recombinant PPAT bound the substrate PL at Lys-197 through a Schiff base, like general aminotransferases, forming an internal aldimine between PLP and an active site lysine residue, and the Schiff base formation was partially rate-determining in the reverse reaction. Sequence alignment of PPAT with other class V aminotransferases showed that the amino acid residues that have been shown to interact with PLP, based on the crystallography of E. coli phosphoserine aminotransferase (15Hester G. Stark W. Moser M. Kallen J. Markovic-Housley Z. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol.

Mol.

Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The predicted active site structure of PPAT suggested that PLP cannot bind to the enzyme because the bulky side chain of an amino acid residue located in the phosphate-binding space in PLP-dependent aminotransferases prevents the approach of PLP to the active site of PPAT (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One of the aims of this study was to determine the amino acid residue preventing the binding of PLP, and the extent to which PPAT can be converted to PMP-pyruvate (PLP-l-alanine) aminotransferase through mutation of a relevant residue. A further aim of this study was to propose a reaction mechanism for PPAT based on the structures of PPAT bound to PL, PM, and pyridoxyl-l-alanine (PLA) and on the profile of aligned sequences of the class V aminotransferases and kinetic results described previously (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of Arg-336 to the substrate specificity of PPAT, we produced the PPAT R336A mutant and analyzed its kinetic properties. Overexpression, Purification, and Enzyme and Protein Assays—PPAT from M. loti MAFF303099 was overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified as described previously (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The PPAT activity (by the phenylhydrazine method and the spectrophotometric method) and protein concentration (from the molecular absorption coefficient) were determined as described previously (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PMP-pyruvate aminotransferase activity was assayed by the phenylhydrazine method as follows. The reaction mixture (0.4 ml) consisted of 0.1 m borate-KOH (pH 9.0), 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0-5 mm PMP, and the enzyme. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15-30 min and stopped by the addition of 66 μl of 9 m sulfuric acid. Kinetic parameters were determined using curve-fitting software (KaleidaGraph) as described previously (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of PPAT—Genes encoding E68A, E68G, and R336A mutant PPATs were prepared by essentially the same method as that described previously (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The primers used were: for E68A, 5′-TGCATGGCGCGCCGGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACCGGCGCGCCATGCA-3′; for E68G, 5′-TGCATGGCGGGCCGGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACCGGCCCGCCATGCA-3′; and for R336A, 5′-CGTCGGGGGCGGGCGAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTCGCCCGCCCCCGACG-3′. The underlining indicates mismatched sites. The expressed mutant enzymes were purified by essentially the same method as that used for the wild-type enzyme (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Substrate Soaking, and X-ray Data Collection—PPAT was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The volume of the reservoir solution (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 2 m ammonium sulfate) was 100 μl, and the drop volume was 5 μl, comprising 2 μl of a protein solution (11.6 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and 3 μl of the reservoir solution. Single crystals appeared within 1 month at 4 °C. Crystals of PM, PL, or PLA-bound forms of PPAT were prepared by soaking crystals in the reservoir solution containing 10 mm PM, 10 mm PL, or 5 mm PLA, respectively, for 30 min at 25 °C. PLA was synthesized from PL and l-alanine as described previously (17Miles E.W. Houck D.R. Floss H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14203-14210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the crystals were frozen in a cold nitrogen-gas steam after short soaking in the reservoir solution containing 30% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at the BL38B1 station of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) at -173 °C, using an x-ray beam with a wave-length of 1.0 Å and a Rigaku R-AXIS V imaging plate detector. The crystal belongs to space group P43212 with cell dimensions of a = b = 68.545 and c = 311.625 Å. Two molecules/asymmetric unit were estimated assuming Vsol = 51%. All of the raw data were processed and scaled using the program suite HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38432) Google Scholar).

After rotational and translational searches and refinements with simulated annealing, the initial model was built using TURBO-FRODO (AFMB-CNRS, Marseille, France). It was then refined further with the simulated annealing, individual B factor refinement, and energy minimization protocols in the program CNS. The noncrystallographic symmetry restraint was incorporated through the refinement, and it was removed in the final refinement. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of two subunits in the assymetric units are less than 0.4 Å (Table 1). Water molecules exhibiting more than 1 σ in the 2Fo - Fc map and more than 3 σ in the Fo - Fc map were then added to the model. The structures of the PM-, PL-, and PLA-bound forms of PPAT were built using COOT (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

All of the molecular graphics figures were prepared using the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific; pymol.sourceforge.net/). The accessible surface area was calculated with Protein-Protein Interaction Server version 1.5 (28Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). Modeling of the External Aldimine of PL with l-Alanine in PPAT—For modeling of the external aldimine of PL with l-alanine in the active site of PPAT, the crystal structure of PPAT in a complex with PLA was used as the starting structure. Molecular mechanic calculations were performed using MOE (version 2006.08; Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montréal, Canada). Protons were generated on the entire structure including the water molecules. The bond between C-4′ and N of the alanine moiety of PLA was changed to a double bond, the N atom of the generated imine bond being protonated. The O-3′ and N-1 of PL were unprotonated and protonated, respectively. The chloride ion was removed, and the side chain of Asn-196 was rotated around χ1 by 135 ° to yield a conformation similar to that of the side chain of Asn-196 in other PPAT crystal structures (free enzyme, and the enzymes in complexes with PL and PM). Energy minimization was carried out using MMFF94s parameters with all of the atoms fixed except for those of PLA and the residue interacting with PLA, i.e. Lys-197, Arg-345, Tyr-95, Thr-146, Glu-68, Arg-336, and water molecules within 10 Å from PLA. Polar protons are also allowed to move. Protein Data Bank Deposition—The coordinate and structure factors for the free enzyme, and complexes with PL, PM, and PLA have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2Z9U, 2Z9V, 2Z9W, and 2Z9X, respectively. Structure Determination of PPAT—The crystal structure of PPAT from M. loti has been solved by means of molecular replacement and was refined to an R factor of 15.6% (Rfree = 20.6%) at 2.0 Å resolution. In addition, the structures of PPAT in complexes with PM, PL, and PLA have been refined to R factors of 15.6, 15.4, and 14.5% (Rfree = 18.6, 18.1, and 18.4%) at 1.7, 1.7, and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. The final electron density maps allowed the positioning of all residues except for the first N-terminal residue (Met-1). Ramachandran plot analyses with PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 93-94% of the residues are in the most favored regions, and ∼6% of those lie in additional allowed regions for all of the forms (Table 1). Overall Structure of PPAT—There are two molecules (subunits)/asymmetric unit of PPAT (Fig. 1A). Each PPAT subunit consists of a large N-terminal domain (22-267), and a smaller C-terminal domain (2-21 or 268-393) (Fig. 1, A and B). The N-terminal domain has the three-layer α/β/α sandwich architecture described in the CATH classification (29Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Struct. Fold Des. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and consists of eight α-helices (α1-α8) and seven β-sheets (β1-β7), which have a ↑β1-↓β7-↑β6-↑β5-↑β4-↑β2-↑β3 arrangement (Fig. 1B). This domain is characteristic of PLP-dependent fold-type I aminotransferases (30Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has an α/β complex architecture and consists of an N-terminal strand, four α-helices (α9-α12), and three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets (β8-β10). The topology of the PPAT subunit was basically similar to those of class V aminotransferases such as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nostoc sp. AGATs (19Han G.W. Schwarzenbacher R. Page R. Jaroszewski L. Abdubek P. Ambing E. Biorac T. Canaves J.M. Chiu H.J. Dai X. Deacon A.M. DiDonato M. Elsliger M.A. Godzik A. Grittini C. Grzechnik S.K. Hale J. Hampton E. Haugen J. Hornsby M.

Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), with the exception of having an extra α-helix (α12) at the C terminus. The mode of dimer formation by PPAT was slightly different from that in the case of AGATs because PPAT does not have the longer N-terminal strand that is found in the subunits of AGATs and stabilizes the formation of their dimers. Two dimers, related through a crystallographic 2-fold axis, form a PPAT tetramer, i.e. a dimer of dimers (Fig. 1C). This is in good agreement with the finding that native PPAT is a tetramer in solution when its molecular weight was determined by size exclusion chromatography (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two subunits (A and B) in one asymmetric unit associate with those (A′ and B′) in the other asymmetric one. Subunit A exhibits interface accessible surface areas of ∼2,000, 200, and 1,200 Å2 as to subunits B, A′, and B′, respectively. Thus, subunits A and B are tightly associated through an extensive contact and exhibit 14 hydrogen bonds interactions and ∼240 hydrophobic interactions. The dimers (AB and A′B′) associate through interactions between the C-terminal domains of subunits A (B) and B′ (A′) and those between the C-terminal domain of subunit A (B′) and the N-terminal strand (2-31 residues) of subunit B′ (A). Thus, there are 20 hydrogen bonds and ∼240 hydrophobic interactions between the dimers. A structural homology search using MATRAS version 1.2 (32Kawabata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) showed that the tertiary structure of the M. loti PPAT subunit is similar to those of S. cerevisiae AGAT (Ref. 31Meyer P.

RMSD for PPAT, when superimposed with the S. cerevisiae and Nostoc sp. AGATs, were 1.85 Å (for 358 Cα atoms) and 1.92 Å (for 362 Cα atoms), respectively. Active Site of PPAT and Substrate Recognition—In contrast to general aminotransferases, the native PPAT had no coenzyme forms of vitamin B6, i.e. PLP or PMP (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The residual electron density of the free form of PPAT determined here clearly showed that it has no coenzyme. Instead, one glycerol (from the cryoprotectant solution) and one sulfate ion (from the reservoir solution) bound to the active site (Fig. 2) that is situated at the interface in the dimer (Fig. 1A). When PPAT had been incubated with PL, it bound PL through a Schiff base linkage (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, it was found that PL is bound to the ϵ amino group of Lys-197 through a double bond (an external aldimine) in the active site in the PPAT-PL complex, as shown in Fig. 2. One molecule of PL bound to both subunits in the asymmetric unit. PL is stacked between Tyr-95 and Val-173 through hydrophobic interactions, and the phenol ring of Tyr-95 is situated at the re face of the pyridine ring of PL. The side chain of Thr-146 is hydrogen-bonded to the O-3′ atom of PL, and this bond stabilizes its deprotonated state. The side chain of Thr-146 is kept in place through hydrogen bonding to Oγ of Ser-174. The negative charge on the O-3′ atom of PL stabilizes the protonated form of the imine nitrogen of the external aldimine because they can form an intramolecular hydrogen bond (36Hayashi H. Mizuguchi H. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15076-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Actually, the PL-Lys-197 Schiff base is protonated in a solution of pH 8.0, as determined on spectrophotometric analysis (13Yoshikane Y. Yokochi N. Ohnishi K. Hayashi H. Yagi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The torsion angle of the C-3—C-4-C-4′-N-4′ bond of the PL-lysine-197 Schiff base is 23°, and the Schiff base is roughly coplanar with the pyridine ring. The protonated Schiff base in E. coli aspartate aminotransferase is also nearly coplanar with the pyridine ring of PLP (36Hayashi H. Mizuguchi H. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15076-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Okada K. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The side chain of Asp-171 forms a charged hydrogen bond with the protonated N-1 atom of PL, stabilizing the protonated N-1 to strengthen the electron-withdrawing capacity of PL (38Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The side chain of Glu-68 is hydrogen-bonded to O-5′ of PL. PL exhibits van der Waals' interactions with Pro-69, Cys-142, His-144, and Ser-174. The sulfate ion from the reservoir solution lies near the PL at the active site and forms charged hydrogen bonds with Nη1 and Nη2 of Arg-345. This residue corresponds to the arginine involved in the recognition of the substrate α-carboxylate in class V aminotransferases. The sulfate is also hydrogen-bonded to Oη of Tyr-95 and Nη1 of Arg-336. One molecule of PM is bound to both subunits in the asymmetric unit. In the PPAT-PM complex, PM is anchored to the same residues as those used for anchoring PL through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic and van der Waals' interactions: Glu-68, Pro-69, Val-70, Leu-73, Tyr-95, Cys-142, His-144, Thr-146, Asp-171, Val-173, Ser-174, and the sulfate ion (Fig. 2). In contrast to for the PPAT-PL complex, PM is not covalently bound to Lys-197. Accordingly, the pyridine ring of the anchored PM tilts in the direction of Tyr-95 by ∼18 ° around N-1. Tyr-95 itself also tilts in the same direction. N-4′ of PM is hydrogen-bonded to Oη of Tyr-95 and O-1 and O-4 of the sulfate ion. N-4′ of PM also forms an intramolecular hydrogen-bond with O-3′ of the pyridine ring. The side chain of Lys-197 is hydrogen-bonded to O of Ala-16 and O of Gly-17 an"
https://openalex.org/W2008340466,"Fitness costs associated with resistance or virulence genes are thought to play a key role in determining the dynamics of gene-for-gene (GFG) host-parasite coevolution. However, the nature of interactions between fitness effects of multiple resistance or virulence genes (epistasis) has received less attention. To examine effects of the functional form of epistasis on the dynamics of GFG host-parasite coevolution we modified a classic multilocus GFG model framework. We show that the type of epistasis between virulence genes largely determines coevolutionary dynamics, and that coevolutionary fluctuations are more likely with acceleratingly costly (negative) than with linear or deceleratingly costly (positive) epistasis. Our results demonstrate that the specific forms of interaction between multiple resistance or virulence genes are a crucial determinant of host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics."

However, the regulatory mechanism, especially the trafficking mechanism of hβ2, is still unknown. With the help of immunofluorescence and patch clamp techniques, we determine that the hβ2 subunit alone resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that trafficking mechanism of hβ2 differs from that of hβ1 opposite to what we predicted previously. We further demonstrate that a four-turn α helical segment at the N terminus of hβ2 prevents the surface expression of hβ2, that is, the helical segment itself is a retention signal.

Obviously, the trafficking mechanism of hβ2 subunits is still unknown so far. large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ endoplasmic reticulum enhanced green fluorescence protein. large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ endoplasmic reticulum enhanced green fluorescence protein. There are many mechanisms for governing the surface expression of ion channels and thus the electrical activity of a cell. A channel protein in a misfolded or unfolded state can be trapped in the ER as demonstrated by measurements of the surface labeling, luminomitry. Some retrieval/retention and anterograde signals determine the ER exit of proteins (22Deutsch C. Neuron. 2003; 40: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The retention sequence RKR appearing in potassium inward rectifying channel (Kir) and its auxiliary SUR1 subunit is due to improperly folded or assembled channels (22Deutsch C.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Both the Kir and SUR1 subunits have the cytosolic RKR sequences, which must be masked by the assembly of octamer before channels can be transported to the cell surface (23Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Zarei et al. (24Zarei M.M. Zhu N. Alioua A. Eghbali M. Stefani E. Toro L. J. Biol.

With the help of immunofluorescence and patch clamp techniques, we find that the auxiliary hβ2 subunit cannot traffic to the cell surface without associating with the mslo α subunit. Fortunately, the hβ2 subunit can solely traffic to the cell surface only after demolishing or destroying a four-turn α helical segment of its N terminus (25Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which may implicate a novel trafficking mechanism. We also find that the most accessible region by antibody is located at the middle position of the hβ2 outer loop near the channel filter, suggesting that it may be the important site in regulating the toxin sensitivity and rectification of inactivating BK currents. Constructions and Mutagenesis—The full-length cDNA for each of the mslo α or hβ2 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). For the construct hβ2-Tdimer2, hβ2 cDNA, and Tdimer2 cDNA were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). The BK pore-forming α subunit (mslo) was tagged with the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) at the N terminus. To get a green fluorescence protein targeted ER, pEGFP-ER, the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was used to substitute the DsRed2 in pDsRed2-ER (Clontech). The human β subunits (hβ1/hβ2) were tagged with epitope (c-Myc, EQKLISEEDL; hemagglutinin, YPYDVPDYA) at different positions of the putative extracellular loop by sequential overlap extension PCR. Series of constructs for deletions of the hβ2–137myc N terminus were made by deleting appropriate amino acids from hβ2–137myc and introducing a new start codon with PCR primers. The mutations on hβ2–137myc were created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the constructs and mutations were verified by direct DNA sequence analysis. Immunofluorescence Imaging in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin. The cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, the live cells were transferred to a poly-d-lysine-coated chamber. The next day, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. For cell permeabilization, 0.2% Triton X-100 was added for 5 min. After blocked with 5% goat serum for 1 h, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-human c-Myc antibody (1:200) for 3 h, washed, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:150) for 1 h. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Mouse anti-human c-Myc and fluorescein isothiocyanate rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. We took advantage of the high numeric aperture objective (APO ×100 OHR, NA = 1.65, Olympus) to take high resolution fluorescence images of transfected cells. Excitation light from a fiber optical coupled monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics GmbH, Germany) was passed through a shutter that opened only during camera exposure. The wavelength selection and switch were controlled by the image acquiring software (TILL vision 4.0; Till Photonics GmbH). The images were acquired with a cooled CCD (PCO SensiCam; Germany) with pixel size of 0.067 μm at the specimen plane. Image Analysis and Statistics—Images were viewed, processed, and analyzed in TILL Vision (TILL.Photonics, Germany) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems) and IMAGE J (National Institutes of Health, Public Domain). The exposure time was 2000 ms. Control experiments were executed for each batch of experiments. All of the experiments were performed at there different batches. At each batch, every chamber is normalized to the control. Solutions—HEK293 cells were bathed in ND-96 solution (pH 7.5) containing the following: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm C3H3O3Na (sodium pyruvate), and 10 mm HEPES. For current recording of BK channels, extracellular solution contained the following: 160 mm MeSO3K, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, titrated with MeSO3H; intracellular solution contained the following: 160 mm MeSO3K, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm N-hydroxyethylenediaminetriacetic acid with added Ca2+ for 10 μm free Ca2+ and 5 mm EGTA with no added Ca2+ for 0 μm Ca2+ solution, as defined by the EGTAETC program (McCleskey, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), with the pH adjusted to 7.0, titrated by MeSO3H. All of the chemicals were attained from Sigma. Electrophysiology—Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries with a resistance of 2–4 megohms when filled with pipette solution. Inside-out patches were used in experiments. During recordings, 0 and 10 μm Ca2+ solutions were applied onto the cell via a perfusion pipette containing seven solution channels. All of these experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). The experiments were performed using a PC2C patch clamp amplifier with its software (InBio). The currents were typically digitized at 100 kHz. Macroscopic records were filtered at 5 kHz. Patch clamp recording data were analyzed with IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), Clampfit (Axon Instruments, Inc.), and Sigmaplot (SPSS, Inc.) software. Auxiliary hβ2 Subunits Alone Reside in the ER—The hβ subunits of a four-member β family (hβ1–hβ4) have the similar structure, i.e. with two transmembrane segments, an extra large loop, and a few consensus glycosylation sites (26Behrens R. Nolting A. Reimann F. Schwarz M. Waldschutz R. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The hβ2 subunits like other β subunits have many ways to regulate the mslo BK channels. For example, its extracellular loop alters the conductance and toxin sensitivity of BK channels, but its N terminus introduces a rapid inactivation of BK channels (9Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Savalli N. Kondratiev A. de Quintana S.B. Toro L. Olcese R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Zeng X.H. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The hβ1 subunits have been reported and can traffic to the cell surface alone (14Toro B. Cox N. Wilson R.J. Garrido-Sanabria E. Stefani E. Toro L. Zarei M.M. Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the auxiliary hβ2 subunits also traffic to the plasma membrane as hβ1 subunits do. To investigate the trafficking mechanism of auxiliary hβ2 subunits, a c-Myc epitope was tagged to the center of the loop for measuring the surface expression of hβ2 subunits (Fig. 1A). Considering that recognition signals (export and retention/retrieval) of proteins in the ER are mostly found at the N or C termini, we constructed a series of mutations at the N terminus to investigate the trafficking mechanism of the hβ2 subunits (Fig. 1B). A three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal helix from 18 to 31 is plotted in the Fig. 1C (25Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because coexpression of mslo α and hβ2 subunits can make the inactivating functional BK channels, we expected that images for coexpression of Myc-mslo (green) and hβ2-Tdimer2 (red) should show their coexistence in HEK293 cells. In fact, images for Myc-mslo, hβ2-Tdimer2, and Myc-mslo+hβ2-Tdimer2 show green (left), red (middle), and yellow (right) brims, respectively, which indicates coexistence of two proteins on the cell surface (Fig. 2A). In contrast, there was no red contour distinctly appearing on the cell brim, whereas the hβ2-Tdimer2 was transfected alone in HEK293 cells. The image of coexpression of pEGFP-ER with hβ2-Tdimer2 demonstrates that two proteins coexist in the ER (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, there was no detectable colocalization with coexpression of the hβ2-Tdimer2 with an EGFP-tagged Golgi marker (data not shown) that meant the hβ2 subunit should be retained in ER. Because the Tdimer2 is a protein with more than 450 amino acids, it may influence the traffic of hβ2. To precisely recognize and quantify surface expression of hβ2 subunits, a c-Myc epitope was tagged at the loop. Similarly, the image for coexpression of mslo with hβ2–137myc revealed that the hβ2–137myc subunits were transported to the membrane surface (Fig. 2C, right panel). It is interesting that the surface signals (green) of the hβ2–137myc subunits alone could be detected only under permeabilized conditions (Fig. 2C, left and middle panels). In other words, the green signals were undetectable under nonpermeabilized conditions, whereas the hβ2–137myc subunits were transfected alone in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2C, left panel). In conclusion, a surprising finding is that the hβ2 subunit cannot traffic to the plasma membrane alone except that it expresses with the mslo α subunits together. The hβ2 Subunit Is Restricted in the ER by Four-turn α-Helical Segment—To look for the retention signals of hβ2 subunits, we deleted the C terminus (ΔC) first and then the initial three hydrophobic residues FIW (ΔFIW). In Fig. 3A, mutations ΔC and ΔFIW failed to relieve hβ2 from being retained in ER, but they did traffic to the cell surface after coexpressing with the mslo subunits (data not shown). After deleting the first 10, 20, and 30 amino acids of N terminus, we found that the construct Δ30A was the only one appearing on the cell surface, which illuminates that the retention signals of the hβ2 subunits must be concealed among the residues ranging from 20 to 29. Examining their fractional intensities plotted in Fig. 3D, we further confirmed that only Δ30A could traffic to the cell surface. The constructs Δ23A, Δ26A, and Δ30A were designed to precisely determine the retrieval signal or domain. After gradually decreasing the intensity of retention signals, we determined that the retrieval signal is a motif of 23–29 amino acids (Fig. 3B). To further determine the exact sequence of retention signals, the mutations ΔKIR and ΔDHDL were designed to relieve the retention signal of ER. In Fig. 3B, the construct ΔKIR is clearly a better mutation than the construct ΔDHDL for that purpose. It indicated that the motif KIR played a major role in trapping hβ2 in the ER, which is also consistent with the statistical data of the fractional intensities shown in Fig. 3E. Because alanine-scanning mutations from Q23A to L30A did not show any remarkable surface expression (data not shown), we thus inferred that the motif KIR might be only a core of an expanded sequence. Considering that the motif KIR is located within a four-turn α helical segment ranging from residues 18 to 31 (25Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we tested whether the whole helix served as a retention signal. A series of mutations, i.e. 23A–26A, 24A–26A, 24A–27A, and 23A–27A, were made to flatten the helix (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, mutant Q23P,D27P was constructed to destroy the helix by two prolines, because proline residue is usually thought to promote distortions of transmembrane helices (27Bright J.N. Shrivastava I.H. Cordes F.S. Sansom M.S. Biopolymers. 2002; 64: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). In Fig. 3 (E and F), the expressions of 23A–27A is about 30% more than that of 24A–26A or ΔKIR, which indicates that the motif KIR plays a role in trafficking through its secondary structure. To further demonstrate whether the retention signal is a fixed sequence or a secondary structure, we inserted the QKIRD sequence into the N terminus of hβ1 subunits i.e. QKIRD-hβ1 (Fig. 3, C and G). The mutant QKIRD-hβ1 of hβ1 did not show any clear impact on the surface expression of hβ1 subunits. Therefore, the retention signal of hβ2 subunits is the four-turn helix itself rather than the primary sequence QKIRD. Furthermore, the motif KIR also appears in the βE of the C terminus of mslo subunits (29Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), which is obviously not a retention signal of BK channels. To test whether the retention signal at the N terminus was able to present at other locations of hβ2, we translocated the potential retention signal, i.e. the first 33 amino acids of N terminus, to the C terminus of hβ2 after Arg235 (C33). The C33 alone shows little expression, whereas the mSlo+C33 only shows a little reduction compared with that of the wild type hβ2 (Fig. 4). It means that the same retention signal presents at the new location. We thus believe that the four-turn helix structure at the N terminus is a retention signal of hβ2. Accessibility of the Extracellular Segment of hβ2 for Antibody Varies with Loci of c-Myc Epitope—We first define the c-Myc antibody accessibility at different positions in the outer segment/loop of hβ2. The differential fluorescence intensity of c-Myc antibody at positions in the hβ2 outer loop may arise from either the cysteine-rich and highly glycosylated structure of the loop or restrictions on access of the big antibody molecule to small volumes. The stronger fluorescence intensity means the c-Myc antibody molecule is easier to reach and bind with its antigen through a more spacious pathway. We thus examined the position dependence of antibody accessibility by inserting c-Myc antigen at different sites in the loop, which was used to provide the detailed structural conformation of the extracellular segment of hβ2. In addition to the site Lys137 in the loop, c-Myc epitope was also introduced either at the C terminus or at the sites 72, 76, 114, 126, 158, and 185 in the loop. However, Lys137 is the only site with the clear c-Myc signals in either hβ2 alone or hβ2 with mslo together (Table 1). It is abnormal that we cannot see the c-Myc signals at positions 76 and 158 with coexpression of mslo with hβ2, in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (Table 1). This may suggest that the mslo α subunit can affect the c-Myc accessibility of hβ2.TABLE 1Summary on locations in the P-loop of hβ2 accessible to the c-Myc epitopePosition of c-Myc7276100114126137158185C terminus hβ2 (no Triton) No No No No No No No No No hβ2 (Triton) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes mslo + hβ2 (no Triton) No No No No No Yes No No No mslo + hβ2 (Triton) Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Open table in a new tab To remove the interference of mslo, the construct Δ33A was selected for this purpose. In this construct, the c-Myc epitope was introduced at the positions 76, 100, 114, 126, 137, 158, and 185 in the loop, respectively. In this work, we found that the positions 126 and 137 are two easiest sites for access of antibody based on their fluorescence intensities, whereas β2 expressed alone (Fig. 5 and Table 1). It indicates that the fluorescence signal at position 126 disappears in the coexpression case. Thus, the c-Myc signal of the hβ2 loop can be covered by the α subunit, specially, by the P-loop of S5–S6 while coexpressed with α subunits. Because the higher fractional intensity means the higher accessibility of the loop, the most accessible site was plotted at the highest level of the extracellular loop, the second was plotted at the second highest level, and so on. In this way, the “structural” profile of the extracellualr loop can be depicted in a letter “W,” of which the apex was located around the middle of the loop (Fig. 5C). On the basis of its hydrophobicity plot (9Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the hypothetical topology of hβ2 has two transmembrane domains with a large extracellular loop, of which positions 76 and 185 are just located at the N and C termini of the extracellular loop, respectively. Therefore, they should be the easier sites to be approached by antibody. Moreover, the central part of the loop is usually considered to be difficult to approach because it lays over the channel pore and deep into the cell surface (30Hanner M. Vianna-Jorge R. Kamassah A. Schmalhofer W.A. Knaus H.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16289-16296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Qian X. Nimigean C.M. Niu X. Moss B.L. Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 829-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). According to the above rule of accessibility, the structural profile of the extracellualr loop can be depicted in a letter “M,” of which the valley is around the middle too. To our great surprise, the accessibility plotted in Fig. 5C completely contradicts our expectation. All Mutations of hβ2 Maintain Physiological Functions—Another way for validating the surface expression of mutations is to test currents of all the mslo+mutations by voltage clamp experiments. To make it simpler, the representative traces are only coming from some of the mutations (Fig. 6). Typically, mutations with the initial three hydrophobic residues FIW at their N termini always show a rapid inactivation with a time constant of about 25 ms at 100 mV in 10 μm Ca2+. The rest exhibits the larger inward currents at negative voltages, which indicates that there is a huge negative shift (usually more than 50 mV) in conductance-voltage (G-V) curves relative to the G-V curve of mslo α channels. The above results indicate that the hβ2 including its mutations that we constructed in this study can traffic onto the membrane surface of cells after being functionally associated with mslo α subunits. Among β-subunit trafficking, β1 subunit can traffic to the cell surface alone (14Toro B. Cox N. Wilson R.J. Garrido-Sanabria E. Stefani E. Toro L. Zarei M.M. Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Zarei M.M. Eghbali M. Alioua A. Song M. Knaus H.G. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas β2 subunit can reach the plasma membrane with the α subunit together. Through the biotinylation experiments, Jin et al. (32Jin P. Weiger T.M. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43724-43729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that the β4 subunit could target to the cell membrane based on the existence of double glycosylation sites in β4 subunits. There is no information about trafficking about β3 subunit so far. Furthermore, Zarei et al. (14Toro B. Cox N. Wilson R.J. Garrido-Sanabria E. Stefani E. Toro L. Zarei M.M. Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Zarei M.M. Song M. Wilson R.J. Cox N. Colom L.V. Knaus H.G. Stefani E. Toro L. Neuroscience. 2007; 147: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) observed a putative endocytic signal in the C terminus of the hβ2, which reduced the surface expression of the coexpressed hslo subunits. With polyclonal antibody against β2 subunit using the permeabilized labeling protocol, they found that the hβ2 alone appeared to reach the plasma membrane. We infer that the hβ2 alone stays on the ER membrane just underneath the plasma membrane. In this study, we were attempting to determine a retention motif in hβ2 like the RXR in potassium inward rectifying channel (Kir) and its auxiliary SUR1 (22Deutsch C. Neuron. 2003; 40: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) or the CVLF in BK splice variant (24Zarei M.M. Zhu N. Alioua A. Eghbali M. Stefani E. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16232-16239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There are many reasons against KIR being a retention signal. For instance, the surface expression of Δ29A is more than that of Δ26A; QKIRD-hβ1 or Q23PD27P can traffic to membrane surface. Therefore, the second structure of the hβ2 N-terminus is our exclusive choice. Using NMR spectroscope, Bentrop et al. (25Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) investigated the solution structure of the hβ2 N terminus (amino acids 1–45, BKβ2N). The BKβ2N structure comprises two domains connected by a flexible linker: the ball domain (formed by residues 1–17) and the chain domain (between residues 20–45) linking it to the membrane segment of hβ2. The chain domain consists of a four-turn helix including a 310-helix (between residues 18–31) with an unfolded linker at its C terminus. The BKβ2N with a four-turn helix is a properly folded peptide as it can functionally inactivate BK channels when applied to the cytoplasmic side (25Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results suggest that the retention signal may be derived from protein-protein or protein-lipid mechanism. Because there is no report about the specific anchoring protein of hβ2, we would rather consider a protein-lipid mechanism. From the three-dimensional structure of the four-turn helix shown in Fig. 1C (25Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that the positively charged residues (Lys18, Arg19, and Arg26) were clustering on one side, and the hydrophobic residues (Ile21/Tyr22 and Leu30/Leu31) are lining on each side. Considering that the head group of phospholipid is negatively charged and the tail domain is hydrophobic, we infer that the resultant force coming from electric field and hydrophobic interaction may distort the helix itself to lead the hβ2 subunit coming off the membrane of the ER completely. Furthermore, the positively charged residues Lys and Arg seem to play a crucial role, because the reduction in the number of positively charged residues would somehow weaken the protein-lipid interaction. It is well known that trypsin can attack and cleave any exposed basic residue in the hβ2 N terminus. Zhang et al. (18Zhang Z. Zhou Y. Ding J.P. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11833-11843Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported that the first four basic residues, i.e. Arg8, Arg14, Lys18, and Arg19, had the highest trypsin accessibility of basic residue. During hβ2 assembling with mslo in the ER, the C terminus of mslo α subunit may somehow wrap the N-terminal helix of hβ2 to avoid trypsin attack (18Zhang Z. Zhou Y. Ding J.P. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11833-11843Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, β subunits reciprocally modulate many properties of BK α channels by the loop-loop interaction of α and β subunits. For instance, the BK α+hβ4 channel is becoming very resistant to CTX or IbTX because of the glycosylation in the loop domain of hβ4 subunits, which prevents the access of toxins to the channel vestibule (32Jin P. Weiger T.M. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43724-43729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The outward rectification of BK α+hβ2 channels can be demolished completely by the c-Myc insert hβ2–137myc (data not shown). This study may provide us a new way to understand the interaction of the BK α subunit and β subunit. The extracellular loop of hβ2 plays an important role in preventing the toxin from approaching the pore of BK channels (9Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and producing the rectification of BK channels (19Zeng X.H. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the lack of the structural information about the extracellular loop prevents us from precisely determining the interacting or binding sites between the loop of hβ2 and the pore of BK channels. Our results reveal that three locations at 137, 100, and 185 represent the peak and valleys of accessibility of the extracellular loop, respectively, which may provide us with important clues to explore the interacting or binding sites in the future. In addition, four conserved cysteines influence the rectifying and pharmacological characteristics of BK channels via forming disulfide bridges to constitute a specific structure in the extracellular loop, that can be disrupted by 20 mm extracellular dithiothreitol (19Zeng X.H. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two cysteine mutations (Cys2 and Cys3) were constructed for this purpose, whereas we did not find any changes in accessibility. Hopefully, a complete removal of four conserved cysteines may provide more clues for re-evaluating the accessibility of c-Myc antibody to the extracellular loop in the future. We thank Dr. Z. Q. Xu for valuable comments on the manuscript and Dr. C. L. Lingle for kindly providing us with the β1–β4 clones."
