https://openalex.org/W2112823160,"The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) requires coregulators to bind effectively to response elements in target genes. A strategy of sequential screening of expression libraries with a retinoic acid response element and RAR identified a cDNA encoding a coregulator highly related to RXR alpha. This protein, termed RXR beta, forms heterodimers with RAR, preferentially increasing its DNA binding and transcriptional activity on promoters containing retinoic acid, but not thyroid hormone or vitamin D, response elements. Remarkably, RXR beta also heterodimerizes with the thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors, increasing both DNA binding and transcriptional function on their respective response elements. RXR alpha also forms heterodimers with these receptors. These observations suggest that retinoid X receptors meet the criteria for biochemically characterized cellular coregulators and serve to selectively target the high affinity binding of retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors to their cognate DNA response elements."
https://openalex.org/W2007890001,"Neuronal systems for calcium homeostasis are crucial for neuronal development and function and may also contribute to selective neuronal vulnerability in adverse conditions such as exposure to excitatory amino acids or anoxia, and in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work demonstrated the presence and differential distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the CNS. We now report that a subpopulation of neurons in dissociated cell cultures of embryonic rat hippocampus expresses calbindin-D28k (Mr 28,000 calcium-binding protein) immunoreactivity and that these neurons are relatively resistant to neurotoxicity induced by either glutamate or calcium ionophore. Direct comparisons of dynamic aspects of intracellular calcium levels and calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity in the same neurons revealed that calbindin-D28k-positive neurons were better able to reduce free intracellular calcium levels than calbindin-D28k-negative neurons. These findings indicate that the differential expression of calbindin-D28k in hippocampal neurons occurs early in development and may be one determinant of selective neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxic insults."
https://openalex.org/W2088017195,"NGF and bFGF have recently been shown to have biological activity in central neurons, but their normal functions and mechanisms of action are unknown. Since central neurons are particularly vulnerable to hypoglycemia that occurs with ischemia or insulin overdose, we tested the hypothesis that growth factors can protect neurons against hypoglycemic damage. NGF and bFGF each prevented glucose deprivation-induced neuronal damage in human cerebral cortical and rat hippocampal cell cultures (EGF was ineffective). Protection was afforded when the growth factors were administered before (NGF and bFGF) or up to 12 hr following (NGF) the onset of hypoglycemia. Direct measurements of intracellular calcium levels and manipulations of calcium influx demonstrated that sustained elevations in intracellular calcium levels mediated the hypoglycemic damage. NGF and bFGF each prevented the hypoglycemia-induced elevations of intracellular calcium. These findings indicate that growth factors can stabilize neuronal calcium homeostasis in central neurons and thereby protect them against environmental insults."
https://openalex.org/W2050594447,"Cell-free translation of poliovirus RNA in an extract of uninfected human (HeLa) cells yielded viral proteins through proteolysis of the polyprotein. In the extract, newly synthesized proteins catalyzed poliovirus-specific RNA synthesis, and formed infectious poliovirus de novo. Newly formed virions were neutralized by type-specific antiserum, and infection of human cells with them was prevented by poliovirus receptor-specific antibodies. Poliovirus synthesis was increased nearly 70-fold when nucleoside triphosphates were added, but it was abolished in the presence of inhibitors of translation or viral genome replication. The ability to conduct cell-free synthesis of poliovirus will aid in the study of picornavirus proliferation and in the search for the control of picornaviral disease."
https://openalex.org/W2053964608,"Synaptic transmission was examined in Drosophila mutants deficient in memory function. These mutants, dunce and rutabaga, are defective in different steps of the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) cascade. In both dunce and rutabaga larvae, voltage-clamp analysis of neuromuscular transmission revealed impaired synaptic facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation as well as abnormal responses to direct application of dibutyryl cAMP. In addition, the calcium dependence of transmitter release was shifted in dunce. The results suggest that the cAMP cascade plays a role in synaptic facilitation and potentiation and indicate that synaptic plasticity is altered in Drosophila memory mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2004692311,"In area CA1 of the hippocampus, at least two phases of long-term potentiation (LTP) can be isolated: an early decremental component referred to as short-term potentiation (STP), which precedes a long-lasting, nondecremental component commonly considered to be stable LTP. Utilizing the hippocampal slice preparation, experiments were performed to determine the physiological factors controlling the conversion of STP to LTP. The duration of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic enhancement was influenced by several factors, including the degree of postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation and the magnitude and timing of postsynaptic membrane depolarization during synaptic transmission. It was possible to convert STP to LTP by manipulations that increased the influx of calcium into the postsynaptic cell. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptor activation can result in distinct forms of synaptic potentiation and imply that the magnitude of postsynaptic calcium increase is a critical variable controlling the duration of synaptic enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1982769124,"We have identified a receptor in hepatic endothelial and Kupffer cells that binds oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence SO4-4GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2-Manα (S4GGnM). This receptor can account for the rapid removal of the glycoprotein hormone lutropin, which bears unique Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating in S4GGnM, from the circulation. Hepatic endothelial cells express 579,000 S4GGnM receptors at their surface and bind lutropin with an apparent Kd of 1.63 × 10−7 M. Bound ligand is rapidly internalized. Binding does not require divalent cations, is reversed by incubation at pH 5.0 or below, and is inhibited by fucoidin but not by hyaluronate, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, or dextran sulfate. We propose that the S4GGnM-specific receptor represents a major mechanism for clearance of certain sulfated glycoproteins from the blood, including members of the glycoprotein hormone family."
https://openalex.org/W1517952165,"Activator 1 (A1) is a multiprotein complex which is essential for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) activity and efficient in vitro DNA synthesis in the SV40 dipolymerase replication system. In this report, we describe the isolation of A1 from HeLa cytosolic extracts. A1 stimulated pol delta activity in singly primed phi X174 DNA or (dA)4500.oligo(dT)12-18 in reactions containing PCNA, single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), and ATP. Using this assay, A1 has been extensively purified. Purified preparations contained five discrete subunits of 145, 40, 38, 37, and 36.5 kDa. ATP hydrolysis to ADP and Pi is essential for A1-dependent pol delta activity, and we have shown that A1 contains an intrinsic ATPase which is stimulated by DNA. The DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP can be stimulated by PCNA and further activated by PCNA plus the human single-stranded DNA binding protein. These stimulatory effects were observed with (dA)4500.oligo(dT)12-18, but were not detected with each poly-deoxynucleotide alone. Furthermore, A1 formed a complex with (dA)4500.oligo(dT)12-18 which could be measured by nitrocellulose binding. No complex with (dA)4500 or oligo(dT)12-18 alone was detected by this procedure. Data are also presented which indicate that A1, in conjunction with PCNA, functions as a primer-recognition factor for pol delta, increasing its ability to utilize low levels of primer ends, but it does not increase the size of the DNA products. A1 also markedly reduced the amount of PCNA required for pol delta activity on a multiply primed DNA suggesting that PCNA interacts with A1 at the primer end. These multiple effects of A1 closely resemble the properties of the multisubunit protein RF-C described by Tsurimoto and Stillman (Tsurimoto, T., and Stillman, B. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 1023-1027)."

https://openalex.org/W1540109635,"The binding of agonists and antagonists to the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) is postulated to involve an ionic interaction between the amine group of the ligand and the carboxylate side chain of Asp113 in the third hydrophobic domain of the receptor. To explore the importance of this interaction in the binding of ligands to the beta AR, a Ser residue was substituted for Asp113, and the ability of this mutant receptor to respond to compounds which could potentially interact with the hydroxyl side chain of the Ser residue was assessed. The mutant receptor was fully activated by catechol-containing esters and ketones, compounds which did not activate the wild-type beta AR. The demonstration that the molecular substitution of a single amino acid residue can alter the ligand binding specificity of the beta AR provides evidence that the chemical nature of this residue is a critical determinant in the recognition site of the receptor. Further, the ability to modify the specificity of a receptor by the replacement of amino acids at the binding site demonstrates the potential for the rational design of drugs which function specifically at genetically engineered receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2048505930,"Trains of action potentials evoked rises in presynaptic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) at the squid giant synapse. These increases in [Ca2+]i were spatially nonuniform during the trains, but rapidly equilibrated after the trains and slowly declined over hundreds of seconds. The trains also elicited synaptic depression and augmentation, both of which developed during stimulation and declined within a few seconds afterward. Microinjection of the Ca2+ buffer EGTA into presynaptic terminals had no effect on transmitter release or synaptic depression. However, EGTA injection effectively blocked both the persistent Ca2+ signals and augmentation. These results suggest that transmitter release is triggered by a large, brief, and sharply localized rise in [Ca2+]i, while augmentation is produced by a smaller, slower, and more diffuse rise in [Ca2+]i."

https://openalex.org/W1704017123,"Stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells with oligomeric IgE elicited a rapid and transient phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1 on tyrosine residues. Prior incubation of RBL-2H3 cells with a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, prevented the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 as well as the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate induced by oligomeric IgE. However, 5'-(N-ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine, which is known to activate PLC through a G protein, did not elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. These results, together with previous findings showing that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 enhances its catalytic activity, indicate that phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 by a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase is the mechanism by which IgE receptor aggregation triggers PLC activation."

https://openalex.org/W1545033903,"We have shown recently that the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein annexin V (placental anticoagulant protein I) can be used to study the exposure of anionic phospholipid after platelet activation. In this study we have further examined the mechanism of this process. Collagen-induced exposure of annexin V binding sites correlated directly with increased ability to support activity of the reconstituted prothrombinase complex. The potency of annexin V as an inhibitor of platelet prothrombinase was the same as its Kd for platelets. Prior incubation of platelets with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine or p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate had no significant effect on annexin V binding. Similarly, inhibition of platelet cyclic endoperoxide synthesis by acetylsalicylic acid or indomethacin did not inhibit annexin V binding. Staurosporine inhibited collagen-induced, but not A23187-induced, annexin V binding. Agents that increase intraplatelet cyclic nucleotides partially inhibited collagen-induced annexin V binding. Thus, collagen-induced exposure of anionic phospholipid appears to depend primarily on increases in intraplatelet free calcium and may be independent of ADP- or endoperoxide-mediated pathways. Binding sites for annexin V on microparticles derived from collagen-stimulated platelets were demonstrated by flow cytometry and gel filtration. In addition, prior incubation of platelets with 100 nM annexin V inhibited factor Va binding to both platelets and platelet-derived microparticles. These results support the concept that the procoagulant effect of platelets and platelet-derived microparticles is mediated by calcium-induced exposure of anionic phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2005706099,"The mouse mutants tottering and leaner exhibit neurologic disorders associated, in part, with global noradrenergic hyperinnervation. Therefore, the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA and protein was examined in mutant and control mice. TH expression was normal in the major catecholaminergic nuclei. However, TH was expressed in vermal Purkinje cells of adult mutant but not control mice. TH expression in the Purkinje cells of both mutants was first observed on P21 and persisted throughout adulthood; in contrast, Purkinje cells of normal mice expressed TH transiently during development from P21 to P35. Thus, tottering and leaner mice are deficient in suppressing the normal transient expression of TH in developing Purkinje cells, suggesting that the protein encoded by the tg locus may play a crucial role in neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2046986081,"A point mutation at codon 129 of the murine erythropoietin receptor (cEpoR) results in constitutive activation. We have generated a recombinant spleen focus-forming retrovirus in which the env gene is replaced by the cEpoR cDNA. Mice infected with this virus (but not by viruses expressing the wild-type EpoR) develop erythrocytosis and splenomegaly. From the spleen of infected animals we have isolated clonal, growth factor-independent, proerythroblast cell lines that express cEpoR, do not express the putative oncogene spi-1, and have rearranged and inactivated expression of the p53 suppressor oncogene. These cells induce erythroleukemia upon injection into mice. This demonstrates that oncogenic point mutations exist in a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The activated erythropoietin receptor does not transform cultured fibroblasts, suggesting why oncogenic mutations in other members of this receptor superfamily have not been detected."
https://openalex.org/W1531418845,"In Dictyostelium, chemotaxis to folate during growth and cAMP during aggregation is controlled via cell surface receptors. To study the role of two G alpha proteins (G alpha 1 and G alpha 2) in these responses, we examined the physiological and biochemical effects of null mutations caused by antisense mutagenesis and gene disruptions. Disruption of G alpha 2 results in an aggregation-deficient phenotype and a loss of cAMP receptor-mediated functions, including activation of adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase, and gene expression and in a loss of GTP-mediated decrease in receptor affinity for cAMP, but it has no effect on chemotaxis to folate or folate activation of guanylate cyclase. These phenotypes can be rescued by a vector expressing G alpha 2, suggesting G alpha 2 is coupled to a cAMP receptor but not to folate receptors. Loss of G alpha 1 expression resulted in no visible growth or developmental phenotype, including cAMP- and folate-stimulated responses, suggesting G alpha 1 function is either not essential under standard laboratory conditions or is encoded by multiple genes. Availability of null mutations provides suitable genetic backgrounds for expressing mutant G alpha protein subunits which can then be used to examine the physiological roles of G alpha 1 and G alpha 2. Construction of these gene disruptions was facilitated by using the auxotrophic marker THY1, which allowed for selection of single-copy insertions into the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1578213890,"Two distinct cDNAs encoding proteins with 84% sequence identity have been isolated for human IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205) (Natsumeda, Y., Ohno, S., Kawasaki, H., Konno, Y., Weber, G., and Suzuki, K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5292-5295), an important target in antileukemic chemotherapy. We constructed expression plasmids containing these cDNAs in full length with pUC plasmids and produced lacZ'-IMP dehydrogenase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Both synthesized proteins exhibited IMP dehydrogenase activity and were partially separated from endogenous E. coli IMP dehydrogenase. By injecting the fusion proteins into mice we generated a polyclonal antibody specific to type I IMP dehydrogenase and an antibody which reacted with both types. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the total amounts of types I and II enzymes increased in human leukemic cell lines K562 and HL-60 in agreement with the increase in IMP dehydrogenase activity to 7.8- and 9.4-fold, respectively, above that of normal lymphocytes. The extent of expression of type I IMP dehydrogenase was similar in these cells, however, indicating that the increase in IMP dehydrogenase amount in leukemic cells was due to specific up-regulation of type II enzyme. Northern blot analysis also showed specific and predominant expression of type II in the leukemic cells. Thus, de novo GTP biosynthesis may be controlled differently in normal and neoplastic cells by different IMP dehydrogenase molecular species."
https://openalex.org/W2037170540,"The targeting of proteins to mitochondria involves the recognition of the precursor proteins by receptors on the mitochondrial surface followed by insertion of the precursors into the outer membrane at the general insertion site GIP. Most mitochondrial proteins analyzed so far use a mitochondrial outer membrane protein of 19 kilodaltons (MOM19) as an import receptor. The gene encoding MOM19 has now been isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that MOM19 is anchored in the outer membrane by an NH2-terminal hydrophobic sequence, while the rest of the protein forms a hydrophilic domain exposed to the cytosol. MOM19 was targeted to the mitochondria via a pathway that is independent of protease-accessible surface receptors and controlled by direct assembly of the MOM19 precursor with GIP."
https://openalex.org/W2071971527,"Developing cultured hippocampal neurons were studied for the expression of GABAA receptor subunits using anti-peptide antibodies. The antibodies decorated the plasma membrane of cell bodies and all neurites in immature neurons, whereas the immunoreactivity was restricted to somata and dendrites in fully developed cells. Most receptor subunits were expressed throughout the entire culture period. However, the α1 and γ2 subunits were detected only late in culture, while α6 disappeared around this time. These findings were partly corroborated by in situ hybridization data in the developing rat hippocampus. Our results reveal a temporal control of gene expression for subsets of receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons and suggest a change in the subunit composition of GABAA receptors in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W2087181210,"mRNA made in eukaryotic cells typically has a 3′ poly(A) tail that is added posttranscriptionally. To investigate mechanisms by which 3′ poly(A) is formed, we identified the genes for the two vaccinia virus-encoded polypetides, VP55 and VP39. Primer-dependent polyadenylation activity was associated exclusively with purified VP55-VP39 heterodimer, which, although stable to column chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation, was readily dissociated by antibody to an N-terminal peptide of VP55. Poly(A) polymerase activity was associated with immunopurified VP55, but not with immunopurified of chromatographically purified VP39. VP39 was, however, required for the formation of long poly(A) molecules, in conjunction with either purified VP55 or low concentrations of the heterodimer, and was shown to bind free poly(A). Thus, a catalytic polypeptide and a dissociable poly(A)-binding stimulatory factor each contribute to poly(A) tail formation. No prokaryotic or eukaryotic homologs of either polypeptide were detected in sequence data bases, consistent with the absence of previously reported poly(A) polymerase genes from any source."
https://openalex.org/W1784526106,"Novel methods for the isolation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor alpha subunit iso-oligomers have been developed. Thus, populations of GABAA receptors containing the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit, the alpha 2 subunit, and the alpha 3 subunit have been purified from sodium deoxycholate extracts of bovine cerebral cortex with the retention of specific [3H]flunitrazepam-binding activity by anti-alpha 1 324-341, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424, or anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibody affinity chromatography, respectively. The relative abundance of the different specificity alpha subunits in these preparations was compared with benzodiazepine affinity chromatography-purified GABAA receptors by immunoblotting. In each case, it was found that although the immunoreactivity with the specific alpha subunit antibody that was used for purification was enriched in immunoaffinity-purified receptors, reactivity with the other alpha subunit specificity antibodies, together with anti-gamma 2 1-14 Cys immunoreactivity was found. Immunoprecipitation of GABAA receptors purified by anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibody affinity chromatography by all three anti-alpha subunit antibodies employed, together with the use of anti-alpha 1 324-341 and anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424 antibody affinity columns in series, further substantiated the partial co-purification of the different polypeptides. These results demonstrate the copurification of the gamma 2 subunit with each population of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 subunit-enriched GABAA receptors. They also show the existence of minor populations of GABAA receptors that contain alpha 1 alpha 2, alpha 1 alpha 3, and alpha 2 alpha 3 subunit pairs within single oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W2055817678,"In the mollusk Aplysia the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) has a fundamental modulatory role in several forms of learning and memory that involve an increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission between tail sensory neurons (SNs) and motor neurons. The classical 5HT antagonist cyproheptadine (CYP) permits dissociation of three forms of serotonergic modulation in these SNs: (i) CYP reversibly blocks spike-broadening induced either by exogenous application of 5HT or by sensitizing stimulation of a tail nerve. (ii) CYP does not block 5HT-induced or tail input-induced increases in SN somatic excitability. (iii) Concomitant with its block of spike-broadening, CYP reversibly blocks 5HT-induced facilitation of synaptic transmission from SNs. These results suggest that endogenously released 5HT may act at different receptor subtypes that are coupled to different forms of neuromodulation in tail SNs of Aplysia."
https://openalex.org/W2064020921,"Receptors that transmit signals across cell membranes are typically composed of multiple subunits. To test whether subunit interactions are required for transmembrane signaling by the bacterial aspartate receptor, dimers were constructed with (i) two full-length subunits, (ii) one full-length subunit and one subunit lacking the cytoplasmic domain, or (iii) one full-length subunit and one subunit lacking both the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains. Methylation of the cytoplasmic domain of all three receptor constructs was stimulated by the binding of aspartate. These findings demonstrate that transmembrane signaling does not require interactions between cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of adjacent subunits and suggest that signaling occurs via conformational changes transduced through a single subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1525671373,"Two site-specific antibodies have been prepared by immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized peptides derived from the partial cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), which has been proposed to encode the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) kinase (Boulton, T. G., Yancopoulos, G. D., Gregory, J. S., Slauer, C., Moomaw, C., Hsu, J., and Cobb, M. H. (1990) Science 249, 64-67). With immunoprecipitation in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Western blotting, an antibody to the peptide containing triple tyrosine residues (alpha Y91) resembling one of the insulin receptor autophosphorylation sites specifically recognized 42- and 44-kDa proteins. On the other hand, an antibody to the peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus portions (alpha C92) of the ERK1 cDNA gene product recognized the 44-kDa protein much more efficiently than the 42-kDa protein. With immunoprecipitation in the absence of SDS, alpha Y91 could barely recognize these two proteins and alpha C92 recognized the 44-kDa protein but failed to recognize the 42-kDa protein. Kinase assays in myelin basic protein (MBP)-containing gel, after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that insulin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated MBP kinase activity in alpha Y91 immunoprecipitates comigrated at molecular mass 42 and 44 kDa. On the other hand, the stimulated MBP kinase activity in alpha C92 immunoprecipitates comigrated only at molecular mass 44 kDa. Insulin stimulated the MBP kinase activity in gels and phosphorylation of these two proteins by greater than 10-fold with a maximal level at 5 min. Insulin and TPA rapidly stimulate the phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins via de novo threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping analysis of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins, respectively, revealed a single major phosphopeptide containing phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine, which was common to both insulin- and TPA-stimulated phosphoproteins. Protein phosphatase 2A treatment of these two phosphoproteins caused a complete loss of kinase activity with selective dephosphorylation of phosphothreonine. These data strongly suggest that these two proteins are highly related to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa (Ray, L. B., and Sturgill, T. W. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 3753-3757) and that these two immunologically similar but distinct MBP/MAP2 kinases may represent isozymic forms of MBP/MAP2 kinases. These data also demonstrate that insulin and TPA activate MBP/MAP2 kinase activity by de novo phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues via a very similar pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1601147662,"Covalently cross-linked multimers of lipocortin I are shown to be present in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells treated with epidermal growth factor or the calcium ionophore A23187. This intracellular cross-linking of lipocortin I is suggested to be mediated by the action of tissue transglutaminase, a Ca2(+)-dependent protein cross-linking enzyme. Cross-linking of lipocortin I competes with proteolytic digestion of the protein, and pretreatment of the cells with inhibitors for calpain (Ca2(+)-dependent intracellular protease) markedly enhanced the cross-linking of lipocortin I. Cross-linked lipocortin I is shown to be present in the soluble fraction of A431 cells as well as in the particulate fraction; a 34-kDa fragment of lipocortin I was solubilized successfully by plasmin digestion of the latter fraction. Immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antilipocortin-I antibody showed that cross-linked lipocortin I forms an envelope-like structure, which is not extracted with [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or Triton X-100. In vitro incubation of purified lipocortin I with tissue transglutaminase resulted in the formation of covalently cross-linked lipocortin I dimer, tetramer, and so on. Amine incorporation and cross-linking studies using lipocortin I and its N-terminal truncated derivatives indicated that the cross-linking site is localized within the plasmin-susceptible N-terminal 29 amino acids of lipocortin I. The cross-linking of lipocortin I is shown to be accelerated more than 10 times by the addition of phosphatidylserine vesicles, on which lipocortin I molecules are most likely aligned in a conformation suitable for cross-linking. Collectively, these findings suggest that an increase of intracellular calcium concentration results in the attachment of lipocortin I onto the plasma membrane phospholipids through the C-terminal domain of the molecule where the membrane-bound lipocortin I is cross-linked by the action of tissue transglutaminase through the N-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1513607171,"The addition of norepinephrine, epinephrine, or forskolin to collagenase-dispersed rat liver hepatocytes increase cAMP and result in a 15% loss in total cell Mg2+ within 5 min. Conversely, carbachol and vasopressin induce a 10-15% increase of total cell Mg2+. Permeabilized hepatocytes also mobilize a large pool of Mg2+ when stimulated by ADP or cAMP. This stimulation is completely inhibited by atractyloside and bongkrekic acid, two different specific inhibitors of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase. cAMP directly mobilizes Mg2+ efflux from isolated rat liver mitochondria. 50 nM cAMP or 250 microM ADP induces in 5 min a mitochondrial loss of about 6 nmol of Mg2+/mg of protein and a stimulation of ATP efflux. The effect of cAMP is specific, is not reproduced by other cyclic or noncyclic nucleotides, and is inhibited by inhibitors of the adenine nucleotide translocase. These data indicate that cAMP is a messenger for a major mobilization of Mg2+ in hepatocytes. A major target for the effect of cAMP are mitochondria, which lose up to 20-25% of their total Mg2+ in 5 min, both within the cell and after isolation. Evidence is presented suggesting that the adenine nucleotide translocase is the target of the cAMP-dependent Mg2+ efflux and that cAMP may change the operation of the translocase. This, in turn, could change within the matrix the substrate of choice of the translocase from ATP to ATP.Mg."
https://openalex.org/W1545396114,"Prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) is a widely distributed acidic protein whose function has been related to cell proliferation. We have analyzed the expression of the rat ProT alpha gene in several proliferative systems: concanavalin A (ConA)/interleukin-2-stimulated thymocytes, ConA-stimulated splenic T-lymphocytes, and hepatocytes proliferating during liver regeneration. In these systems, ProT alpha mRNA was detected in all stages of the cell cycle, with maximal increments (2-4-fold) at the beginning of the S phase. By contrast, the mRNAs for proliferating cell nuclear antigen/cyclin and histone H3, two cell-cycle-regulated proteins, were hardly detected in resting cells but increased notably at the G1/S boundary and in the S phase, respectively. Treatment of T-cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 increased ProT alpha mRNA levels 2.5-fold, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, had no effect on ProT alpha gene expression. Incubation of ConA-stimulated T-cells with hydroxyurea, a DNA synthesis inhibitor, did not decrease the levels of ProT alpha mRNA, indicating that its expression is independent of DNA synthesis. These findings suggest that ProT alpha is required throughout all the stages of the cell cycle, resembling a constitutively expressed gene rather than one strictly involved in cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1529215510,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase contains two different cAMP-binding sites referred to as the slow and fast sites. Mutation of Ala-334 to a threonine in the slow site of the bovine type I regulatory subunit created a site with marked increase in cGMP affinity without changing cAMP affinity (Shabb, J. B., Ng. L., Corbin, J. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16031-16034). The corresponding fast site residue (Ala-210) was changed to a threonine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and a double mutant containing a threonine in each site was also made. Holoenzymes were formed from native catalytic subunit and each recombinant regulatory subunit. The fast site mutant holoenzyme exhibited an improved cGMP activation constant and an impaired cAMP activation constant. The double mutant cGMP/cAMP selectivity was 200-fold greater than that of wild-type holoenzyme, making it as responsive to cGMP as native cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The increased intrinsic binding energies of mutated sites for cGMP were 2.7-3.0 kcal mol-1, consistent with the presence of an extra hydrogen bond. Cyclic nucleotide analog studies implied that this hydrogen bond was between the threonine hydroxyl and the 2-amino of cGMP. Comparisons of amino acid sequences and cyclic nucleotide specificities suggested that the Ala/Thr difference may also impart cAMP/cGMP binding selectivity to related proteins such as cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2009295852,"Membrane depolarization relieves the G protein-mediated inhibition or block of high threshold Ca2+ channel currents. We found that the net rate of reblocking depended on the extent of G protein activation. With low intracellular concentrations of GTP gamma S reblocking rates resembled inactivation rates; with higher concentrations reblocking rates increased progressively. Reblocking kinetics were fit with a sum of two exponential functions having time constants (in ms) tau F greater than or equal to 10 and tau S greater than or equal to 30. Unblock during depolarization was fit by a single exponential function with time constant tau A similar to tau F. A model was developed in which unblocking followed dissociation of a blocking molecule, possibly the G protein itself, from Ca2+ channels, and reblocking occurred at rates that depended on the concentration of the blocking molecule. The time course of Ca2+ entry and thus presynaptic Ca2+ levels can be regulated by both the concentration of the G-protein-dependent blocking particle and membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1595635303,"Porcine liver DNA polymerase gamma was shown previously to copurify with an associated 3' to 5' exonuclease activity (Kunkel, T. A., and Mosbaugh, D. W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 988-995). The 3' to 5' exonuclease has now been characterized, and like the DNA polymerase activity, it has an absolute requirement for a divalent metal cation (Mg2+ or Mn2+), a relatively high NaCl and KCl optimum (150-200 mM), and an alkaline pH optimum between 7 and 10. The exonuclease has a 7.5-fold preference for single-stranded over double-stranded DNA, but it cannot excise 3'-terminal dideoxy-NMP residues from either substrate. Excision of 3'-terminally mismatched nucleotides was preferred approximately 5-fold over matched 3' termini, and the hydrolysis product from both was a deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. The kinetics of 3'-terminal excision were measured at a single site on M13mp2 DNA for each of the 16 possible matched and mismatched primer.template combinations. As defined by the substrate specificity constant (Vmax/Km), each of the 12 mismatched substrates was preferred over the four matched substrates (A.T, T.A, C.G, G.C). Furthermore, the exonuclease could efficiently excise internally mismatched nucleotides up to 4 residues from the 3' end. DNA polymerase gamma was not found to possess detectable DNA primase, endonuclease, 5' to 3' exonuclease, RNase, or RNase H activities. The DNA polymerase and exonuclease activities exhibited dissimilar rates of heat inactivation and sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. After nondenaturing activity gel electrophoresis, the DNA polymerase and 3' to 5' exonuclease activities were partially resolved and detected in situ as separate species. A similar analysis on a denaturing activity gel identified catalytic polypeptides with molecular weights of 127,000, 60,000, and 32,000 which possessed only DNA polymerase gamma activity. Collectively, these results suggest that the polymerase and exonuclease activities reside in separate polypeptides, which could be derived from separate gene products or from proteolysis of a single gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1527359679,"Mutations in the norpA gene drastically affect the phototransduction process in Drosophila. To study the biochemical characteristics of the norpA protein and its cellular and subcellular distributions, we have generated antisera against the major gene product of norpA. The antisera recognize an eye-specific protein of 130-kDa relative molecular mass that is present in wild-type head extracts but not in those of strong norpA mutants. The protein is associated with membranes and can be extracted with high salt. Immunohistochemical analysis at the light and electron microscopic levels indicates that the protein is expressed in all adult photoreceptor cells and specifically localized within the rhabdomeres, preferentially adjacent to, but not within, the rhabdomeric membranes. The results of the present study strongly support the previous suggestion that the norpA gene encodes the major phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C in the photoreceptors. Moreover, insofar as the rhabdomeres are specialized structures for photoreception and phototransduction, specific localization of the norpA protein within these structures, in close association with the membranes, is consistent with the proposal that it has an important role in phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1657488732,"Hepatocytes rapidly internalize epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transferrin by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Both EGF and its receptor are thought to be targeted for destruction in lysosomes, leading to down-regulation of the receptor, whereas transferrin, after unloading iron within the cell, is thought to recycle to the cell surface bound to its receptor. Previously, we isolated three endosomal fractions from livers of estradiol-treated rats and examined their roles in cellular trafficking of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and the LDL receptor, which cycles constitutively (Belcher, J. D., Hamilton, R. L., Brady, S. E., Hornick, C. A., Jackle, S., Schneider, W. J., and Havel, R. J., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1987) 84, 6785-6789). In the current study we have taken advantage of the distinct trafficking of the EGF receptor and transferrin to evaluate further the functions of these endosome fractions. Intravenous injection of a saturating amount of EGF into estradiol-treated rats induced internalization of a single population of EGF receptors, which rapidly accumulated in the endosome fraction of intermediate density (compartment of uncoupling of receptor and ligand (CURL)) and subsequently in the low density endosome fraction (multivesicular bodies (MVBs)). The high density endosome fraction, whose membranes contain a high concentration of recycling receptors (designated receptor-recycling compartment (RRC)), failed to accumulate EGF receptors after injection of EGF. In livers of rats not given exogenous EGF, EGF receptors were found in small but comparable concentrations in RRC, CURL, and MVB membranes, consistent with other evidence that targeting of the EGF receptor to lysosomes is mediated by ligand-induced phosphorylation. Transferrin also accumulated first in CURL and later in MVBs, but it also accumulated rapidly in the RRC fraction, consistent with the proposed function of this fraction in receptor recycling. Since transferrin is not degraded during its endocytic cycle, these observations indicate that apotransferrin and its receptor recycle from late endosomes (MVBs) located at the apical pole of hepatocytes, as well as from early endosomes near the sinusoidal pole."
https://openalex.org/W1512443688,"The proposed Ca(2+)-signaling actions of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), formed by phosphorylation of the primary Ca(2+)-mobilizing messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), were analyzed in NIH 3T3 and CCL39 fibroblasts transfected with rat brain Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase. In such kinase-transfected cells, the conversion of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 during agonist stimulation was greatly increased, with a concomitant reduction in Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels and attenuation of both the cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase and the Ca2+ influx response. This reduction in Ca2+ signaling was observed during activation of receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (thrombin and bradykinin), as well as with those possessing tyrosine kinase activity. Single-cell Ca2+ measurements in CCL39 cells revealed that the smaller averaged Ca2+ response of enzyme-transfected cells was due to a marked increase in the number of cells expressing small and slow Ca2+ increases, in contrast to the predominantly large and rapid Ca2+ responses of vector-transfected controls. There was no evidence that high Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 levels promote Ca2+ mobilization, Ca2+ entry, or Ca2+ sequestration. These data indicate that Ins(1,4,5)P3 is the major determinant of the agonist-induced Ca2+ signal in fibroblasts and that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 does not appear to contribute significantly to this process. Instead, Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase may serve as a negative regulator of the Ca(2+)-phosphoinositide signal transduction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1546649912,"Abstract The origin binding protein (OBP) of herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is essential for viral DNA replication, binds specifically to sequences within the viral replication origin(s) (for a review, see Challberg, M.D., and Kelly, T. J. (1989) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 58, 671-717). Using either a COOH-terminal OBP protein A fusion or the full-length protein, each expressed in Escherichia coli, we investigated the interaction of OBP with one HSV origin, OriS. Binding of OBP to a set of binding site variant sequences demonstrates that the 10-base pair sequence, 5' CGTTCGCACT 3', comprises the OBP-binding site. This sequence must be presented in the context of at least 15 total base pairs for high affinity binding, Ka = approximately 0.3 nM. Single base pair mutations in the central CGC sequence lower the affinity by several orders of magnitude, whereas a substitution at any of the other seven positions reduces the affinity by 10-fold or less. OBP binds with high affinity to duplex DNA containing mismatched base pairs. This property is exploited to analyze OBP binding to DNA heteroduplexes containing singly substituted mutant and wild-type DNA strands. For positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, substitutions are tolerated on one or the other DNA strand, indicating that base-mediated interactions are limited to one base of each pair. For both Boxes I and II, these interactions are localized to one face of the DNA helix, forming a recognition surface in the major groove. In OriS, the 31 base pairs which separate Boxes I and II orient the two interaction surfaces to the same side of the DNA."

Quantitative mass analysis by anion-exchange HPLC and a recently developed postcolumn dye system (Mayr, G. W. (1988) Biochem. J. 254, 585-591) revealed basal intracellular concentrations between less than 5 pmol/10(9) cells for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and 6380 +/- 355 pmol/10(9) cells for InsP6. Time course analysis of samples from stimulated Jurkat T-cells showed an increase of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to 1125 +/- 125 pmol/10(9) cells within 10 min and remained elevated over more than 30 min. Moreover, increases of the intracellular concentrations of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, and/or Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (determined as the enantiomeric mixture), Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P5 and InsP6 were observed. In contrast, the concentration of Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 and/or Ins(2,3,4,5,6)P5 (determined as the enantiomeric mixture) decreased after stimulation. Using cytosolic extracts from Jurkat T-lymphocytes incubated with purified Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P5, or Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5/Ins(2,3,4,5,6)P5 three enzyme activities were observed. Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was dephosphorylated by a phosphatase removing a phosphate group at the 1 and/or 3 position resulting in the formation of Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 and/or Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (determined as the enantiomeric mixture). Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P5 was metabolized by a specific phosphatase that cleaved the phosphate group at the 2 position, thereby generating the product Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. On the other hand, Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5/Ins(2,3,4,5,6)P5 was phosphorylated by a 1/3-kinase activity to InsP6. Together novel receptor-mediated metabolic pathways of inositol polyphosphates were demonstrated in human T-lymphocytes, and corresponding enzyme activities for the inositol pentakisphosphate metabolism were found in cell lysates."
https://openalex.org/W1010635479,"The involvement of endogenous diacylglycerol production in the stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by exogenous phospholipase C was examined using a neuroblastoma (LA-N-2) cell line. Phospholipase C treatment (0.1 unit/ml) of intact cells stimulated CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity significantly more effectively than did maximally effective concentrations of the synthetic diacylglycerol sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (1 mM). When added to cells together with phospholipase C, oleic acid, but not dioctanoylglycerol, further increased cytidylyltransferase activity with respect to phospholipase C treatment alone, indicating that the enzyme was not maximally activated by the lipase. This suggests that the lack of additivity of diacylglycerol and phospholipase C reflects a common mechanism of action. The time course of activation of cytidylyltransferase by phospholipase C paralleled that of [3H]diacylglycerol production in cells prelabeled for 24 h with [3H]oleic acid. Diacylglycerol mass was similarly increased. Significant elevations of [3H]oleic acid and total fatty acids occurred later than did the increases in cytidylyltransferase activity and diacylglycerol levels. No significant reduction in total or [3H]phosphatidylcholine was elicited by this concentration of phospholipase C, but higher concentrations (0.5 unit/ml) significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine content. The stimulation of cytidylyltransferase activity by phospholipase C or dioctanoylglycerol was also associated with enhanced incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline into phosphatidylcholine. Dioctanoylglycerol was more effective than phospholipase C at stimulating the formation of [14C]phosphatidylcholine, and the effects of the two treatments were additive. However, further analysis revealed that dioctanoylglycerol served as a precursor for [14C]dioctanoylphosphatidylcholine as well as an activator of cytidylyltransferase; and when corrections were made for this effect, the apparent additivity disappeared. The results indicate that the generation of diacylglycerol by exogenous phospholipase C (and possibly the subsequent production of fatty acids via diacylglycerol metabolism) activates cytidylyltransferase activity in neuronal cells under conditions in which membrane phosphatidylcholine content is not measurably reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2167403731,"The effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on the trafficking of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor within the endocytic route was analyzed. Treatment with BFA induced a redistribution of the receptor to the cell surface and increased both the binding and internalization of ligands 2-4-fold. The effect of BFA was dose- and time-dependent and reversible. Determinations of transport rates showed that BFA increases the internalization rate and the externalization rate of the receptor. This implies that the higher surface concentration is due to higher concentrations of receptor at the intracellular sites from where they recycle to the cell surface. The effect of BFA was additive to the redistribution induced by insulin-like growth factors I and II and was observed in all human and rodent cell lines analyzed. BFA increased also the cell surface expression of the Mr 46,000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor but not of the transferrin receptor. The results indicate that BFA interferes with the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors and affects the endocytosis of lysosomal enzymes by increasing the number of receptors available for recycling to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1570105893,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is thought to mediate the transport of anti-cancer drugs and to be responsible for the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype in tumor cells. However, the function of P-gp in normal tissues is still not well understood. We present evidence indicating that the active efflux of several structurally unrelated organic compounds is mediated by P-gp in multidrug-resistant KB (KB-C2) cells and that these compounds interact with P-gp in the kidney and adrenal gland. The photoactive radioactive calcium channel blocker [3H]azidopine labels a protein of approximately 140 kDa in crude membrane fractions from human kidney and adrenal gland and a 130-kDa protein from bovine adrenal gland. These photolabeled proteins are immunoprecipitated with an anti-P-gp antibody. Photolabeling is inhibited by vinblastine, reserpine, and several other organic chemicals. These data indicate that the kidney and adrenal gland express P-gp (or a protein closely related to P-gp) that can interact with several organic compounds and that the P-gp expressed in these tissues has a drug-binding site similar to that of P-gp in KB-C2 cells. Our findings thus strongly support the hypothesis that P-gp can transport a wide variety of organic chemicals as well as anti-cancer drugs and that one of the physiological functions of P-gp is the excretion of certain classes of organic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2089590130,"Neuron B19 of Helisoma is selective in synaptogenesis. Presynaptic mechanisms underlying this selectivity were tested. Acetylcholine-sensitive assay cells were micromanipulated into contact with B19 somata to assess its secretory state. Prior to appropriate muscle target contact, spontaneous synaptic currents were detected; however, action potential-evoked release of neurotransmitter was detected only following hours of muscle contact. Photolysis of a calcium cage, DM-nitrophen, accelerated the frequency of synaptic currents in muscle-contacted, but not novel neuron-contacted, B19 somata. These studies demonstrate that contact with appropriate target muscle enhances the responsiveness of this neuron's secretory machinery to internal calcium levels, thereby imparting the presynaptic cell with the ability to couple action potentials with neurotransmitter release."

Immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that IGF-1 induced a transient increase in immunoreactive phosphotyrosine in nuclear proteins of 43, 95, and 160 kDa. Using a double immunoprecipitation protocol, the transcription factor c-Jun was also found to increase in immunoreactive phosphotyrosine in response to IGF-1. A similar pattern of tyrosyl phosphorylation of nuclear proteins was observed in the epidermoid carcinoma cell line CaSki. These data suggest that tyrosyl phosphorylation of nuclear proteins may be a step in the transduction of mitogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1602340775,"Inhibitors for glutathione S-transferase (GST) iso-enzymes from rat liver with high affinity for the glutathione-binding site (G-site) have been developed. In previous studies, a model was described for the G-site of GST (Adang, A. E. P., Brussee, J., van der Gen, A., and Mulder, G. J. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 47-54) in terms of essential and nonessential interactions between groups in glutathione (GSH) and the G-site. Based on this model, compounds were designed that have high affinity for the G-site but cannot be conjugated. In the dipeptide gamma-L-glutamyl-D-aminoadipic acid (gamma-L-Glu-D-Aad), the L-cysteinylglycine moiety is replaced by D-aminoadipic acid. This dipeptide is an efficient competitive inhibitor (toward GSH) of mu class GST isoenzymes with Ki values of 34 microM for GST isoenzyme 3-3 and 8 microM for GST isoenzyme 4-4. Other GSH-dependent enzymes, such as gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase, were not inhibited by 1 mM of gamma-L-Glu-D-Aad. Inhibition is also highly stereospecific since gamma-L-Glu-L-Aad is only a poor inhibitor (Ki = 430 microM for GST 3-3). Gamma-L-Glutamyl-D-norleucine also had a much higher Ki value for GST 3-3. Thus, the presence of a delta-carboxylate group in D-Aad appears to be essential for a high affinity inhibitor. An additional hydrophobic group did not result in increased inhibitory potency. In a different approach, the gamma-L-glutamyl moiety in GSH was replaced by delta-L-aminoadipic acid; delta-L-Aad-L-Cys-Gly is an efficient cosubstrate analogue for GSTs with Km values comparable to GSH and Vmax values ranging from 0.24 to 57 mumol/min/mg for the different GSTs. The structures of the efficient inhibitor and the cosubstrate analogue were combined in delta-L-Aad-D-Aad, which had a Ki value of 68 microM with GST 3-3. In order to investigate their possible use in vivo studies, the degradation of gamma-L-Glu-D-Aad and delta-L-Aad-L-Cys-Gly by gamma-GT was investigated. The peptides showed no measurable hydrolysis rates under conditions where GSH was rapidly hydrolyzed. Thus, an efficient, mu class-specific GST inhibitor and a gamma-glutamyl-modified cosubstrate analogue of GSH were developed. Their gamma-GT stability offers the possibility to use these peptides in in vivo experiments."

Chem. 266, 24149-24160) we demonstrated that the segment of the apolipoprotein B promoter extending from -260 to -85 is functionally different in hepatic (HepG2) and intestinal (CaCo-2) cells. These functional differences could be explained at least in part by differences in binding of three nuclear proteins to the region from -111 to -88. In this article we present further evidence suggesting that the mechanisms involved in transcriptional control of the apolipoprotein B gene in HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells are different, by demonstrating that an enhancer and a reducer can alter the activity of various apolipoprotein B promoter segments in widely differing ways in these two cell lines. Furthermore, we have localized a 329-base pair segment that is found within a negative regulatory region in the 5' distal portion of the gene. It displays a strong reducer effect upon promoter sequences that exhibit maximal transcriptional activity in CaCo-2 cells, but not in HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1506107723,"Forty-eight hours after partial (approximately 67%) hepatectomy the activity of the particulate guanylate cyclase was increased by 2-fold in the regenerating rat liver. This increase was not an artifact of membrane isolation procedures, and as determined by 125I-labeled Tyr-28 atrial natriuretic hormone-(1-28) ANF binding, was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the number of ANF receptors. The Kd of the receptors in membranes of regenerating livers was not significantly different from the Kd of the receptors in livers of sham-operated rats. The linear synthetic descysteine analog of ANF, analog I, which binds only to the 66-kDa receptors, displaced approximately 40% of the specifically bound 125I-ANF in liver membranes from both hepatectomized and sham-operated (control) animals. Affinity cross-linking studies with 125I-ANF confirmed the increase in the 116-kDa ANF receptor in membranes of regenerating livers. In perfused livers derived from control and hepatectomized animals, the basal rates of cGMP production were not significantly different. However, atriopeptin II-stimulated cGMP production was twice as great in regenerating livers as compared with controls. These data demonstrate that the increase in particulate guanylate cyclase activity observed during liver regeneration is due to an increase in the 116-kDa ANF receptor-associated activity. Additionally, our data demonstrate that the regenerating rat liver may be a valuable model with which to study the role of the hepatic ANF receptor/particulate guanylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1762256219,"Activation of the complement cascade with the generation of anaphylatoxins accompanies the inflammatory response elicited by acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Although complement is activated in the interstitium during acute myocardial ischemia, we have studied mechanisms whereby complement might exacerbate ischemia by using a model employing intracoronary injection of C5a in nonischemic hearts. Intracoronary injection of complement component C5a induces transient myocardial ischemia, mediated through the production of the coronary vasoconstrictors thromboxane A2 and peptidoleukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4), and causes sequestration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the coronary vascular bed. To further investigate the role of the PMN in the C5a-induced vasoconstriction, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in pigs was perfused at constant pressure and measurements of coronary blood flow, myocardial contractile function (sonomicrometry), arterial/coronary venous blood PMN count, and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels were performed. The myocardial response to intracoronary C5a (500 ng) was determined before, during, and after perfusion with blood depleted of PMNs using leukocyte filters (Sepacell R-500, Pall PL-100). In additional animals, the myocardial response to the PMN chemotactic agent, LTB4, and the effects of intracoronary C5a during constant flow perfusion were measured. Control intracoronary injection of C5a decreased flow (41% of baseline) and contractile function (39% of baseline), PMNs were trapped (5.1 x 10(3) cells/microliters), and TxB2 concentration increased in coronary venous blood. The response to C5a during coronary perfusion with arterial blood depleted of PMNs with Sepacell or Pall filters (less than 0.1 x 10(3) cells/microliters) was greatly blunted, with flow and contractile function falling by less than 14 and 8%, respectively, from baseline, and release of TxB2 was greatly attenuated. However, the myocardial ischemia and TxB2 release remained depressed in response to C5a after removal of the filters and perfusion with either arterial blood containing normal levels of PMNs or stored arterial blood never exposed to filters. In contrast, the repeat C5a challenge resulted in equivalent myocardial extraction of PMNs, thus indicating a dissociation of PMN sequestration from the acute ischemic response and release of TxB2. In separate experiments, the intracoronary injection of LTB4 also resulted in a pronounced myocardial extraction of PMNs (8.6 x 10(3) cells/microliters) greater than during C5a, but did not depress coronary flow or function. Perfusion at constant flow greatly diminished the ischemic response to C5a, indicating that vasoconstriction and resultant ischemia is the main cause of the contractile dysfunction. These data indicate that leukocyte filters inhibit the myocardial ischemia and release of TxB2 induced by C5a via mechanisms not related to PMN depletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W207215660,"The effects of the chaotropic agent, guanidine HCl, on the chlorinating activity, optical absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman spectra of myeloperoxidase have been studied. In the presence of the agent the Soret optical absorption of the reduced enzyme (lambda max = 474 nm) is blue shifted to 448 nm, a position similar to heme alpha-containing enzymes. The chlorinating activity of the enzyme disappears, and EPR spectra show a loss of intensity of the rhombic high spin heme signals (gx = 6.9; gy = 5.4) and the appearance of a more axial high spin signal (gx = gy = 6.0). Surprisingly the effects of guanidine HCl are partly reversible. Upon decreasing the concentration of the chaotropic agents by dilution, both the chlorinating activity and the original optical spectrum of native reduced enzyme (lambda max = 474 nm) are partly restored. The resonance Raman spectra of denatured cyanomyeloperoxidase are less complicated than those of native myeloperoxidase, which have been interpreted previously to suggest an iron chlorin chromophore. The multiple lines in the oxidation state marker region are not seen in the spectra of the denatured species. The changes suggest that upon denaturation the macrocycle is converted into a more symmetric structure. Since the effects on the optical absorption spectrum are reversible we speculate that, in the native enzyme, an apparent porphyrin macrocycle undergoes a reversible interaction with amino acid residues in the protein which creates an asymmetry in the electronic distribution of the macrocycle. Comparison of the Raman spectra of denatured cyanomyeloperoxidase with those of analogous heme alpha model complexes suggests the presence of a formyl group in the denatured species; our data, however, demonstrate that the chromophore structure is not identical to heme alpha and may contain a different C beta substitution on the ring macrocycle."
