https://openalex.org/W2053520756,"Mutations in BRAF and NRAS that lead to constitutive activation of MAPK signalling have been found at high frequencies in many melanomas, both benign and malignant. However, they have not been found in uveal melanomas (arising from in the cells that give colour to the eye) or in blue naevi melanomas (a type of benign blue–black mole). Now a genetic screen of biopsy samples shows that these melanoma subtypes instead show frequent activating mutations in the G protein α-subunit GNAQ, also leading to the activation of the MAPK pathway. This identifies signalling components downstream of GNAQ as potential therapeutic targets. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS that lead to constitutive activation of MAP kinase signalling have been found at high frequencies in many melanomas. However, they have not been found in the uveal melanomas and blue nevi subtypes of melanoma. This paper shows that these subtypes instead show frequent activating mutations in the G protein α-subunit GNAQ, also leading to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. BRAF and NRAS are common targets for somatic mutations in benign and malignant neoplasms that arise from melanocytes situated in epithelial structures, and lead to constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway1,2. However, BRAF and NRAS mutations are absent in a number of other melanocytic neoplasms in which the equivalent oncogenic events are currently unknown3. Here we report frequent somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit, GNAQ, in blue naevi (83%) and ocular melanoma of the uvea (46%). The mutations occur exclusively in codon 209 in the Ras-like domain and result in constitutive activation, turning GNAQ into a dominant acting oncogene. Our results demonstrate an alternative route to MAP kinase activation in melanocytic neoplasia, providing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention."

As such, immune modulatory therapies that enhance and/or restore the function of virus-specific immunity may protect from disease progression. Here we investigate the safety and immune restoration potential of blockade of the co-inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) during chronic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques. We demonstrate that PD-1 blockade using an antibody to PD-1 is well tolerated and results in rapid expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells with improved functional quality. This enhanced T-cell immunity was seen in the blood and also in the gut, a major reservoir of SIV infection. PD-1 blockade also resulted in proliferation of memory B cells and increases in SIV envelope-specific antibody. These improved immune responses were associated with significant reductions in plasma viral load and also prolonged the survival of SIV-infected macaques. Blockade was effective during the early (week 10) as well as late ( approximately week 90) phases of chronic infection even under conditions of severe lymphopenia. These results demonstrate enhancement of both cellular and humoral immune responses during a pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infection by blocking a single inhibitory pathway and identify a novel therapeutic approach for control of human immunodeficiency virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2011146811,"Contact inhibition of locomotion was discovered by Abercrombie more than 50 years ago and describes the behaviour of fibroblast cells confronting each other in vitro, where they retract their protrusions and change direction on contact. Its failure was suggested to contribute to malignant invasion. However, the molecular basis of contact inhibition of locomotion and whether it also occurs in vivo are still unknown. Here we show that neural crest cells, a highly migratory and multipotent embryonic cell population, whose behaviour has been likened to malignant invasion, demonstrate contact inhibition of locomotion both in vivo and in vitro, and that this accounts for their directional migration. When two migrating neural crest cells meet, they stop, collapse their protrusions and change direction. In contrast, when a neural crest cell meets another cell type, it fails to display contact inhibition of locomotion; instead, it invades the other tissue, in the same manner as metastatic cancer cells. We show that inhibition of non-canonical Wnt signalling abolishes both contact inhibition of locomotion and the directionality of neural crest migration. Wnt-signalling members localize at the site of cell contact, leading to activation of RhoA in this region. These results provide the first example of contact inhibition of locomotion in vivo, provide an explanation for coherent directional migration of groups of cells and establish a previously unknown role for non-canonical Wnt signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2041590882,"Little is known about the formation of niches, local micro-environments required for stem-cell maintenance. Here we develop an in vivo assay for adult haematopoietic stem-cell (HSC) niche formation. With this assay, we identified a population of progenitor cells with surface markers CD45(-)Tie2(-)alpha(V)(+)CD105(+)Thy1.1(-) (CD105(+)Thy1(-)) that, when sorted from 15.5 days post-coitum fetal bones and transplanted under the adult mouse kidney capsule, could recruit host-derived blood vessels, produce donor-derived ectopic bones through a cartilage intermediate and generate a marrow cavity populated by host-derived long-term reconstituting HSC (LT-HSC). In contrast, CD45(-)Tie2(-)alpha(V)(+)CD105(+)Thy1(+) (CD105(+)Thy1(+)) fetal bone progenitors form bone that does not contain a marrow cavity. Suppressing expression of factors involved in endochondral ossification, such as osterix and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inhibited niche generation. CD105(+)Thy1(-) progenitor populations derived from regions of the fetal mandible or calvaria that do not undergo endochondral ossification formed only bone without marrow in our assay. Collectively, our data implicate endochondral ossification, bone formation that proceeds through a cartilage intermediate, as a requirement for adult HSC niche formation."

https://openalex.org/W2006548753,"A balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulates numerous cellular processes and pathways, and specific deubiquitinating enzymes often play the decisive role of controlling this balance. We recently reported that the USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme, which regulates the Fanconi anemia pathway by deubiquitinating the central player of the pathway, FANCD2, is activated by the WD40-repeat containing UAF1 protein through formation of a stable USP1/UAF1 protein complex. Here we present the isolation of two novel multisubunit deubiquitinating enzyme complexes containing USP12 and USP46, respectively. Both complexes contain the UAF1 protein as a bona fide subunit. Interestingly, UAF1 regulates the enzymatic activity of both enzyme complexes, suggesting that this activator protein may regulate a subclass of human deubiquitinating enzymes. We postulate that additional WD40-containing proteins may also form complexes with other human deubiquitinating enzymes and thereby regulate their activity and substrate specificity. A balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulates numerous cellular processes and pathways, and specific deubiquitinating enzymes often play the decisive role of controlling this balance. We recently reported that the USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme, which regulates the Fanconi anemia pathway by deubiquitinating the central player of the pathway, FANCD2, is activated by the WD40-repeat containing UAF1 protein through formation of a stable USP1/UAF1 protein complex.

We postulate that additional WD40-containing proteins may also form complexes with other human deubiquitinating enzymes and thereby regulate their activity and substrate specificity. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulate a number of essential biological processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin modifications can be divided into three principally different types. First, monoubiquitination may alter the activity of the substrate, as described for the FANCD2 protein of the Fanconi anemia (FA) 2The abbreviations used are: FA, Fanconi anemia; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; Ub, ubiquitin; VS, vinyl sulfone. pathway (2Kennedy R.D. D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2925-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and the PCNA protein involved in Trans Lesion Synthesis (2Kennedy R.D. D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2925-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 3Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), or may alter the cellular localization of the protein (4Sigismund S. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 149-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Second, polyubiquitination through K48-linkage typically targets the protein substrate for degradation by the proteasome (5Hanna J. Finley D. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Third, polyubiquitination through the K63-linkage can alter the activity of the protein by modifying its protein-protein interaction properties. A recent example of K63 polyubiquitination is that of the histone variant H2AX, which is polyubiquitinated in response to DNA damage, and as such, is believed to orchestrate the recruitment of DNA repair factors to sites of DNA damage on the chromatin (6Yang X.H. Zou L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20645-20646Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Processes regulated by ubiquitination are often controlled by the opposing enzymatic reaction, namely deubiquitination. First, accurate deubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein by the USP1/UAF1 complex is essential for an intact Fanconi anemia pathway. Loss of USP1 activity leads to accumulation of monoubiquitinated FANCD2, dysregulation of the FA pathway, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (7Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M.

Second, failure to deubiquitinate Cdc20 as part of the APC-inhibitory Mad2-Cdc20 complex by USP44, leads to an anaphase entry defect (10Stegmeier F. Rape M. Draviam V.M. Nalepa G. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L.

Third, the USP22 deubiquitinating enzyme, as a subunit of the SAGA complex, is critical for appropriate progression through the cell cycle due to its function in transcriptional regulation by deubiquitinating monoubiquitinated histone H2B (11Zhang X.Y. Varthi M. Sykes S.M. Phillips C. Warzecha C. Zhu W. Wyce A. Thorne A.W. Berger S.L. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 102-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). There are ∼95 deubiquitinating enzymes in human (12Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). The family of deubiquitinating enzymes is divided into five subfamilies, including the USP subfamily (58 members), the UCH subfamily (4 members), the MJD subfamily (5 members), OTU subfamily (14 members), and the JAMM subfamily (14 members). The exact biological function of the majority of these enzymes is currently unknown. However, for those enzymes whose function has been uncovered, it has become apparent that regulation of their activities is essential for integrity of the pathways they regulate. A critical question has remained unanswered, namely, how are deubiquitinating enzymes regulated. We previously reported that one deubiquitinating enzyme, USP1, which controls the Fanconi anemia pathway, is activated by a novel protein called UAF1. UAF1 forms a complex with USP1 in vivo, and this protein complex has high deubiquitinating enzyme activity, as opposed to free USP1, which by itself is nearly inactive. Thus, UAF1 regulates the activity of the USP1 enzyme. Here we describe the identification of two novel deubiquitinating enzyme complexes containing the USP12 and the USP46 enzymes, respectively. Interestingly, the UAF1 factor tightly regulates the activity of both complexes. Thus we describe a more general mechanism for regulation of human deubiquitinating enzymes. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Plasmids—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's or Joklik's MEM (Invitrogen or Sigma, respectively) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable HeLa cells expressing USP1 or UAF1 knockdown plasmids were generated as previously described (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). shRNA target sequences against USP12 and USP46, were 5′-GAAGAGAGAAAGCAGGAAA-3′ and 5′-CCATGAAACTTACGCAGTA-3′, respectively. USP12 and USP46 cDNAs were cloned from a HeLa cDNA library, using standard cloning methods (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibodies used were as follows: Rabbit anti-USP1 antibody (7Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M. Brummelkamp T.R. Kerkhoven R.M. D'Andrea A.D. Bernards R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); mouse anti-α-tubulin (CP06, Calbiochem or T5168, Sigma); mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5); rabbit anti-UAF1 (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar); rabbit anti-USP12 polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing a rabbit with an N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein of USP12 according to standard immunization methods (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol, cysteine residues were derivatized with iodoacetamide, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins from Silver-stained gel bands were in-gel digested with trypsin (15Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The generated peptide mixtures were subjected to LC-MS/MS using a hybrid linear ion trap/FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ FT, Thermo Electron) essentially as described previously (16Haas W. Faherty B.K. Gerber S.A. Elias J.E. Beausoleil S.A. Bakalarski C.E. Li X. Villen J. Gygi S.P. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1326-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). MS/MS spectra were assigned by searching them with the SEQUEST algorithm (17Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates 3rd., J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar) against the Human International Protein Index sequence data base. Protein Purification—The UAF1 complex was purified from nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells expressing N-terminal Flag- and HA epitope-tagged UAF1 as described (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). For density gradient sedimentation, 200 μl of the Flag peptide-eluted material was loaded onto a 4.8-ml glycerol gradient (10-40%) and spun at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 2 h. 200-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient using a Brandel BR-184 density gradient fractionator. Proteins purified from Sf9 cells were expressed using either the pFastBac-HTa vector (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal His tag or the pFastBac vector (Invitrogen) with an engineered Flag tag and purified as described (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In Vitro Enzymatic Assays—In vitro enzymatic assays in the presence of 5 μm ubiquitin-VS (ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone; U-202; Boston Biochem) were performed 30 °C. In vitro enzymatic assays using ubiquitin-AMC (ubiquitin-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; U-550; Boston Biochem) were performed in 50-100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.8, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin (A7641; Sigma), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. Fluorescence was monitored in a Fluo-Star Galaxy Fluorometer (BMG Labtech Inc.). UAF1 Associates with a Deubiquitinating Enzyme Activity Different from USP1—We previously demonstrated that the WD40-repeat containing protein UAF1 forms a stable complex with the USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme in vivo and that the interaction both stabilizes and activates USP1 (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that UAF1 regulates other deubiquitinating enzymes, we asked whether UAF1 co-purifies with deubiquitinating activity when purified from cells in which the USP1 protein in stably knocked down by shRNA (Fig. 1). As expected, purification of epitope-tagged e-UAF1 as a native complex from either wild-type HeLa cells or USP1 knockdown HeLa cells, demonstrated the presence or absence, respectively, of USP1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 5-6). However, when we assayed the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of the two UAF1 purifications, using ubiquitin-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (ubiquitin-AMC) as a substrate, the activity was essentially identical, despite the absence of USP1 in the second purification (Fig. 1B). A mock purification from untransduced HeLa cells contained no detectable deubiquitinating enzyme activity. These data suggested that UAF1 interacts with other deubiquitinating enzymes in addition to USP1 in vivo. To further explore the nature of the UAF1-associated deubiquitinating enzyme activity, we visualized the protein subunits of the native UAF1 complex by silver stain (Fig. 1C). As predicted, we observed full-length USP1 as well as both of its N- and C-terminal cleavage products (lane 2). The identities of these polypeptides were verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). We previously demonstrated the existence of an enzymatically competent ternary complex composed of UAF1 and these two cleavage products of USP1, in good agreement with the current data (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition to the known USP1 derived polypeptides, we observed several additional polypeptides that were not present in a mock purification, suggesting that they are bona fide subunits of the UAF1 complex (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The relatively large number of polypeptides indicates that multiple protein subcomplexes exist rather than one large complex. To address this directly, we further fractionated the purified complexes by a 10-40% glycerol gradient sedimentation and analyzed the fractions by silver stain. The sedimentation profile suggested the existence of at least four distinct protein complexes containing UAF1 (complexes I-IV) (Fig. 1D). In good agreement with previous data showing that the USP1/UAF1 complex is a stoichiometric heterodimer, USP1 sedimented at a relatively low molecular weight, peaking in fractions 3-5 (Complex I, II) (Fig. 1D). Immunoblot blot analysis further confirmed that both UAF1 and USP1 peak in these fractions (Fig. 1E, fractions 3-5). We next went on to assay the deubiquitinating enzyme activity in the various fractions using ubiquitin-AMC as a substrate. We detected activity in fractions 3-7 with a peak in fraction 3 (Fig. 1E), corresponding to the peak of USP1. These data suggested that the unidentified deubiquitinating enzyme complex has a molecular weight similar to the USP1/UAF1 complex and correspondingly co-sediments in the glycerol gradient sedimentation. Identification of the UAF1-associated Deubiquitinating Enzyme Activity—To identify the UAF1-associated deubiquitinating enzyme(s), we used an affinity labeling approach. Many active deubiquitinating enzymes interact with and form a covalent complex with the ubiquitin derivative ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (Ub-VS) upon incubation in vitro (18Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The resulting deubiquitinating enzyme/ubiquitin complex will migrate ∼8 kDa slower in SDS-PAGE than the free deubiquitinating enzyme, corresponding to the molecular weight of the covalently attached ubiquitin protein. We subjected fractions 3 and 5 to an in vitro incubation with Ub-VS, and analyzed the resulting polypeptides by silver stain. As expected, we observed a shift of USP1 in fraction 3 where the protein is most abundant (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Importantly, we also observed a shift of two additional very closely migrating polypeptides with molecular weights of ∼40-41 kDa. The shift of these closely migrating polypeptides suggested that they may constitute the observed UAF1-associated deubiquitinating enzyme activity. Therefore, we excised and trypsinized the corresponding Silver stained band and analyzed the resulting peptides by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MC). The analysis leads to the identification of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP12 (Fig. 2B). USP12 is a 370-amino acid protein belonging to the USP family of cysteine ubiquitin proteases, whose exact biological function currently is unknown. USP12 is highly homologous to USP46, which is 366-amino acid long, and the overall homology between the two proteins is 88% (Fig. 2C). Like USP1, USP12, and USP46 contain the three conserved catalytical triad amino acid residues. The active site cysteine is located in the N-terminal end of all three proteins whereas the histidine and aspartic acid residues are located in the C-terminal ends of all three proteins (Fig. 2C). We next raised a rabbit antibody against USP12, which due to the high homology between USP12 and USP46, recognizes both proteins. Using this antibody, we analyzed the native UAF1 complex by immunoblotting. As expected, in addition to UAF1, we observed two very closely migrating bands of 40 and 41 kDa, corresponding to USP12 and USP46, respectively (Fig. 2D). The data suggest that three UAF1 deubiquitinating enzyme complexes exist in vivo, namely the USP1/UAF1, USP12/UAF1, and USP46/UAF1 complexes. To further reinforce this notion, we stably expressed epitope-tagged USP12 and USP46 proteins in HeLa cells, and purified the two proteins together with associated proteins as native protein complexes. Silver stain analysis of the purified complexes revealed the presence of the epitope-tagged proteins but also an additional 80-kDa polypeptide, corresponding to the molecular weight of UAF1 (Fig. 2E and data not shown). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the identity of this polypeptide as UAF1 (Fig. 2F). The silver stain profile suggested that the proteins form a stoichiometric complex between UAF1 and the deubiquitinating enzyme, as we previously observed for the USP1/UAF1 complex (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular weight of such heterodimeric complexes correlates well with the observed size sedimentation profile (Fig. 1D). Taken together, we have identified three separate deubiquitinating enzyme complexes. Each complex contains a common subunit, namely the WD40-repeat protein UAF1 as well as a unique deubiquitinating enzyme subunit, either USP1, USP12, or USP46. UAF1 Regulates the Enzymatic Activity of USP12 and USP46—We previously demonstrated that the USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme has weak activity by itself, and that its activity is stimulated 33-fold upon forming a heterodimeric complex with the UAF1 protein (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We concluded that the enzymatic activity of USP1 is regulated by UAF1. The present data, demonstrating the identification of two additional deubiquitinating enzyme complexes, both containing UAF1 as a bona fide subunit, suggests that UAF1 may regulate the activity of these enzyme complexes as well. To address this question, we purified both USP12 and USP46, either alone or as heterodimeric protein complexes with UAF1, from Sf9 insect cells. We were able to express and purify both USP12 and USP46 to homogeneity from Sf9 cells (Fig. 3A). As predicted, when the enzymes were co-expressed with UAF1, they were purified as stoichiometric heterodimeric protein complexes with UAF1 (Fig. 3A). These data confirm the existence of stable USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes in vivo. We next asked whether the enzymatic activity of USP12 and USP46 is regulated by UAF1. To this end we assessed the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of the enzymes, alone or as protein complexes with UAF1, by an in vitro deubiquitinating enzyme assay using ubiquitin-AMC as a substrate. USP12 and USP46 converted the substrate at a very low rate of turnover (Fig. 3B). The USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes, on the other hand, possessed strong deubiquitinating enzyme activity. Therefore, UAF1 regulates the activity of both USP12 and USP46. Importantly, UAF1 did not stimulate the enzymatic activity of USP2, USP5, USP7, and USP14, underscoring the specificity of the activation (data not shown). The WD40 Repeats of UAF1 Are Required for the Formation of the USP1/UAF1, USP12/UAF1, and USP46/UAF1 Complexes—Previous studies have shown that the large N-terminal region of UAF1, containing the eight predicted WD40 repeats, is required for binding and activation of USP1. We next determined the structural regions of UAF1 required for binding to USP12 and USP46. A series of Flag-tagged deletion mutant UAF1 polypeptides was expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 4A). Anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were blotted for bound endogenous USP1, USP12, and USP46 proteins (Fig. 4B). Deletion of only WD40 repeat 2 of UAF1 was sufficient to prevent detectable interaction with any of the three deubiquitinating enzymes. Only deletions in the proximal C-terminal part of UAF1 did not interfere with USP1 or USP12 and USP46 interaction. The data suggest that the interaction requires an intact propeller domain constituted by the 8 WD40 repeats. Taken together, these results indicate that UAF1 interacts with USP12 and USP46 in a manner similar to which it interacts with USP1. UAF1 Forms Separate and Distinct Complexes with USP1, USP12, and USP46—Our data suggest that UAF1 forms separate and distinct complexes with USP1, USP12, and USP46, and that each complex is unique in its enzyme subunit composition. To further address this question, we analyzed the presence of any of the three deubiquitinating enzymes in the USP1, USP12, and USP46 complexes purified from HeLa cells. As expected, immunoblot analysis of the three complexes clearly demonstrated that the USP1 complex contained only USP1 and UAF1, but not USP12 and USP46 (Fig. 5A). Likewise, we found that the USP12 and USP46 complexes contained only USP12, USP46, and UAF1, but not USP1 (Fig. 5A). Importantly, we detected all three deubiquitinating enzymes in the UAF1 purification, which contains all three subcomplexes (Fig. 5A). To further reinforce the notion that UAF1 forms three separate protein complexes in vivo, where each complex contains a distinct deubiquitinating enzyme, we asked whether a protein complex, formed by a catalytically inactive version of USP12, possesses any deubiquitinating enzyme activity. The amino acid consensus sequence surrounding the catalytical cysteine is highly conserved among members of the USP subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes (12Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic cysteine of USP12 is readily detectable as amino acid 48 (Fig. 5B). We expressed a mutant USP12 protein in HeLa cells, where the cysteine has been mutated to a serine, USP12-C48S (Fig. 5B). We purified USP12-C48S as a protein complex and confirmed that it forms a stable complex with UAF1, with similar stoichiometry as we observed in the USP12 complex (Fig. 5C). We subjected the USP12-C48S complex to an in vitro deubiquitinating enzyme assay, using ubiquitin-AMC as a substrate. Whereas the USP12 complex contained robust deubiquitinating enzyme activity, the USP12-C48S complex contained no detectable activity (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data confirm the notion that three separate UAF1 deubiquitinating enzyme complexes exist in vivo, and that each complex contains only one deubiquitinating enzyme species. USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 Complexes Do Not Regulate FANCD2 Ubiquitination or the FA Pathway—The cellular functions and substrates of the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 deubiquitinating complexes are currently unknown. Previous studies have indicated that the USP1/UAF1 complex regulates the deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated Fanconi anemia protein, Ub-FANCD2. Cellular knockdown of USP1 results in accumulation of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 (Ub-FANCD2) and disruption of the FA pathway (7Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M. Brummelkamp T.R. Kerkhoven R.M.

Moreover, USP1 knockout results in cellular hypersensitivity to the cross-linking agent, Mitomycin C(8Oestergaard V.H. Langevin F. Kuiken H.J. Pace P. Niedzwiedz W. Simpson L.J. Ohzeki M. Takata M. Sale J.E. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 798-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We next determined whether the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes also participate in the regulation of the FA pathway. We established HeLa cell lines where UAF1, USP1, USP12, USP46, or both USP12 and USP46 where stably knocked down by shRNA. The efficiency and specificity of the various protein knockdowns were assayed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6A). Knockdown of UAF1, USP12, or USP12 and USP46 resulted in a decrease in USP12/46 protein levels (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). As expected, knockdown of USP1 or UAF1 both resulted in deregulation of the FA pathway, as visualized by an increase in the level of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 protein (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 3). On the contrary, knockdown of either USP12 or USP46 did not affect the levels of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 (Fig. 6A, lanes 4-6), and had no effect on the Mitomycin C sensitivity of these cells (data not shown). Our data suggest distinct and separate functions of the three deubiquitinating enzyme complexes. Regulation of Deubiquitinating Enzyme Activity—Deubiquitinating enzymes regulate numerous fundamental biological processes such as protein degradation, gene transcription, cell cycle control, and genomic stability (12Nijman S.M.

Cell. 2008; 29: 653-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of regulation for the majority of these critical enzymes has remained elusive. Several mechanisms of regulation for deubiquitinating enzymes have been described. First, regulation may be intrinsic to the enzyme itself. For instance, some deubiquitinating enzymes such as USP7 (HAUSP) have low activity catalytic sites, which are rearranged into an active conformation upon interaction with the substrate (21Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Second, some proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes such as yeast Ubp6 have relatively low activity by themselves, but are activated upon binding to the proteasome (22Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Third, some deubiquitinating enzymes such as Uch37 have low activity, but are stimulated by binding partners that enhance the recruitment to their substrates (23Qiu X.B. Ouyang S.Y. Li C.J. Miao S. Wang L. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5742-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Yao T. Song L. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Cohen R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Fourth, some deubiquitinating enzymes are regulated at the transcriptional level (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Finally, some deubiquitinating enzymes have a relatively high baseline activity, but are recruited to their substrates by their own substrate binding domain, as the UIM domain of DUB-A (25Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R. Quan C. O'Rourke K.M. Eby M. Pietras E. Cheng G. Bazan J.F. Zhang Z. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) or by a chaperone protein (26Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We recently described a novel mechanism of regulation for one of these essential enzymes, namely the USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T. Gygi S.P. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 786-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found that USP1 is activated upon forming a complex with the novel WD40-domain containing activator protein UAF1. The active USP1/UAF1 complex in turn controls the cellular levels of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 DNA repair protein, a regulation that is instrumental for integrity of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway. Interestingly, uncovering the molecular mechanism of the activation revealed that UAF1 enhances the catalytic turnover (kcat) of USP1 upon formation of a stable USP1/UAF1 protein complex, while only affecting enzyme affinity for the substrate (Km) slightly. This novel mechanism of activation coupled with the biological importance of human deubiquitinating enzymes in general, stimulated us to search for other deubiquitinating enzymes regulated by UAF1. UAF1 Regulates the Enzymatic Activity of the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 Complexes—We identified two new human UAF1 complexes. One, the USP12/UAF1 complex, contains the USP12 deubiquitinating enzyme as a bona fide subunit whereas the other, the USP46/UAF1 complex, contains the USP46 deubiquitinating enzyme. Detailed analysis of these complexes in vitro and in vivo, clearly demonstrate that UAF1 serves as an activator of both protein complexes. Recombinant USP12 and USP46 enzymes possess only very low deubiquitinating enzyme activity, whereas the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes have robust activity. We show that the three deubiquitinating enzyme complexes are different and distinct in their enzyme subunits, in that none of the complexes contain more than one of the deubiquitinating enzymes. The substrate for the USP1/UAF1 complex is well described, namely, the monoubiquitinated FANCD2 protein, whereas the substrates for the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes have not been defined at present. The Cellular Function of the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 Complexes Is Unknown—The USP1/UAF1 complex has a clear function in the regulation of the DNA damage response by controlling the cellular levels of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 protein. In contrast, the cellular function of the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes is unknown. ShRNA knockdown of USP12 or USP46 (or both) did not result in increased levels of monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Elucidation of the cellular function of these deubiquitinating enzymes may therefore depend on the successful identification of their ubiquitin substrates in the future. Interestingly, USP12 and USP46 have extensive amino acid identity with each other and with two highly related Saccharomyces cereviciae deubiquitinating enzymes, namely, Ubp9 and Ubp13. The cellular function of these yeast enzymes also remains unknown. Previous studies indicate that Ubp9 and Ubp13 are not essential genes in yeast, and that single deletion of these genes has no effect on growth under standard conditions (28Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ubp9 and Ubp13, co-purify with a yeast WD40-containing protein, Yol087c, a protein containing structural similarity to human UAF1 (9Cohn M.A. Kowal P. Yang K. Haas W. Huang T.T.

Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). Indeed, in agreement with these genomic and proteomic data, deletion of Yol087c leads to a common growth phenotype as a double deletion of the yeast Ubp9 and Ubp13. 3D. Bernard, S. Kanga, D. Urban-Grimal, and R. Haguenauer-Tsapis, personal communication. We are therefore led to hypothesize that the USP12/UAF1 and USP46/UAF1 complexes described in this report may be functional orthologues of the Ubp9/Yol087c and Ubp13/Yol087c proteins in yeast. General Mechanism of Activation for Human Deubiquitinating Enzymes—Our data describe a mechanism of regulation for three of the 95 human deubiquitinating enzymes. In addition to USP1, USP12, and UPS46, a number of other human deubiquitinating enzymes have also been shown to possess very low enzymatic activity as recombinant proteins, including USP2, USP7, USP14, and USP44 (10Stegmeier F. Rape M. Draviam V.M. Nalepa G. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Li M.Z. Hannon G.J. Sorger P.K. Kirschner M.W. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Therefore, several members of the USP subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes may require an activating protein. The low intrinsic activity of these and perhaps other deubiquitinating enzymes, particularly of the USP subfamily, suggest the presence of other regulatory subunits for these enzymes. Specifically, we postulate that other WD40-repeat-containing proteins (i.e. UAF2, UAF3, etc.) may exist in protein complexes with other deubiquitinating enzymes and thereby regulate their activity. The proposed combinatorial assortment of USP enzymes and UAF activators is described schematically in Fig. 6B.

Therefore, it is important to identify the causal connection between mechanisms of aging and PCa. Employing in vitro and in vivo approaches, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that SIRT1, which belongs to the Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) family of sirtuin class III histone deacetylases, is overexpressed in PCa, and its inhibition will have antiproliferative effects in human PCa cells. Our data demonstrated that SIRT1 was significantly overexpressed in human PCa cells (DU145, LNCaP, 22Rν1, and PC3) compared with normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) at protein, mRNA, and enzymatic activity levels. SIRT1 was also found to be overexpressed in human PCa tissues compared with adjacent normal prostate tissue. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that SIRT1 inhibition via nicotinamide and sirtinol (at the activity level) as well as via short hairpin RNA-mediated RNA interference (at the genetic level) resulted in a significant inhibition in the growth and viability of human PCa cells while having no effect on normal prostate epithelial cells. Further, we found that inhibition of SIRT1 caused an increase in FOXO1 acetylation and transcriptional activation in PCa cells. Our data suggested that SIRT1, via inhibiting FOXO1 activation, could contribute to the development of PCa. We suggest that SIRT1 could serve as a target toward developing novel strategies for PCa management.

Prostate cancer (PCa) 2The abbreviations used are: PCa, prostate cancer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: PCa, prostate cancer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. is a major age-related malignancy and is rarely seen in men younger than 40 years; the incidence rises rapidly with each decade thereafter. Because the present life expectancy has significantly improved and Americans are living longer, it is believed that more cases of PCa will be diagnosed in the future. According to one prediction, by year 2010, the number of annual PCa cases will skyrocket to 330,000. Thus, it will be immensely useful to better understand the molecular mechanism and connection between aging and PCa. Unraveling determinants such as genes and gene-products involved in aging and that have a connection with PCa could be exploited in designing novel targets and approaches for the management of this age-related neoplasm. We hypothesized that sirtuins (Sirt proteins), which are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases, could serve as a connection between aging and cancer. Originally discovered in yeast, sirtuins are a unique class of type III histone deacetylases that utilize NAD+ as a cofactor for their functions (1Longo V.D. Kennedy B.K.

Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2006; 75: 435-465Google Scholar). Seven homologs of yeast Sir2 have been identified in the human genome. Called SIRT1 to -7, they all contain a highly conserved catalytic domain, and despite their enzymatic activity on histone substrates in vitro, Sirt proteins predominantly target nonhistone proteins for deacetylation, in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (1Longo V.D.

Each sirtuin is characterized by a conserved 275-amino acid catalytic core domain and unique N-terminal and/or C-terminal sequences of variable length. The catalytic core domain may act preferentially as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase or NAD+-dependent deacetylase (3Michan S. Sinclair D. Biochem. J.. 2007; 404: 1-13Google Scholar). Their functions and locations differ greatly, and SIRT1 is the best characterized member among the mammalian sirtuins (1Longo V.D. Kennedy B.K.

The activities and localization of the FOXOs have been shown to be dependent on their phosphorylation and acetylation status. Phosphorylation of FOXO factors, with subsequent ubiquitination, has been shown to modulate a variety of downstream target genes (34Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Aoyama H. Yoshimochi K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 11278-11283Google Scholar).

Cell.. 2004; 116: 551-563Google Scholar); however, the connection between SIRT1 and the FOXO factors in PCa is not well understood. In this study, we have demonstrated that SIRT1 is significantly overexpressed in human PCa cell lines compared with normal human prostate epithelial cells. Further, we found that SIRT1 is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue samples versus adjacent normal prostate epithelium in patients with PCa. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that SIRT1 inhibition by nicotinamide, sirtinol, or shRNA-mediated RNA interference causes an inhibition in growth and cell viability of human PCa cells while having no effect on normal prostate epithelial cells. We have also found that inhibition caused an increase in acetylated FOXO1 protein with a concomitant increase in FOXO1 transcriptional activity. Our data suggest that SIRT1 may be promoting PCa cell growth via inhibiting FOXO1. Cell Culture—The human prostate carcinoma cell lines (viz. LNCaP, 22Rν1, DU145, and PC3 (obtained from ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640, minimum Eagle's, and F12K media (ATCC) supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Normal human prostate epithelial cells PrEC (Cambrex) and NPEC (Celprogen) were maintained at standard cell culture conditions in PrEBM medium or human prostate culture complete growth medium, respectively, with growth factors and supplements as recommended by the vendors (Cambrex and Celprogen). Normal human keratinocytes, NHEK (Invitrogen), were maintained in keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen). N/Tert-1 keratinocytes were obtained from the Brigham and Women's Hospital Cell Culture Core Facility (Boston, MA) and maintained in keratinocyte-SFM medium. Human mammary epithelial cells (Cambrex) were maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium with supplements (Cambrex). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (Cambrex) were maintained in bronchial epithelial cell basal medium supplemented with BEGM Single Quots (Cambrex). All cells were maintained at standard cell culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator) as recommended by the vendors. Primary Cell Culture—Prostate tissue was obtained under an approved Institutional Review Board protocol from men (ages 44-66) undergoing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. Histology confirmed the absence of cancer in the tissue. Prostate epithelial cultures were established, as described by others (37Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H.

Cell Physiol.. 1987; 131: 285-301Google Scholar). Briefly, prostate tissues were minced with a scalpel and digested in a solution containing collagenase (500 units/ml; Sigma) and plated on collagen-coated plates. Cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.25 units/ml regular insulin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml human transferrin, 2.7 mg/ml dextrose, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, and 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were passaged using trypsin-EDTA. Preparation of Whole Cell Protein Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—PCa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. Cell lysates were prepared using 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer, with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Cell Signaling), and protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Primary culture protein (designated P326 and P218) was extracted by freeze thawing three times in ECB buffer, and protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay. For immunoblot analysis, 30-40 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot analysis was performed using a variety of primary antibodies (anti-SIRT1, anti-TATA-binding protein TBP (Abcam), anti-FOXO1, anti-FOXO3a, anti-FOXO4 (Cell Signaling), anti-actin, and anti-Ac-FKHR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a variety of secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Upstate) and donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by chemiluminescent detection. The quantification of protein was performed by a digital analyses of protein bands (TIFF images) using UN-SCAN-IT software. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Protein Lysates—Following treatments, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmol/liter KCl, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture) was added, and cells were scraped off. The lysate was then incubated on ice for 15 min. 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the suspension, which was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Supernatant was collected for cytosolic protein lysate. The remaining cell pellet was resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture). Suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected for nuclear protein lysate. Nuclear and cytosolic protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Both nuclear and cytosolic lysates were used for subsequent Western blotting experiments (described above). Immunofluorescence—For detection of SIRT1 by immunofluorescence, the cells were plated and grown on BD Falcon CultureSlides (BD Biosciences) until a confluence of 80% was reached. The cells were fixed and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 10% normal goat serum (Caltag Laboratories) in PBS. Following blocking, rabbit anti-SIRT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was removed, and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was then added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. PBS-diluted 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (Pierce) counterstain was used for nuclear staining. Cells were mounted with the ProLong anti-fade kit as per the vendor's protocol (Molecular Probes) and examined under a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP Rainbow confocal/multiphoton system. Immunoprecipitation and SIRT1 Enzyme Activity Assay—For immunoprecipitation of SIRT1 protein, the lysates containing 500 μg of total protein were incubated with rabbit anti-SIRT1 antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. The specific antibody-antigen complex was collected by precipitation with Protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) for 2.5 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. SIRT1 activity was determined in immunoprecipitates from cells using the SIRT1 fluorimetric drug discovery kit (AK-555; Biomol) as per the vendor's protocol. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the vendor's protocol. RNA was treated with DNase (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA was transcribed with 300 ng of random primers, 10 mm dNTPs, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed in triplicate with Platinum SYBR Green quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) with 50 ng of first strand cDNA and a 0.2 μm concentration each of forward and reverse primers for SIRT1 (forward (5′-TGCTGGCCTAATAGAGTGGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCAGCGCCATGGAAAATGT-3′) with a product size of 102 bp) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′) with a product size of 236 bp). The samples were cycled once for 50 °C for 2 min for UDG incubation followed by 94 °C for 2 min and then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s and 55 °C for 30 s each. Relative SIRT1 mRNA was calculated using the ΔΔCt comparative method using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an endogenous control. Purity of product was checked by dissociation curve analysis as well as running the samples on 3% agarose gel. Human Tissues and Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded tissue slides containing human prostate cancer tissue with adjacent normal prostate tissue and a custom tissue microarray containing cancer and normal prostatic tissue from 41 patients (3-9 samples per patient depending on heterogenicity) with varying grades of PCa were obtained from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). The slides were deparaffinized and blocked for endogenous peroxidases with a 3% H2O2 in a double-distilled H2O incubation. 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, was heated to a boil, and tissue slides were then boiled for 3 min for antigen retrieval. Slides were then blocked in 1.5% normal goat serum (Caltag Laboratories) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber followed by incubation with a rabbit anti-SIRT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. The slides were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Upstate) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber, followed by cross-reaction with freshly prepared liquid 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate chromogen system, 20 μl of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen/1 ml of substrate buffer (DakoCytomation). Hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories) was diluted 1:5 in double-distilled H2O and used as a nuclear counterstain. Finally, slides were dehydrated and mounted with coverslips followed by microscopic analysis with digital image capture. SIRT1 staining was semiquantitatively graded as negative (-), weak (+), moderate (++), or strong (+++) staining in 50% of cells examined. Statistical analysis of the data were performed using Fisher's exact test. Treatment of Cells with Nicotinamide—Cells were grown to 60% confluence and then treated with 150 μm, 300 μm, 5 mm, or 20 mm nicotinamide (Acros Organics) dissolved in the growth medium. Cells were incubated with the nicotinamide treatment for 24 h, after which they were used for subsequent experiments. Treatment of Cells with Sirtinol—Cells were grown to 60% confluence and then treated with 30 or 120 μm sirtinol (Sigma; dissolved in DMSO). Cells were incubated with sirtinol for 24 or 48 h, after which they were used for subsequent experiments. Transfection with SIRT1 Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)—Short hairpin SIRT1 clone V2HS_20109 (sequenced with U6 5′-TGT GGA AAG GAC GAA ACA CC sequencing primers) cloned into a pSHAG-MAGIC2 vector was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The transfections were done according to the protocol supplied with the RNAintro shRNA transfection kit (Open Biosystems). Plasmid DNA from cultures was prepared according to the protocol given in Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Appropriate restriction digests were performed to confirm correct shRNA plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was then diluted in serum-free medium and mixed with Arrest-In diluted in serum-free medium and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The DNA·Arrest-In complex mixture was added to 60-80% confluent cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After 6 h, transfection medium was removed, and medium with serum was added and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. The cells were then harvested, and further studies were performed. Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay—Following treatments, cells were trypsinized and collected in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS (120 μl). Trypan blue (0.4% in PBS; 10 μl) was added to a smaller aliquot (10 μl) of cell suspension, and the number of cells (viable unstained and nonviable blue) were counted. Luciferase Reporter Assay—PCa cells were transfected with phRL-TK (Promega) and 3×IRSLuc-FOXO1 (15Yang Y. Hou H. Haller E.M. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 1021-1032Google Scholar) or FGHRE-Luc (33Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar) (Addgene plasmid 1789) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the vendor's protocol. Transfected cells were then collected and replated into 12-well plates 48 h post-transfection so that they were 75% confluent the following day. 24 h postreplating, cells were treated in triplicate with medium, DMSO (vehicle), or sirtinol (30 or 120 μm for 24 h). Then cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega, WI). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test for independent samples, and the data are expressed as means ± S.E. unless specified otherwise. Statistically significant p values are provided for each individual experiment. Aging, an inevitable process in living organisms, has been linked to several unwanted disease conditions, including several types of cancers. Studies suggest that certain genetic and epigenetic alterations are accumulated during aging and appear to possess a direct role in cell transformation. These events show a clear evolution during aging and are reversed in cancer. An interesting example of this is that telomere length (controlled by genetic and epigenetic modifications) decreases with ag"
https://openalex.org/W2044337618,"Dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2) are plasma membrane-targeted hydrogen peroxide generators that support extracellular hemoperoxidases. Duox activator 2 (Duoxa2), initially described as an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, functions as a maturation factor needed to deliver active Duox2 to the cell surface. However, less is known about the Duox1/Duoxa1 homologues. We identified four alternatively spliced Duoxa1 variants and explored their roles in Duox subcellular targeting and reconstitution. Duox1 and Duox2 are functionally rescued by Duoxa2 or the Duoxa1 variants that contain the third coding exon. All active maturation factors are cotransported to the cell surface when coexpressed with either Duox1 or Duox2, consistent with detection of endogenous Duoxa1 on apical plasma membranes of the airway epithelium. In contrast, the Duoxa proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed without Duox. Duox1/Duoxa1alpha and Duox2/Duoxa2 pairs produce the highest levels of hydrogen peroxide, as they undergo Golgi-based carbohydrate modifications and form stable cell surface complexes. Cross-functioning pairs that do not form stable complexes produce less hydrogen peroxide and leak superoxide. These findings suggest Duox activators not only promote Duox maturation, but they function as part of the hydrogen peroxide-generating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2053378951,"Alzheimer disease β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are generated via sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and γ-secretase. A subset of BACE1 localizes to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts. BACE1 processing in raft microdomains of cultured cells and neurons was characterized in previous studies by disrupting the integrity of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion. These studies found either inhibition or elevation of Aβ production depending on the extent of cholesterol depletion, generating controversy. The intricate interplay between cholesterol levels, APP trafficking, and BACE1 processing is not clearly understood because cholesterol depletion has pleiotropic effects on Golgi morphology, vesicular trafficking, and membrane bulk fluidity. In this study, we used an alternate strategy to explore the function of BACE1 in membrane microdomains without altering the cellular cholesterol level. We demonstrate that BACE1 undergoes S-palmitoylation at four Cys residues at the junction of transmembrane and cytosolic domains, and Ala substitution at these four residues is sufficient to displace BACE1 from lipid rafts. Analysis of wild type and mutant BACE1 expressed in BACE1 null fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells revealed that S-palmitoylation neither contributes to protein stability nor subcellular localization of BACE1. Surprisingly, non-raft localization of palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 did not have discernible influence on BACE1 processing of APP or secretion of Aβ. These results indicate that post-translational S-palmitoylation of BACE1 is not required for APP processing, and that BACE1 can efficiently cleave APP in both raft and non-raft microdomains.

BACE1 cleaves APP within the extracellular domain of APP, generating the N terminus of Aβ. In addition, BACE1 also cleaves to a lesser extent within the Aβ domain between Tyr10 and Glu11 (β′-cleavage site). Processing of APP at these sites results in the shedding/secretion of the large ectodomain (sAPPβ) and generating membrane-tethered C-terminal fragments +1 and +11 (β-CTF) (5Cole S.L. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 29621-29625Google Scholar). The multimeric γ-secretase cleaves at multiple sites within the transmembrane domain of β-CTF, generating C-terminal heterogeneous Aβ peptides (ranging in length between 38 and 43 residues) that are secreted, as well as cytosolic APP intracellular domains (6Iwatsubo T.

In addition to BACE1, APP can be cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ domain between Lys16 and Leu17, releasing sAPPα and generating α-CTF. γ-Secretase cleavage of α-CTF generates N-terminal truncated Aβ, termed p3. Genetic ablation of BACE1 completely abolishes Aβ production, establishing BACE1 as the major neuronal enzyme responsible for initiating amyloidogenic processing of APP (4Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D.

Interestingly, both the expression and activity of BACE1 is specifically elevated in neurons adjacent to senile plaques in brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease (8Zhao J. Fu Y. Yasvoina M.

In the past few years additional substrates of BACE1 have been identified that include APP homologues APLP1 and APLP2 (9Li Q. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

BACE1 is a type I transmembrane protein with a long extracellular domain harboring a catalytic domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. BACE1 is synthesized as a proenzyme, which undergoes post-translational modifications that include removal of a pro-domain by a furin-like protease, N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, S-palmitoylation, and acetylation, during the transit in the secretory pathway (16Capell A.

In non-neuronal cells the majority of BACE1 localizes to late Golgi/TGN and endosomes at steady-state and a fraction of BACE1 also cycles between the cell surface and endosomes (21Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Google Scholar). The steady-state localization of BACE1 is consistent with the acidic pH optimum of BACE1 in vitro, and BACE1 cleavage of APP is observed in the Golgi apparatus, TGN, and endosomes (22Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Google Scholar, 23Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat.

Over the years, a functional relationship between cellular cholesterol level and Aβ production has been uncovered, raising the intriguing possibility that cholesterol levels may determine the balance between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP (32Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1998; 95: 6460-6464Google Scholar, 33Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J.

Cell Biol.. 2004; 167: 953-960Google Scholar). Furthermore, several lines of evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts, might be the critical link between cholesterol levels and amyloidogenic processing of APP. Lipid rafts function in the trafficking of proteins in the secretory and endocytic pathways in epithelial cells and neurons, and participate in a number of important biological functions (35Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar). BACE1 undergoes S-palmitoylation (19Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Google Scholar), a reversible post-translational modification responsible for targeting a variety of peripheral and integral membrane proteins to lipid rafts (36Brown D.A. Physiol. (Bethesda).. 2006; 21: 430-439Google Scholar). Indeed, a significant fraction of BACE1 is localized in lipid raft microdomains in a cholesterol-dependent manner, and addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to target BACE1 exclusively to lipid rafts increases APP processing at the β-cleavage site (37Riddell D.R. Christie G. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Curr. Biol.. 2001; 11: 1288-1293Google Scholar, 38Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Google Scholar). Antibody-mediated co-patching of cell surface APP and BACE1 has provided further evidence for BACE1 processing of APP in raft microdomains (33Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 160: 113-123Google Scholar, 39Sakurai T. Kaneko K. Okuno M. Wada K. Kashiyama T. Shimizu H. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Cell Biol.. 2008; 183: 339-352Google Scholar). Components of the γ-secretase complex also associate with detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions enriched in raft markers such as caveolin, flotillin, PrP, and ganglioside GM1 (40Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Lin W. Sakurai T. Li T. Nukina N. Wong P.C. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 44945-44954Google Scholar). The above findings suggest a model whereby APP is sequentially processed by BACE1 and γ-secretase in lipid rafts. Despite the accumulating evidence, cleavage of APP by BACE1 in non-raft membrane regions cannot be unambiguously ruled out because of the paucity of full-length APP (APP FL) and BACE1 in DRM isolated from adult brain and cultured cells (41Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Kim S.H. Chen Y. Barnes N.Y. Parent A.T. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25892-25900Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently reported that moderate reduction of cholesterol (<25%) displaces BACE1 from raft domains, and increases BACE1 processing by promoting the membrane proximity of BACE1 and APP in non-raft domains (34Abad-Rodriguez J. Ledesma M.D. Craessaerts K. Perga S. Medina M. Delacourte A. Dingwall C. De Strooper B. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 167: 953-960Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this study also found that BACE1 processing of APP is inhibited with further loss of cholesterol (>35%), consistent with earlier studies (32Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1998; 95: 6460-6464Google Scholar, 33Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 160: 113-123Google Scholar). Nevertheless, given the pleiotropic effects of cholesterol depletion on membrane properties and vesicular trafficking of secretory and endocytic proteins (42Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1999; 10: 961-974Google Scholar, 43Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol.

Traffic.. 2006; 7: 917-926Google Scholar), unequivocal conclusions regarding BACE1 processing of APP in lipid rafts cannot be reached based on cholesterol depletion studies. In this study, we explored the function of BACE1 in lipid raft microdomains without manipulating cellular cholesterol levels. In addition to the previously reported S-palmitoylation sites (Cys478/Cys482/Cys485) within the cytosolic tail of BACE1 (19Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Google Scholar), we have identified a fourth site (Cys474) within the transmembrane domain of BACE1 that undergoes S-palmitoylation. A BACE1 mutant with Ala substitution of all four Cys residues (BACE1-4C/A) fails to associate with DRM in cultured cells, but is not otherwise different from wtBACE1 in terms of protein stability, maturation, or subcellular localization. Surprisingly, APP processing and Aβ generation were unaffected in cells stably expressing the BACE1-4C/A mutant. Finally, we observed an increase in the levels of APP CTFs in detergent-soluble fractions of BACE1-4C/A as compared with wtBACE1 cells. Thus, our data collectively indicate a non-obligatory role of S-palmitoylation and lipid raft localization of BACE1 in amyloidogenic processing of APP. cDNA Constructs—Plasmids encoding C-terminal FLAG-tagged wtBACE1 and 3C/A (C478A/C482A/C485A) (19Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Google Scholar) and hemagglutinin-tagged Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC)-rich protein acyltransferases (PATs) have been described (48Fukata M. Fukata Y. Adesnik H. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Neuron.. 2004; 44: 987-996Google Scholar). A plasmid containing placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) cDNA was obtained from ATCC (clone MGC-5096). BACE1-3C/A cDNA was used as the template to generate BACE1-4C/A (C474A/C478A/C482A/C485A) by PCR mutagenesis, and the amplified segment was verified by sequencing. BACE1-GPI cDNA was constructed by overlap PCR by replacing the transmembrane and C-terminal sequences of BACE1 with the GPI anchor domain from PLAP. For retroviral expression, the cDNAs were subcloned into retroviral vector, pMXpuro (provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Japan) or pLHCX (Clonetech). To construct a retroviral vector for low-level transgene expression (pMXpuroIRES), we cloned the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from pIRES (Clontech) downstream of the puromycin resistance cassette in pMX vector. BACE1 cDNAs were then subcloned downstream of the IRES. Retroviral Infections and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—BACE1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) have been previously described (49Li T. Ma G. Cai H. Price D.L. Wong P.C. J. Neurosci.. 2003; 23: 3272-3277Google Scholar). N2a cells stably expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged wtAPP (N2a 695.13) and APPSwe (N2a Swe.10) have been described previously (24Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Google Scholar). The Plat-E retroviral packaging cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura (University of Tokyo, Japan). Retroviral infections were performed as described previously (50Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol.. 1996; 24: 324-329Google Scholar). Briefly, retroviral supernatants collected 48 h after transfection of Plat-E cells with expression vectors were used to infect BACE1-/- MEF or N2a cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene. Stably transduced pools of MEF, N2a 695.13, or Swe.10 cells were selected in the presence of 4 μg/ml puromycin or hygromycin (400 μg/ml). Antibodies—BACE1 was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-BACE1 (residues 46–163 (4Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D. Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat.

Rabbit polyclonal antiserum CTM1 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of APP followed by the c-Myc epitope (MEQKLISEEDLN). Rabbit polyclonal PS1NT antiserum (residues 1–65) has been described (51Thinakaran G. Regard J.B. Bouton C.M. Harris C.L. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Neurobiol.

The following mAbs were purchased from commercial sources: GM130, syntaxin 6, flotillin-2, γ-adaptin, EEA1 (BD Biosciences), anti-hemagglutinin (clone 16B12) and 4G8 (Covance), and mAb 5228 (Chemicon). Lipid Raft Fractionation—Lipid rafts were isolated from 0.5% Lubrol WX (Lubrol 17A17; Serva) lysates of cultured cells by discontinuous flotation density gradients as described previously (40Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Lin W. Sakurai T. Li T. Nukina N. Wong P.C. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 44945-44954Google Scholar, 41Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Kim S.H. Chen Y. Barnes N.Y. Parent A.T. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25892-25900Google Scholar). For the analysis of cell surface rafts, subconfluent cultures were surface biotinylated with NHS S-S biotin (Pierce) as described previously (24Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Google Scholar) and then subjected to lipid raft fractionation. Cell surface-biotinylated proteins in gradient fractions were captured with streptavidin beads (Pierce) and analyzed by immunoblotting. For quantifications, optimal exposures of Western blots were analyzed by standard densitometry, and a transmission calibration step tablet (Stouffer Industries, Inc.) was used to convert raw optical densities to relative fold-differences in signal intensity using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Protein Analyses—Metabolic and pulse-chase labeling using [35S]Met/Cys were performed essentially as described (24Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Google Scholar, 53Vetrivel K.S. Gong P. Bowen J.W. Cheng H. Chen Y. Carter M. Nguyen P.D. Placanica L. Wieland F.T. Li Y.M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. Mol. Neurodegener.. 2007; 2: 4Google Scholar). To assess the stability of BACE1, parallel dishes were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 250 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (MP Biomedicals) and chased for various time points. BACE1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-BACE1 antibody. For analysis of APP, cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min or continuously labeled for 3 h. Full-length APP and APP CTFs were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using CTM1 antibody. Aβ and p3 fragments were immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium using mAb 4G8. β-CTFs (starting at +1 residue of Aβ) were identified by probing the blots with mAb 26D6. Aβ, sAPPα, and sAPPβ Measurements—Conditioned media were collected 48 h after plating the cells and the levels of secreted Aβ and sAPPα were quantified by ELISA as described previously (53Vetrivel K.S. Gong P. Bowen J.W. Cheng H. Chen Y. Carter M. Nguyen P.D. Placanica L. Wieland F.T. Li Y.M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. Mol. Neurodegener.. 2007; 2: 4Google Scholar). Aβ1–40, Aβx-40, and Aβ1-x were measured using specific sandwich ELISAs. Aβ peptides were captured using mAb B113 for Aβ1–40 and Aβx-40 ELISA, and mAb B436 for Aβ1-x ELISA. Bound peptides were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mAb B436 for Aβ1–40 ELISA or biotinylated mAb 4G8 in combination with the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase complex for Aβx-40 and Aβ1-x ELISA. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using CSPD-Sapphire II Luminescence Substrate (Applied Biosystems) and relative luminescence unit values were measured using a standard 96-well luminometer. Each sample was assayed in duplicate using appropriate dilution of the conditioned media so that the relative luminescent units were in the linear range of the standards included on each plate. Synthetic Aβ40 peptide (Bachem) was diluted in culture medium to generate standard curve (ranging from 1 to 1000 pg/well). sAPPα was quantified by sandwich ELISA using mAb 5228 for capture and mAb B436 for detection, and quantified using a standard curve prepared using affinity-purified sAPPα as described (53Vetrivel K.S. Gong P. Bowen J.W. Cheng H. Chen Y. Carter M. Nguyen P.D. Placanica L. Wieland F.T. Li Y.M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. Mol. Neurodegener.. 2007; 2: 4Google Scholar). sAPPβ was quantified using a commercial sβAPP wild-type ELISA kit and Meso Scale Sector Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) for detection following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Captured sAPPβ was quantified by comparing the signals of the samples to a standard curve included on each plate prepared using recombinant sAPPβ in complete medium. Analysis of BACE1 Palmitoylation—COS7 cells were cotransfected with BACE1 and DHHC plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and labeled 48 h after transfection. Stable pools of BACE1-/- MEF and N2a cells were grown to subconfluence prior to labeling. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and labeled for 4 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [10,11-3H]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) diluted in the preincubation medium. Cells were scrapped in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Roche Protease Inhibitor Mixture 1X), and sonicated for 30 s on ice. Aliquots of lysates (adjusted to trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity) were incubated overnight with 2 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody to immunoprecipitate BACE1. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and [3H]palmitic acid-labeled BACE1 was detected by PhosphorImager analysis (GE Healthcare). The membranes were subsequently subject to Western blotting with FLAG M2 antibody (1:20,000) to reveal total immunoprecipitated BACE1. To compare the relative efficiencies of BACE1 palmitoylation by each DHHC, the ratio between [3H]palmitic acid-labeled BACE1 and immunoblot BACE1 signal intensities were quantified using Image J software. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Polyclonal BACE1 antiserum 7523 and mAb against γ-adaptin or transferrin receptor were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20, and incubated with fixed cells at room temperature for 2 h.

https://openalex.org/W2133627468,"Several cohort studies reported a relation of cardiovascular events and periodontal disease. In particular, Porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with the development of atherosclerotic plaques. We verified in a longitudinal study whether inflammation biomarkers, endothelial adhesion molecules, leukocyte activation markers, and intima-media thickness could be beneficially modified by periodontal treatment alone. Thirty-five otherwise healthy individuals affected by mild to moderate parodontopathy were enrolled in the study. Echo-Doppler cardiography of the carotid artery, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses on lymphocytes and monocytes, and plasma inflammatory indices were evaluated at baseline and at multiple time points after the periodontal treatment. Results showed that inflammation biomarkers were abnormally increased at baseline. Periodontal treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the total oral bacterial load that was associated with a significant amelioration of inflammation biomarkers and of adhesion and activation proteins. Notably, intima-media thickness was significantly diminished after treatment. Inflammatory alterations associated with the genesis of atherosclerotic plaques are detected in otherwise healthy individuals affected by parodontopathy and are positively influenced by periodontal treatment. Reduction of oral bacterial load results in a modification of an anatomical parameter directly responsible for atherosclerosis. These results shed light on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and could have practical implications for public health."
https://openalex.org/W2007161969,"Ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma frequently express both mesothelin and CA125 (also known as MUC16) at high levels on the cell surface. The interaction between mesothelin and CA125 may facilitate the implantation and peritoneal spread of tumors by cell adhesion, whereas the detailed nature of this interaction is still unknown. Here, we used truncated mutagenesis and alanine replacement techniques to identify a binding site on mesothelin for CA125. We examined the molecular interaction by Western blot overlay assays and further quantitatively analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also evaluated the binding on cancer cells by flow cytometry. We identified the region (296-359) consisting of 64 amino acids at the N-terminal of cell surface mesothelin as the minimum fragment for complete binding activity to CA125. We found that substitution of tyrosine 318 with an alanine abolished CA125 binding. Replacement of tryptophan 321 and glutamic acid 324 with alanine could partially decrease binding to CA125, whereas mutation of histidine 354 had no effect. These results indicate that a conformation-sensitive structure of the region (296-359) is required and sufficient for the binding of mesothelin to CA125. In addition, we have shown that a single chain monoclonal antibody (SS1) recognizes this CA125-binding domain and blocks the mesothelin-CA125 interaction on cancer cells. The identified CA125-binding domain significantly inhibits cancer cell adhesion and merits evaluation as a new therapeutic agent for preventing or treating peritoneal malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2033835940,"Recently, this laboratory identified a proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), with optimal activity at low pH. PCFT is critical to intestinal folate absorption and transport into the central nervous system because there are loss-of-function mutations in this gene in the autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary folate malabsorption. The current study addresses the role PCFT might play in another transport pathway, folate receptor (FR)-mediated endocytosis. FRα cDNA was transfected into novel PCFT+ and PCFT– HeLa sublines. FRα was shown to bind and trap folates in vesicles but with minimal export into the cytosol in PCFT– cells. Cotransfection of FRα and PCFT resulted in enhanced folate transport into cytosol as compared with transfection of FRα alone. Probenecid did not inhibit folate binding to FR, but inhibited PCFT-mediated transport at endosomal pH, and blocked FRα-mediated transport into the cytosol. FRα and PCFT co-localized to the endosomal compartment. These observations (i) indicate that PCFT plays a role in FRα-mediated endocytosis by serving as a route of export of folates from acidified endosomes and (ii) provide a functional role for PCFT in tissues in which it is expressed, such as the choroid plexus, where the extracellular milieu is at neutral pH.

Hence, the failure to absorb folates in the absence of this transporter in HFM is expected. However, PCFT expression, and its associated folate transport activity at low pH, is observed in many tissues where the transport interface is presumed to be at pH 7.4 (12Zhao R. Goldman I.D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the mechanism by which PCFT mediates transport of folates into the central nervous system (CNS) where this transporter is expressed in brain and choroid plexus (1Qiu A.

Transport into the CNS is impaired in patients with HFM who have very low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) folate levels and marked reversal of the blood:CSF folate gradient which is normally 2–3:1 (5Geller J. Kronn D. Jayabose S. Sandoval C. Medicine (Baltimore). 2002; 81: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Folates are also transported into cells by a receptor-mediated process. Folate receptor-α (FRα) is anchored to cell membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol domain. Uptake begins with folate binding to receptor at the cell surface followed by invagination of the membrane and the formation of endosomes that traffic along microtubules to a perinuclear compartment before returning to the plasma membrane (14Anderson R.G.W.

The experimental approach utilized a series of HeLa sublines, developed in this laboratory, in which constitutive expression of FRα is negligible. HeLa R5 cells lack reduced folate carrier (RFC) function due to a genomic deletion of this gene (23Zhao R. Gao F. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A derivative of R5 cells, HeLa R1-11 cells lack, in addition, PCFT expression, while an R1-11 revertant re-expresses PCFT (24Zhao R. Chattopadhyay S. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8735-8742Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The impact of PCFT on FRα-mediated endocytosis, achieved by transfection of the receptor into these cell lines, was assessed under conditions in which there was negligible PCFT-mediated transport directly across the plasma membrane into cells. Chemicals—[3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid, [3′,5′,7,9-3H](6S)-5-methylTHF (5-methyltetrahydrofolate), [3′,5′,7-3H(N)]MTX (methotrexate) and [3′,5′,7, 9-3H(N)](6S)-5-formylTHF (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Folic acid was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and MTX was obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Both (6S)5-formylTHF and (6S)5-methylTHF were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Tritiated compounds were purified before use by liquid chromatography. Cells and Culture Conditions—The HeLa R5 cell line is a HeLa subline in which RFC was deleted from the genome under MTX selective pressure (23Zhao R. Gao F. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HeLa R1 cells were derived from HeLa R5 cells under a second round of MTX selective pressure and lack, in addition, PCFT expression (24Zhao R. Chattopadhyay S. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8735-8742Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). R1-11 cells are a clonal derivative of R1 cells. R1-11R cells are revertants of R1-11 cells in which PCFT expression was regained progressively after culture in MTX-free medium over six months. While R1-11 and R1-11R cells are G418-resistant, R5 cells are G418-sensitive. All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Expression Vectors and Transfection—The coding region of C-terminal HA-tagged PCFT was cloned into pZeoSV2(+) (zeocin resistant) as described previously to obtain HA-PCFT-pZeoSV(+) and expression was driven by the SV40 promoter (25Zhao R. Qiu A. Tsai E. Jansen M. Akabas M.H. Goldman I.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Human FRα cDNA in pcDNA1 was a gift from Dr. Manohar Ratnam and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (hygromycin-resistant) with HindIII and XbaI to obtain FRα-pCDNA3.1. These expression vectors were transfected, alone or in combination, into HeLa R5, R1-11, R1-11R, or their clonal derivatives using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The stable clones were selected in the presence of hygromycin (0.3 mg/ml) alone or in combination with zeocin (0.1 mg/ml). Folic Acid Surface Binding—Cells were seeded in 12-well plates, transient transfection was conducted on the second day, and cells were allowed to grow for two more days to reach near confluence. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold acid buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.5 with acetic acid) followed by a wash with ice-cold HBS (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm dextrose, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). To assess FRα protein at the cell surface, cells were incubated for 15 min with 5 nm [3H]folic acid in ice-cold HBS in the presence or absence of 5 μm nonlabeled folic acid (1000-fold in excess of [3H]folic acid) as previously reported (13Wollack J.B. Makori B. Ahlawat S. Koneru R. Picinich S.C. Smith A. Goldman I.D. Qiu A. Cole P.D. Glod J. Kamen B. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After three ice-cold HBS washes, membrane-bound [3H]folic acid was released with the addition of the acid buffer (0.5 ml) and radioactivity in solution measured. The cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 n NaOH, and 10 μl of cell lysate were used for protein determination with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Assessment of PCFT Functional Activity—PCFT activity was determined by assessment of the initial rate of [3H]MTX uptake across the plasma membrane at a pH of 5.5, which is optimal for this transporter. In some experiments initial uptake was assessed at the higher endosomal pH. Cells grown in liquid scintillation vials were washed twice with HBS and incubated in the same buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. The incubation buffer was then aspirated, and transport was initiated by the addition of 0.5 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) MBS (20 mm MES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 5.5) containing 0.5 μm [3H]MTX at 37 °C. After 2 min, uptake was quenched by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold HBS. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBS and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 m NaOH at 65 °C for 40 min. Radioactivity in 0.4 ml of lysate was measured on a liquid scintillation spectrometer and normalized to the protein level. FRα-mediated Transport and Uptake into Cytoplasm versus Membrane Vesicles—Cells grown in 12-well plates were washed twice with acid buffer (pH 3.5) and then once with ice-cold HBS (pH 8.0). The cells were then incubated with 0.5 ml of pre-warmed HBS (pH 8.0) containing 50 nm tritiated folate substrates in the presence or absence of 1 μm nonlabeled folic acid at 37 °C for 1 h. At this pH, transport directly across the plasma membrane mediated by PCFT is minimized and transport measured is due predominantly to FRα-mediated endocytosis. Following cessation of uptake, the incubation buffers were removed and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold acid buffer (pH 3.5) and twice with ice-cold HBS (pH 8.0). For each wash, cells were incubated with the washing buffer for 5 min or longer. Total tritium accumulated in cells was determined as described above for the transport studies. To discriminate between uptake into vesicles and cytosol, cells were treated with 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing 1 μm nonlabeled folic acid for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were then detached from the plates by a cell lifter, and the suspension centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated from the pellet, which was then dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.2 m NaOH. Radioactivity and the amount of protein in both the supernatant and pellet were determined. Immunohistochemical Localization of PCFT in the Choroid Plexus—Sections of C57BL/6 mouse brain were obtained by a protocol approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Hahneman Medical College, Philadelphia, PA. Brain was prepared by standard procedures and 5-μm thickness cryosections were obtained from cerebrum to medulla oblongata. Sections were dried at room temperature, fixed in cold acetone for 10 min, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersion of slides into 3% H2O2 for 15 min. After rinsing with PBS three times, slides were incubated with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 30 min before loading a polyclonal anti-mouse PCFT antibody (7Qiu A. Min S.H. Jansen M. Malhotra U. Tsai E. Cabelof D.C. Matherly L.H. Zhao R. Akabas M.H. Goldman I.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C1669-C1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with incubation overnight at 4 °C. Control slides were treated in the same way without anti-serum. Each slide was then washed three times with PBS buffer, incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG, then washed three times. The reaction was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted in cytoseal™ 280. The anti-MmPCFT antibody, directed to a peptide ([C]EKVNPHPEFQQFPQSP) corresponding to amino acids 446–459 of the protein, were affinity-purified with the SulfolinkTrial Kit (Pierce) as previously reported (7Qiu A. Min S.H. Jansen M. Malhotra U. Tsai E. Cabelof D.C. Matherly L.H. Zhao R. Akabas M.H. Goldman I.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C1669-C1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of PCFT and FRα in R1-11 Transfectants—Stable clones of R1-11-FR2-PCFT and R1-11-FR2-Mock were generated by transfection of HA-PCFT-pZeoSV2(+) or pZeoSV2(+) into R1-11-FR2 cells. Cells grown on slides were washed with sterile PBS and incubated with folate-AlexaFluor 488 (26He W. Wang H. Hartmann L.C. Cheng J.X. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11760-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing to remove unbound folate-AlexaFluor 488, cells were incubated in growth medium for 1, 2, or 4 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and 0.05% sodium azide to quench unreacted aldehydes, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 0.1 m glycine, 0.05% sodium azide for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed and permeabilized cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05 m glycine, 0.2% fish gelatin, and 0.05% sodium azide (blocking solution) and incubated in the same solution for a minimum of 60 min before exposure to anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Sigma) for 40 min. After washing with the blocking solution, cells were probed with anti-rabbit rhodamine red-x to label PCFT (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Before observation, cells were coated with M800 Aqua Mount (Fisher Scientific Co, Pittsburgh, PA) and covered with a microscope coverslip before sealing with nail polish. Confocal images were acquired using a Radiance 2100 MP Rainbow (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, England) on a TE2000 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) inverted microscope using a 60× oil 1.4 NA lens. The rhodamine red X was excited at 543 nm using the green HeNe laser and fluorescence emission greater than 570 nm was collected. The AlexaFluor 488 signal was excited using the 488-nm line of the 4-line argon laser and emission between 500 and 540 nm was collected. Effects of Stable Transfection of FRα into PCFT-competent R5 and PCFT-deficient R1-11 Cells on Surface Binding and Folate Transport—FRα was stably expressed in PCFT-deficient R1-11 cells and PCFT-competent R5 cells, both of which lack genomic RFC. One clone from each transfected cell line (R1-11-FR2 and R5-FR12) was selected for further study because they had a similar level of folate receptor expression as assessed by folic acid binding to the cell surface (panel A, Fig. 1). PCFT functional expression, assessed by [3H]MTX influx at pH 5.5, was comparable in R5 and R5-FR12 cells but negligible in R1-11 and R1-11-FR2 cells (panel B, Fig. 1). FRα-mediated transport was then determined with 50 nm 5-[3H]methylTHF at pH 8.0. As indicated in panel C, Fig. 1, uptake was increased as a function of incubation time and was markedly higher in both FRα transfectants than in their recipient cells; there was no significant difference in uptake between R5-FR12 and R1-11-FR2 cells. At this pH, transport directly across the plasma membrane mediated by PCFT, as assessed in FRα-negative cells, was negligible. 5-[3H]MethylTHF transport in the transfectants was almost completely abolished by the co-addition of 1 μm nonlabeled folic acid, indicating that transport was mediated solely by FRα under these conditions (panel D of Fig. 1). While the total levels of 5-[3H]methylTHF accumulated in R5-FR12 and R1-11-FR2 cells were the same, the distribution between the vesicle and cytoplasm compartments were different as indicated in the next section. Assessment of Folate Uptake into Cytosolic and Vesicular Compartments—FRα-mediated transport involves a sequence of events in which the folate is first bound to receptor, following which the receptor-folate-plasma membrane complex invaginates to form an endosome that traffics within the cytoplasm. During the latter phase, the endosome acidifies, folate dissociates from the receptor, and is exported from the intact endosome into the cytoplasm. Studies were conducted to discriminate between folates localized to membrane vesicles and folates in the cytosol. Uptake was assessed with 50 nm [3H]folic acid at pH 8.0 to minimize direct transport across the plasma membrane mediated by PCFT. Folic acid has the highest affinity for FRα among the folates. In fact, the affinity of folic acid for the receptor is so high, that folic acid does not significantly dissociate from the receptor at the pH achieved in the acidified endosome (15Kamen B.A. Smith A.K. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2004; 56: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). After completion of the uptake interval, cells were ruptured by hypotonic buffer and vesicles were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation. As indicated in the upper panel of Fig. 2, uptake of folic acid in the cytosol of R1-11-FR2 and R5-FR12 cells was small in comparison to the component in the vesicles, consistent with vesicular trapping of this substrate (18Kamen B.A. Wang M.-T. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13602-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, these fractions were well separated under these conditions. Consistent with transport mediated primarily by FRα, uptake into vesicles was markedly suppressed by the co-addition of 1 μm nonlabeled folic acid. After subtracting the FRα-independent fraction, folic acid trapped in vesicles was 30% greater in R5-FR12 cells than in R1-11-FR2 cells (p = 0.04). There was also a small increase (p = 0.02) in cytosolic uptake of folic acid in the R5-FR12 cells compared with R1-11-FR2 cells. The partition of tritiated 5-methylTHF or 5-formylTHF between cytosol and vesicles was also determined after the same cell lines were exposed to 50 nm levels of these substrates for 1 h at pH 8.0. These folates have a relatively lower affinity for FRα than folic acid and dissociate from FRα at endosomal pH (15Kamen B.A. Smith A.K. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2004; 56: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As indicated in the middle panel of Fig. 2, cytosolic 5-methylTHF in R5-FR12 cells was 6.7-fold greater than that in R1-11-FR2 cells (p = 0.04). While vesicular 5-MTHF was less in the R5-FR12 line, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.24). The same pattern was also seen with 5-formylTHF (bottom panel of Fig. 2). Cytosolic 5-formylTHF in R5-FR12 cells was 7-fold greater than in R1-11-FR2 cells (p = 0.02), whereas vesicular 5-formylTHF in R5-FR12 cells was about half that in R1-11-FR2 cells; in this case, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.04). In R5-FR12 cells, the 5-formylTHF level in the cytosol exceeded that in vesicles. Hence, FRα-mediated uptake of 5-formylTHF and 5-methylTHF into the cytosol was far greater in the PCFT+ than PCFT– cells. Based upon these findings, 5-formylTHF appeared to be the best substrate for assessment of FRα-mediated transport and was chosen for subsequent studies. Effect of Probenecid on FRα-mediated Transport—Probenecid has been reported to inhibit FRα-mediated transport without affecting folate binding to the receptor (20Kamen B.A. Smith A.K. Anderson R.G.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1442-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that probenecid suppresses export of folates from endosomes. The effect of probenecid (3 mm) on FRα-mediated transport was determined with 50 nm 5-[3H]formylTHF in R5-FR12 cells at pH 8.0 over 1 h. As shown in Fig. 3, probenecid inhibited uptake of 5-formylTHF into the cytosol by 75% (p = 0.015) while increasing the level in vesicles by 36% (p = 0.007), consistent with suppression of export from endosomes. Next, the effect of 3 mm probenecid on PCFT-mediated transport across the plasma membrane was determined in R5-FR12 cells at pH 6.5, which approximates the intravesicular pH of FRα-containing endosomes (17Yang J. Chen H. Vlahov I.R. Cheng J.X. Low P.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As indicated in the inset of Fig. 3, PCFT-mediated transport, assayed with [3H]MTX was suppressed by 75%. Effect of Transient Expression of FRα in R1-11 and R1-11R Cells on 5-FormylTHF Transport—To avoid the clonal variability associated with stable transfectants, transient transfection was performed to further assess the impact of PCFT on FRα-mediated transport. The transfection recipients were the PCFT-deficient R1-11 line and the R1-11R revertant; in the latter, constitutive PCFT expression had been restored. As indicated in panel A of Fig. 4, the level of PCFT activity (assessed with [3H]MTX at pH 5.5) regained in R1-11R cells was close to that of R5 cells. FRα expression, as assessed by surface binding, was similar in the R1-11 and R1-11R FRα transfectants (panel B, Fig. 4). 5-[3H]FormylTHF transport mediated by FRα is illustrated in panel C of Fig. 4. There was no significant transport in the mock transfectants, R1-11-Mock and R1-11R-Mock. 5-FormylTHF transport into cytosol was 3.5-fold greater (p = 0.001) in R1-11R-FR cells than in R1-11-FR cells; vesicular 5-formylTHF levels were comparable. Hence, the presence of PCFT augmented FRα-mediated 5-formylTHF transport into cytosol in R1-11R revertants in which near constitutive levels of PCFT function were restored. Effect of Transient Co-expression of PCFT and FRα in R1-11 Cells—Using another approach to assess the impact of PCFT on FRα-mediated transport activity, uptake of 5-[3H]formylTHF was assessed in R1-11 cells transfected with FRα and co-transfected with either PCFT or the vector alone (Mock). PCFT-mediated transport across the plasma membrane, measured at pH 6.5, was 10-fold higher in the FR-α, PCFT+ transfectant than in the FR-α mock transfectant (panel A, Fig. 5). While FRα expression was similar in the two transfectants (panel B, Fig. 5), PCFT increased FRα-mediated transport of 5-[3H]formylTHF at pH 8.0 into the cytosol by a factor of 2.4 (p = 0.014) and decreased the 5-formylTHF level in vesicles by 25% (p = 0.019) compared with the mock-transfected, PCFT– cells (panel C, Fig. 5). Localization of PCFT in Murine Choroid Plexus; Co-localization of FRα and PCFT within HeLa R1-11 Cells Stably Transfected with PCFT—Localization of PCFT in murine choroid plexus was examined by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal anti-MmPCFT antibody. As indicated in Fig. 6, PCFT was localized to the basolateral membrane of choroid plexus. Localization at the subcellular level was assessed using folic acid linked to Alexa Fluor 488, which binds to FRα at the cell surface, following which the complex enters cells by endocytosis, and is retained within endosomes. Endogenous PCFT was visualized using an anti-HA antibody. These studies employed the R1-11-FR2 cells stably transfected with PCFT containing an HA insert in the C terminus. Three different cells are portrayed in Fig. 7. The folic acid-AlexaFluor488 (green) is visualized in dense clusters within the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear endosomal compartment, and as punctuate staining within the plasma membrane. PCFT (green) is similarly located. Co-localization is indicated by the yellow coloration when the two images were overlaid. Of particular note is the co-localization in the plasma membrane, the perinuclear endosomal compartment, and within endosomes as seen in the higher magnification.FIGURE 7Subcellular co-localization of folate-AlexaFluor 488 and PCFT. R1-11-FR2 cells stably transfected with human PCFT were incubated with 100 nm folate-AlexaFluor 488 for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing to remove unbound folate-AlexaFluor 488, cells were incubated in fresh medium for 1 h before fixation and examination by confocal micr"

In this study, we report that viperin specifically localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and that an amphipathic α-helix at its N terminus is necessary for the ER localization of viperin and sufficient to promote ER localization of a reporter protein, dsRed. Overexpression of intact viperin but not the amphipathic α-helix fused to dsRed induced crystalloid ER. Consistent with other proteins that induce crystalloid ER, viperin self-associates, and it does so independently of the amphipathic α-helix. Viperin expression also affected the transport of soluble but not membrane-associated proteins. Expression of intact viperin or an N-terminal α-helix-dsRed fusion protein significantly reduced secretion of soluble alkaline phosphatase and reduced its rate of ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Similarly, viperin expression inhibited bulk protein secretion and secretion of endogenous α1-antitrypsin and serum albumin from HepG2 cells. Converting hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal α-helix to acidic residues partially or completely restored normal transport of soluble alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that the extended amphipathic nature of the N-terminal α-helical domain is essential for inhibiting protein secretion.

Type I interferons are the first line of defense against viral infections. The significance of the interferon pathway is illustrated by the susceptibility of interferon signaling mutants to infection and by viral mechanisms that counteract this pathway (1Katze M.G. He Y. Gale Jr., M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 2Haller O. Kochs G. Weber F. Virology. 2006; 344: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Although many genes are induced upon interferon stimulation, very few of these genes have been functionally characterized. Viperin is highly induced by both Type I and II interferons and has a broad range of antiviral activity, inhibiting DNA viruses, notably human cytomegalovirus (3Chin K.C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15125-15130Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); RNA viruses such as influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV), 2The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; SeAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; WT, wild-type. and alphaviruses (4Wang X.

Brosnan C.F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4735-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Upon expression, viperin localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it interacts with farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis. This interaction appears to result in the disruption of lipid raft microdomains and prevention of influenza virus from budding from the plasma membrane (4Wang X. Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have explored the antiviral functions of viperin, the general biochemical properties of this protein remain largely undefined. Viperin is highly conserved across both mammals and lower vertebrates and shares homology with the MoaA family of “radical S-adenosylmethionine” enzymes that bind Fe-S clusters (3Chin K.C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15125-15130Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 8Jiang D. Guo H. Xu C. Chang J. Gu B. Wang L. Block T.M. Guo J.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1665-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to a putative Fe-S cluster-binding domain, viperin has a 42-amino acid residue N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, and similar domains in other proteins have been shown to bind membranes and induce membrane curvature (9Antonny B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L. Nature. 2005; 438: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of the viperin N-terminal α-helical domain in both cellular localization and ER membrane morphology and analyzed the biochemical properties of viperin. We discovered that viperin forms dimers and induces a tightly ordered, visually striking array of ER membranes, known as crystalloid ER(11Fukuda M. Yamamoto A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41112-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), upon overexpression. In addition, viperin expression impedes the secretion of a variety of soluble proteins. Although the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix is not sufficient to induce crystalloid ER formation, it is both necessary and sufficient to mediate ER localization and to inhibit protein secretion. Cells, Antibodies, and Constructs—HepG2, HeLa, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% bovine calf serum. The following antibodies were purchased commercially: anti-placental alkaline phosphatase (ab11299), anti-α1-antitrypsin (ab7633), anti-human serum albumin (ab18079), and anti-Myc (ab9106) (Abcam) and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) tag (HA.11; Covance). MaP.VIP and rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (4Wang X. Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and the mouse anti-tapasin monoclonal antibody PaSta1(14Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were described previously. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies were purchased commercially from Molecular Probes. All viperin constructs were generated by PCR amplification and then cloned into pcDNA3.1. The dsRed gene cassette was excised from pDsRed-Monomer (Clontech) using restriction enzyme digestion and then cloned into pcDNA3.1 with or without residues 1-42 of viperin. The pRSVPAP construct, which encodes placental alkaline phosphatase, was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The construct encoding TAP1 (transporter associated with antigen processing subunit 1) fused to Cherry at its C terminus was a kind gift from Dr. David Stepensky (Ben-Gurion University, Beersheba, Israel). Constructs encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase (SeAP) and Sar1 and Arf1 dominant negatives were kind gifts from Dr. Jon Kagan (Harvard University). The expression construct encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein temperature-sensitive ts045 mutant (15Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). Transfection—Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blotting—Cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and then probed with the indicated antibodies. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells or 293T cells transiently expressing wild-type (WT) viperin, viperin lacking the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix (viperin-(Δ1-42)), or viperin bearing mutations in the α-helix were plated onto glass coverslips. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, washed, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin or 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with the indicated antibodies. For selective plasma membrane permeabilization, cells were treated with 22 μg/ml streptolysin O (Aalto) in the presence of 0.3 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min on ice, washed in intracellular transport buffer (50 mm HEPES, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 8.37 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm EGTA), and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After permeabilization, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and then stained with the indicated antibodies in intracellular transport buffer. Electron Microscopy—293T cells transiently expressing the vector control, WT viperin, or viperin-(1-42)-dsRed were examined by electron microscopy as described previously (4Wang X. Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.25 m HEPES, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature and then in 8% paraformaldehyde in 0.25 m HEPES, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. Samples were prepared for immunochemistry as described previously (16Folsch H. Pypaert M. Maday S. Pelletier L. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and stained with MaP.VIP and 10 nm of protein A-gold (Cell Microscopy Center, Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Sections were examined with a Tecnai 12 Biotwin electron microscope, and images were captured using a charge-coupled device camera (Morada, Olympus). SeAP Assay—293T cells were cotransfected with SeAP and the indicated viperin constructs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cell supernatants were harvested and analyzed for SeAP secretion by an alkaline phosphatase assay using the Phospha-Light system (Applied Biosystems) and a luminometer. Radiolabeling and Pulse-Chase Analysis—Transiently transfected 293T cells or HepG2 cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine or cysteine (Sigma) containing 3% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were labeled for the indicated times with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum and excess methionine and cysteine. Cells and supernatants were harvested at the indicated times and stored at -20 °C until detergent lysis. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice. For radiolabeled cells, extracts were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and normal rabbit serum and then immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed, eluted in reducing sample buffer, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens for quantification with ImageQuant software. For viperin co-immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were precleared with protein G-Sepharose, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or control antibody, and then blotted with anti-Myc antibody. The N-terminal Amphipathic α-Helix Is Necessary and Sufficient to Localize Viperin to the Cytoplasmic Face of the ER—Although previous studies have shown that viperin localizes to the ER, the precise topology and the ER localization signal of viperin were not identified. To determine whether viperin localizes to the cytosolic or lumenal face of the ER, we used streptolysin O to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, followed by staining with the anti-viperin monoclonal antibody MaP.VIP. An anti-tapasin antibody that recognizes a lumenal ER epitope and an anti-calnexin antibody that recognizes a cytosolic epitope were used as controls. Under these conditions, viperin and calnexin staining was readily observed, whereas the ER lumenal epitope of tapasin was detected only after saponin permeabilization (Fig. 1A). This demonstrated that viperin was localized to the cytosolic face of the ER. To identify the domain responsible, we focused on the N-terminal α-helix because it has a wide hydrophobic face that is characteristic of helices that not only bind to the ER but also induce membrane curvature. First, to determine whether the α-helix is necessary for ER localization, we used immunofluorescence to examine cells expressing WT viperin or a deletion mutant lacking this domain (viperin-(Δ1-42)). WT viperin colocalized with ER resident proteins, namely human TAP1 fused to the fluorescent protein tag Cherry and calnexin, but removing the α-helix relocalized viperin to the cytosol (Fig. 1B). Adding the N-terminal α-helix of viperin to dsRed was also sufficient to relocalize this reporter protein from the cytosol and nucleus to the ER (Fig. 1C). Viperin Overexpression Induces Crystalloid ER—To confirm the ER localization of viperin, we used immunoelectron microscopy to examine 293T cells expressing viperin. We observed that these cells contained membranous structures highly similar to previously described crystalloid ER, characterized by the distortion of smooth ER membranes into a lattice-like pattern (Fig. 2A) (12Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 17Orci L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Garcia-Segura L.M. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1984; 36: 835-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the amphipathic α-helix-dsRed fusion protein did not induce these morphological changes (Fig. 2A), indicating that the α-helical domain is not sufficient to induce crystalloid ER. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that viperin was highly concentrated in these membranous areas in addition to normal ER (Fig. 2B). Further analysis of viperin-expressing cells by immunofluorescence using Triton X-100 rather than saponin for permeabilization confirmed that expression of WT viperin but not viperin-(Δ1-42) or the α-helix-dsRed fusion protein induced dramatically distorted ER structures, defined by the presence of calnexin (Fig. 2C). Viperin Forms Dimers Independently of the N-terminal Amphipathic α-Helix—Proteins that induce crystalloid ER are often dimeric (13Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and we therefore wished to determine whether viperin is capable of dimerization. Using Myc- and HA-tagged viperin expression vectors, we overexpressed these proteins in 293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation studies on detergent extracts. HA-tagged viperin co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged viperin but not with a Myc-tagged control protein, Rp14 (ribosomal protein 14) (Fig. 3). To determine whether this self-interaction requires the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, we performed similar co-immunoprecipitations with HA- and Myc-tagged viperin-(Δ1-42) truncation mutants. The viperin mutants were also capable of self-association, indicating that viperin dimerization or multimerization can occur independently of the amphipathic α-helical domain (Fig. 3). The N-terminal Amphipathic α-Helix Is Necessary and Sufficient to Inhibit Protein Secretion—To determine whether the viperin-induced morphological changes affected ER function, we examined protein trafficking in viperin-expressing cells. Viperin expression in HepG2 cells caused a reduction in protein secretion, as measured by the amount of 35S-labeled proteins secreted into the supernatant normalized to the total amount of 35S-labeled proteins in whole cell extracts. Although expression of the green fluorescent protein control had no effect on protein secretion relative to the vector control, viperin expression reduced total protein secretion from HepG2 cells to levels comparable with those observed in cells expressing dominant-negative Sar1 and Arf1 (Fig. 4A, Sar1dn and Arf1dn) previously shown to dramatically affect protein secretion (18Stephens D.J. Pepperkok R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By combining pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitations from cell supernatants and extracts, we specifically examined the secretion of endogenous albumin (Fig. 4B), α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 4C), and transferrin (data not shown) by 35S-labeled HepG2 cells and found that secretion of all three of these soluble proteins was significantly reduced in viperin-expressing cells. To determine whether the reduction in protein secretion was a direct consequence of crystalloid ER formation or a separate function associated with the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, we cotransfected various constructs into 293T cells along with the secreted version of placental alkaline phosphatase lacking the membrane anchor (SeAP) (20Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). SeAP secretion was assayed enzymatically, and intracellular transport was assessed using pulse-chase radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and endoglycosidase H digestion. The N-terminal amphipathic α-helix (amino acids 1-42) alone was able to reduce SeAP secretion to levels comparable with WT viperin, whereas secretion in cells expressing viperin-(Δ1-42) was comparable with that in cells expressing the vector control or the control protein Rp14 (Fig. 5A). Pulse-chase analysis of SeAP showed that that the amphipathic α-helical domain was both necessary and sufficient to inhibit the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of SeAP, measured by the rate of acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix fused to monomeric dsRed also inhibited SeAP secretion and significantly delayed the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance compared with the vector control or dsRed alone (Fig. 5, C and D). Although viperin expression affected the secretion of soluble proteins, there was no discernible effect on the intracellular trafficking rates of membrane-bound proteins. Using a temperature-sensitive variant of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (ts045), we found that the rate at which vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein arrived at the cell surface after shifting to the permissive temperature was comparable in viperin-expressing and control cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). Similarly, the rate at which placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is truncated before the transmembrane domain to yield the soluble SeAP reporter (20Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), arrived at the cell surface was unaffected in viperin-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). However, transport was significantly delayed by expression of the dominant-negative version of Sar1. Furthermore, viperin expression did not alter the ER-to-Golgi trafficking rates of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (data not shown) or placental alkaline phosphatase, as measured by the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance in radiolabel pulse-chase experiments, whereas dominant-negative versions of Sar1 and Arf1 effectively reduced the transport rate (supplemental Fig. 1C). Mutating Hydrophobic Residues in the Amphipathic α-Helix Restores Protein Secretion—Arrangement of the N-terminal domain of viperin into a helical wheel showed the classic amphipathic arrangement of residues, with hydrophobic amino acids localized on an extended face of the α-helix (Fig. 6A). To determine whether this face of the α-helix is involved in inhibiting protein secretion, specific hydrophobic residues were mutated to alanine or glutamic acid (circled in Fig. 6A), and charged arginine residues were mutated to serine (pink in Fig. 6A). Although mutating hydrophobic residues to alanine or charged arginine residues to serine did not alter the ability of viperin to inhibit protein secretion (data not shown), mutating hydrophobic residues to glutamic acid partially or completely restored protein secretion (Fig. 6B). Although none of the single glutamic acid substitutions affected the ER localization of viperin (supplemental Fig. 2), mutating three hydrophobic residues to glutamic acid disrupted ER association (Fig. 6C). In addition, sequentially deleting turns in the α-helix disrupted ER association, resulting in the progressive relocalization of viperin to the cytosol (supplemental Fig. 3). Viperin has a broad range of antiviral activity and is highly conserved in evolution, suggesting that it is functionally extremely important. As is the case for other interferon-induced antiviral proteins, the precise mechanism(s) of action of viperin remains largely unknown. To date, the only mechanistic information indicates an effect of viperin expression on lipid raft microdomains and a potential role for the conserved putative Fe-S-binding motif in HCV infection (4Wang X. Hinson E.R. Cresswell P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 8Jiang D. Guo H. Xu C. Chang J. Gu B. Wang L. Block T.M. Guo J.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1665-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified and examined the properties of the different domains of viperin. We showed that a region in the C-terminal domain is important for protein dimerization and that the N-terminal amphipathic α-helical domain is required for ER localization and interferes with the secretion of soluble proteins. Overexpression of viperin induced dramatic changes in ER morphology that are characteristic of crystalloid ER. Crystalloid ER is induced by a number of membrane-associated proteins (11Fukuda M. Yamamoto A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41112-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Current models for crystalloid ER formation propose that smooth ER is morphologically altered when the cytoplasmic domains of ER-bound proteins form high affinity dimers and bring apposing membranes together to form a lattice-like pattern of hexagonally packed tubules (11Fukuda M. Yamamoto A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41112-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we showed that viperin self-interacts to form multimers, likely to be dimers. The interaction occurred in viperin truncation mutants lacking the amphipathic α-helix, arguing that it is independent of the ER localization domain. However, preliminary size exclusion data (data not shown) obtained with purified, soluble, recombinant viperin lacking the N-terminal α-helical domain suggest that the extent of dimerization is low in solution; membrane association may enhance the tendency to multimerize by limiting movement to the plane of the membrane. We did not find that viperin expression and crystalloid ER formation induced the unfolded protein response, based on analysis of XBP-1 mRNA processing (data not shown) (21Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). Although crystalloid ER has dramatic effects on ER morphology, our data suggest that it is not responsible for the defects in protein secretion that we observed upon viperin expression. We also failed to find any effects on steady-state levels or localization of a number of ER resident proteins, including tapasin, calnexin, ERp57, and Grp94 (data not shown). Expressing a fusion protein containing the amphipathic α-helix N-terminal to monomeric dsRed did not induce crystalloid ER formation but still inhibited protein secretion to a level comparable with that observed with WT viperin. We hypothesize that the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix induces localized membrane curvature that is further exacerbated upon viperin dimerization via its C terminus to cause crystalloid ER formation. Previous reports have shown that amphipathic α-helices modulate membrane curvature (9Antonny B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L. Nature. 2005; 438: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar, 22Zimmerberg J. Kozlov M.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Specifically, amphipathic α-helices with wide hydrophobic faces, notably Sar1, localize to the ER and induce membrane curvature (9Antonny B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Lee M.C. Orci L. Hamamoto S. Futai E. Ravazzola M. Schekman R. Cell. 2005; 122: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). When specific hydrophobic residues on the Sar1 helical wheel were changed to alanine, the mutant Sar1 proteins induced altered membrane tubulation and affected the size of liposomes generated in vitro in association with Sar1 (23Lee M.C. Orci L. Hamamoto S. Futai E. Ravazzola M. Schekman R. Cell. 2005; 122: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis of the amphipathic α-helix of viperin showed that more dramatic changes were required to observe an effect on secretion in that the hydrophobic residues needed to be changed to charged glutamic acid residues rather than alanine residues. This may be because the amphipathic α-helix of viperin, which consists of 42 amino acids compared with 23 residues in the case of Sar1, has a more extended hydrophobic face. Also compatible with this idea is the observation that more than four helical turns had to be deleted or at least three hydrophobic residues had to be mutated to glutamic acid to induce dissociation of viperin from the ER membrane. Crystalloid ER formation upon viperin expression is consistent with an increase in membrane curvature of the ER, which may be caused by the amphipathic α-helix and exacerbated by viperin dimerization. It is tempting to infer that the increase in membrane curvature is also responsible for the reduction in protein secretion that is observed upon expression of viperin or the amphipathic α-helix linked to the marker protein dsRed. Although not demonstrated here, the association of viperin with secretory coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles and an enhancement of membrane curvature caused by the α-helix could reduce the size of the vesicles. Geometric principles suggest that a reduction in the volume of secretory vesicles induced by a reduction in curvature would reduce the incorporation of soluble cargo to a much greater extent than transmembrane cargo, which might explain the suppressive effect of viperin expression on the transport of soluble but not membrane-associated proteins. Unfortunately, attempts to purify recombinant WT viperin were unsuccessful, and therefore, we were unable to measure membrane curvature of viperin-associated liposomes in vitro. However, the similarities between the amphipathic α-helices of viperin and Sar1 suggest a similar mechanism of ER localization and potentially similar effects on membrane curvature. Alternative hypotheses for a viperin-induced reduction in soluble protein secretion but not membrane-associated proteins do exist, however. For example, viperin could differentially associate with vesicles bearing soluble or transmembrane cargo. Resolution of this question awaits additional experiments. A key question is whether the viperin-induced effects on the ER could contribute to its antiviral activity. Viperin may inhibit the trafficking of soluble virally encoded and cellular proteins necessary for viral replication, and certain viruses also use membranes derived from the ER for viral replication, budding, and exit via the secretory route (24Mackenzie J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Miller S. Krijnse-Locker J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Therefore, one of the antiviral functions of viperin may be to prevent or alter the formation of these membranous complexes, thus affecting viral replication or egress. A previous report suggests that viperin inhibits HCV replication (5Helbig K.J. Lau D.T. Semendric L. Harley H.A. Beard M.R. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which is known to generate a replication complex potentially derived from ER membranes. Future studies will investigate if viperin can specifically alter formation of the HCV replication complex and prevent HCV replication. Although viperin shares significant homology with the MoaA family of radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes and contains a characteristic conserved CxxxCxxC motif, to date, we have been unable to show that viperin binds iron. Both 55Felabeling of viperin-expressing yeast and heavy metal analysis of soluble recombinant viperin produced in insect cells showed no binding of iron or other heavy metals (data not shown). However, a previous study showed that mutating these three cysteines to alanines abolished the anti-HCV activity of viperin (8Jiang D. Guo H. Xu C. Chang J. Gu B. Wang L. Block T.M. Guo J.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1665-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is possible that viperin binds Fe-S clusters weakly or transiently or that our expression systems were insufficient to detect metal binding to mammalian viperin. Alternatively, these cysteines may be critical for coordinating another, unknown activity. To further investigate these possibilities, future studies should examine such viperin mutants for antiviral activity against other viruses. We thank Drs.

CSPGs regulate diverse physiological phenomena such as cytokinesis, morphogenesis, and infections with viruses and bacteria (1Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K. Gengyo-Ando K.

In particular, the pathologic functions of CS moieties of CSPGs as major axon growth-inhibitory molecules in the injured adult central nervous system have attracted widespread attention and prompted research aimed at overcoming their barrier effects on neuronal regeneration processes. Although axonal regeneration is indeed improved by the removal of CS moieties around lesion sites (5Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 6Silver J. Miller J.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar), CS does not always impede neurite outgrowth. For example, several CS preparations serve as stimulatory substrata for neurite outgrowth of cultured primary neurons (2Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 7Sugahara K. Mikami T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The apparently contradictory actions of CS in the central nervous system are thought to be attributable to its structural diversity. CS is a linear polysaccharide that contains repeating disaccharide units consisting of glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc). The building blocks can be substituted with sulfate groups at various positions, thereby producing characteristic “sulfation codes.” CS polysaccharides are divided into subclasses based on their disaccharide composition. The major CS subclasses found in mammalian tissues contain monosulfated disaccharide units, A (GlcUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)) and C (GlcUA-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)). CS polysaccharides rich in A and C units (CS-A and CS-C, respectively) are poorly permissive for neurite extension (2Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), probably reflecting the inhibitory nature of typical mammalian CS. In contrast, squid cartilage-derived CS-E polysaccharide possesses strong neuritogenic activity toward primary hippocampal neurons (2Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). CS-E is characterized by the predominant disulfated disaccharide E unit, (GlcUA-GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate)). Recent studies on chemically synthesized CS-E tetrasaccharides also support the structural importance of E unit for neurite outgrowth-promoting activity (8Tully S.E. Mabon R. Gama C.I. Tsai S.M. Liu X. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7736-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Gama C.I. Tully S.E. Sotogaku N. Clark P.M. Rawat M. Vaidehi N. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Nishi A. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The inherent potential of CS-E is of special interest for therapeutic application to central nervous system injury. CS-E binds to several humeral factors, such as midkine (MK) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (10Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Tully S.E. Sotogaku N. Clark P.M. Rawat M. Vaidehi N. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Nishi A. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible roles of CS-E as a coreceptor and/or reservoir for neuritogenic factors. In contrast, although it has been postulated that functional receptor molecules receiving a sulfation code of CS reside on the neuronal membrane surface (12Carulli D. Laabs T. Geller H.M. Fawcett J.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15 (erratum (2005) Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 15, 252): 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), identification of such potential molecules remains challenging. Focusing on neuroregulatory roles of CS, we show here the involvement of a cell adhesion molecule, contactin-1 (CNTN-1), in CS-E-mediated neuritogenesis in a neuroblastoma cell line and primary hippocampal neurons. CS-E engaged CNTN-1 and induced intracellular signaling downstream of CNTN-1, indicating that CS-E is a ligand for a potential CS receptor, CNTN-1. Our data provide the first evidence for functional expression of CS through the CS receptor-mediated signaling pathway(s). Cell Culture, Real-time RT-PCR, and Immunocytochemistry—Neuro2a (N2a) cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cDNA encoding mouse CNTN-1 (GenBank™ accession no. NM_007727) was subcloned into a pCMV expression vector (Stratagene). The fidelity of the plasmid construct (pCMV/CNTN-1) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. N2a cells were transfected with pCMV/CNTN-1 using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clonal cell lines (N2a/CNTN-1 cells) were selected and grown in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). To avoid any side effects of G418 on neuronal differentiation, N2a/CNTN-1 cells were passaged and maintained in G418-free medium for at least 7 days before the following experiments. Single-cell suspensions of hippocampal cells were prepared from E16 mouse brains as described previously (13Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For the culture of crudely purified neurons, hippocampal cells were precultured on Petri dishes in Neurobasal™ medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 h at 37 °C to remove more adherent non-neuronal cells. After 3 h, non-adherent hippocampal cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-precoated plates and maintained in Neurobasal™ medium supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen) for 3 days. Total RNA was extracted from parent N2a, N2a/CNTN-1, and crudely purified hippocampal cells using an RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). Amplification of target cDNAs, including CNTN-1 (for comparative expression analysis) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as an internal control), was initially conducted by RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I in a LightCycler ST300 (Roche Applied Science). Primer sequences were as follows: CNTN-1, 5′-AAGCCATATCCTGCTGATATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGACGTGCTTATCTCGG-3′ (reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CATCTGAGGGCCCACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGCCATGTAGGCCATGA-3′ (reverse). To evaluate the cell-surface distribution of CNTN-1, the cultured cells were labeled with an anti-CNTN-1 polyclonal antibody (R & D Systems, goat IgG, final concentration of 2 or 10 μg/ml) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat IgG antibody (Invitrogen, 1:1000), and/or with an anti-MAP2 antibody (Leico Technologies Inc., mouse IgG, 1:20) followed by Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen, 1:1000). CS-mediated Neuritogenesis—GAG-precoated substrata were prepared as described previously (13Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) were precoated with poly-dl-ornithine (Sigma, 1.5 μg/ml) and then coated with individual GAG preparations (Seikagaku Corp., 2 μg per well), including CS-A from whale cartilage (average molecular mass of 19 kDa), CS-C from shark cartilage (average molecular mass of 43 kDa), CS-E from squid cartilage (average molecular mass of 70 kDa), and heparan sulfate (HS) from bovine kidney (average molecular mass of 11 kDa). Disaccharide composition analysis revealed that the CS-E preparation used in this study consisted primarily of the disaccharide E unit (68.4%, supplemental Table S1). Dissociated hippocampal cells were plated at a cell density of 15,000 cells/cm2 on each well precoated with a defined substrate, and cultured for 24 h. To elicit differentiation, parent N2a and N2a/CNTN-1 cells were resuspended with a serum-deprived medium (Neurobasal™ medium supplemented with B27 supplement) and plated at a cell density of 6,000 cells/cm2 on the defined CS substrata, and maintained for 48 h. To neutralize CNTN-1, an anti-CNTN-1 polyclonal antibody (goat IgG, final concentration of 5 μg/ml) was added to the medium 2 h after cell seeding. The cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and labeled with anti-MAP2 (1:250) plus anti-neurofilament (Sigma, mouse IgG, 1:250) antibodies followed by development using an M.O.M.™ Immunodetection kit (Vector) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Micrographic images of immunostained cells were analyzed using morphological analysis software (Mac SCOPE, Mitani Corp). In each condition, clearly isolated cells with at least one process longer than the cell body diameter were counted as a “neurite-bearing cell.” The length of the longest neurite was measured by tracing the corresponding neurite of ∼100 neurite-bearing cells. At least three independent experiments per condition were carried out. Interaction Analysis—The binding of various GAGs to CNTN-1 was examined using a BIAcore J system (GE Healthcare) as described previously (14Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37407-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, recombinant human CNTN-1 (R & D Systems) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAGs in a series of concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μg/ml in running buffer were applied to flow cells, and changes in resonance units were recorded. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (GE Healthcare) using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. In Situ Binding of CS-E to the Cell Surface of N2a/CNTN-1 Cells—CS-E was biotinylated as described previously (11Nandini C.D. Mikami T. Ohta M. Itoh N. Akiyama-Nambu F. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50799-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Biotinylated CS-E (15 μg) was incubated with Avidin-Fluorescein (R & D, 0.1 μg) for 30 min. The fluorescein-labeled CS-E (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) was added to serum-free culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) of parent N2a or N2a/CNTN-1 cells and incubated for 2 h. After washing with PBS, fluorescence on the cell surface was visualized on an all-in-one type fluorescence microscope BZ-8000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Kinase Assay—N2a/CNTN-1 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were incubated in 8 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h and further treated with CS-A, CS-C, or CS-E (final concentration, 50 or 100 μg/ml) for 2 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in 500 μl of M-PER® Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate (300 μg of protein) was incubated with anti-p59fyn (FYN3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) polyclonal antibody for 60 min at 4 °C, then protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) beads were added, and the incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was assayed for kinase activity as described previously (15Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, the kinase assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, and 1 nmol of ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was mixed with sample-loading buffer and heated at 100 °C. The reaction sample and the untreated aliquot of the immunoprecipitate were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (16Izumikawa T. Koike T. Shiozawa S. Sugahara K. Tamura J. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11396-11406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For immunodetection of endogenously phosphorylated/autophosphorylated and total Fyn, anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate, 4G10), and anti-p59fyn antibodies were used, respectively. For simplicity, we attempted to uncover the mechanisms underlying CS-E-mediated neurite extension using a neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a (N2a) cells, instead of primary neurons. Because they differentiate and extend neurites in response to serum deprivation, the possible contributions of neuritogenic humoral factors, being derived from non-neuronal cells and/or sera, are largely excluded from this neuronal differentiation system. Surprisingly, when N2a cells were cultured on CS-E-precoated substrate under serum-free conditions in the presence of a serum replacement, neuritogenesis was not observed, even after 48-h culture (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, neither MK nor BDNF treatment improved the neuritogenesis of N2a cells on CS-E substrate (supplemental Fig. S1). These initial observations raised the possibility that the insensitivity of N2a cells to CS-E is due to defects (or relatively low expression) of particular cell surface molecules potentially sensing CS-E. In the search for candidate molecules by comparative gene expression analysis using cDNA libraries prepared from N2a and cultured hippocampal cells, we found that contactin-1 (CNTN-1), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, was not expressed in N2a cells (Fig. 1b). The widely accepted features of CNTN-1 that modulate neurite outgrowth and interact with multiple macromolecules, including a CSPG RPTPβ/phosphacan (17Gennarini G. Durbec P. Boned A. Rougon G.

Cell. 2002; 94: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), prompted us to validate the function of CNTN-1 as a neuronal cell surface receptor for CS-E. To assess the involvement of CNTN-1 in CS-E-medicated neurite outgrowth, N2a cells were stably transfected with an expression vector carrying CNTN-1 cDNA. The significant expression of CNTN-1 and its cell surface distribution in established N2a clones (N2a/CNTN-1) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively (Fig. 1c and supplemental Fig. S2). Unlike parent N2a cells, vigorous neurite sprouting was observed in N2a/CNTN-1 cells when plated on CS-E substrate, as judged by the increased fraction of neurite-bearing cells (Fig. 1, a and d). In contrast, no such appreciable promotion was seen even in N2a/CNTN-1 cells when cultured on substrate precoated with CS-A, CS-C, or HS from bovine kidney, another class of representative sulfated GAGs (supplemental Fig. S3). Notably, application of a functionally blocking anti-CNTN-1 polyclonal antibody in culture medium effectively abrogated neuritogenesis in N2a/CNTN-1 cells on CS-E substrate (Fig. 1d and supplemental Fig. S3). Additional quantitative analysis measuring the length of the longest neurite of individual N2a/CNTN-1 cells also revealed that CS-E displayed marked neurite outgrowth-promoting effects compared with the poly-dl-ornithine control, CS-A, CS-C, and HS (Fig. 1e). These findings clearly indicate that the functional expression of CNTN-1 is required for neuritogenesis in N2a cells grown on CS-E substrate. We next investigated whether CNTN-1 is also required for CS-E-induced neurite outgrowth of primary hippocampal neurons. In support of the mRNA expression in cultured hippocampal cells (Fig. 1a), immunoreactivity for CNTN-1 was detected in the majority of MAP2-positive neurons in the culture (Fig. 2a), enabling us to test the above-mentioned functional blocking assay. As reported previously (22Clement A.M. Sugahara K. Faissner A. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), elongation of prominent long neurites was frequently observed in hippocampal neurons cultured on CS-E substrate (Fig. 2b). As observed in N2a/CNTN-1 cells, the neurite outgrowth-promoting effect of CS-E was also effectively inhibited by treatment with the CNTN-1-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 2, b and c). Notably, combined treatments with the CNTN-1-neutralizing antibody and either MK- or BDNF-neutralizing antibodies (9Gama C.I. Tully S.E. Sotogaku N. Clark P.M. Rawat M. Vaidehi N. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Nishi A. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) completely abolished the CS-E-mediated neurite outgrowth promoting effects, when the poly-dl-ornithine was deemed as a basal control substrate (Fig. 2c). These results suggested that not only humoral factors, MK and BDNF, but also CNTN-1 is important in CS-E-mediated neuritogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and also indicated that MK and BDNF might be largely dispensable for neurite outgrowth via CNTN-1. To further clarify the receptor function of CNTN-1 specific for CS-E, the molecular interaction of CNTN-1 with various GAG preparations was examined using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor, BIAcore. Recombinant CNTN-1 was immobilized on the carboxymethyl-dextran sensor chip surface, and aqueous solutions of GAG preparations (80 μg/ml) were individually injected over the sensor surface to detect direct binding. An overlaid sensorgram disclosed the clear binding of CS-E (Fig. 3a); in contrast, CS-A, CS-C, and HS showed less binding than did CS-E. This binding preference of CNTN-1 was positively correlated with the structure-dependent neuritogenic activity of CS preparations toward both N2a/CNTN-1 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Evaluation of kinetic parameters revealed that CS-E interacted with CNTN-1 with significant affinity (apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 1.4 ± 0.1 μm) (supplemental Fig. S4 and Table 1), which was comparable to measurement of carbohydrate-recognizing proteins, including animal lectins and their target glycoconjugates (23Rabinovich G.A. Toscano M.A. Jackson S.S. Vasta G.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, all the other GAGs examined had 2 or 3 orders of magnitude lower apparent affinity for CNTN-1 compared with CS-E (Table 1). Based on the kinetic data, the binding ability of CS-E to cell-surface CNTN-1 was examined by addition of a fluorescein-labeled CS-E to the culture medium. As shown in Fig. 3b, the fluorescent signal was detected on the cell surface of N2a/CNTN-1 cells, whereas no detectable signal was observed on parent N2a cells. Thus, the direct interaction of CS-E, but not CS-A, CS-C, and HS, with cell-surface CNTN-1 seemed to be a prerequisite for subsequent actions leading to neurite outgrowth on CS substrata.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the interaction of various GAGs with immobilized CNTN-1 The apparent association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the interaction of various GAGs with immobilized CNTN-1 were determined using a BIAcore system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values obtained from at least five runs that were performed using varying concentrations of each GAG are expressed as the mean ± S.D.GAGkakdKdm-1 s-1s-1μmCS-E(2.9 ± 1.1) × 102(4.0 ± 1.2) × 10-41.4 ± 0.1CS-A8.3 ± 1.9(1.9 ± 0.3) × 10-2(2.9 ± 0.9) × 103CS-C(0.6 ± 0.2) × 102(8.7 ± 1.6) × 10-3(1.9 ± 0.3) × 102HS9.6 ± 8.0(1.8 ± 0.5) × 10-2(4.7 ± 3.4) × 103 Open table in a new tab Several lines of evidence suggest that CNTN-1-mediated signaling is expressed as the activation of cytoplasmic, non-receptor-type tyrosine kinase Fyn, which regulates neurite outgrowth (25Zisch A.H. D'Alessandri L. Amrein K. Ranscht B. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Zeng L. D'Alessandri L. Kalousek M.B. Vaughan L.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); therefore, to evaluate the functional aspects of CS-E as a signaling molecule, we examined in vitro autophosphorylation activity of Fyn immunoprecipitated from lysates of N2a/CNTN-1 cells cultured in the presence or absence of CS preparations. Treatment with CS-E (50 or 100 μg/ml) brought about a significant increase of Fyn kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, which was 168% or 245% of the autophosphorylation activity of non-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 3, c and d). By contrast, treatment with CS-A or CS-C did not augment the basal kinase activity observed in non-treated cells (Fig. 3, c and d). In addition, no significant increment in kinase activity occurred in parent N2a cells, even when treated with the higher concentration (100 μg/ml) of CS-E (supplemental Fig. S5). These results indicate that CS-E can act as an effective ligand for neuronal cell-surface receptor CNTN-1 that stimulates the intracellular signaling pathways involved in neuritogenesis. Taking advantage of the observation that N2a cells were less responsive to the neuritogenic CS-E substrate, we described here how a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell adhesion molecule CNTN-1 can function as a neuronal cell-surface receptor for CS-E. This is the first report showing that CS sugar chains indeed behave as extracellular signaling molecules that can induce intracellular signaling in a sulfation pattern-dependent manner. Based on these findings, in conjunction with the capability of CS-E to bind humoral factors (10Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

CS-E substrate stimulates intracellular signaling cascades leading to neurite outgrowth by interacting directly with plasma membrane-residing CNTN-1. In addition, CS-E substrate concentrates soluble neuritogenic factors, derived from cultured cells and/or medium, onto its own surface and effectively presents them to their respective receptors on the extending neurites and/or neuronal cell soma (7Sugahara K. Mikami T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Gama C.I. Tully S.E. Sotogaku N. Clark P.M. Rawat M. Vaidehi N. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Nishi A.

It has been reported that neuronal CNTN-1-mediated neurite outgrowth is induced via trans-heterophilic interaction with a glial CSPG, RPTPβ/phosphacan (18Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T.

Cell. 2002; 94: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the contribution of CS moieties of RPTPβ/phosphacan to such neuron-glia interaction remains to be investigated, functional similarities between CS-E and RPTPβ/phosphacan in neurite outgrowth suggest that neuritogenic sulfation domains composed of CS-E-like structures may be embedded in CS moieties of RPTPβ/phosphacan expressed by particular glial cells. In fact, significant proportions of CS-E-like structures are found in the mammalian brain (2Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Given that the sulfation modification of CS chains is a cell/tissue-specific and core protein-dependent process, the emergence of neuritogenic CSPGs in the central nervous system may be also spatiotemporally regulated; therefore, further identification of CSPGs carrying the CS-E-like structures, but not typical CS-A- and CS-C-like structures, is essential to elucidate the functional aspect of CS as a neuritogenic molecule. In addition, future studies focusing on the sulfotransferases responsible for synthesis of the CS-E-like structures will advance our understanding of the functional importance of the sulfation code in the central nervous system development and regeneration and will aid in the development of novel, additional therapeutic approaches for central nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2013841398,"The linkage of heterodimeric (α/β) integrin receptors with their extracellular matrix ligands and intracellular actin cytoskeleton is a fundamental step for controlling cell adhesion and migration. Binding of the actin-linking protein, talin, to integrin β cytoplasmic tails (CTs) induces high affinity ligand binding (integrin activation), whereas binding of another actin-linking protein, filamin, to the integrin β CTs negatively regulates this process by blocking the talin-integrin interaction. Here we show structurally that migfilin, a novel cytoskeletal adaptor highly enriched in the integrin adhesion sites, strongly interacts with the same region in filamin where integrin β CTs bind. We further demonstrate that the migfilin interaction dissociates filamin from integrin and promotes the talin/integrin binding and integrin activation. Migfilin thus acts as a molecular switch to disconnect filamin from integrin for regulating integrin activation and dynamics of extracellular matrix-actin linkage.

Cell-ECM contact is crucial for many physiological and pathophysiological processes and is primarily mediated by heterodimeric (α/β) transmembrane receptors, the integrins (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). Integrins engage a variety of ECM proteins via their extracellular domains while connecting to the actin cytoskeleton via their small cytoplasmic tails (CTs). The ability of integrins to bind to their ligands is uniquely controlled by the integrin CTs via a process called “inside-out signaling,” i.e. upon cellular stimulation, an integrin, typically expressed in a latent state, can receive intracellular signal(s) at its CT, which transmits through the transmembrane domain to the extracellular domain thereby converting the receptor from a low to a high affinity state (integrin activation). How such long range information transfer is initiated and regulated has been the central topic of integrin/cell adhesion research over the decades (for reviews see Refs. 2Qin J. Vinogradova O.

Relevant to this study is the role of filamin, another major actin cross-linking protein (21Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Filamin was found to share an overlapping binding site on integrin β CTs with talin and thus suppress the talin-integrin interaction (16Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.L. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L.

Rose D.M. Wood-side D.G. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), a process critically dependent on integrin activation. Together these observations support the notion that filamin binding to integrin serves as a cellular brake to control the dynamics of the integrin activation by inhibiting talin function and ECM-cytoskeleton communication. The mechanism as to how the filamin brake is turned off to promote integrin activation and cell migration is not understood. Filamin is known to contain an N-terminal actin binding domain (ABD) and a long rod-like domain of 24 immunoglobulin-like repeats, of which repeat 21 (IgFLN21) was shown to play a key role in binding to integrin β CTs and blocking the talin-integrin β CT interaction (16Kiema T.

Interestingly, IgFLN21 also recognizes another intracellular protein called migfilin, which has been shown to be an important regulator of integrin-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell shape change (25Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and cell migration (26Zhang Y. Tu Y. Gkretsi V. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12397-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In an effort to dissect the complex intermolecular interactions between migfilin, filamin, and integrin, we have undertaken a detailed structural/functional analysis. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have mapped the precise IgFLN21 binding region in migfilin, which is located at the extreme N terminus (residues 1-24) of migfilin (migfilin-N), and we solved solution structure of the IgFLN21-migfilin-N complex. To our surprise, despite little sequence homology, migfilin binds to the same region in IgFLN21 where integrin β CT binds. Detailed NMR and biochemical analyses demonstrate that the migfilin-filamin interaction is an order of magnitude higher than the integrin-filamin interaction and that the migfilin binding to filamin can competitively dissociate filamin from integrin and thus promote the talin-integrin interaction. Using multiple functional approaches, we further show that migfilin, but not its filamin binding defective mutant, significantly enhances integrin activation. These data suggest a novel regulatory pathway in which the binding of filamin to its downstream target migfilin switches off the integrin-filamin connection, thereby promoting talin binding to and activation of integrins. Plasmid, Peptide Constructs, and Purification—Human IgFLNc21-(2282-2395) was cloned into pGEX 5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) with glutathione S-transferase as fusion tag and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were induced at room temperature with 250 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h when the A600 was 0.6. The protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B to homogeneity and cleaved with factor Xa to release the fusion partners. Rebinding of GST to the column gave a preparation consisting predominantly of IgFLNc21, which was then subjected to gel filtration to remove residual GST to yield homogeneous IgFLNc21. A five-amino acid segment remains with IgFLNc21 as a cloning artifact bringing the total length of the fragment used for structure determinations to 119 residues. To prepare 15N- and/or 13C-labeled protein, 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose were added to M9 medium. The N-terminal 85-residue filamin binding domain of migfilin (Migfilin-Nter) was cloned in pMalC2X vector and expressed in E. coli BL21. The E. coli expressed MBP-Migfilin-Nter protein was used for initial binding studies to filamin, and specific binding of migfilin to IgFLNc21 was confirmed by HSQC perturbation. Subsequent cleavage to release Migfilin-Nter was only partly successful as the protein tended to degrade on purification. GST-fused Migfilin-Nter was therefore expressed along with chaperone co-expression (Takara Bio Inc.) in E. coli to generate Migfilin-Nter of better quality and quantity. N-terminal migfilin peptides, 34 and 24 residues in length, and β7 peptide (see Fig. 3A) were synthesized by the in-house Biotechnology Core Facility. IgFLNa21-(2236-2329) was cloned in pGST-parallel vector, expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using standard protocols. GFP-tagged migfilin was generated using the pEGFP-N1 vector using the EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—A Microcal VP-ITC instrument was used for calorimetric studies. Proteins (IgFLNa21 and IgFLNc21) were extensively buffer-exchanged into 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 5 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Peptides were weighed (β7 and migfilin-N) and directly dissolved in the above buffer. Experiments were performed at 29 °C to match the NMR spectroscopy conditions. Binding was assumed to be 1:1. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on Bruker 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe at 29 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Resonance assignments of IgFLNc21 with bound migfilin-N peptide were achieved with standard triple resonance experiments on a single 13C-15N-labeled sample with 1 mm IgFLNc21 and 2 mm migfilin-N peptide. NOE analyses were made using 120-ms mixing time for the 13C-15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments. Resonance assignments of the unlabeled 24-residue migfilin-N peptide were made using filtered total correlation spectroscopy (mixing time 70 ms) and filtered nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (mixing time 150 ms) experiments. Spectra were processed by NMRPipe (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and visualized PIPP (28Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). PASA software was used in the assignment of chemical shifts (29Xu Y. Wang X. Yang J. Vaynberg J. Qin J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—X-plor-NIH (30Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar) was used for calculating structure. The structure of IgFLNc21 was calculated with intramolecular NOEs and dihedral angle restraints derived from the TALOS program (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The complex structure was then calculated by including 130 intermolecular NOEs between IgFLNc21 and migfilin-N and intramolecular NOEs for migfilin-N. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange-based experimental hydrogen bonding constraints were also used for further refinement at the final stage of the structure calculations. Structure quality was evaluated using PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final 20 lowest energy structure coordinates are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and assigned as code 2K9U. The complete list of constraints used for structure calculation is submitted to BMRB data base (accession number 16002). Western Blotting—Purified platelets from 50 ml of blood were lysed in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) by gentle pipetting. Lysed platelets were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. From this lysate, 100 μl (2 mg of protein) was diluted with 900 μl of RIPA buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% sodium azide) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, and sodium orthovanadate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The diluted lysate was precleared with protein A/G PLUS beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min. The supernatant (1 ml) was incubated with 25 μl of anti-filamin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) with mild rocking for 4 h, and 40 μl of protein A/G was added followed by overnight incubation. Amount of integrin β3 bound to filamin was estimated in the presence/absence of migfilin-N peptide in the platelet lysate by Western blotting using anti-integrin β3 antibody (BD Biosciences). Isolation of Platelets from Human Blood—Platelets were isolated as described previously (33Ugarova T.P. Budzvnskiv A.Z. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21080-21087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was drawn from healthy volunteers into acid/citrate/dextrose (ACD: 65 mm citric acid, 85 mm sodium citrate, 111 mm dextrose, pH 4.61) and 2 μm prostaglandin E1. Blood was centrifuged to obtain platelet-rich-plasma, which was then further centrifuged, and the platelet pellet was suspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.36 mm Na2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). This was filtered through a Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) column in Tyrode's buffer to obtain the platelet preparations used. Platelet count was determined using an automated cell counter (Nexcelcom Bioscience). MgCl2 and CaCl2 in the concentrations of 1 and 2 mm, respectively, were added to the platelet suspension just before experiments, unless otherwise indicated. A5 Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing αIIbβ3 integrin (A5 cells) were detached as described (9Ma Y.Q. Yang J. Pesho M.M. Vinogradova O. Qin J. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6656-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Peptide Conjugation—Truncated versions of IgFLN21 binding migfilin-N wild type and mutant peptides (4KPEKRVASSVFITLAP19C and 4KPEKRVADSAFITLAP19C), were made with an additional C-terminal cysteine residue (in boldface type). CR7 transport peptide was activated with 2,2′-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) and conjugated to the migfilin peptides by minor modifications of reported methods (34Chen L. Wright L.R. Chen C.H. Oliver S.F. Wender P.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1123-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The conjugated peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and conjugation confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Conjugated peptides were also made with a single FITC-group at the N terminus, adding the FITC group during the synthesis of the peptides. Peptide Uptake into Platelets and A5 Cells—Peptide uptake into platelets and A5 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS) and confocal microscopy. Gel-filtered platelets (5 × 108 ml-1) or A5 cells (1-2 × 106 ml-1) were incubated with 10 μm FITC-WTmigfilinCCR7, FITC-MTmigfilinCCR7, FITC-migfilin, migfilin, or CR7 peptides for 5 min at 37 °C and fixed with 0.5% (platelets) or 2% (A5 cells) paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. All flow cytometry analyses were done in an LSR instrument (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with FlowJo software 8.7.3 (Treestar). For each sample, 100,000 platelets or 10,000 A5 cells were counted. Platelets/A5 cells were prepared similarly for confocal microscopy. Cells were analyzed using a Leica microscope using a 100× oil immersion objective for platelets and 63× lens for A5 cells. Fibronectin or HUTS-4 Binding to A7 Cells—Melanoma cells line A7 (FLNA+) was obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously (35Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Migfilin full-length subcloned into EGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech) was used to transiently transfect A7 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to 95% confluence and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. After 4 h, cells were washed, and integrin activation was assessed at 24 h. A7 cells were detached as the A5 cells. Live cells were distinguished from dead cells by staining with LIVE/DEAD dye (Molecular Probes) (1 μl of dye per 106 cells), and this dye was included in all analyses with cultured cells. Cells were incubated with 30 μgml-1 Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes)-labeled 120-kDa fibronectin fragment (Millipore) or 20 μgml-1 of HUTS-4 monoclonal antibody (Millipore) for 30 min at 37 °C in dark. For HUTS-4 binding, cells were incubated further with 20 μgml-1 of Alexa Fluor 633 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min on ice in the dark. After fibronectin or HUTS-4 binding, washed and fixed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Fibronectin or HUTS-4 binding was calculated from 10,000 live GFP+ cells per sample that bound fibronectin or HUTS-4 and corrected for GFP fluorescence. Intensity calibration beads for 633 or 647 nm excitation/660 nm emission (fibronectin or HUTS-4) and 488 nm excitation/515 nm emission (Molecular Probes) (GFP) were included in each experiment. Binding because of migfilin full-length is represented as fold increase over vector alone. αIIbβ3 Activation in Platelets—PAC1, the mAb that reacts selectively with the active conformation of αIIbβ3 was used as in Ref. 36Martin K. Meade G. Moran N. Shields D.C. Kenny D. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2643-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Platelets (7-10 × 108 ml-1) were incubated with 10 μm of the respective unlabeled peptides at 37 °C for 5 min followed by 40 μgml-1 FITC-PAC1 IgM for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. This was followed by addition of 500 μl of the Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, and immediate analysis by FACS. Data acquisition and processing were the same as for peptide uptake analyses. Specific binding was expressed in terms of median fluorescent intensities. Nonspecific binding was based on binding because of FITC-PAC1 alone. At the end of each experiment, intensity calibration beads were run as above for fibronectin/HUTS4 binding of A7 cells. The relative fluorescent intensities displayed on graphs are the median fluorescent intensities-based on the calibration beads. PAC1 or Fibrinogen Binding of A5 Cells—50-μl aliquots of A5 cells (1.5-2 × 106 ml-1) were incubated with 10 μm of unlabeled peptides at 37 °C for 5 min, and PAC1 binding done as described (9Ma Y.Q. Yang J. Pesho M.M. Vinogradova O. Qin J. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6656-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgM conjugate (Molecular Probes) for detection. For some experiments, A5 cells were incubated with 125 μgml-1 of Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate of fibrinogen (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C after peptide treatment. After washing and fixation, FACS was done. Specific PAC1 or fibrinogen binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding because of the Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgM conjugate or Alexa Fluor 488-fibrinogen alone, respectively. The relative fluorescent intensities were calculated as before. Platelet Aggregation—Effect of FITC-labeled or -unlabeled migfilin peptides on platelet aggregation was examined using an aggregometer (Chronolog Corp.). In siliconized cuvettes, Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and platelets (0.5-4 × 108 ml-1) were equilibrated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then 10 μm of the selected peptide or agonist was added, and aggregation was monitored for 5 min at 37 °C with stirring. The final volume in each cuvette was 500 μl. TRAP6 (10 μm concentration) was used as a positive control, and base line for 100% aggregation was set with Tyrode's buffer. Quantitation of the effects of the peptides is based by assigning TRAP6 aggregation a value of 100%. Characterization of Migfilin Binding to Filamin—Migfilin (25Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), also known as Cal (37Akazawa H. Kudoh S. Mochizuki N. Takekoshi N. Takano H. Nagai T. Komuro I.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or FBLP-1A (38Takafuta T. Saeki M. Fujimoto T.T. Fujimura K. Shapiro S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), is a widely expressed 373-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal region, a middle proline-rich region, and three C-terminal consecutive LIM domains. Migfilin has two isoforms: migfilin(s) that lacks the proline-rich region, and FBLP-1 that lacks the third LIM domain (39Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous functional studies have shown that the N-terminal residues 1-85 of migfilin recognize repeat 21 of filamin A or C (isoforms of 91% identity, supplemental Fig. S1) (25Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Migfilin-(1-85) has no sequence homology to any known protein, and its binding mode to filamin is unknown. Fig. 1A shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of filamin C repeat 21 (IgFLNc21) in the absence and presence of unlabeled migfilin-(1-85). Substantial chemical shift changes were observed for IgFLNc21 upon addition of migfilin-(1-85) suggesting strong interaction. Fig. 1B shows the converse HSQC spectrum, 15N-labeled migfilin-(1-85), in the absence and presence of unlabeled IgFLNc21. The free form of migfilin-(1-85) appears to be intrinsically unstructured as indicated by its very narrow spectral dispersion. However, upon binding to IgFLNc21, 12 residues in migfilin-(1-85) underwent dramatic chemical shift changes, whereas the majority of the signals remained unperturbed, indicating that only a small portion of migfilin is involved in binding to IgFLNc21, but this portion appears to be changed dramatically by the interaction. To map the precise filamin binding region in migfilin-(1-85), we synthesized two deletion mutants, truncating the C terminus of migfilin-(1-85) to generate migfilin-(1-36) and migfilin-(1-24). Fig. 1A shows that these deletion mutants induced identical chemical shift changes in IgFLN21 compared with migfilin-(1-85), demonstrating that the first 24 residues of migfilin are sufficient for binding to IgFLNc21. This is consistent with the previous cell-based analysis in which deletion of migfilin-(1-24) (migfilin-N) completely abolished the migfilin binding to filamin and impaired actin assembly (25Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). During all the above HSQC titrations, no appreciable increase in line widths was observed. Many residues that could not be assigned with the free form of filamin appeared sharper indicating better structuring of the repeat, thereby negating any appreciable dimer formation on migfilin binding. Filamin A repeat 21 (IgFLNa21) also interacted with migfilin-N in a similar manner (see supplemental Fig. S2) with essentially the same affinity (Kd ∼2.5 μm) as IgFLNc21 (Kd ∼2.4 μm), as shown by ITC experiments (Fig. 2). Interestingly, migfilin-N induced a quite distinct spectral pattern in IgFLN21 as compared with integrin β7 CT (supplemental Fig. S2), which is the highest affinity integrin β CT binding partner of IgFLN21 (16Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.L. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylänne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Overall, more significant chemical shift changes of IgFLN21 occurred upon binding to migfilin-N than to β7 CT, suggesting that the filamin-migfilin interaction is stronger than the filamin-integrin interaction. To confirm this, we performed the ITC experiments, which revealed that the affinity of migfilin-N/IgFLNa21 was an order of magnitude higher than that for integrin β7/IgFLNa21 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2A, isothermal calorimetry data demonstrating similar migfilin binding of IgFLNa21; B, IgFLNc21.

https://openalex.org/W2095174045,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the degradation of tryptophan and is strongly induced in interferon-γ (IFNγ)-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs). IDO has recently been established as a key enzyme in T-cell suppression-mediated immune tolerance to tumors. STAT1 phosphorylation appears to play an important role in the control of IDO expression by IFNγ, but the precise regulatory mechanism remains obscure. Here we present a novel mechanism of IFNγ-induced IDO expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. In addition, we demonstrate that curcumin, an active component of turmeric, significantly inhibited the induction of IDO expression and activity by IFNγ. We found that curcumin suppressed STAT1 activation by directly inhibiting Janus-activated kinase 1/2 and protein kinase Cδ phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived DCs, suppressing the subsequent translocation and binding of STAT1 to the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter. Coincident with these inhibitory effects on IFNγ-induced IDO expression, curcumin reversed IDO-mediated suppression of T-cell responses. Our results, thus, suggest that down-regulation of IDO in DCs is an important immunomodulatory property of curcumin that may be exploited therapeutically in the control of cancers.

Zanoni I. Feau S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. EMBO J.. 2003; 22: 2546-2551Google Scholar, 2Steinman R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 1991; 9: 271-296Google Scholar). It is now well known that DCs not only induce immunity but are also important for the induction of T-cell tolerance. In particular, murine CD11c+ DCs that coexpress the markers CD8α, B220, DX5, and DEC205 promote tolerance rather than immunity to specific antigens (3Belz G.T. Behrens G.M. Smith C.M. Miller J.F.

Immunity.. 2003; 18: 605-617Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms that might contribute to this tolerance in antigen-presenting cells involves the expression of the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the catabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. IDO has also recently been established as a key enzyme in T-cell suppression and the induction of immune tolerance (5Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Immunol. Today.. 1999; 20: 469-473Google Scholar, 6Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2004; 4: 762-774Google Scholar, 7Munn D.H. Mellor A.L. J. Clin. Investig.. 2007; 117: 1147-1154Google Scholar). The expression of IDO by various cell types has broad immunological significance. In particular, in many tumors and tolerant antigen-presenting cells, IDO degrades tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to the depletion of tryptophan and resulting in the suppression of T-cell proliferation (8Burke F. Knowles R.G. East N. Balkwill F.R. Int. J. Cancer.. 1995; 60: 115-122Google Scholar, 9Hwu P. Du M.X. Lapointe R. Do M. Taylor M.W. Young H.A. J.

Recent in vivo studies suggest that IDO-expressing DCs isolated from tumor-draining lymph nodes contribute to the progression of tumors by creating local immunosuppression (11Fallarino F. Grohmann U.

Mellor A.L. J. Clin. Investig.. 2004; 114: 280-290Google Scholar). The control of IDO transcription is complex and cell type-specific (6Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2004; 4: 762-774Google Scholar). A number of pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways as well as the Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, can modulate IDO expression in response to a variety of stimuli (14Jung I.D. Lee C.M. Jeong Y.I. Lee J.S. Park W.S. Han J. Park Y.M. FEBS Lett.. 2007; 581: 1449-1456Google Scholar, 15Tas S.W. Vervoordeldonk M.J. Hajji N. Schuitemaker J.H. van der Sluijs K.F. May M.J. Ghosh S. Kapsenberg M.L. Tak P.P. de Jong E.C. Blood.. 2007; 110: 1540-1549Google Scholar). In macrophages and DCs, transcription of the IDO gene is strongly induced by IFNγ (6Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2004; 4: 762-774Google Scholar). In bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), the precise regulatory mechanisms underlying IFNγ-induced IDO expression remain unclear. IFNγ-induced gene expression has been closely linked to the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (16Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 17247-17252Google Scholar, 17Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2005; 5: 375-386Google Scholar). After IFNγ binds to its surface receptor, the receptor-associated JAK1 and JAK2 become activated and regulate the downstream phosphorylation of STAT1 on the tyrosine 701. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT results in the formation of STAT1-STAT1 homodimers, which translocate into the nucleus and bind to the distinct IFNγ-activated site (GAS) element in the promoters of IFNγ-activated genes, including IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), to initiate gene transcription (17Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2005; 5: 375-386Google Scholar). In addition, STAT1 is also phosphorylated at serine 727 by protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), a phosphorylation event that is required for maximal induction of gene transcription (18Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell.. 1995; 82: 241-250Google Scholar). Both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 after the activation of JAKs and PKCδ are critically important in the transcription of IFNγ-associated genes (17Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol.. 2005; 5: 375-386Google Scholar). IFNγ-induced gene transcription in various cell types is also regulated by IRF-1, which transactivates multiple effector genes (20Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med.. 1996; 183: 147-157Google Scholar, 21Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Exp. Med.. 1994; 180: 977-984Google Scholar). These regulatory effects are mediated by cooperative binding of STAT1 and IRF-1 to their cognate promoter sequence and are essential for IFNγ-induced gene transcription (19Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene.. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Google Scholar). Curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydrosy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), a phenolic natural product isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, is the active component of turmeric. It exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic activities (22Aggarwal B.B. Shishodia S. Takada Y. Banerjee S. Newman R.A. Bueso-Ramos C.E. Price J.E. Clin.

Babu K.D. Rajasekharan K.N. Kuttan R. Cancer Lett.. 1995; 94: 79-83Google Scholar), implying that curcumin engages the immune system on multiple levels. On the basis of these multiple biological activities, curcumin has been suggested to have therapeutic potential in the treatment or prevention of several inflammatory diseases and cancer (26Johnson J.J. Mukhtar H. Cancer Lett.. 2007; 255: 170-181Google Scholar, 27Stan S.D. Kar S. Stoner G.D. Singh S.V. J. Cell. Biochem.. 2008; 104: 339-356Google Scholar). The rationale for the present study stems from previous observations that several antioxidants inhibit IDO in INF-γ-activated macrophages through posttranslational or transcriptional regulation of IDO expression (28Thomas S.R.

In addition, we have previously reported that several antioxidants inhibit IDO expression in IFNγ-induced BMDCs (29Jeong Y.I. Jung I.D. Lee J.S. Lee C.M. Lee J.D. Park Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 354: 1004-1009Google Scholar, 30Kim S.I. Jeong Y.I. Jung I.D. Lee J.S. Lee C.M. Yoon M.S. Seong E.Y. Kim J.I. Lee J.D. Park Y.M. Int.

The present study was, thus, designed to investigate whether curcumin, acting as an antioxidant, could inhibit IDO expression and activity in IFNγ-induced murine BMDCs and, if so, to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanism. In this report we demonstrate a novel biological activity of curcumin in IDO-mediated immune tolerance, showing that curcumin significantly inhibited the expression and enzymatic functions of IDO in IFNγ-stimulated murine BMDCs, thereby reversing IDO-mediated T-cell suppression. We further demonstrate that curcumin regulates IFNγ-induced IDO expression by targeting JAK1 and PKCδ signaling pathways. Mice—Male 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 (H-2Kb and I-Ab) mice were purchased from the Korean Institute of Chemistry Technology (Daejeon, Korea). OT-1 T-cell receptor transgenic mice in the C57BL/6 background were purchased form The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). They were bred using hemizygote males and wild-type females. To screen for transgenic offspring, 1 μl of blood was collected from the tail, immunostained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Vα2 and Cy5-labeled anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (Abs), and analyzed using flow cytometry. Mice with nearly all of their CD8+ T-cells stained positive for Vα2 were selected. The animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment within our animal facility and used in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal care. Reagents and Abs—Recombinant mouse (rm) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, rm interleukin-4, and rm INF-γ were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Curcumin with a purity of ≥80% and 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. InSolution™ JAK Inhibitor I, rottlerin, Go6976, and safingol were purchased from Calbiochem. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated monoclonal Abs used to detect the expression of CD11c (HL3), CD80 (16–10A1), and CD86 (GL1) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. To detect protein levels by Western blot, anti-phosphotyrosine-STAT1 (Tyr-701), anti-phospho-serine-STAT1 (Ser-757), and anti-STAT1 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and polyclonal anti-mouse IDO Ab was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Abs against α-tubulin, phospho-JAK1, phospho-JAK2, JAK2, phospho-PKCδ, and PKCδ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Generation of BM-derived Murine DCs—DCs were generated from murine BM cells as described by Inaba et al. (32Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med.. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Google Scholar) with some modifications. BM was flushed from the tibiae and femurs of C57BL/6 and depleted of red cells with ammonium chloride. The cells were plated in 6-well culture plates (106 cells/ml; 3 ml/well) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse (rm) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and rm interleukin-4 at 37 °C, 5% CO2. On day 3 of the culture, floating cells were gently removed, and fresh medium was added. On day 6 of the culture, nonadherent cells and loosely adherent proliferating DCs aggregates were harvested for analysis or stimulation. On day 6, 80% or more of the nonadherent cells expressed CD11c. To obtain highly purified populations for subsequent analyses, the DCs were labeled with bead-conjugated anti-CD11c monoclonal Ab (Miltenyi Biotec) and subjected to positive selection through paramagnetic columns (LS columns; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the selected cell fraction was >90%. IDO mRNA Analysis by Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from 5 × 106 cells was rapidly isolated using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was used for the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of IDO were: 5′-GTACATCACCATGGCGTATG-3′ and 5′-GCTTTCGTCAAGTCTTCATTG-3′. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 40 s (32 cycles); 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle). PCR products were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-Tris-buffered EDTA gel containing ethidium bromide. For reference, we quantified the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Western Blot Analysis—Each cell lysate (30 μg of protein/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane. After the membrane was blocked, it was incubated with primary Ab and then incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat, anti-rabbit, or mouse-IgG secondary Ab. Finally, the membrane was developed with the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using an UNSCAN-IT gel automated digitizing system (Scion, Frederick, MD). Enzymatic Assay for IDO Activity—A strong correlation between the colorimetric assay and the high performance liquid chromatography analysis has been reported by Albert and co-workers. (33Braun D. Longman R.S. Albert M.L. Blood.. 2005; 106: 2375-2381Google Scholar); we used the colorimetric assay for monitoring IDO activity. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were disrupted by freeze/thaw cycles, the lysate (250 μl) was cleared by centrifugation, and an equal amount of 2× IDO buffer (100 mm PBS, pH 6.5, 40 mm ascorbate, 20 μm methylene blue, 200 μg/ml catalase, and 800 mm l-tryptophan; all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was added. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 100 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid and further incubated for 30 min at 52 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with an equal amount of Ehrlich's reagent (0.8% p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid). The color was allowed to develop for 10 min, and then the absorbance was read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer. Serial dilutions of l-kynurenine were used as standards. A kynurenine standard curve was obtained by measuring the absorbance at 480 nm of kynurenine solutions at final concentrations of 0–100 μm (Fig. 1C, inset). One unit of IDO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 nmol/h of kynurenine. The amount of protein in the samples was assayed according to the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction—Transgenic ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD8+ T-cells were purified from bulk splenocytes via negative selection using a mouse CD8+ T-cell kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Purity was assessed to be >93% by flow cytometry after staining with Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8 Ab. The lymphocytes were washed twice in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and labeled by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) as previously described (34Langenkamp A. Messi M. Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Nat. Immunol.. 2000; 1: 311-316Google Scholar). In brief, OT-1 T-cells were resuspended in 1 μm CFSE in PBS. After 8 min of shaking at 37 °C, cells were washed once in pure fetal bovine serum and twice in PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum. DCs (1 × 104 cells per well) generated from BM-derived monocytes of C57BL/6 were pretreated with 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan (600 μm) or curcumin (25 μm). Cells were then incubated for 18 h in the presence or absence of IFNγ (100 units/ml). DCs were pulsed or nonpulsed with 1 μm/ml OVA peptide (kindly provided by S. Y. Lee) at 37 °C for 1 h and then thoroughly washed before use. CFSE-labeled OT-1 T-cells were seeded in triplicate wells (1 × 105 per well) in U-bottomed, 96-well, microtiter culture plates (Nunc) together with DCs (1 × 104 per well). After 72 h of culturing, the cells were harvested and stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD8 monoclonal Ab (to allow us to gate on the OT-1 T-cells) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were carried out using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to a modification of the manufacturer's instructions. 2 × 106 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link the protein-DNA complexes. Then they were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). For the remaining steps of the protein isolation, all buffers used to isolate the proteins contained phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were added to SDS lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear the DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 base pairs and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The sonicated cell supernatants were diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with a 27% suspension of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. The supernatant was recovered after pelleting the agarose by centrifugation and then incubated with 5 μg of a rabbit-specific Ab against STAT1 overnight at 4 °C. The Ab-protein-DNA complexes were collected by adding protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Immunoprecipitated Ab-protein-DNA complexes were washed 3 times with wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 500 mm NaCl) followed by three additional washes in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Chromatin complexes were eluted with 250 μl of freshly prepared extraction buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). To reverse cross-links, 5 m NaCl was added to each combined elute to a final concentration of 0.3 m, then the solution was heated to 65 °C for 5 h. Proteins were digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C, and DNA was extracted with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Precipitated DNA fragments were amplified by PCR. The sequences of IRF-1 promoter primer are as follows: IRF-1 forward primer 5′-CTTTCCAACACAGGCAAG-3′, IRF-1 reverse primer 5′-ACTGTGAAAGCACGTAC-3′. Statistics—Experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to compare experimental groups to control values, whereas comparisons between multiple groups were done using Tukey's multiple comparison test. Statistical significance was determined a p value less than 0.05. Curcumin Inhibits the Expression and Activity of IDO in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs—To investigate the effect of curcumin on IFNγ-induced IDO expression, we preincubated BMDCs with or without curcumin and then stimulated cells with IFNγ. Using RT-PCR, we observed that IFNγ induced a significant increase in the transcription of the IDO gene in BMDCs, an increase that was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by curcumin (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses confirmed that curcumin also inhibited IFNγ-induced IDO expression at the protein level (Fig. 1B). We have previously shown that curcumin has no remarkable effect on cell viability at curcumin concentrations ≤50 μm (35Kim G.Y. Kim K.H. Lee S.H. Yoon M.S. Lee H.J. Moon D.O. Lee C.M. Ahn S.C. Park Y.C. Park Y.M. J. Immunol.. 2005; 174: 8116-8124Google Scholar), indicating that these inhibitory effects on IDO expression were not due to nonspecific cytotoxic consequences of curcumin exposure. To determine whether reductions in IDO expression were accompanied by a decrease in IDO activity in IFNγ-activated BMDCs, we assayed cell extracts for the presence of kynurenine, a byproduct of tryptophan. As shown in Fig. 1C, a non-toxic concentration of curcumin (25 μm) induced a dramatic, dose-dependent inhibition of IFNγ-induced IDO activity. JAK1/2 and PKCδ Regulate Tyrosine and Serine Phosphorylation of STAT1 in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs—Because curcumin strongly suppressed the induction of IDO expression and activity in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs, we next sought to examine the precise mechanisms involved in the induction and inhibition of IDO expression by IFNγ and curcumin, respectively. We first investigated whether phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine residues of STAT1 was regulated by JAK1/2 and PKCδ in IFNγ-stimulated murine BMDCs. JAK1/2, PKCδ, and STAT1 were rapidly activated in response to IFNγ, reaching a plateau 30 min after IFNγ stimulation (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment with JAK-specific inhibitor was completely suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs, whereas serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and phosphorylation of PKCδ was not changed (Fig. 2B). Next, to determine whether phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to IFNγ was dependent on PKCδ, we preincubated BMDCs with the PKCδ-specific inhibitor, rottlerin, for 30 min before stimulating with IFNγ for 30 min. Rottlerin abrogated IFNγ-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 without decreasing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). PKC comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases that transducer-signals and regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis (36Matthews S.A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol.. 2006; 18: 314-320Google Scholar). To further explore the specificity of PKCδ in regulating IFNγ-induced IDO expression, we determined whether other PKC isotypes could regulate serine phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to IFNγ. Go6976, which inhibits PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-μ, and safingol, which specifically inhibits PKC-α, were examined for their ability to inhibit STAT1 serine phosphorylation. BMDCs were preincubated with effective doses of the PKC inhibitors for 30 min and then treated with IFNγ for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2D, these PKC inhibitors, which do not inhibit PKCδ, did not affect the IFNγ-dependent serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Activation of Both JAK1/2 and PKCδ Is Essential for IDO Expression in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs—To characterize the direct effect of inactivating JAK1/2 and PKCδ on IDO induction by IFNγ, we investigated IDO expression in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs treated with either the JAK1/2- or PKCδ specific inhibitor. Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we observed that IFNγ-induced IDO expression was completely suppressed by the JAK inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 3B, treatment with the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin, reduced IDO expression in a dose-dependent manner in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs. In contrast, inhibitors of other PKC isoforms had little effect on IDO expression in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs (Fig. 3C). To exclude the possibility that the effect of rottlerin on IFNγ-induced IDO expression were nonspecific, we used PKCδ-specific small interfering RNA to silence the PKCδ gene in BMDCs. Introduction of PKCδ-specific small interfering RNA significantly reduced IDO expression and PKCδ phosphorylation in response to IFNγ (Fig. 3D). Curcumin Inhibits STAT1 Activation by Suppressing IFNγ-induced of JAK1/2 and PKCδ Phosphorylation—The dependence of IFNγ-induced IDO expression on JAK1/2 and PKCδ phosphorylation suggests that curcumin may block IFNγ effects by inhibiting these downstream events. To investigate the effect of curcumin on the phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and PKCδ, we preincubated BMDCs with varying doses of curcumin for 30 min and then stimulated cells with IFNγ for 30 min. Curcumin treatment dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and PKCδ in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs (Fig. 4A). Next, we examined whether the inhibitory effect of curcumin on JAK1/2 and PKCδ activation suppressed the subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1. As expected, curcumin significantly reduced STAT1 phosphorylation on both serine and tyrosine residues (Fig. 4B). Curcumin Inhibits the Binding of Phosphorylated STAT1 to the GAS Site of the IRF-1 Promoter in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs—The binding of phosphorylated STAT1 to the GAS site of the IRF-1 promoter is essential for the induction of IRF-1 gene transcription by IFNγ (37Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science.. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). Moreover, STAT1 and IRF-1 cooperatively mediate the induction of IDO protein by IFNγ (16Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 17247-17252Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibiting JAK1/2 or PKCδ impaired the binding capacity of IFNγ-activated STAT1 to the GAS site of the IRF-1 promoter and blunted subsequent IRF-1 expression, BMDCs were preincubated with a JAK- or PKCδ-specific inhibitor before IFNγ treatment. In the ChIP assay using STAT1-specific Ab and Western blot analyses, we observed that inhibiting JAK1/2 or PKCδ activation severely blunted or abolished the binding of IFNγ-activated STAT1 to the GAS sequence (Fig. 5A) and reduced subsequent IRF-1 expression (Fig. 5B). This latter effect was more pronounced in the presence of both inhibitors. We next investigated whether curcumin treatment attenuated STAT1 binding to the IRF-1 promoter in IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs using the ChIP assay. Cells were preincubated with various concentrations of curcumin for 1 h before IFNγ treatment. Chromatin was isolated and immunoprecipitated with a STAT1-specific Ab, and then the IRF-1 promoter region was amplified by PCR. Curcumin treatment significantly blocked STAT1 binding to the GAS elements on the promoter region of the IRF-1 gene (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Similar effects of curcumin were observed in ChIP assays using an RNA polymerase II-specific Ab (Fig. 6A, lower panel). In addition, Western blots showed that IRF-1 expression, which was strongly induced in the IFNγ-stimulated BMDCs, was profoundly inhibited after curcumin-mediated suppression of STAT1 binding to the GAS element (Fig. 6B). Curcumin Restores IDO-induced T-cell Suppression—Finally, we sought to determine whether curcumin treatment could reverse IDO-mediated suppression of T-cell proliferation. Paradoxically, in a previous study of LPS-induced DC maturation, we found that curcumin caused a suppression of the T-cell stimulatory function by down-regulating the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (35Kim G.Y. Kim K.H. Lee S.H. Yoon M.S. Lee H.J. Moon D.O. Lee C.M. Ahn S.C. Park Y.C. Park Y.M. J. Immunol.. 2005; 174: 8116-8124Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to analyze the expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules in IFNγ-stimulated BMDC. Consistent with our previous report, LPS was sufficient to induce the expression of CD80 and CD86 molecules on CD11c+ cells on day 7, whereas IFNγ did not (Fig. 7A). Although curcumin modulates the expression of CD80 and CD86 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in LPS-stimulated BMDCs, it has little inhibitory effect on the expression of MHC class I molecules (35Kim G.Y. Kim K.H. Lee S.H. Yoon M.S. Lee H.J. Moon D.O. Lee C.M. Ahn S.C. Park Y.C. Park Y.M. J. Immunol.. 2005; 174: 8116-8124Google Scholar). To precisely characterize the"
https://openalex.org/W2039867038,"Recent data have led us to hypothesize that selective activation of endothelial small- and/or intermediate-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels, respectively) by the opener compounds NS309 and DCEBIO would augment stimulated nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and vasodilation in resistance arteries. Experimentally, ATP-evoked changes in membrane potential, cytosolic Ca(2+), and NO synthesis were recorded by patch clamp and microfluorimetry in single human endothelial cells. Agonist-evoked inhibition of myogenic tone in isolated, pressurized arterioles from rat cremaster skeletal muscle was analyzed by video microscopy. NS309 and DCEBIO enhanced ATP-evoked membrane hyperpolarization and cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, along with acute NO synthesis in isolated endothelial cells. The acetylcholine-mediated inhibition of myogenic tone (IC(50)=237 nM) was left-shifted in the presence of NS309 and DCEBIO (10, 100, and 1000 nM) to IC(50) values of 101, 78, and 43 nM; endothelial denudation inhibited this drug effect. L-NAME attenuated the acetylcholine-induced inhibition of myogenic tone but did not interfere with NS309 and DCEBIO-evoked vasodilation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that drug-induced enhancement of endothelial SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channel activities represents a novel cellular mechanism to increase vasodilation of small-resistance arterioles, thereby highlighting these channels as potential therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease states associated with compromised NO signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1995531595,"In Alzheimer disease (AD)-affected neurons, the Tau protein is found in an aggregated and hyperphosphorylated state. A common hypothesis is that Tau hyperphosphorylation causes its dissociation from the microtubular surface, with consequently a breakdown of the microtubules (MTs) and aggregation of the unbound Tau. We evaluated the effect of Tau phosphorylation on both tubulin assembly and MT binding. We show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A3 kinase complex can generate the AT8 and AT180 AD-specific phospho-epitopes and use NMR spectroscopy to validate qualitatively and quantitatively the phospho content of our samples. The simultaneous presence of both epitopes disables the tubulin assembly capacity of Tau in conditions whereby Tau is the driving force for the assembly process but does not, however, inhibit MT assembly when the latter is driven by an increased tubulin concentration. When compared to the isolated MT binding repeats (K(d)=0.3 microM), the phospho-Tau retains a substantial affinity for preformed MTs (K(d)=11 nM), suggesting that the phosphorylated proline-rich region still participates in the binding event. Our results hence indicate that the sole phosphorylation at the AT8/AT180 epitopes, although leading to a functional defect for Tau, is not sufficient for its dissociation from the MT surface and subsequent aggregation as observed in AD."

We recently demonstrated that the ASGP-R mediates the clearance of glycoproteins bearing Siaα2,6GalNAc as well as those bearing terminal Gal or GalNAc. We now report that glycoproteins such as haptoglobin, serum amyloid protein (SAP), and carboxylesterase that bear oligosaccharides with terminal Siaα2,6Gal are elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R-deficient mice. Because of their abundance in plasma, glycoproteins bearing terminal Siaα2,6Gal will saturate the ASGP-R and compete with each other on the basis of their relative affinities for the ASGP-R and their relative abundance.

The ASGP-R has been extensively characterized since its initial discovery; however, its biologic function in vivo has remained unclear. This endocytic receptor is highly abundant with 500,000 receptors expressed at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes (3Schwartz A.L. Rup D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1977; 499: 73-84Google Scholar). The abundance of the ASGP-R and its rapid rate of internalization in combination with the large number of hepatocytes that are present in the liver, 1.35 × 108/g of liver (7Kedderis G.L. Held S.D.

Histopathol.. 1997; 12: 1069-1080Google Scholar), results in an enormous potential capacity to remove glycoproteins from the circulation. Until recently, mice that have had either subunit of the ASGP-R ablated, subunit 1 ASGP-R1(-/-) or subunit 2 ASGP-R2(-/-), have not been reported to have altered levels of circulating glycoproteins in their blood or to have a physiologic phenotype (9Braun J.R.

We recently established that glycoproteins bearing Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence Siaα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc are recognized by the ASGP-R and rapidly removed from the blood (12Park E.I.

Glycoproteins bearing these structures, for example the prolactin-like proteins (14Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Cohick C.B. Soares M.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 4775-4782Google Scholar), glycodelin (15Dell A. Morris H.R. Easton R.L. Panico M. Patankar M. Oehniger S. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 24116-24126Google Scholar), urokinase (16Bergwerff A.A. Van Oostrum J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem.. 1995; 228: 1009-1019Google Scholar), and glycoprotein hormones (17Stockell Hartree A. Renwick A.G.C. Biochem. J.. 1992; 287: 665-679Google Scholar), are not highly abundant, suggesting that the ASGP-R recognizes and clears additional more abundant glycoproteins. The most likely candidates are glycoproteins bearing Asn-linked oligosaccharides that terminate with the sequence Siaα2,6Galβ1, 4GlcNAc. We have reported that the ASGP-R recognizes these structures with an avidity that is in the micromolar range (13Park E.I. Mi Y. Unverzagt C. Gabius H.J. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 17125-17129Google Scholar). The avidity of the ASGP-R for structures terminating with Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc is predicted to be sufficient to mediate binding and clearance of glycoproteins bearing structures terminating with Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc from the blood. This concept is supported by indications that neo-glycoproteins bearing structures terminating with Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc are removed from the blood at a faster rate than those bearing Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc (18Unverzagt C. Andre S. Seifert J. Kojima S. Fink C. Srikrishna G. Freeze H. Kayser K. Gabius H.J. J. Med. Chem.. 2002; 45: 478-491Google Scholar). Slow clearance of glycoproteins bearing Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc, however, hampers accurate measurement of their half-lives by injection of radiolabeled ligands. We now report that multiple glycoproteins bearing oligosaccharides that terminate with Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc are elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R-deficient ASGP-R2(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type (Wt) mice. The elevation of multiple glycoproteins bearing terminal Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc supports our proposal that the ASGP-R accounts for the clearance of these glycoproteins. This previously undiscerned role of the ASGP-R now allows us to develop a model of how this receptor may contribute to the regulation of the concentration of many different glycoproteins in the blood. Mice—ASGP-R2(-/-) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratories were kindly provided by David Ginsburg, University of Michigan, Dept. of Internal Medicine and Human Genetics. The mice were backcrossed with C57Bl/J6 for five generations. C57Bl/J6 were used as Wt controls. Plasma Preparation—Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava of Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice using a 1-ml syringe and a 23-gauge needle treated with EDTA to prevent coagulation. The blood was diluted 1:1 with 20 mm PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (PBS) containing 20 mm EDTA. Leukocytes and erythrocytes were separated from the plasma by sedimentation for 10 min at 0.5 × g. The protein concentration of the plasma was determined using a modified Lowry method (PlusOne 2D-Quant Kit, GE Healthcare). Cyanine Dye Labeling—Plasma samples from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice containing 25 μg of protein were separately diluted 1:10 in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% CHAPS (w/v). The diluted samples from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice were labeled with 200 pmol of either 3-(4-carboxymethyl)phenylmethyl-3′-ethyloxacarbocyanine halide N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Cy2), or 1-(5-scarboxypentyl)-1′-methylindodicarbocyanine halide N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Cy5), respectively, in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. Excess N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters were consumed by adding 1 μl of 10 mm lysine and incubating for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark. The labeled Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) samples were combined and brought to a final volume of 450 μl with 400 μl of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 10% isopropanol, 5% glycerol (w/v), 5.4 μl Destreak Rehydration Solution (GE Healthcare), and 2.25 μl of ampholyte pH 3–11 (GE Healthcare). Two-dimensional Differential In-gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)—Isoelectric focusing of the combined, labeled samples was conducted using 24-cm 3–10 NL-immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips for 6500 Volt-h using an IPGPhor (GE Healthcare). After focusing, the IPG strips were incubated in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, and 2% SDS containing 50 mg dithiothreitol. The reduced proteins were alkylated by incubation in the same buffer containing 600 mg of iodoacetamide. Electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE was performed by layering the IPG strips onto 10% polyacrylamide gels. The Cy2- and Cy5-labeled images were acquired using a Typhoon Imager (GE Healthcare, Cy2: Blue 488 nm laser, 520 BP40 filter; Cy5: Red 633 nm laser, 670BP30 filter). Relative quantification of specific gel spots was determined using the DIA and BVA modules of the DeCyder software. Protein Identification of Gel Spots by Mass Spectrometry—Specific gel spots were selected using the Decyder Software and excised from the gel using an x,y robot (ProPic, Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). The gel pieces were trypsin-digested. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on the tryptic peptides as previously described (19Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E. Gross J. Townsend R.R. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2004; 101: 11785-11790Google Scholar) using either a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (ABI4700) or a nano LC-MS using a QSTAR-L mass spectrometer. Lectin Blots—Plasma proteins, 75 μg, from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice were labeled with Cy5 and individually separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above on 12–16% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes. The membranes were each incubated in 125 ml of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Sambucus nigra I (SNA-1) lectin (EY Labs) diluted 1:1000 in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5 containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma A-7030) for 45 m. The membranes were washed and developed by incubation in 30 ml of ECL plus (GE Healthcare) working solution at 25 °C for 5 m. Digital images were generated by scanning the blots with Typhoon Imager (HRP: 457 nm laser 520BP40 filter; Cy5: 633 nm laser, 670BP40 filter). Neuraminidase Treatment, Wisteria Floribunda (WFA)-Agarose Affinity Chromatography, and Western Blotting—Plasma proteins, 400 μg, from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice was digested with neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C overnight. WFA-agarose (EY Laboratories) was prepared for incubation with each sample by washing 50 μl, with 2.5 ml of PBS. Each sample of neuraminidase-treated plasma was applied to WFA-agarose in a Handee mini-spin column (Pierce) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were collected by sedimenting the WFA-agarose (200 × g for 1 min) in the spin column. The columns were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS, and each wash fraction was collected by centrifugation. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm GalNAc and analyzed by Western blot following separation by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% Bis-Tris gels. Glycoproteins bearing terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc were identified using the monoclonal antibody SMLDN1:1 that is specific for this structure (20Nyame A.K. Leppanen A.M. DeBose-Boyd R. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology.. 1999; 9: 1029-1035Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1,000,000 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM at a dilution of 1:500,000. Glycoproteins recognized by SMLDN1:1 were excised from a gel, trypsin-digested, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Quantitative Western Blotting—The relative quantities of multiple plasma proteins, haptoglobin, SAP, hemopexin, transferrin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. Plasma proteins from individual Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes (Millipore). For hemopexin detection, 1 μg of plasma proteins was loaded onto a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel. For haptoglobin, transferrin, and CRP detection, 10 μg of plasma proteins was loaded onto 4–12% Bis-Tris gels. For SAP detection, 100 μg of plasma proteins was loaded onto 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The plasma was separated using MOPS Running Buffer for all gels (Invitrogen). Following electrophoretic transfer membranes were incubated in 0.1% casein (Hammersten grade, BDH Chemicals) for 1 h to block nonspecific binding during incubation with antibodies. The relative quantity of each protein in each sample was determined by incubating the membranes overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody in 25 ml of PBS. The dilutions were: rabbit anti-mouse haptoglobin (Life Diagnostics) 1:20,000, rabbit anti-rat SAP 1:20,000 rabbit anti-rat hemopexin (Life Diagnostics) 1:2,500, rabbit anti-rat transferrin 1:10,000, and rabbit anti-rat CRP 1:10,000. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min at 25 °C with 0.01% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with IReDye800 labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland). After washing three times for 10 min at 25 °C with 0.01% Tween 20 in PBS, a LICOR Odyssey was used to scan and quantitate the relative amount of protein in each fraction. Sambucus Nigra I (SNA-I)-Agarose and Ricinus Communis I (RCA-I)-Agarose Affinity Chromatography—SNA-I-agarose and RCA-I-agarose (EY Laboratories) were prepared for incubation with each sample by washing 50 μl with 2.5 ml of PBS. Plasma proteins, 25 μg in 50 μl of PBS, from Wt or ASGP-R2(-/-) mice were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl SNA-I or RCA-I-agarose in Handee mini-spin columns (Pierce). Unbound proteins were collected by centrifugation (200 × g for 1 min). The columns were washed three times with 200 μl PBS and each wash fraction was collected by centrifugation. The bound proteins were eluted from the column using 45 μl of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and 5 μl of NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) and boiling for 5 min. The amount of haptoglobin in each fraction was determined by Western blot analysis as described above. Multiple Plasma Proteins Are Elevated in the Plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) Mice as Compared with Wt Mice—The levels of ASGP-R1 are markedly reduced in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice (21Ishibashi S. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Google Scholar), and clearance of glycoproteins bearing terminal β1,4-linked Gal is abolished (13Park E.I. Mi Y. Unverzagt C. Gabius H.J. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 17125-17129Google Scholar, 21Ishibashi S. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Google Scholar). In addition, membranes prepared from ASGP-R2(-/-) mice do not exhibit detectable binding of glycoproteins such as orosomucoid that have been treated with neuraminidase to expose terminal Gal (not shown). Thus, even though the minor subunit of the ASGP-R has been ablated in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice, the mice are functionally deficient in ASGP-R activity in the liver. The vast majority of proteins found in plasma are glycosylated. Many of these plasma glycoproteins bear one or more N-linked oligosaccharides that have branches that terminate with either Siaα2,6Gal or Siaα2,3Gal. If, as we have proposed (13Park E.I. Mi Y. Unverzagt C. Gabius H.J. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 17125-17129Google Scholar), oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal are recognized by the ASGP-R and cleared from the blood at a more rapid rate than those terminating with Siaα2,3Gal, glycoproteins bearing oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal should be elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. We have used fluorescence 2D-DIGE to address this issue. Plasma was isolated from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice, and equal amounts of plasma protein were fluorescently labeled with Cy2 and Cy5, respectively. The Cy2- and Cy5-labeled samples were combined and then separated into components by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The gel was scanned using the excitation and emission wavelengths specific for Cy2 or Cy5, and the false colored images were digitally combined to produce the composite image illustrated in Fig. 1. As many as 160 individual spots were elevated >3-fold in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice as compared with Wt mice. Seven of the most prominent groups of spots that were elevated are circled and designated 1–7 in Fig. 1. The presence of multiple spots differing in charge but not size is characteristic of glycoproteins. Tryptic peptides from individual spots within the regions marked 1–7 were identified by tandem mass spectrometry as summarized in Table 1. All of the spots identified are glycoproteins. Several are associated with the acute phase response including SAP, haptoglobin, serine protease inhibitor clade A, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor, and α1-B glycoprotein. Carboxylesterase and the IgM heavy chain are also glycoproteins but are not considered acute phase proteins. The majority of spots are not elevated in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice as indicated by the features colored yellow in Fig. 1. Thus, only specific plasma proteins are elevated in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. DeCyder Software was used to determine the relative fold-change for each of the spots that were identified as summarized in Table 1. Individual spots were elevated between 2.8 (inter-α trypsin inhibitor) and 33-fold (SAP) in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice as compared with Wt mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Identification of proteins increased in plasma from ASGP-R2(–/–) mice Spots identified as being elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R2(–/–) mice, indicated by the numbers 1–7 in Fig. 1, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments. The identification and fold increase in level of plasma proteins from ASGP-R2(–/–) as compared to Wt mice are indicated for individual spots in each group.

Based on the ability of the ASGP-R to bind glycoproteins bearing structures that terminate in Siaα2,6Gal (13Park E.I. Mi Y. Unverzagt C. Gabius H.J. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 17125-17129Google Scholar), we predicted that the glycoproteins that are elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice will be enriched for structures that terminate with Siaα2,6Gal. The lectin SNA-I binds saccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal/GalNAc but not those terminating with Siaα2,3Gal (22Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekaert W.F. Nsimba-Lubaki M. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1987; 262: 1596-1601Google Scholar, 23Van Damme E.J. Barre A. Rouge P. Van Leuven F. Peumans W.J. Eur. J. Biochem.. 1996; 235: 128-137Google Scholar). Cyanine dye-labeled plasma proteins from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice were separately subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. The relative locations and levels of spots containing terminal Siaα2,6Gal/GalNAc were determined by Western blot using SNA-I-HRP as shown in Fig. 2. Both the level and number of spots that react with SNA-I are increased in the plasma from ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, at least 6 of the 7 groups of spots identified in Fig. 1 (labeled 1–4, 6–7) and Table 1 as representing elevated plasma glycoproteins correspond to the spots that react with SNA-I. Because the proteins were cyanine dye-labeled, we could confirm the correspondence between the SNA-I reactive spots and the labeled spots. SNA-I will bind to structures terminating with Siaα2,6GalNAc as well those terminating with Siaα2,6Gal; however, the only glycoproteins in plasma known to bear Siaα2,6GalNAc in rodents are prolactin-like proteins (PLP) in the rat (14Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Cohick C.B. Soares M.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 4775-4782Google Scholar) and glycoprotein hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) in the mouse (24Mi Y. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Clin. Investig.. 2008; 118: 1815-1824Google Scholar). The former are only present in plasma during pregnancy (14Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Cohick C.B. Soares M.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 4775-4782Google Scholar) and both are present in small quantities. We determined that the predominant, if not exclusive, structure detected by SNA-I in the plasma of Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice is Siaα2,6Gal. Plasma from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice was treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid and expose underlying Gal or GalNAc. The neuraminidase-digested plasma was then incubated with WFA-agarose, which binds oligosaccharides bearing terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc but not those bearing terminal β1,4-linked Gal (25Mengeling B.J. Smith P.L. Stults N.L. Smith D.F. Baenziger J.U. Anal. Biochem.. 1991; 199: 286-292Google Scholar). Glycoproteins bound to WFA-agarose were eluted analyzed by Western blot using the SMLDN1:1 mAb, a monoclonal antibody specific for terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc (20Nyame A.K. Leppanen A.M. DeBose-Boyd R. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology.. 1999; 9: 1029-1035Google Scholar). There was no evidence of any glycoprotein in either the bound or unbound fraction containing terminal GalNAc (not shown). Carbonic anhydrase-VI, which bears oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6GalNAc (26Hooper L.V. Beranek M.C. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 5985-5993Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Thus, the glycoproteins in plasma that react with SNA-I bear oligosaccharides that terminate with Siaα2,6Gal. Taken together, the results indicate that glycoproteins bearing oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal represent the major fraction of glycoproteins that are increased in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. Haptoglobin and SAP Are Elevated in Plasma from ASGP-R2(-/-) Mice—Spots identified on two-dimensional gels represent individual isoforms of glycoproteins. It is possible that individual isoforms are elevated at the expense of other isoforms, but that the overall level of a given plasma glycoprotein is not increased in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for haptoglobin and SAP was used to determine if the total level of these two glycoproteins was elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. Plasma obtained from 7 Wt and 11 ASGP-R2(-/-) mice was examined as summarized in Fig. 3. Haptoglobin increased 3–5-fold in ASGP-R2(-/-) plasma (p = 0.0112) when compared with Wt (Fig. 3A). SAP increased 2–3-fold (p = 0.0146) when compared with Wt (Fig. 3B). These represent highly significant increases for these two major plasma glycoproteins. Hemopexin, transferrin, and CRP provide examples of plasma proteins that were not elevated in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice when examined by 2D-DIGE. Quantitation was performed by Western blot using antibodies specific for hemopexin, transferrin, and CRP respectively. In agreement with the 2D-DIGE analysis, neither hemopexin (Fig. 3D) or transferrin (Fig. 3E), which are glycoproteins, nor CRP (Fig. 3C), which is not glycosylated, were elevated. The absence of an increase in CRP levels in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice indicates that the increased levels of Siaα2,6Gal-bearing glycoproteins in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice is not due to induction of the acute phase response. Haptoglobin from Both Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) Mice Is Modified with Siaα2,6Gal—Haptoglobin is a major plasma glycoprotein known to bear two N-linked oligosaccharides that are extensively modified with terminal Siaα2,6Gal (27Dalziel M. Lemaire S. Ewing J. Kobayashi L. Lau J.T. Glycobiology.. 1999; 9: 1003-1008Google Scholar). The SNA-I lectin blot in Fig. 2 shows that the isoforms of haptoglobin that are elevated in plasma from ASGP-R2(-/-) mice bear terminal Siaα2,6Gal; but do not establish that these are the major isoforms of haptoglobin. Plasma, 25 μg, from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice was incubated overnight at 4 °C with SNA-I immobilized on agarose (Fig. 4A). After washing to remove unbound proteins, bound glycoproteins were eluted from the column by boiling in SDS. Less than 10% of the haptoglobin remained in the unbound fraction following incubation with SNA-I agarose and >90% of the bound haptoglobin was present in the fraction eluted with SDS (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when Wt or ASGP-R2(-/-) plasma was incubated with immobilized RCA-I, which binds oligosaccharides with terminal Gal (28Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1979; 254: 9795-9799Google Scholar), the major fraction of haptoglobin was present in the unbound fraction and the first wash fraction. The differences in the amount of haptoglobin in the Unbound and Wash1 fractions from Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice does not reach statistical significance. The amount of haptoglobin present in the bound fraction did not differ, 3% in plasma from Wt mice versus 4% in plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) (Fig. 4B). Thus, the major, if not exclusive, form of haptoglobin in both Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice bears oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal whereas haptoglobin bearing terminal Gal is a minor fraction in Wt and ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, the amount of haptoglobin bearing terminal Gal does not increase significantly in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice as compared with Wt mice. Thus, the increase in haptoglobin in ASGP-R2(-/-) mice represents a reduced clearance rate for glycoproteins bearing oligosaccharides that terminate with Siaα2,6Gal. Our observation that multiple glycoproteins bearing terminal Siaα2,6Gal are elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice indicates that the ASGP-R serves to control the concentration of glycoproteins bearing structures terminating with Siaα2,6Gal by clearing them from the blood. The ASGP-R, an abundant carbohydrate-specific, endocytic receptor that is expressed by parenchymal cells in the liver (1Ashwell G. Harford J. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1982; 51: 531-554Google Scholar), is well suited for this purpose. It is among the most abundant receptors known in mammals with as many as 500,000 asialoglycoprotein binding sites expressed at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes (3Schwartz A.L. Rup D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1980; 255: 9033-9036Google Scholar, 4Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 1980; 255: 6111-6120Google Scholar, 5Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. Cell.. 1980; 22: 611-620Google Scholar). The receptor is rapidly endocytosed and recycled back to the cell surface. The ASGP-R is capable of internalizing 0.1 pmol of ligand per minute per 106 parenchymal cells (3Schwartz A.L. Rup D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1980; 255: 9033-9036Google Scholar, 29Schwartz A.L. Fridovich S.E. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4230-4237Google Scholar). The 1.5 g of liver in the mouse is capable of removing 1.2 nmol of ligand per h from the blood if it is saturated with ligand! This is the equivalent of clearing 110 μg of haptoglobin dimer with a molecular weight of 90,000 per hour. The normal concentration of haptoglobin, one of the most abundant glycoproteins present in plasma, is 600–2700 μg/ml or 7.0–30 μm. If the ASGP-R binds haptoglobin with a Kd of 3.6 μm, the Kd that we obtained for binding bovine serum albumin chemically modified with oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal (13Park E.I. Mi Y. Unverzagt C. Gabius H.J. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 17125-17129Google Scholar), the receptor would be saturated at the concentrations of haptoglobin seen in vivo. As a result, if haptoglobin were the only glycoprotein recognized the ASGP-R would remove 110 μg of haptoglobin from the blood per h or between 2 and 9% of the haptoglobin present in the entire circulation of the mouse every h. However, haptoglobin is not the only glycoprotein that bears oligosaccharides that terminate with Siaα2,6Gal, nor is it the only glycoprotein that is elevated in the plasma of ASGP-R2(-/-) mice. The glycoproteins listed in Table 1 as well as a number of other glycoproteins also bear oligosaccharides terminating with Siaα2,6Gal and will compete with haptoglobin as well as each other for binding to the ASGP-R. The ASGP-R will, therefore, be saturated with respect to binding ligands that bear terminal Siaα2,6Gal. As a result the fraction of ASGP-R binding sites that are occupied by individual glycoproteins will reflect their relative affinity and concentration relative to the other glycoproteins in plasma that are recognized. For example, if haptoglobin is bound with a Kd of 3.0 μm and SAP with a Kd of 15 μm and both are present in plasma at the same concentration, 80% of the ASGP-R will be occupied with haptoglobin and 20% with SAP. Under this condition haptoglobin will be cleared at a 4-fold greater rate than SAP. The affinity of individual plasma glycoproteins that bear oligosaccharides that terminate with Siaα2,6Gal for the ASGP-R will reflect the number and location of these structures. The concentrations of plasma glycoproteins will reflect their rates of synthesis and their rates of removal by mechanisms related to their function such as the binding of free hemoglobin by haptoglobin as well as clearance by the ASGP-R. We propose that the ASGP-R acts much like a “buffer” in vivo. If the concentration of a plasma glycoprotein increases due to increased synthesis, it will occupy a greater fraction of the ASGP-R and be cleared at a more rapid rate. If the concentration of a plasma glycoprotein decreases due to consumption, for example in the case of haptoglobin by increased hemolysis, a smaller fraction of the ASGP-R will be occupied by that glycoprotein and it will be cleared at a slower rate. We postulate that the ASGP-R serves to help regulate the relative concentrations of a wide range of plasma glycoproteins that all bear terminal Siaα2,6Gal. Because the total amount of these glycoproteins is more than sufficient to saturate the binding sites on the hepatocytes, each glycoprotein will occupy a fraction of the receptor proportionate to the concentration and affinity of that glycoprotein relative to all the other glycoproteins in the plasma. Should the concentration of an individual glycoprotein increase or decrease relative to all the others due to some perturbation, the ASGP-R will serve to return the glycoprotein to its same relative concentration after the perturbation has ceased by increasing or decreasing its rate of clearance. Such a function may well explain why so many different glycoproteins in plasma bear oligosaccharides that terminate with Siaα2,6Gal. An attractive feature of such a mechanism is that it would also serve to return glycoproteins to hepatocytes where their amino acids and sugars can be recycled following degradation in lysosomes. The rapid clearance of glycoproteins bearing terminal Siaα2, 6GalNAc, Gal, or GalNAc will continue because glycoproteins bearing these structures will be bound with affinities that are 100-fold stronger than those for glycoproteins bearing structures terminating with Siaα2,6Gal. The rapid clearance of glycoproteins bearing terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc, Gal, or GalNAc may reflect additional functions that require rapid clearance by the ASGP-R. For example, the reported removal of platelets from the blood by the ASGP-R during S. pneumoniae sepsis due to the action of the bacterial neuraminidase may comprise such a distinct function (11Grewal P.K. Uchiyama S. Ditto D. Varki N. Le D.T. Nizet V. Marth J.D. Nat. Med.. 2008; 14: 648-655Google Scholar). The results we have presented indicate that the ASGP-R does indeed mediate the clearance of a wide range of glycoproteins that bear terminal Siaα2,6Gal. Ablation of the ASGP-R results in significant increases in the plasma concentrations of these glycoproteins. We propose that an important function of the ASGP-R is to contribute to the regulation of the relative concentrations of plasma glycoproteins bearing terminal Siaα2,6Gal."

Neurodegeneration in AD correlates with dysfunction of diverse signal transduction mechanisms, such as the G-protein-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis mediated by Gαq/11. We report here that impaired Gαq/11-stimulated signaling in brains of AD patients and mice correlated with the appearance of cross-linked oligomeric angiotensin II AT2 receptors sequestering Gαq/11. Amyloid β (Aβ) was causal to AT2 oligomerization, because cerebral microinjection of Aβ triggered AT2 oligomerization in the hippocampus of mice in a dose-dependent manner. Aβ induced AT2 oligomerization by a two-step process of oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking. The induction of AT2 oligomers in a transgenic mouse model with AD-like symptoms was associated with Gαq/11 dysfunction and enhanced neurodegeneration. Vice versa, stereotactic inhibition of AT2 oligomers by RNA interference prevented the impairment of Gαq/11 and delayed Tau phosphorylation. Thus, Aβ induces the formation of cross-linked AT2 oligomers that contribute to the dysfunction of Gαq/11 in an animal model of Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β; APPSw mice, transgenic mice expressing human APP695 with the double mutation (K670N/M671L) that was identified in a Swedish family with early onset Alzheimer disease; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RNAi, RNA interference. is a protein aggregation disease that is characterized by profound neuropathological changes in the brain, including neurodegeneration, neurofibrillary tangles, and the accumulation of fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ) in extracellular senile plaques. Although some neuropathological features of AD, such as tangles and plaques, are also detected in brains of elderly people without major symptoms of dementia (1Price J.L. Morris J.C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar), neurodegeneration and neuronal loss of AD patients are associated with the major AD symptoms of memory impairment and dementia (2Gomez-Isla T.

McKeel D.W. Morris J.C. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Neurodegeneration in AD is accompanied by dysfunction of diverse signal transduction mechanisms, such as the G-protein-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis mediated by Gαq/11 (4Ferrari-DiLeo G. Flynn D.D. Life Sci. 1993; 53: PL439-PL444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Fowler C.J. Cowburn R.F. Garlind A. Winblad B. O'Neill C. Mol.

Aging. 2006; 27: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Gαq/11-stimulated signal transduction pathways are important for neuronal communication, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival (9Miura M. Watanabe M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Kano M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8379-8390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wettschureck N. van der Stelt M. Tsubokawa H. Krestel H. Moers A. Petrosino S. Schütz G. Di Marzo V. Offermanns S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5888-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the Gαq/11 signaling defect of AD patients plays a role in the disease process leading to neurodegeneration and dementia. In agreement with this notion, G-protein dysfunction is directly associated with disease severity of AD patients (8Tsang S.W. Lai M.K. Kirvell S. Francis P.T. Esiri M.M. Hope T. Chen C.P. Wong P.T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Further insight into the pathological role of the G-protein dysfunction of AD patients is lacking, because the underlying mechanism is barely understood. Several observations point to a specific defect at the level of Gαq/11: (i) protein levels of Gαq/11 are not changed (7Jope R.S. Song L. Li X. Powers R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); (ii) downstream receptor/G-protein-independent phosphoinositide hydrolysis is intact (7Jope R.S. Song L. Li X. Powers R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); and (iii) receptor-mediated activation of other G-proteins, such as the Gαi/o proteins, is not affected (5Fowler C.J. Cowburn R.F. Garlind A. Winblad B. O'Neill C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In view of a putative role in the pathogenesis, we investigated the mechanism accounting for defective Gαq/11 activation in AD. Gαq/11 activation is under control of specific receptors. Although most receptors interacting with Gαq/11 stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange and thereby trigger Gαq/11-mediated signaling, the angiotensin II AT2 receptor is inhibitory and capable of disrupting receptor-stimulated Gαq/11 activation under specific conditions (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies link the AT2 receptor to diverse neuronal functions related to behavior (12Ichiki T. Labosky P.A. Shiota C. Okuyama S. Imagawa Y. Fogo A. Niimura F. Ichikawa I. Hogan B.L. Inagami T. Nature. 1995; 377: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), apoptosis (13Shenoy U.V. Richards E.M. Huang X.-C. Sumners C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and memory (14Vervoort V.S. Beachem M.A. Edwards P.S. Ladd S. Miller K.E. de Mollerat X. Clarkson K. DuPont B. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Boyd E. Srivastava A.K. Science. 2002; 296: 2401-2403PubMed Google Scholar). Focusing on the inhibitory AT2 receptor as a potential candidate accounting for defective Gαq/11 activation in AD, we identified cross-linked oligomeric AT2 receptors that form by a two-step cross-linking process triggered by aggregated Aβ. Functional Assays-Basal and stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS (specific activity 1250 Ci/mmol; final concentration 0.5 nm) to Gαq/11 was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm GDP in a volume of 200 μl in triplicates with membranes (25 μg of protein/point) prepared from human prefrontal cortex specimens and mouse hippocampal tissue as described (15AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), followed by immunoaffinity enrichment of Gαq/11. The method measures specifically the activation of Gαq/11, because the applied antibodies cross-react specifically with Gαq/11 as determined in immunoblot. The assay of [3H]phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was carried out in triplicates with membranes (100 μg of protein/point) of human prefrontal cortex specimens, as detailed previously (6Greenwood A.F. Powers R.E. Jope R.S. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase activity was determined by a [3H]putrescine incorporation assay (15AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity enrichment of Gαq/11 followed by immunoblot detection of co-enriched AT2 was performed by a method that was described (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Activities of α-secretase and β-secretase present in hippocampal tissue of 13-month-old nonstressed and stressed APPSw mice were determined using commercially available secretase kits (R&D Systems). Soluble and aggregated Aβ peptide levels (Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42)) were determined in supernatant (SDS-soluble) and the formic acid extract of the pellet (SDS-insoluble) of hippocampal tissue preparations from 13-month-old nonstressed and stressed APPSw mice using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Invitrogen). Antibodies for Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry-The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting, affinity purification, and immunohistochemistry (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar): affinity-purified rabbit/rat polyclonal anti-AT2 antibodies (raised against an antigen encompassing amino acids 320-349 of the human AT2 receptor); affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-AT2 antibodies (raised against an antigen encompassing amino acids 16-35 of the human or mouse AT2 receptor); affinity-purified rabbit/rat polyclonal anti-M1 antibodies (raised against an antigen encompassing amino acids 231-350 of the human M1 receptor); affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-transglutaminase antibodies (raised against an antigen encompassing amino acids 1-20 of mouse transglutaminase-2); affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαq/11 antibodies (raised against the C terminus of Gαq/11). Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were routinely used to determine and confirm cross-reactivity of the antibodies with the respective proteins (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

Protein Detection in Immunoblot-Insoluble, formic acid (70%)-extractable Aβ in the prefrontal cortex specimens indicative of Aβ plaque load was assessed by immunoblot with Aβ-specific rat polyclonal antibodies after serial extraction in the presence of protease inhibitors by high salt (150 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 750 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) and detergents (1% Triton X-100 in high salt buffer followed by radioimmune precipitation buffer and 2% SDS in 150 mm Tris, pH 7.6). Membranes were prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 4 °C, followed by partial enrichment (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (500 μg of protein/1.5 ml containing ∼300-400 fmol/mg AT2) were solubilized by 20 mm CHAPS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The solubilized proteins were precipitated and delipidated by acetone/methanol (12:2; final concentration 83%) for 90 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, followed by three washing steps with 0.2 ml of cold acetone. The pellet was dissolved in SDS-sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 m urea for 90 min at room temperature and stored for further use at -70 °C. For immunoblotting analysis, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and supplemented with urea followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (15AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies or F(ab)2 fragments of the respective antibodies preabsorbed to human and mouse proteins, respectively, were used for detection of AT2, AT1 receptors, and Gαq/11. Applied antibodies were characterized in previous studies (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 15AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U.

Bound antibody was visualized by preabsorbed F(ab)2 fragments of enzyme-coupled secondary antibodies or by enzyme-coupled Protein A followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL Plus). Receptor Quantification-The number of AT2 receptors was determined with membranes (50 μg of protein/point) suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EDTA (including protease inhibitor mixture) by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with 50 nm 125I-labeled F(ab)2 fragments of affinity-purified AT2-specific antibodies (∼1 μCi) in a total volume of 100 μl in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled antibodies to determine nonspecific binding. Receptor-bound antibodies were separated from free antibodies by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters (GF/B; Whatman), followed by washing with ice-cold incubation buffer. Bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The binding assay was standardized with affinity-purified recombinant AT2 receptors expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding AT2. Patients-Prefrontal cortex specimens were obtained at autopsy from 10 demented individuals with clinical diagnosis of (probable) AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (male/female ratio 4:6, average age 73 ± 2 years, range 63-81 years, postmortem interval 3-10 h) and from 10 nondemented patients (male/female ratio 5:5, average age 71 ± 2 years, range 60-78 years, postmortem interval 4-10 h) used as a control group. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and control individuals (or subjects’ relatives), and the study was approved by the Ethical Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University. Transgenic Animals-Transgenic mice (Tg2576; Taconic) used in this study express human APP695 with the double mutation (K670N/M671L; APPSw) that was identified in a Swedish family with early onset Alzheimer disease (18Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar). Nontransgenic mice served as a control group for immunoblotting studies. Lentiviral Vector Production-Vector plasmids were constructed for the production of third generation lentiviruses expressing HA-transglutaminase-2 under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen). For RNA interference, lentiviral constructs with RNA polymerase II promoter-driven expression of micro-RNAs targeting AT2 (nucleotides 296-316) or β-galactosidase (nucleotides 1298-1318) were used. The generation of viral particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein was performed with a four-plasmid system by transient transfection of 293T cells. Forty-eight hours later, the supernatants were collected. Titers of the lentiviral stocks were determined by transduction efficiency of HT1080 cells. High titer stocks were obtained by ultracentrifugation. For stereotactic injection in mice, high titer lentiviral stocks were used (>1 × 107 transduction units/μl). Immunotherapy with Aβ-(1-40) Peptide Immunization-Immunotherapy of APPSw mice with Aβ-(1-40) peptide immunization was performed essentially as described (19Dickstein D.L. Biron K.E. Ujiie M. Pfeifer C.G. Jeffries A.R. Jefferies W.A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), starting at 12 months of age. Prior to immunization, Aβ-(1-40) (2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Immunization was performed with Aβ-(1-40) (100 μg/injection) or phosphate-buffered saline (control) mixed 1:1 with complete Freund’s adjuvant. Booster injections in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant followed 2 weeks after the first injection and monthly thereafter up to 18 months. Blood samples were collected prior to immunization and 3 weeks after the initial immunization. Titers of anti-Aβ antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with serum samples from Aβ- and control-immunized APPSw mice. Aβ-immunized mice, which did not exhibit high titers of anti-Aβ antibodies, were not included in the study. At 18 months of age, APPSw transgenic mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in the same buffer. Brains were removed, fixed >48 h in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and paraffin-embedded by standard methods. Immunoblotting and functional studies were performed with hippocampal membrane tissue isolated from nonfixed brain samples. Immunohistochemistry, Radioimmunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescence-For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded sections (8 μm, taken at 50-μm intervals for analyses, 10-15 sections/set) were deparaffinized followed by antigen retrieval (15AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of transglutaminase-2, AT2 receptor, and M1 receptor were performed with F(ab)2 fragments of preabsorbed affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 15AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Sections were stained for Aβ plaques with monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with residues 1-12 of the Aβ peptide (clone BAM-10; Sigma). Phosphorylated Tau was visualized with AT8 antibodies (Pierce). Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) was used as a marker of neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (anti-MAP2 antibodies; Sigma). DNA strand breaks were determined in situ applying TUNEL technology (Roche Applied Science). All sections were imaged with a Leica DMI6000 microscope equipped with a DFC420 camera. Plaque burden was analyzed at 18 months of age by computerized quantitative image analysis of immunolabeled hippocampal areas. Assessment of the site and area of lentivirus infection was performed with paraffin sections obtained from brains of 17-month-old APPSw mice 5 weeks after injection into the CA3 area of 2 μl of a lentivirus preparation (∼1 × 107 transduction units/μl) encoding HA-transglutaminase-2. Lentivirus-driven expression of HA-transglutaminase-2 was visualized by radioimmunohistochemistry applying anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by 125I-labeled secondary antibodies (specific activity ∼3000 Ci/mmol) and autoradiography. Immunofluorescence staining of phosphorylated Tau, AT2, and M1 receptors was performed with cryosections (8 μm) of postfixed and frozen brains obtained from 13- or 15-month-old APPSw mice subjected to stress for 4 weeks (short term) or 12 weeks (long term), respectively. For co-localization of AT2 and M1, affinity-purified rat anti-AT2 antibodies and rabbit anti-M1 antibodies were applied (dilution 1:4000), followed by secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 (dilution 1:5000; Molecular Probes) and counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Sections were imaged with a Leica DMI6000 microscope equipped with a DFC350FX camera. Cerebral Injection of Lentiviruses and Aβ Peptide-Expression of transglutaminase-2 in the hippocampus of 16-month-old APPSw transgenic mice was induced by stereotactic injection of 2 μl of a transglutaminase-encoding lentivirus under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter into the CA3 area of the hippocampus (anteroposterior -1.58 to -2.3 mm; lateral 1.8-2.8 mm; dorsoventral -2 mm) as described (20Singer O. Marr R.A. Rockenstein E. Crews L. Coufal N.G. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Masliah E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Briefly, anesthetized mice were placed on a Kopf stereotactic apparatus, coordinates were determined according to the Franklin and Paxinos atlas, the skin was delicately bored with a 0.5-ml insulin syringe equipped with a 30-gauge needle, and lentiviruses (∼1 × 107 transduction units/μl) were delivered using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe with a 33-gauge blunt tip needle at a rate of 0.25 μl/min. The control group of 16-month-old APPSw transgenic mice received injection of a control lentivirus encoding β-galactosidase. A total of 12 APPSw transgenic mice/group were injected unilaterally. Twenty days after the lentivirus injection, mice were anesthetized, brains were removed after intracardial perfusion, and injected hemispheres (or brains) of mice were fixed and paraffin-embedded. Immunoblotting and Gαq/11 activity measurement were performed with nonfixed hippocampal tissue isolated from the injected brain hemispheres. For down-regulation of AT2 expression, a lentivirus that delivers a micro-RNA targeting the coding region of AT2 (nucleotides 296-316) by RNA interference (RNAi) was injected into the CA1 area of the hippocampus of 12-month-old APPSw mice as detailed above. The control group received injection of a control lentivirus targeting β-galactosidase (nucleotides 1298-1318). After 1 week of recovery, mice were subjected to the stress paradigm for 4 weeks. Five weeks after the lentiviral injection, behavioral analysis, biochemical analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed as described. Protein expression levels of lentivirus-driven expression were routinely monitored in immunoblot (e.g. with anti-transglutaminase antibodies (∼1.8-2.3-fold hippocampal overexpression compared with mice injected with a control lentivirus encoding β-galactosidase)). To assess the effect of Aβ on AT2 oligomerization in vivo, the indicated amounts of the Aβ-(1-40) peptide in 2 μl were microinjected under anesthesia into the CA1 area of the hippocampus of 13-month-old nontransgenic mice as described (21Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar, 22Kowall N.W. Beal M.F. Busciglio J. Duffy L.K. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7247-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Vehicle was used as control. Seven days after the injection, biochemical analysis of AT2 receptors was performed by immunoblot. Induction of Stress-To analyze the effect of stress, 12-month-old APPSw transgenic mice were distributed into two subgroups. One subgroup was housed in normal conditions (nonstressed), and the other subgroup was subjected to stress (stressed) as described (23Monleon S. D'Aguila P. Parra A. Simon V.M. Brain P.F. Willner P. Psychopharmacology. 1995; 117: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The following stimuli were administered each week in a random order for 4 weeks: 3 h of 45° cage tilt, two times a week; soaked cage for 12 h, once a week; water deprivation for 14 h, once a week; lights on for 9 h during the dark phase, once a week; noise in the room for 3 h, three times a week; flashing light for 30 min, three times a week. Stressed mice with a significant decrease in sucrose preference (≤50% of sucrose consumption compared with nonstressed controls) were included in the study. Stressed mice also exhibited a significant increase in plasma corticosterone levels (11.4 ± 0.6 μg/dl of stressed APPSw mice and 5.2 ± 0.5 μg/dl of nonstressed APPSw mice; n = 12 mice/group). After 28 days of stress, 4 h before the beginning of the dark phase, brains from stressed and nonstressed APPSw mice were removed and processed for immunoblotting, functional studies, and immunohistochemistry as described above. Twelve animals of each subgroup were used for behavioral studies. Behavioral Studies-We used the standard water maze task (hidden platform) to test for spatial memory (24Morris R.G.M. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N.P. O'Keefe J. Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Testing involved four trials per day over 10 days starting after the stress period. On the day following the 10 days of acquisition testing, memory retention was determined in a single 60-s probe trial, for which the submerged platform was removed. All behavioral studies were performed essentially as described (25King D.L. Arendash G.W. Physiol. Behav. 2002; 75: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the committees on animal research at the Universities of Hamburg and Cairo and were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Statistics-Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. To determine significance between two groups, we made comparisons using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Impaired Gαq/11-stimulated Signaling on Prefrontal Cortex Specimens of AD Patients-Prefrontal cortex specimens of AD patients with significant levels of “insoluble” amyloid β (Aβ) characteristic of Aβ plaque load (Fig. 1A) were applied to analyze the G-protein signaling defect. Specimens of AD patients were characterized by impaired Gq/11-stimulated signaling, as revealed by significantly reduced phosphoinositide hydrolysis under basal conditions or upon stimulation with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol and the G-protein activator GTPγS orAlF4- (Fig. 1B). By contrast, direct stimulation of phospholipases C by calcium was not different between AD cases and nondemented controls (Fig. 1B). Post-mortem time (≤10 h) did not significantly affect the phosphoinositide signal (data not shown). These findings with prefrontal cortex specimens from AD patients confirm previous data of defective Gαq/11-stimulated phosphoinositide signaling in AD (4Ferrari-DiLeo G. Flynn D.D.

Oligomeric AT2 Receptors in AD Patients-We hypothesized that the neuronal angiotensin II AT2 receptor could be involved in the Gαq/11 signaling defect of AD patients, because the AT2 receptor is one of the few inhibitory receptors capable of disrupting receptor-stimulated Gαq/11 activation under specific conditions (11AbdAlla S.

Moreover, several studies link the AT2 receptor to cerebral functions related to behavior, neuronal apoptosis, and memory (12Ichiki T. Labosky P.A. Shiota C. Okuyama S. Imagawa Y. Fogo A. Niimura F.

Combining UV-visible absorption, EPR, and enzyme activity measurements, we demonstrate here that E. coli DinG contains a redox-active [4Fe-4S] cluster with a midpoint redox potential (Em) of –390 ± 23 mV (pH 8.0) and that reduction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster reversibly switches off the DinG helicase activity.

However, the DinG [4Fe-4S] cluster can be efficiently modified by nitric oxide (NO), forming the DinG-bound dinitrosyl iron complex with the concomitant inactivation of helicase activity in vitro and in vivo. Reassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in NO-modified DinG restores helicase activity, indicating that the iron-sulfur cluster in DinG is the primary target of NO cytotoxicity.

Protein Preparation—The DNA fragment encoding the DNA damage-inducible protein DinG was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA using PCR. Two primers, DinG-1 (5′-GGTTTTCCCATGGCATTAACCGCC-3′) and DinG-2 (5′-CATCATTAAAGCTTCCGACGGCGT-3′), were used for PCR amplification. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and NcoI and ligated into expression vector pET28b+ to produce pTDinG. The cloned DNA fragment was confirmed by direct sequencing using the T7 primer (Genomic Facility, Louisiana State University). Recombinant DinG was overproduced in E. coli BL21 strain in Terrific broth and purified using a nickel-agarose column, followed by a HiTrap desalting column. The purity of purified DinG was >95% judging from the SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining. The precise molecular weight of recombinant DinG was confirmed using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (Chemistry Department, Louisiana State University). The protein concentration of purified DinG was measured from the absorption peak at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 79.0 mm–1 cm–1. The total iron content in protein samples was determined using an iron indicator, FerroZine (38Cowart R.E. Singleton F.L. Hind J.S. Anal.

Briefly, an oligonucleotide (5′-CCGTAACACTGAGTTTCGTCACCAGTACAAACTACAACGCCTGTAGCATTCCACA-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5 μm) was annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (New England Biolabs) in annealing buffer containing Tris (50 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (50 mm), and MgCl2 (10 mm). The DNA solution was heated at 85 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature over 3 h. The annealed DNA duplex was purified using a gel filtration spin column (CHROMA SPIN-400, Clontech) pre-equilibrated with annealing buffer. The annealed substrate (at a final concentration of 2 nm) was incubated with DinG in 20 μl of reaction solution containing Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0), NaCl (100 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), dithiothreitol (2 mm), glycerol (5%), and ATP (2 mm) at 30 °C for 10 min. For each experiment, two controls in which the substrate was either denatured by heating at 85 °C for 5 min or incubated at 30 °C for 10 min without any enzymes were included. The reactions were terminated by adding 4 μl of stop solution (containing 6% SDS, 60 mm EDTA, and 0.3% bromphenol blue). The reaction products (single-stranded DNA) were separated on 1% Tris acetate/EDTA-agarose gel, transferred to Nytran transfer membranes (0.45 μm; What-man), and exposed to x-ray films overnight for quantification. Redox Titration of the DinG Iron-Sulfur Cluster—A specially designed anaerobic cuvette was used for redox titrations as described by Dutton (43Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Before titration, solution containing DinG (20 μm) and safranin O (1 μm) was equilibrated with ultrapure argon gas for 50 min at room temperature. During titration, argon flow was maintained with gentle stirring using a small magnet on the bottom of the cuvette. The redox potential of the solution was adjusted by adding a small amount of freshly prepared sodium dithionite using a 10-μl gas-tight microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV). The redox potential was monitored directly with a redox microelectrode (Microelectrodes Inc., Bedford, NH). Freshly prepared ZoBell solution containing potassium ferricyanide (5 mm) and potassium ferricyanide (5 mm) dissolved in Tris buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0) and NaCl (500 mm) was used as a standard (Eh = 238 mV) for calibration of the redox microelectrode. NO Exposure of DinG and Reassembly of the Iron-Sulfur Cluster in the Protein—Purified DinG (30 μm) was incubated with the NO-releasing reagent diethylamine NONOate (0–0.5 mm; Cayman Chemicals) in buffer containing Tris (20 mm, pH 7.5) and NaCl (200 mm) anaerobically at room temperature. Diethylamine NONOate releases 1.5 eq of NO/mol of parent compound with a half-life time of 16 min at room temperature and pH 7.5. After a 20-min incubation, the protein was repurified by passage through a HiTrap desalting column to remove residual diethylamine NONOate. For in vivo NO exposure, E. coli cells containing recombinant DinG were subjected to the Silastic tubing NO delivery system (44Tamir S. Lewis R.S. de Rojas Walker T. Deen W.M. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as described previously (41Ren B. Zhang N. Yang J. Ding H. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 953-964PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the Silastic tubing (0.025 (inner diameter) × 0.047 (outer diameter) inches) immersed in the cell culture was adjusted to such that ∼100 nm NO/s was released to the cell culture in a sealed flask under anaerobic conditions. The chosen NO release rate was comparable with reported NO production in activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (34Krieglstein C.F. Cerwinka W.H. Laroux F.S. Salter J.W. Russell J.M. Schuermann G.

After the E. coli cells were subjected to NO exposure for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 10 min anaerobically, recombinant DinG was purified from cells following the procedures described above. For reassembly of iron-sulfur clusters, NO-exposed DinG (10 μm) was incubated with freshly prepared Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (80 μm), l-cysteine (0.5 mm), and cysteine desulfurase IscS (1 μm) (45Yang W. Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12868-12873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm) anaerobically at 37 °C for 20 min as described (45Yang W. Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12868-12873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), followed by repurification of DinG from the incubation solution. Repurified DinG was then subjected to EPR and helicase activity measurements. EPR Measurements—The EPR spectra were recorded at X-band on a Bruker ESR-300 spectrometer using an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 flow cryostat. The routine EPR conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; microwave power, 10 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 2.0 milliteslas; sample temperature, 20 K; and receive gain, 1.0 × 105. E. coli DinG Contains an Iron-Sulfur Cluster Essential for Protein Stability and Helicase Activity—Fig. 1A shows the UV-visible absorption spectrum of purified E. coli DinG. The major peak at ∼403 nm represents a typical absorption of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins. The overall spectrum of purified DinG was similar to that of the purified XPD homolog [4Fe-4S] cluster from S. acidocaldarius (15Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and the endonuclease III [4Fe-4S] cluster from E. coli (35Rogers P.A. Eide L. Klungland A. Ding H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The total iron and sulfur content analyses of purified DinG showed that each DinG monomer contained ∼3.1 ± 0.5 iron and 2.8 ± 0.8 sulfide (n = 3), indicating that DinG contains one [4Fe-4S] cluster per monomer. Purified DinG was further analyzed for its DNA helicase activity. Following the procedures described by Voloshin et al. (5Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28284-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that as-purified DinG was able to unwind double-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 1B). E. coli DinG has 11 cysteine residues; four of them (Cys-120, Cys-194, Cys-199, and Cys-205) are conserved among a subset of DinG proteins from diverse bacteria (6Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. J.

Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To test whether the conserved cysteine residues are required for iron-sulfur cluster binding, we substituted each of these four cysteine residues in DinG with serine using site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All four mutant proteins (C120S, C194S, C199S, and C205S), purified using the same procedure as wild-type DinG, had no absorption peak at 403 nm (Fig. 2A). The SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that unlike wild-type DinG, the DinG mutants expressed in E. coli cells were largely degraded (Fig. 2B) and had no detectable helicase activity (Fig. 2C). Thus, these conserved cysteine residues appear to be essential for the iron-sulfur cluster binding in DinG and protein stability.FIGURE 2The conserved cysteine residues in DinG are required for iron-sulfur cluster binding, protein stability, and helicase activity. The DinG mutants (C120S, C194S, C199S, and C205S) were constructed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, UV-visible absorption spectra of purified DinG mutants. The protein concentrations were ∼3 μm. B, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified wild-type DinG and DinG mutants.

Nevertheless, when reduced DinG was reoxidized by exposure to air or by the oxidant potassium ferricyanide, the absorption peak at 403 nm of DinG reappeared (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the iron-sulfur cluster in DinG can be reversibly reduced by sodium dithionite. The absorption peak at 403 nm was then used to determine the Em of the DinG iron-sulfur cluster. Purified DinG was dissolved in buffer containing the redox mediator safranin O under anaerobic conditions. The redox potential of the solution was adjusted by adding freshly prepared sodium dithionite and directly monitored using a microelectrode as described by Dutton (43Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorption spectra were taken at different redox potentials, and the absorption peak at 403 nm of the DinG [4Fe-4S] cluster was plotted as a function of the poised redox potentials (Fig. 3B). The data from three experiments were fitted to a Nernst equation (n = 1) with a midpoint redox potential of –390 ± 23 mV, a value close to that of the intracellular redox potential in E. coli (17Ding H. Hidalgo E. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33173-33175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). EPR spectroscopy was further used to explore the redox state of the DinG iron-sulfur cluster. As shown in Fig. 3C, purified DinG had no EPR signal at around the g = 2.0 region under the experimental conditions (spectrum 1). However, when freshly prepared sodium dithionite was added to purified DinG, a rhombic EPR signal with gx = 1.918, gy = 1.944, and gz = 2.005, indicative of a reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster, appeared (spectrum 2). Spin quantification revealed that there was ∼0.8–0.9 spin per each iron-sulfur cluster in the dithionite-reduced DinG. The observed g-values were comparable with those of the reduced [4Fe-4S]+ cluster observed in other proteins (46McDevitt C.A. Hanson G.R. Noble C.J. Cheesman M.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15234-15244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The relatively small Δg could reflect the unique property of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in DinG. The rhombic EPR signal was completely eliminated when dithionite-reduced DinG was reoxidized by exposure to air or by potassium ferricyanide (spectrum 3), confirming that the DinG [4Fe-4S] cluster can be reversibly reduced by sodium dithionite"

However, no animal phenotypes have been described due to genetic defects in nuclear-encoded subunits of COX. We knocked down predicted homologues of COX IV and COX Va in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Animals treated with W09C5.8 (COX IV) or Y37D8A.14 (COX Va) RNA interference had shortened lifespans and severe defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. Amount and activity of complex IV, as well as supercomplexes that included complex IV, were decreased in COX-deficient worms. The formation of supercomplex I:III was not dependent on COX. We found that COX deficiencies decreased intrinsic complex I enzymatic activity, as well as complex I-III enzymatic activity. However, overall amounts of complex I were not decreased in these animals. Surprisingly, intrinsic complex I enzymatic activity is dependent on the presence of complex IV, despite no overall decrease in the amount of complex I. Presumably the association of complex I with complex IV within the supercomplex I:III:IV enhances electron flow through complex I. Our results indicate that reduction of a single subunit within the electron transport chain can affect multiple enzymatic steps of electron transfer, including movement within a different protein complex. Patients presenting with multiple defects of electron transport may, in fact, harbor a single genetic defect.

The physical organization of these complexes is controversial. Two extreme models of their structure have been proposed. A “liquid-state model” of the mitochondrial respiratory chain depicts the respiratory complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane as separate entities, functionally connected to each other by the mobile electron carriers, coenzyme Q and cytochrome c. This model postulates that random collision among all respiratory components can account for measured electron transport rates in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Lateral diffusion of each component is regarded as sufficient to generate contact between MRC components (1Chazotte B. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol.

Supercomplex architecture suggests a kinetic advantage that increases the respiratory rate by providing substrate channeling between components of the supercomplex as well as stabilizing the complexes (5Schagger H.

There is also compelling evidence to show interdependence among the individual components of supercomplexes. In mammalian cell lines complex III assembly is required to maintain an intact complex I (17Acin-Perez R. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Fernandez-Silva P. Moreno-Loshuertos R. Perez-Martos A. Bruno C. Moraes C.T. Enriquez J.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Structural defects in complex III affected the amount of complex I, whereas chemical inhibition did not. Patients with defects in cytochrome b not only lose complex III, but also show decreased amounts of complex I, while maintaining normal enzymatic activity of the complex (15Schagger H. de Coo R. Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Godinot C. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36349-36353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Conversely, the disruption of complex I function caused by nonsense mutations in NDUFS4, a subunit of this large multimeric complex, leads to the partial loss of complex III activity in skin fibroblast cultures obtained from Leigh-like patients (18Budde S.M. van den Heuvel L.P. Janssen A.J. Smeets R.J. Buskens C.A. DeMeirleir L. Van Coster R. Baethmann M. Voit T. Trijbels J.M. Smeitink J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44161-44167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, defects in the complex I subunit ND5 did not cause a loss of complex III in the I-III supercomplex (20Cardol P. Boutaffala L. Memmi S. Devreese B. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In most eukaryotes cytochrome c oxidase (COX), or complex IV, contains 10 nuclear and 3 mitochondrial encoded subunits. In cell lines, complex IV stabilizes the assembly of complex I. COX10 knock-out mouse cell lines, which were unable to assemble complex IV, showed decreased amounts of complex I, as detected by Western blot analysis following blue native gel electrophoresis. In human cell lines, high COX I mutation levels can lead to destabilization of complex I (11D'Aurelio M. Gajewski C.D. Lenaz G. Manfredi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2157-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of COX IV expression caused impairment in complex I assembly in mouse cell lines (21Li Y. D'Aurelio M. Deng J.H. Park J.S. Manfredi G. Hu P. Lu J. Bai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17557-17562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although evidence supports interdependence among MRC complexes, the mechanism regulating this phenomenon remains unclear. We hypothesized that supercomplexes exist in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We also hypothesized that decreasing amounts of complex IV subunits would inhibit the assembly of supercomplexes that include complex IV. We expected that, ultimately, reduced levels of complex IV subunits would in turn reduce amounts of associated components of any supercomplex that includes complex IV. These defects could lead to whole animal phenotypes characteristic of mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we use RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down two different predicted subunits of COX. COX IV and Va are two nuclear-encoded subunits of complex IV. Each controls mitochondrial energy metabolism (22Napiwotzki J. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kadenbach B. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Kadenbach B. Frank V. Rieger T. Napiwotzki J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). COX IV does so through an allosteric mechanism when the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio is high. Binding of ATP to the cytosolic domain of COX IV leads to an increase of the Km of cytochrome c (24Napiwotzki J. Kadenbach B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which slows mitochondrial respiration. This mechanism can be abolished by the binding of 3,5-diiodo-thyronine to COX Va (25Arnold S. Goglia F. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). No animals with nuclear-encoded genetic defects in subunits of complex IV have been reported. Genes predicted to encode the worm homologues of COX IV and COX Va were each subjected to RNAi knockdown. After knockdown, whole animal phenotypes were recorded, as well as function and structure of the MRC. Lifespan and fecundity of the animals were reduced, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction. Complex IV activity was reduced, commensurate with decreased amounts of complex IV. Surprisingly, we found that the rate of electron transport within complex I was also decreased by knockdown of either complex IV transcript. Despite the decreased enzymatic activity of complex I in the complex IV knockdown animals, the total amount of complex I remained normal. In diagnosis of patients, our results caution that primary complex IV defects could be misinterpreted to be primary complex I-complex IV defects. Wild type C. elegans (N2) and the Escherichia coli strain HT115 were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. HT115 bacteria containing plasmids used for RNAi knockdown were obtained from GeneService, United Kingdom. Each culture of worms grown for analysis of any sort either had a degree of knockdown measured by qRT-PCR (see below), or lack of complex IV function confirmed by measuring rates of oxygen consumption by mitochondria using TMPD/ascorbate as an electron donor (see below). N2 was grown on either W09C5.8 or Y37D8A.14, the 2 clones of E. coli containing the plasmids that express RNAi corresponding to the target genes, COX IV and COX Va, respectively. The control worms were fed HT115 on Nematode Growth Medium plates (3 days) and transferred to liquid culture (3 additional days) when most animals were young adults. Worm preparation and mitochondrial isolation were performed as previously described (26Kayser E.B. Morgan P.G. Hoppel C.L. Sedensky M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20551-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Kayser E.B. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2004; 125: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The knockdown worms required 4 and 6 days on the plates and in liquid culture, respectively. In this manner two generations of worms were exposed to RNAi or control bacteria. 5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was used to induce RNAi synthesis from the bacteria. Temperature was controlled at 20 °C throughout and the cultures were never allowed to clear. Gene knockdown was checked by qPCR. RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR were done by standard techniques. Life Span-Nematodes were grown for two generations on the RNAi strain being studied or the control strain, OP50. Adult nematodes were allowed to lay eggs for 4-6 h on plates containing lawns of the control or RNAi producing bacteria. The adults were removed and the eggs were allowed to hatch. The day of egg laying for this F1 generation was defined as day 0 of life. Animals were moved to new plates on day 3 of life and plated at a density of 20-22 animals per 35-mm plate. The animals were then moved every 2 days. Death, defined as failure to respond to a light touch, was scored each day. Each experiment consisted of 100-150 animals and was repeated in triplicate. The total number of animals for the three experiments was recorded. Growth Rate-In the experiments described for lifespan, the first day of adulthood was recorded by scoring animals for the presence of eggs. Fecundity-Animals were grown on a bacterial lawn of either HT115 or one of the RNAi clones for two generations. Single larvae were then transferred to new plates with the appropriate lawn. These animals were moved every 2 days and their off-spring were counted on the plates from which they were transferred. Offspring from 15 such animals were used to determine average number of offspring. Behavior in Anesthetic-Freshly washed young adult worms from liquid cultures of each strain were transferred to agar plates and exposed to varying concentrations of the volatile anesthetic, halothane to determine the EC50 values (effective concentration at which 50% of the animals are immobilized). Dose-response analysis is performed as previously described (28Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Meneely P.M. Cascorbi H.F. Anesthesiology. 1988; 69: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Polarography Assay-The polarographic measurement of oxygen consumption of intact mitochondria by a Clark electrode was performed as previously described (29Hoppel C. DiMarco J.P. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4164-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Malate, succinate, and TMPD/ascorbate were used as the electron donors to complex I-, complex II- and complex IV-dependent respiration, respectively. The complex IV rate was measured in the presence of high ADP and 2,4-dinitrophenol to maximize respiratory capacity of complex IV. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) Assay-Enzyme activities were measured at 30 °C, exclusively using cholate-treated mitochondria (1 mg of mitochondrial protein solubilized in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer containing 1% cholate (w/v), pH 7.4, to a final volume of 1 ml). No ETC measurements were made on mitochondrial components prepared for or isolated from blue native gels. CI (NADH-decylubiquinone oxidoreductase (rotenone-sensitive)) (30Hatefi Y.

Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20998-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined by established spectrophotometric methods as mentioned. The activity of CIV was determined by first-order kinetic and reported as absorbance units/min/mg of protein. The activities of the other assays were determined by zero order kinetic and reported as nanomole of substrate/min/mg of protein. Agilent 8453 UV-visible Spectroscopy System and Agilent ChemStation for UV-visible Spectroscopy (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA) were the hardware and the software used for the ETC assay, respectively. Blue Native Gel (BNG) Electrophoresis and In-gel Activity Assay (IGA)-BNGs (34Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 555-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were loaded with 150-250 μg of mitochondrial protein, determined by Lowry assay, and subjected to membrane solubilization. Digitonin was used with a detergent/protein mass ratio of 6/1. The solubilization was performed at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and Coomassie Blue G-250 was added to the supernatants to obtain a dye/detergent mass ratio of 8/1 before loading onto a 3.5-11% polyacrylamide gradient gel, 0.15 × 14 × 16 cm (Hoefer Inc., Holliston, MA). The gels were run at 100 V until all samples entered the separating gel and then at 300 V for the remainder. When the dye reached one-third of the gel, the first cathode buffer was replaced by the second cathode buffer that contained a 10-fold dilution of Coomassie Blue G-250. Complex I in-gel activity (CI-IGA) was visualized by incubating the gel with 0.5 mm nitro blue tetrazolium and 5 mm NADH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 60 min. Complex IV in-gel activity (CIV-IGA) was visualized by incubating the gel with 0.1% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 0.1% (w/v) cytochrome c and 24 units/ml catalase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 3-6 h. Both protocols are modifications of Grad and Lemire (35Grad L.I. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To visualize complex I as an individual complex in BNGs, Triton X-100 with a detergent/protein mass ratio of 5/1 was used instead of digitonin. 25 μg of mitochondrial protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.1%) and then incubated with either anti-NDUFS3 (MS112, Mitosciences, Eugene, OR) or anti-adenosine nucleotide transporter (MSA02, Mitosciences). Secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal® West Pico, Pierce) was used to develop the reactions. ImageQuant (TL version 2005) software from Amersham Biosciences was used to quantify levels of expression. The expression levels of protein reacting with anti-NDUFS3 were normalized to that of anti-adenosine nucleotide transporter. BNGs were analyzed following the standard mass spectrometry procedure (36Conway J.P. Kinter M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1522-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, the in-gel tryptic digests of the bands cut from BNGs were analyzed using a capillary column LC-tandem mass spectrometer. An LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) was equipped with a microelectrospray ionization source (Protana, Odense, Denmark), which was operated under microspray conditions at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. The digests were analyzed using the data-dependent mode, recording a mass spectrum and three collision-induced dissociation spectra of ions ranging in abundance over several orders or magnitude. The entire sets of collision-induced dissociation spectra in each digest were subjected to data base search against the NCBI data base using the C. elegans taxonomy filter. Analysis of variance was used to analyze groups of data for significant differences. Unpaired Student’s t test was employed to calculate statistical significance of specific pairs if a difference was noted with analysis of variance. Standard deviations (S.D.) and n listed under supplemental data are to enable the reader to determine significance. Error bars in the figures represent mean ± S.E. for each experiment. RNAi-The average percentages of COX IV and COX Va knockdown determined by qPCR from 4 independent cultures were 53.1 ± 7 and 27.4 ± 4%, respectively (see below, and Fig. 1). Phenotypes-Nematodes treated with RNAi for either subunit COX IV (W09C5.8) or COX Va (Y37D8A.14) required an additional day to reach adulthood compared with N2. Lifespan was significantly shortened by 3-5 days, and fecundity was less than half of normal (Table 1). No change in anesthetic sensitivity was seen.TABLE 1Phenotypical study of COX IV and COX Va knockdown wormsPhenotypeN2COX IVCOX VaMean lifespan (days)17 ± 1.114 ± .912 ± 1.5Facundity (eggs/worm)254 ± 22124 ± 14107 ± 17Days to adulthood (days)3 ± 0.14 ± 0.34 ± 0.4EC50 (halothane)3.2 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Polarography-MRC function of intact mitochondria isolated from the knockdown worms and N2 was determined by rates of oxygen consumption. As expected, complex IV respiration was decreased by both RNAi knockdowns (Fig. 1). In addition, the state 3 rates of both complex I- and complex II-dependent oxidative phosphorylation were significantly lower in COX IV knockdown worms than in N2. COX Va knockdown significantly decreased complex I-dependent rates but no significant change was seen in the complex II-dependent rates. The defects in MRC function in both RNAi worms were consistent with complex IV deficiencies. The amount of knockdown of the target gene correlated with TMPD/ascorbate rates; respiratory rates were lowest in those preparations with the greatest RNAi effect (Fig. 1B). Electron Transport Chain-KCN-sensitive cytochrome c oxidase activities in COX IV and COX Va knockdown worms were significantly lower than in the wild type, as expected (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the average rotenone-sensitive NADH-decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activities (electron flow through complex I) in the COX IV and COX Va worms were 59 and 48% lower than in the wild type, respectively (Fig. 2B). NADH-ferricyanide reductase (NFR), a measure of proximal complex I function, was not decreased (Fig. 2C). However, rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (CI-III), a measure of electron flow through complex I to III was decreased in COX Va knockdowns (Fig. 2D). When analyzed by analysis of variance, complex II-III rates in the knockdowns (Fig. 2E, CII-III) were statistically unchanged compared with control. Antimycin A-sensitive decylubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities (complex III) in the knockdown worms were also not statistically different from wild type (Fig. 2F). Because II-III and III activity were unchanged, we concluded that complex II is unaffected by knockdown of complex IV. Complex I and complex IV activity were specifically decreased in the mutants; we therefore asked whether the amounts of these complexes were also changed. Supercomplex Organization in C. elegans Mitochondria-BNGs were used to determine the amount of MRC complexes in the worms with and without RNAi treatment. To optimize the BNG conditions, we first tested dodecyl maltoside (MS), Triton X-100 (TX), and digitonin (DT), as detergents in our isolation (Fig. 3 and supplementary data Fig. S1). We also varied the protein to detergent mass ratio in multiple attempts to optimally isolate supercomplexes as discreet entities. Digitonin at a detergent/protein mass ratio of 6/1 best preserved most MRC supercomplexes (Fig. 3 and supplementary data). Mass spectrometry was used to identify the polypeptides in each band appearing in digitonin (6/1) BNGs. Of the MRC proteins, 26 complex I subunits, 5 complex III subunits, 6 complex IV subunits, and 12 complex V subunits were identified (Table 2). Mitochondrial matrix proteins were found in the same bands as MRC supercomplexes, although the ratio of non-MRC/MRC peptides was less than 1/4, and most commonly seen in isolated complex III. The presence of specific subunits led to the identification of the complexes contained in each band.TABLE 2MRC proteins identified by mass spectrometry in each protein band in digitonin-based BNGs Open table in a new tab In the digitonin gel, multiple bands of greater than 1,236 kDa contained subunits of supercomplex I:III:IV (Fig. 3A, DT) (Table 2). Two other bands at 1,048 and 1,000 kDa were also identified as supercomplex I:III:IV. The 950-kDa band contained only supercomplex I:III. Three bands at 880, 800, and 720 kDa were identified as complex V. Molecular mass analysis predicts that the 880-kDa band represents dimeric complex V, whereas the 720-kDa band is the monomer. Each band contained peptides from all complex V subunits. Relative amounts of these three bands to each other varied slightly in digitonin-based gels, but the sum of their staining was relatively constant (data not shown). The band at 600 kDa corresponds to dimeric complex III. Complex IV is located at 420 kDa, predicted by molecular mass to be dimeric complex IV. A band at 500 kDa, which is positive for CIV-IGA, was not analyzed by mass spectrometry. However, its molecular mass matches the summation of complex III and complex IV (300 and 200 kDa, respectively). Although complex III is usually found only in dimeric form, we cannot rule out that a monomer may form with complex IV. Thus, the band at 500 kDa may represent a supercomplex III:IV but with the monomeric form of each. We also identified bands from the Triton X-100-treated lane (supplementary data). Notably, we found that the band at about 780 kDa contained only complex I subunits, with no proteins identified from other complexes or from non-MRC proteins. Thus, Triton X-100 can be used to isolate complex I, although it is not known whether it contains a complete form of the complex. The two bands at ∼875-900 kDa each contained complex I and III subunits. No bands were seen above 900 kDa in both Triton X-100 and dodecyl maltoside lanes. We were not able to detect complex II in any of our BNGs. We used in-gel activity assays of BNGs of N2 mitochondria to verify the presence and amount of MRC complexes. IGAs (Fig. 3, B and C) corroborated the proteomic results. No complex I or complex IV activity was seen outside of bands that were predicted by mass spectrometry to contain subunits of these complexes. Complex I remained sufficiently intact in all three detergents to maintain enzymatic function, whereas complex IV activity was only seen in the digitonin-treated lane. COX IV and COX Va Knockdowns-RNAi treatment for COX IV and COX Va disrupted supercomplex formation (Fig. 4), as seen in BNGs of digitonin-treated mitochondria. Not surprisingly, COX IV and COX Va knockdown decreased amounts of dimeric complex IV (Fig. 4A). Supercomplex I:III:IV was also decreased in both knockdowns, compared with the wild type, whereas supercomplex I:III was increased. RNAi treatment did not affect amounts of isolated complex III or complex V. CIV-IGA verified loss of complex IV in the knockdown animals (Fig. 4B). Compared with wild type activity, we observed a decrease in COX activity at 420 kDa, the dimeric complex IV, in both RNAi worm strains. The activity of the complex IV component in supercomplex I:II-I:IV was also decreased in the RNAi-treated worms. CI-IGA was decreased in supercomplex I:III:IV after RNAi treatment in the knockdown worms, consistent with the decrease in supercomplex I:III:IV formation (Fig. 4C). However, CI-IGA of supercomplex I:III increased. The ratio of CI-IGA activity in I:III:IV to the total CI-IGA, a"
https://openalex.org/W1978800133,"We have shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) down-regulates thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells by suppressing the activation of NF-kappaB. However, the mechanisms by which mTOR is activated to modulate these responses remain to be addressed. Here, we show that thrombin engages protein kinase C (PKC)-delta and phosphattidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways to activate mTOR and thereby dampens NF-kappaB activation and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. Stimulation of human vascular endothelial cells with thrombin induced the phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream target p70 S6 kinase in a PKC-delta- and PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. Consistent with this, thrombin-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was defective in embryonic fibroblasts from mice with targeted disruption of PKC-delta (Pkc-delta(-)(/)(-)), p85alpha and p85beta subunits of the PI3K (p85alpha(-)(/)(-)beta(-)(/)(-)), or Akt1 and Akt2 (Akt1(-)(/)(-)2(-)(/)(-)). Furthermore, we observed that expression of the constitutively active form of PKC-delta or Akt was sufficient to induce NF-kappaB activation and ICAM-1 expression, and that co-expression of mTOR suppressed these responses. In reciprocal experiments, inhibition/depletion of mTOR augmented NF-kappaB activation and ICAM-1 expression induced by PKC-delta or Akt. In control experiments, increasing or impairing mTOR signaling by the above approaches produced similar effects on NF-kappaB activation and ICAM-1 expression induced by thrombin. Thus, these data reveal an important role of PKC-delta and PI3K/Akt pathways in activating mTOR as an endogenous modulator to ensure a tight regulation of NF-kappaB signaling of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054085388,"Upon exposure to DNA damage the p53 tumor suppressor is accumulated and activated to stall cellular growth. For this to occur, p53 must be relieved from its major inhibitors, Mdm2 (Hdm2 in humans) and Mdmx (Mdm4; Hdmx in humans). A key mechanism controlling this relief is the post-translational modifications of p53 and its inhibitors. We have previously demonstrated that the stress-activated tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, contributes to the relief of p53 from Hdm2. Because Hdmx is the major inhibitor of p53 activity, the additional possibility that c-Abl protects p53 through targeting Hdmx was explored in this study. c-Abl was found to interact with and to phosphorylate Hdmx. This phosphorylation was enhanced in response to DNA damage. Importantly, we mapped the sites of phosphorylation to the p53 binding domain of Hdmx. One of these phosphorylations, on tyrosine 99, inhibited Hdmx interaction with p53. This inhibition is consistent with the predicted role of this residue in the interaction with p53 based on the crystal structure of the interaction site. Our results show that c-Abl not only targets Hdm2, but also Hdmx, which together contribute to p53 activation in response to DNA damage.

Our results show that c-Abl not only targets Hdm2, but also Hdmx, which together contribute to p53 activation in response to DNA damage. Tight regulation of the p53 protein is critical for tumor suppression, for a proper cellular response to stress, and for mouse development (1Vousden K.H. Lane D.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2007; 8: 275-283Google Scholar). P53 stability and activity are regulated by two major inhibitors, Mdm2 and Mdmx (Mdm4; Hdmx in humans), respectively. The importance of the Mdm genes as p53 regulators was best exemplified by the demonstration that elimination of p53 fully rescues mdm2 and mdmx null embryos from lethality (2Marine J.C. Dyer M.A. Jochemsen A.G. J. Cell Sci.. 2007; 120: 371-378Google Scholar). Mdm2 acts as the direct E3 ligase of p53, promoting it for proteasomal degradation and nuclear export (3Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol.. 2003; 13: 49-58Google Scholar). Unlike Mdm2, Mdmx lacks detectable ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and, hence, does not target p53 for degradation but, rather, inhibits p53 transcriptional activity by binding to its transactivation domain (for review, see Ref. 4Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2005; 331: 750-760Google Scholar). Down-regulation or mutations in Mdmx increase the induction of p53 target genes without a change in p53 expression levels (4Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2005; 331: 750-760Google Scholar, 5Marine J.C. Francoz S. Maetens M. Wahl G. Toledo F. Lozano G. Cell Death Differ.. 2006; 13: 927-934Google Scholar). The importance of Mdmx as a regulator of p53 is further demonstrated by its link to cancer development. Hdmx is overexpressed or amplified in 10-20% of human cancers including breast, stomach, colon, and lung cancers (for review, see Ref. 6Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2006; 6: 909-923Google Scholar) and in 65% of retinoblastomas (7Laurie N.A. Donovan S.L. Shih C.S. Zhang J. Mills N. Fuller C. Teunisse A. Lam S. Ramos Y. Mohan A. Johnson D. Wilson M. Rodriguez-Galindo C. Quarto M. Francoz S. Mendrysa S.M. Guy R.K. Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G. Dyer M.A. Nature.. 2006; 444: 61-66Google Scholar). Interestingly, in papillary thyroid carcinomas Hdmx expression is down-regulated, although certain Hdmx variants with p53 inhibitory properties were abnormally expressed in these tumors (8Prodosmo A. Giglio S. Moretti S. Mancini F. Barbi F. Avenia N. Di Conza G. Schunemann H.J. Pistola L. Ludovini V. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Puxeddu E. Moretti F. J. Mol. Med.. 2008; 86: 585-596Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of Mdmx correlates well with a normal status of p53, supporting the notion that this inhibitory pathway is sufficient to suppress p53 and, thus, negates the need for p53 mutation. Thus, abrogating Mdmx function may be an important approach for reactivating p53 in cancer cells (for review, see Ref. 2Marine J.C. Dyer M.A. Jochemsen A.G. J. Cell Sci.. 2007; 120: 371-378Google Scholar).Mdm2 and Mdmx form homo- and heterodimers through their RING domains (9Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M.

Mdmx degradation together with the self-degradation of Mdm2 contributes considerably to p53 activation and stabilization upon stress (for review, see Ref. 17Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol.. 2007; 39: 1476-1482Google Scholar).An important mechanism leading to p53 activation in response to DNA damage involves post-translational modifications, which are mediated by several upstream positive regulators (for review, see Ref. 18Meek D.W. DNA Repair (Amst).. 2004; 3: 1049-1056Google Scholar). One such activator is the c-Abl non-receptor tyrosine kinase (19Levav-Cohen Y. Goldberg Z. Zuckerman V. Grossman T. Haupt S. Haupt Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2005; 331: 737-749Google Scholar). c-Abl has been implicated in the cellular response to stress by promoting cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (20Shaul Y. Ben-Yehoyada M. Cell Res.. 2005; 15: 33-35Google Scholar, 21Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Curr. Top. Dev.

Given the important inhibitory role of Mdmx in p53 regulation and the link between c-Abl and Hdm2, we asked whether c-Abl also protects p53 through targeting Hdmx. We report here a physical and biochemical link between c-Abl and Hdmx. c-Abl interacts with and phosphorylates Hdmx. These phosphorylations are enhanced in response to stress. Tyrosine phosphorylations of Hdmx were mapped to the p53 binding domain of Hdmx, and one of these phosphorylations inhibits p53 binding. Overall, our results reveal that Hdmx is a new target of c-Abl, which together with Hdm2 contributes to p53 activation in response to stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Transfection Assays, and Cell Treatments—H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells, lacking p53 expression, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 293 and 293T human embryo kidney epithelial cells, MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, and mdm2/p53 double null (2KO) fibroblasts were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (26Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Google Scholar). Transfections using polyethyleneimine (PEI; Sigma) were done by mixing DNA with PEI reagent in serum-free medium for 5 min. 1 μl of polyethyleneimine (1 mg/ml) was used for 1 μg of DNA. The polyethyleneimine-DNA complex was applied to the cells for 5-7 h before the medium was replaced. Transfections with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) were performed in 9-cm dishes according to the manufacturer's instructions. The FuGENE 6-DNA complex was applied to the cells for 24 h before the medium was replaced. A constant amount of plasmid DNA in each sample was maintained by supplementing with empty plasmid. Usually, cells were transfected with 5-8 μg of the indicated plasmid for a 9-cm plate and with 2-5 μg for a 5-cm plate.For measuring the cellular response to stress, cells were treated with 3 mm H2O2 (Merck, Germany) together with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) for the indicated times. To induce DNA damage, cells were treated with either 2-2.5 μg/ml doxorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma) or 500 ng/ml neocarzinostatin (Sigma) in the dark. To inhibit proteasomal degradation, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) was added for 4 h.Plasmids, in Vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Generation of Lentivirus—Expression plasmids used in this study were human wild-type (wt) 2The abbreviations used are: wt, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; KD, kinase-defective; aa, amino acids; IP, immunoprecipitation; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BD, binding domain. p53 (pRC-CMV-p53), mouse wt nontagged and HA-tagged c-abl (pCMV-c-abl, type IV), mouse kinase-defective (KD) c-abl (pCMV-c-ablK290H, type IV) (24Goldberg Z.

Hdmx vectors were pcDNA3.1 human HA-hdmx, pcDNA3.1 human wt hdmx, HA-hdmx-C (amino acids (aa) 1-318 followed by 25 alternative aa), hdmx-D (aa 1-206 followed by 13 alternative aa), HA-hdmx-G (Δ27-124 aa). Hdmx deletion mutants were Myc-tagged hdmx ΔN (aa 101-490) and hdmx p53 binding domain (p53 BD)-His-Myc (aa 1-153). The Tyr to Phe substitutions within Hdmx were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on the full-length and the p53 BD hdmx forms. For the production of GFP-c-Abl lentivirus, the following vectors were used; GFP-c-Abl was cloned into SIN18.hEF1-WPRE vector using SmaI and XbaI sites, pCMVΔR8.91-packaging construct, and pMD2.VSVG envelope construct. For the production of lentivirus these three vectors were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, and lentivirus was collected from the supernatants after 48 h. For the production of si-3′UTR-Hdmx lentivirus (MISSION Library Sigma-Aldrich) the manufacturer's instructions were followed.Antibodies—Anti-Hdmx antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal sera p55, p56 (27Ramos Y.F.

Additional antibodies used were: anti-human p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb1801 and DO1; anti-p53 goat polyclonal antibody (FL-393 Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal antibody (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-p53 Ser-20 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA); anti-Hdm2 SMP14 and 2A9 monoclonal antibodies, anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-14-3-3 tau (BIO-SOURCE, Camarillo, CA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), and EnVision peroxidase anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (DAKO Corp., Glostrup, Denmark).Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, in Vivo Kinase Assay and Nickel Pulldown Assay—Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation assay were performed as previously described (26Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Google Scholar), whereas the lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation consisted of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150-300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Nickel pulldown and in vivo kinase assay were performed as described previously (24Goldberg Z. Vogt Sionov R. Berger M. Zwang Y. Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Google Scholar).Luciferase Assay—This assay was done essentially as previously described (24Goldberg Z. Vogt Sionov R. Berger M. Zwang Y. Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Google Scholar).Detection of Phosphorylated Tyr by Mass Spectrometry—Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Hdmx proteins were derived from in vivo kinase assay using wt or kinase-defective c-Abl. The proteins were digested using Asp N enzyme, and mass spectrometry was carried out with Qtof2 (Micromass, England) using nanospray attachment (30Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem.. 1996; 68: 1-8Google Scholar). Data analysis was done using the biolynx package (Micromass, England), and data base searches were performed with the Mascot package (Matrix Science).RESULTSInteraction between c-Abl and Hdmx—To determine whether the protection of p53 by c-Abl involves relief from Hdmx, we examined a possible interaction between c-Abl and Hdmx proteins in cultured cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for HA-Hdmx either alone or together with wt or a KD c-AblK290H mutant of c-Abl. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-c-Abl Abl-148 antibody followed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-Hdmx antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, Hdmx was efficiently co-precipitated only in the presence of c-Abl, demonstrating an interaction between the two proteins in cultured cells. The interaction between Hdmx and the KD mutant of c-Abl appeared to be weaker. To further establish the interaction between Hdmx and c-Abl, we performed a reversal experiment where IP was done with anti-Hdmx 6B1A antibody and IB with anti-c-Abl antibody. Hdmx efficiently co-precipitated c-Abl (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate an interaction between the two proteins in cultured cells. Next, we investigated whether endogenous Hdmx interacts with endogenous c-Abl. To answer this question, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using MCF-7 cell line expressing relatively high endogenous Hdmx levels. c-Abl was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using anti-c-Abl K-12 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-Hdmx antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, Hdmx protein was co-immunoprecipitated by c-Abl, providing evidence for an interaction between the two endogenous proteins.Both c-Abl and Hdmx interact with p53 and Hdm2 (19Levav-Cohen Y. Goldberg Z. Zuckerman V. Grossman T. Haupt S. Haupt Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2005; 331: 737-749Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether the c-Abl/Hdmx interaction is mediated by p53 and/or Hdm2. To address this question, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for c-Abl in combination with different Hdmx deletion mutants. First, we tested the involvement of p53 by using Hdmx-G, a product of an alternative splice variant that lacks amino acids 27-124 encompassing the p53 binding domain of Hdmx (Ref. 15de Graaf P. Little N.A. Ramos Y.F. Meulmeester E. Letteboer S.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 38315-38324Google Scholar and Fig. 1D). Twenty-four hours post-transfection cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 1E, Hdmx-G (ΔN) bound efficiently to c-Abl, suggesting that p53 is not essential for c-Abl-Hdmx interaction under these conditions. Next we investigated the contribution of Hdm2 to the interaction by using another Hdmx alternative splice variant, Hdmx-D, which lacks the C terminus (amino acids 207-490) including the Hdm2 binding region and contains an additional 13 alternative amino acids after amino acid 206 (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1F, HdmxD (ΔC) efficiently co-precipitated with c-Abl, implying that the Hdm2 binding domain is not critical for c-Abl-Hdmx interaction. To further define the interaction region of c-Abl within Hdmx, a series of additional deletion mutants of Hdmx (Fig. 1D) were tested using the same assay. All the Hdmx deletion mutants tested were able to bind c-Abl (supplemental Fig. S1), implying that c-Abl may bind Hdmx at more than one site and/or that additional proteins are involved in the interaction with some of these mutants. c-Abl Phosphorylates Hdmx within the p53 Binding Domain—Because c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase, we asked whether Hdmx is phosphorylated by c-Abl. There are nine Tyr residues within Hdmx, five of which are clustered within the p53 BD (Fig. 2A) and are conserved among mice, rat, and human (Fig. 2B). In view of the possible link to p53 regulation, we examined the ability of c-Abl to phosphorylate an Hdmx deletion mutant containing the N-terminal p53 BD (amino acids 1-153) in an in vivo kinase assay. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for the Myc- and His-tagged hdmx p53 BD either alone or in combination with wt or c-Abl KD. Twenty-four hours post-transfection Hdmx was isolated from cell extracts using nickel resin, and Tyr phosphorylation of Hdmx was monitored with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, Tyr phosphorylation of Hdmx p53 BD was detected only in the presence of wt c-Abl, supporting a role for c-Abl in Tyr phosphorylation of Hdmx within the p53 BD.FIGURE 2c-Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Hdmx. A, schematic representation of the tyrosine residues in Hdmx. The cluster of the tyrosine residues within p53 binding domain of Hdmx is highlighted. B, alignment of the Mdmx amino acid sequence from rat, mouse, and human. The conserved tyrosine residues within Mdmx are highlighted. C, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for c-abl or c-abl KD either alone or together with His- and Myc-tagged hdmx p53 BD (binding domain; amino acids 1-153). Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were harvested, and Hdmx p53 BD was isolated from cell extracts using nickel resin. Phosphorylation was detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and Hdmx levels were monitored by blotting (IB) with anti-Myc antibody. The expression level of c-Abl was monitored with anti-c-Abl antibody (ABL-148).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tyr-99 and Tyr-55 Are the Major Sites within the p53 BD of Hdmx—To identify the c-Abl Tyr phosphorylation site(s) within the p53 BD of Hdmx, we employed mass spectrometric analysis along with site-directed mutagenesis. Hdmx p53 BD was phosphorylated in vivo by c-Abl (Fig. 2C) and then subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Tyr-55 was identified as a potential Tyr phosphorylation site (data not shown). Additionally, we generated substitution mutants from Tyr(Y) to Phe(F) for each Tyr residue in the p53 BD of Hdmx, either alone or in various combinations. The effect of these substitutions on Hdmx phosphorylation by c-Abl was measured in phosphorylation assays in vivo. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for wt hdmx p53 BD or phosphorylation mutants together with wt c-Abl or c-Abl KD. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, Hdmx was precipitated, and Tyr phosphorylation analysis revealed that substitutions of Y99F and Y55F, but not the other Tyr residues within the p53 binding domain, reduced the extent of Hdmx phosphorylation (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Tyr phosphorylation was almost abolished in the Hdmx Y55F,Y99F double mutant (Fig. 3A), supporting the notion that Tyr-55 and Tyr-99 are the major c-Abl phosphorylation sites within the p53 BD of Hdmx. Among these two sites, Y99F substitution had a greater effect on Hdmx phosphorylation (Fig. 3A); hence, it was assumed to be a more dominating site. To further verify the phosphorylation of Hdmx on Tyr-99 and Tyr-55, anti-phospho-monoclonal antibodies were raised. To determine the specificity of these antibodies, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for the Myc and His-tagged hdmx p53 BD in combination with wt c-Abl or c-Abl KD. Specific c-Abl-induced Hdmx phosphorylations on Tyr-55 and Tyr-99 were detected with the corresponding anti-phospho antibodies (Fig. 3B). A similar result was obtained when the experiment was repeated with full-length non-tagged wt Hdmx (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3c-Abl phosphorylates Hdmx on Tyr-99 and Tyr-55 in vivo. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Twenty-four hours later Hdmx p53 BD was isolated by nickel resin from cell extracts, and the protein complex was subjected to Western blotting (IB) using the indicated antibodies as described in Fig. 2C. B and C, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Twenty-four (B) or forty-eight (C) hours later cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Tyr-55 antibody and anti-phospho-Tyr-99 antibody. Total Hdmx levels were monitored by blotting with anti-Hdmx 1328 polyclonal antibody. The position of Tyr-55 and Tyr-99-phosphorylated Hdmx and total Hdmx is indicated. A dividing line in B indicates that lanes were merged from different parts of the same gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phospho-Tyr-99 Affects the Phosphorylation of Tyr-55—Because the phosphorylation sites reside within the same domain of Hdmx, it was of interest to test a potential dependence between the two sites. To examine this possibility, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for Myc and His-tagged wt hdmx p53 BD or phosphorylation mutants either alone or in combination with wt c-Abl or c-Abl KD. The phosphorylation of Tyr-99 was detected in wt Hdmx and the Y55F substitution mutant (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the Tyr-99 phosphorylation is independent of Tyr-55 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Tyr-55 was reduced not only in the Y55F mutant but partially also in the Y99F mutant (Fig. 4B). A similar effect was observed with full-length non-tagged Hdmx (Fig. 4C). This suggests that phosphorylation on Tyr-99 is required at least partially for an efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-55. An alternative explanation is that the Y99F substitution impairs the interaction between Hdmx and c-Abl. To test this possibility HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for c-Abl either alone or together with Myc-His-tagged wt or Y99F hdmx p53 BD mutant. Hdmx was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody, and the amount of co-precipitated c-Abl was determined by IB using anti-c-Abl antibody (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4D, the Y99F substitution did not reduce the c-Abl-Hdmx interaction but, rather, increased it.FIGURE 4Tyr-99 is required for the efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-55, and both tyrosine phosphorylations are independent of Ser-342 and Ser-367 phosphorylation. A-C, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Twenty-four (A and B) or forty-eight hours (C) later cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting using either anti-phospho-Tyr-55 antibody (B and C) or anti-phospho-Tyr-99 antibody (A and C). Total Hdmx levels were monitored using anti-Hdmx 1328 polyclonal antibody. The position of Tyr-55 and Tyr-99-phosphorylated Hdmx and total Hdmx is indicated. Hdmx p53 BD mutant was described in Fig. 2C. D, HEK293 cells were transfected with the expression plasmid for c-abl alone or together with Myc and His-tagged hdmx p53 BD either wt or Y99F mutant. Twenty-four hours post-transfection Hdmx was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody. The level of the co-precipitated c-Abl was monitored by blotting with anti-c-Abl antibody (ABL-148). The expression level of the Hdmx was investigated by using anti-Myc antibody. E, HEK293-T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged hdmx or hdmx-S342/367A or empty vector together with c-abl. Cells were either non-treated or treated with 3 mm H2O2 for 45 min together with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4; 1 mm) for 5 h before harvest. Twenty-nine hours post-transfection cell extracts were subjected to IP with anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Tyr-55-Hdmx, anti-phospho-Y99-Hdmx, and anti-Hdmx MX-82 to monitor total Hdmx levels. To show the absence of Ser-367 phosphorylation of the mutant, the same protein extracts were used in immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed on Western blot with anti-phospho-Ser-367-Hdmx or anti-Hdmx antibody (BL1258).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interplay between c-Abl-mediated Phosphorylation of Hdmx and the DNA Damage-induced Hdmx Phosphorylation on Ser-342, Ser-367, and Ser-403 and 14-3-3 Binding—It has been shown that Hdmx is independently phosphorylated on Ser-342, Ser-367, and Ser-403 in response to double strand breaks by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or by its target Chk2 (29Pereg Y.

Each of these phosphorylations contributes to the increased ubiquitination and degradation of Hdmx after DNA damage, caused by dissociation of the herpes virus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) from both Hdmx and Hdm2 and promotion of nuclear accumulation of Hdmx (12Li C.

Here we addressed the effect of removing mammalian cyt c on the integrity of the respiratory complexes in mammalian cells. Mitochondria from cyt c knockout mouse cells lacked fully assembled complexes I and IV and had reduced levels of complex III. A redox-deficient mutant of cyt c was unable to rescue the levels of complexes I and IV. We found that cyt c is associated with both complex IV and respiratory supercomplexes, providing a potential mechanism for the requirement for cyt c in the assembly/stability of complex IV."

The stage is set for the next international food crisis, says Joachim von Braun. The 'food crisis', lately top of the news agenda, has been displaced by economic woes. But as Joachim von Braun explains, recent events have made food shortages even more likely, and concerted international action is needed if people are not to starve. In Where Our Food Comes From, Gary Paul Nabhan constructs a history of agricultural biodiversity by following in the tracks of Russian botanist Nikolay Vavilov, who before being jailed by Stalin, was first to identify the world's centres of crop diversity. With the benefit of the long view provided by Vavilov and his own work as a conservationist, Nabhan makes the case for systems based on traditional forms of agriculture as the basis for another, much needed, 'green revolution'."
https://openalex.org/W2041101236,"Endophilin B1/BAX-interacting factor 1 (Bif-1) is a protein that cooperates with dynamin-like protein 1 (DLP1/Drp1) to maintain normal mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) dynamics in healthy cells and also contributes to BAX-driven MOM permeabilization (MOMP), the irreversible commitment point to cell death for the majority of apoptotic stimuli. However, despite its importance, exactly how Bif-1 fulfils its proapoptotic role is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of Bif-1 on BAX-driven MOMP and on BAX conformational activation observed in intact cells during apoptosis can be recapitulated in a simplified system consisting of purified proteins and MOM-like liposomes. In this reconstituted model system the N-BAR domain of Bif-1 reproduced the stimulatory effect of Bif-1 on functional BAX activation. This process was dependent on physical interaction between Bif-1 N-BAR and BAX as well as on the presence of the mitochondrion-specific lipid cardiolipin. Despite that Bif-1 N-BAR produced large scale morphological rearrangements in MOM-like liposomes, this phenomenon could be separated from functional BAX activation. Furthermore, DLP1 also caused global morphological changes in MOM-like liposomes, but DLP1 did not stimulate BAX-permeabilizing function in the absence or presence of Bif-1. Taken together, our findings not only provide direct evidence for a functional interplay between Bif-1, BAX, and cardiolipin during MOMP but also add significantly to the growing body of evidence indicating that components of the mitochondrial morphogenesis machinery possess proapoptotic functions that are independent from their recognized roles in normal mitochondrial dynamics.

Released intraorganellar components, including cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF, then act as mediators for activating executioner caspase proteases or for other downstream events in the intracellular apoptosis cascade. MOMP is tightly regulated by BCL-2 family members, whose core components are proapoptotic BAX-type proteins that directly effect MOMP and antiapoptotic BCL-2-type proteins which inhibit MOMP (2Youle R.J.

On the one hand, Bif-1 is known to participate downstream of DLP1/Drp1, modulating normal MOM morphological dynamics in healthy cells (11Karbowski M. Jeong S.-Y. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 27: 1027-1039Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in response to specific apoptotic signals, a significant portion of Bif-1 binds BAX at the MOM in close temporal correlation with BAX conformational change and cytochrome c release (12Takahashi Y. Karbowski M. Yamaguchi H. Kazi A. Wu J. Sebti S.M. Youle R.J. Wang H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9369-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, increasing the levels of Bif-1 has been shown to accelerate BAX conformational change, caspase activation, and apoptotic cell death, whereas loss of Bif-1 delays all these processes (12Takahashi Y. Karbowski M. Yamaguchi H. Kazi A. Wu J. Sebti S.M. Youle R.J. Wang H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9369-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Cuddeback S.M. Yamaguchi H. Komatsu K.

Together, these previous findings point to an important contributing role of Bif-1 in BAX-driven MOMP during apoptosis, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. As other members of the endophilin family, Bif-1 contains an N-BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain that has been shown to confer ability to these proteins for transforming flat lipid bilayers into high curvature buds, tubules, and vesicles in vitro (14Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Buttler P.J.G.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of the N-BAR domain of endophilin A1, a close homologue of Bif-1, revealed a crescent-shape homodimer with a positively charged concave surface which is believed to act like a molecular scaffold that impresses its own curvature on binding to negatively charged membranes (16Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Weissenhorn W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Another distinguishing feature of endophilin N-BAR domains is the presence of two distinct amphipathic segments referred to as “Helix 0” (H0) and “Helix 1 insert” (H1I) that penetrate only partway into the external leaflet and are thought to create a wedge effect that also increases membrane curvature. This dual curvature-generating mechanism has been linked to the shared capacity of endophilins to operate in membrane tubulovesicular dynamics during normal cell growth together with dynamin/dynamin-like proteins (16Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R.

However, exactly how the molecular-scale perturbation of membrane curvature induced by N-BAR domains translates into large scale membrane remodeling processes (e.g. tubulation and vesiculation) is not well understood (19Antonny B.

In addition, it is unclear whether the ability of Bif-1 to produce global changes in membrane morphology is functionally connected to its apoptotic mode of action. The complexity of the network of intermolecular interactions that controls the BCL-2-regulated MOMP pathway constitutes a major hurdle for gaining a molecular-level understanding of Bif-1 pro-death function in intact cells. Another complicating factor is that Bif-1 can interact with binding partners other than BAX at intracellular membranes distinct from the MOM depending on environmental conditions (14Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 26Modregger J. Schmidt A. Rittere B. Huttner W.B. Plomman M. J.

In previous studies this and other laboratories have shown that the BCL-2-regulated MOMP pathway can be reconstituted in a simplified system consisting of purified recombinant proteins and chemically defined MOM-like large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) in a manner that faithfully reflects the basic physiological functions of BCL-2 family proteins at the MOM (30Kuwana T.

Here, we have used this minimal cell-free system to advance our understanding of the pro-death role of Bif-1. We provide strong evidence for a direct implication of Bif-1 in functional BAX activation at the membrane level and novel insights concerning the mechanism through which Bif-1 achieves this effect. Materials—Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), liver phosphatidylinositol (PI), heart cardiolipin (CL), myristoylated cardiolipin (myrCL), monolysocardiolipin (MCL), dilysocardiolipin (DCL), N-(NBD)-phosphatidylethanolamine), and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). KCl, HEPES, EDTA, dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether (C12E8), Triton X-100, β-octylgucoside (OG), tetanolysin, GTP, GTPγS, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans of 70 kDa (FD70) were obtained from Sigma. Disuccinimidyl suberate was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Recombinant Proteins and Synthetic Peptides—Recombinant full-length human BAX with an amino-terminal His6 tag (BAX) (31Terrones O. Etxebarria A. Landajuela A. Landeta O. Antonsson B. Basañez G. J.

Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) were purified as previously described. OG-BAX was obtained by incubating BAX with 2% OG (w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. The recombinant human Bif-1 proteins were purified using IMPACT system (New England Biolabs). In brief, the human Bif-1, Bif-1 (1–252), and Bif-1 (253–361) cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs) with NdeI and SapI sites. The resulting plasmids, which express Bif-1 and intein-tag fusion proteins, were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli. Recombinant proteins were isolated by a chitin affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Bif-1 proteins were cleaved off from intein tag by dithiothreitol and dialyzed in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA. All proteins were purified from soluble fractions of bacterial extracts obtained in the absence of detergents and were >90% pure as evaluated by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1). High performance liquid chromatography-purified peptides were obtained from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Peptide identity was confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Cytochrome c Release Assays—Mitochondria were isolated from livers of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (31Terrones O. Etxebarria A. Landajuela A. Landeta O. Antonsson B. Basañez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7790-7803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (500 μg of protein/ml) were incubated with recombinant proteins in 125 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 μm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, 5 μm rotenone, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) for 20 min at 30 °C under constant stirring using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Vfinal = 100 μl). Reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant fractions and pellet fractions were subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c 7H8.2C-12 antibody (Pharmingen). Mitochondria were kept on ice and used within 3 h of preparation (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Liposome Preparation—Unless otherwise indicated, liposomes were prepared with a lipid composition resembling that of MOM contact sites ((40 PC/35 PE/10 PI/15 CL (mol/mol)) (MOM-like liposomes). Lipid mixtures at the indicated ratios were co-dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and organic solvents were removed by evaporation under an argon stream followed by incubation under vacuum for 2 h. For membrane permeabilization assays, dry lipid films were resuspended in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA (KHE buffer) supplemented with 100 mg/ml FD70. For other assays dry lipid films were resuspended in KHE. Multilamellar vesicles were then subjected to 5 freeze/thaw cycles. Except where indicated, these frozen/thawed liposomes were then extruded 10 times through two polycarbonate membranes of 0.2-μm pore size (Nucleopore, San Diego, CA) to obtain LUV. Untrapped FD70 was removed by gel filtration in Sephacryl S-500 HR columns with KHE running as elution buffer. Fluorimetric Measurements of Vesicular Contents Release—Release of LUV-encapsulated FD70 was monitored in an 8100 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) in a thermostatically controlled 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring at 37 °C (Vfinal = 750 μl). The FD70 emission was monitored at 525 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 490 nm (slits, 4 nm). A cutoff filter at 515 nm was used between the sample and the emission monochromator to avoid scattering interferences. The extent of marker release was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation (Ft – F0/F100 –F0) = 100 where Ft is the measured fluorescence of protein-treated LUV at time t, F0 is the initial fluorescence of the LUV suspension before protein addition, and F100 is the fluorescence value after complete disruption of LUV by the addition of C12E8 (final concentration, 0.5 mm). Lipid concentration was 50 μm. Fluorimetric Measurements of Intervesicular Lipid Mixing—Membrane lipid mixing was monitored using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay described by Struck et al. (35Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the dilution of the NBD-PE/N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-PE FRET pair. LUV containing 2 mol % of each probe were mixed with unlabeled vesicles at a 1:10 ratio. Dilution of the fluorescent probes due to membrane fusion resulted in an increased NBD-PE fluorescence. The NBD emission was monitored at 530 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 465 nm. A cutoff filter at 515 nm was used between the sample and the emission monochromator to avoid scattering interferences. The fluorescence scale was calibrated such that the zero level corresponded to the initial residual fluorescence of the labeled vesicles and the 100% value corresponded to complete mixing of all the lipids in the system. The latter value was set by the fluorescence intensity upon the addition of 10 mm OG. Proteins were incubated with LUV (50 μm) for 10 min in a thermostatically controlled 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring at 37 °C (Vfinal = 750 μl) followed by determination of extents of intervesicular lipid mixing. Binding of Proteins to MOM-like Liposomes—To assess the liposome binding capacity of an individual protein in a mixture containing multiple proteins, a low speed vesicle sedimentation approach was used followed by detection of the protein of interest by immunoblotting. In brief, proteins were incubated with freeze/thawed vesicles (100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C under constant stirring using an Eppenford Thermomixer (Vfinal = 100 μl). Next, the mixture was centrifuged for another 30 min at 18,000 × g at 4 °C, and equivalent aliquots were taken from the supernatant (corresponding to free protein) and pellet fractions (corresponding to liposome-bound protein). Both fractions were then subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on 15% Tris-glycine gels followed by protein visualization by immunoblotting using anti BAX N20 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) or anti-Bif-1 monoclonal antibody (Imgenex). Assays of BAX Oligomerization at MOM-mimetic LUV—For studies of BAX oligomerization, apoptotic proteins were first incubated with MOM-mimetic LUV (100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C under constant stirring using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Vfinal = 100 μl). Then, disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linker was added at 0.1 mm concentration followed by incubation of the mixture for 30 min at room temperature and quenching of free cross-linker by addition of 0.1 volume of 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Finally, samples were examined for BAX immunoreactivity with anti-BAX N20 antibody. Immunoprecipitations—Proteins were incubated with LUV (100 μm) in KHE buffer for 30 min at 37 °C under constant stirring using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Vfinal = 300 μl) followed by the addition of CHAPS (0.5% w/v, final concentration) and immunoprecipitation with agarose-conjugated anti-BAX N20 antibody (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 5000 × g). The pellets were washed 2 times with KHE supplemented with 2% CHAPS (w/v), then an additional 2 times with KHE. Immunoprecipitates were released from the beads in SDS loading buffer and analyzed for Bif-1 immunoreactivity. Far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectrapolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Hachioji City, Japan) equipped with a JASCO PTC-423S temperature control unit using a 1-mm path length cell. Data were collected every 0.2 nm at 50 nm/min from 250 to 200 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm, and results were averaged from 20 scans. For experiments with liposomes, small unilamellar vesicles were obtained by sonication to diminish the contribution from scattered light. Bif-11–252, Bif-11–27, and lipid concentrations were 5 μm, 20 μm, and 2 mm, respectively. All samples were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before CD analysis. Each spectrum represents the average of three distinct spectral recordings. The contribution of buffer with/or without small unilamellar vesicles to the measured ellipiticity was subtracted as blank. Molar ellipticity values (ϕ) were calculated using the expression ϕ = ∊/10cnl, where ∊ is the ellipticity (millidegrees), c is the protein concentration (mol/liter), l is the cuvette path length, and n is the number of amino acid residues in the protein. The amount of secondary structural elements was estimated with the CD-Pro software. Monolayer Surface Pressure Measurements—Surface pressure measurements were carried out with a MicroTrough-S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) with constant stirring at 37 °C. Lipid monolayers were prepared with a lipid composition resembling that of MOM contact sites (40 PC/35 PE/10 PI/15 CL (mol/mol)) (MOM-like monolayers). The lipid, dissolved in chloroform and methanol (2:1), was gently spread over the surface of 1-ml KHE buffer and kept at a constant surface area. The desired initial surface pressure was attained by changing the amount of lipid applied to the air-water interface. After 10 min to allow for solvent evaporation, compounds of interest were injected through a hole connected to the subphase, and the change in surface pressure was recorded as a function of time until a stable signal was obtained. Under these conditions maximal surface pressures obtained after injecting compounds in the absence of a lipid monolayer were below initial monolayer pressure values examined. DLS Measurements—Vesicle size was determined by DLS at a fixed angle of 90° and 37 °C using a Protein Solutions DynaPro instrument equipped with a temperature-controlled microchamber and a 64-channel correlator capable of estimating particle sizes in the range from 5 to 5000 nm. LUV (50 μm) were incubated with or without proteins in KHE buffer for 10 min at 37 °C under constant stirring using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Vfinal = 70 μl) followed by DLS analysis. Each measurement was done as an average of 20 data points and took approximately between 15 and 20 min. Data were analyzed by the cumulant method using the software provided by the instrument. Bif-1 Stimulates BAX-permeabilizing Function in MOM-like LUV—We began by examining the capacity of purified full-length recombinant human Bif-1 (termed Bif-1 hereafter) to release mitochondrial cytochrome c either by itself or in combination with BAX or with tBID-activated BAX. Incubation of isolated rat liver mitochondria with Bif-1 either alone or in combination with BAX produced minimal release of cytochrome c, whereas treatment of organelles with a BAX plus tBID mixture produced near-to-complete release of cytochrome c (Fig. 1A, left). However, the addition of Bif-1 to isolated mitochondria treated with BAX together with a suboptimal dosing of tBID produced an enhancement in the amount of cytochrome c release (Fig. 1A, middle), and this effect could be blocked by antiapoptotic BCL-XL (Fig. 1A, right). One possible explanation for these results is that Bif-1 increases the degree of MOMP under suboptimal BAX-activating conditions by directly potentiating the permeabilizing function of BAX. To test this hypothesis, we swit"
https://openalex.org/W2124300681,"Protein S-glutathionylation is a reversible redox-dependent post-translational modification. Many cellular functions and signal transduction pathways involve proteins whose cysteine-dependent activities are modulated by glutathionylation. Glutaredoxin (Grx1) plays a key role in such regulation because it is a specific and efficient catalyst of deglutathionylation. We recently reported an increase in Grx1 in retinae of diabetic rats and in rat retinal Müller glial cells (rMC-1) cultured in high glucose. This up-regulation of Grx1 was concomitant with NFkappaB activation and induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This proinflammatory response was replicated by adenoviral-directed up-regulation of Grx1 in cells in normal glucose. The site of regulation of NFkappaB was localized to the cytoplasm, where IkappaB kinase (IKK) is a master regulator of NFkappaB activation. In the current study, inhibition of IKK activity abrogated the increase in ICAM-1 induced by high glucose or by adenoviral-directed up-regulation of Grx1. Conditioned medium from the Müller cells overexpressing Grx1 was added to fresh cultures of Müller or endothelial cells and elicited increases in the Grx1 and ICAM-1 proteins in these cells. These effects correlate with a novel finding that secretion of interleukin-6 was elevated in the cultures of Grx overexpressing cells. Also, pure interleukin-6 increased Grx1 and ICAM-1 in the rMC-1 cells. Thus, Grx1 appears to play an important role in both autocrine and paracrine proinflammatory responses. Furthermore, IKKbeta isolated from Müller cells in normal glucose medium was found to be glutathionylated on Cys-179. Hence Grx-mediated activation of IKK via deglutathionylation may play a central role in diabetic complications in vivo where Grx1 is increased."

Nondissociable angiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to the impaired Gαq/11-stimulated signaling of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. To further analyze the role of AT2 receptor oligomers, we induced the formation of AT2 oligomers in an in vitro cell system. Similarly as in vivo, sequential oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking steps triggered the formation of AT2 oligomers in vitro. Elevated reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative cross-linking of AT2 monomers to dimers involving tyrosine residues located at putative interreceptor contact sites of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices III/IV. Cross-linked AT2 dimers were subsequently a substrate of activated transglutaminase-2, which targeted the carboxyl terminus of AT2 dimers, as assessed by truncated and chimeric AT2 receptors, respectively. AT2 oligomers acted as dominant negative receptors in vitro by mediating Gαq/11 protein sequestration and Gαq/11 protein arrest. The formation of AT2 oligomers and G-protein dysfunction could be suppressed in vitro and in vivo by an AT2 receptor mutant. Inhibition of AT2 oligomerization upon stereotactic expression of the AT2 receptor mutant revealed that Gαq/11-sequestering AT2 oligomers enhanced the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in the hippocampus of transgenic mice with AD-like pathology.

Hope T. Chen C.P. Wong P.T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the pathophysiological role of the G-protein defect is barely understood. A direct relationship between Gαq/11 dysfunction and the pathogenesis of AD leading to neurodegeneration and dementia is suggested by the important role of Gαq/11 proteins in neuronal survival and memory (6Miura M. Watanabe M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Kano M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8379-8390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wettschureck N. van der Stelt M. Tsubokawa H. Krestel H. Moers A. Petrosino S. Schütz G. Di Marzo V. Offermanns S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5888-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, many of the cognition-enhancing effects of acetylcholine are mediated by the Gαq/11-coupled muscarinic receptors (8Wess J. Eglen R.M. Gautam D. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The M1 receptor is a major target of Gαq/11 dysfunction of AD patients and mice, and impaired Gαq/11-coupling of M1 receptors correlates with disease severity (5Tsang S.W. Lai M.K. Kirvell S. Francis P.T. Esiri M.M. Hope T. Chen C.P. Wong P.T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To better understand the pathophysiological function of the G-protein defect in AD, we analyzed the mechanism accounting for the G-protein defect in AD. In the first article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we identified cross-linked AT2 receptor oligomers in the brains of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. Co-enrichment studies showed that AT2 receptor oligomers resembled dominant negative receptors by sequestering Gαq/11 in the absence of agonist. The cross-linked AT2 receptors were directly linked to the progression of AD, because (aggregated) amyloid β (Aβ) triggered AT2 oligomerization in vivo in a dose-dependent manner by a two-step process of oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking. Down-regulation of AT2 receptors by RNA interference revealed that AT2 receptor (oligomers) contributed to Gαq/11 dysfunction of transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. Specifically, AT2 receptor oligomers impaired signaling of Gαq/11-coupled muscarinic M1 receptors in the hippocampus. Because activation of hippocampal Gαq/11-stimulated signaling retards the development of AD-like symptoms in transgenic mice (9Caccamo A. Oddo S. Billings L.M. Green K.N. Martinez-Coria H. Fisher A. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2006; 49: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), we thought that AT2 receptor oligomers were directly involved in symptoms of neurodegeneration. To address this question, we used an AT2 receptor mutant to suppress AT2 oligomerization in vitro and in vivo. We show here that inhibition of AT2 oligomerization by stereotactic expression of a mutated AT2 receptor retarded the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in the hippocampus of transgenic mice with AD-like pathology. These observations provide strong evidence for an involvement of AT2 oligomers in mediating symptoms of neurodegeneration. Cell Culture, Protein Expression, and Functional Assays-Cultivation of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and transfection with plasmids encoding AT2, AT2 ΔCTer, M1, Gα11Q209L, or transglutaminase-2 under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was performed as described (10AbdAlla S.

Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was induced by expression of NOX-3. Changes in total inositol phosphates and measurement of [Ca2+]i were determined with intact cells (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Basal and stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS (specific activity 1250 Ci/mmol; final concentration 0.5 nm) to Gαq/11 was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm GDP in a volume of 200 μl in triplicates with membranes (25 μg of protein/point) prepared from cells and mouse hippocampal tissue followed by immunoaffinity enrichment of Gαq/11. The method measures specifically the activation of Gαq/11, because the applied antibodies cross-react specifically with Gαq/11 as determined in immunoblot. Transglutaminase activity was determined by a [3H]putrescine incorporation assay (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity enrichment of Gαq/11 followed by immunoblot detection of co-enriched AT2 was performed by a method that was described (12AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Quantification of the carbachol-stimulated M1-Gαq interaction in the presence of increasing levels of oligomeric AT2 (0-300 fmol/mg protein) was performed after immunoaffinity enrichment of M1 receptors from M1 receptor-expressing HEK cells (∼900 fmol/mg protein) co-expressing oligomeric AT2 as indicated. Briefly, HEK cell membranes (50 μg/point) in GTP-free buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm carbachol for 60 min at 12 °C followed by 20 min at 24 °C and the addition of 1 mm DSP. Membranes were washed three times with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors, collected by centrifugation, and solubilized in 200 μl of buffer (1% deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors). The solubilisate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with an immunoaffinity matrix of M1-specific antibodies coupled to Affi-Gel 10. After washing, Gαq co-enriched with the M1 receptor was quantified by the addition of 125I-labeled F(ab)2 fragments of immunoselected anti-Gαq antibodies (1 × 10-8 m, specific activity ∼0.02 Ci/mg) to the affinity matrix. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the affinity matrix was washed three times with ice cold buffer, and radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. To determine the carbachol-stimulated M1-Gαq interaction, bound radioactivity in the absence of carbachol (<10%) was subtracted. In a parallel approach, Gαq co-enriched with the M1 receptor was quantified in immunoblot with Gαq-specific antibodies after elution from the affinity matrix and SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Activities of α-secretase present in hippocampal tissue of 13-month-old stressed APPSw mice were determined using a commercially available kit (R&D Systems). Antibodies for Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry-The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting, affinity purification, and immunohistochemistry (10AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were routinely used to determine and confirm cross-reactivity of the antibodies with the respective proteins (10AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

Protein Detection in Immunoblot-Membranes were prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 4 °C followed by partial enrichment (see accompanying manuscript (26AbdAlla S.

For immunoblotting analysis, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and supplemented with urea followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described (11AbdAlla S.

Affinity-purified antibodies or F(ab)2 fragments of the respective antibodies preabsorbed to human and mouse proteins, respectively, were used for detection of AT2, AT1 receptors, and Gαq/11. Applied antibodies were characterized in previous studies (accompanying manuscript (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol.

Bound antibody was visualized by preabsorbed F(ab)2 fragments of enzyme-coupled secondary antibodies or by enzyme-coupled Protein A followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL plus). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis-Cell surface M1 receptors of transfected HEK cells were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using affinity-purified M1-specific antibodies raised against an epitope corresponding to the receptor's amino-terminal region according to standard methods (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transgenic Animals-Transgenic mice used in this study express human APP695 with the double mutation (K670N/M671L; APPSw) that was identified in a Swedish family with early onset Alzheimer disease (14Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar). Lentiviral Vector Production-Vector plasmids were constructed for the production of third generation lentiviruses expressing wild-type AT2 and AT2ΔCTer under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The generation of viral particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein was described in the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For stereotactic injection in mice, high titer lentiviral stocks were used (>1 × 107 transduction units/μl). Immunohistochemistry-For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded sections (8 μm, taken at 50-μm intervals for analyses, 10-15 sections/set) were deparaffinized, followed by antigen retrieval (11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of AT2 receptor was performed with F(ab)2 fragments of preabsorbed affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (10AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 11AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) was used as a marker of neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (anti-MAP2 antibodies; Sigma). DNA strand breaks were determined in situ, applying TUNEL technology (Roche Applied Science). All sections were imaged with a Leica DMI6000 microscope equipped with a DFC420 camera. Cerebral Injection of Lentiviruses-To inhibit the formation of cross-linked AT2 oligomers, lentivirus preparations encoding AT2ΔCTer were injected bilaterally into the CA1 area of 12-month-old APPSw mice similarly as described in the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (anteroposterior -1.6 to -2.3; lateral 1; dorsoventral -1.8). The control group received an injection of a control lentivirus encoding β-galactosidase or wild-type AT2 receptor. After 1 week of recovery, mice were subjected to the stress paradigm for 4 weeks. Five weeks after the lentiviral injection, behavioral analysis, biochemical analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed. Protein expression levels of lentivirus-driven expression were routinely monitored in immunoblot with anti-AT2 receptor antibodies (∼1.8-2.3-fold hippocampal overexpression compared with mice injected with a control lentivirus encoding β-galactosidase). Induction of Stress-The generation of Aβ was enhanced in 12-month-old APPSw mice by 4 weeks of stress as described in the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Stressed mice with a significant decrease in sucrose preference (≤50% of sucrose consumption compared with nonstressed controls) were included in the study. After 28 days of stress, 4 h before the beginning of the dark phase, brains from stressed and nonstressed APPSw mice were removed and processed for immunoblotting, functional studies, and immunohistochemistry as described above. Behavioral Studies-We used the standard water maze task (hidden platform) to test for spatial memory (15Morris R.G.M. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N.P. O'Keefe J. Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Testing involved four trials per day over 10 days starting after the stress period. On the day following the 10 days of acquisition testing, memory retention was determined in a single 60-s probe trial for which the submerged platform was removed (16King D.L. Arendash G.W. Physiol. Behav. 2002; 75: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the committees on animal research at the Universities of Hamburg and Cairo and were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Statistics-Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. To determine significance between two groups, we made comparisons using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Oxidative and Transglutaminase-mediated Cross-linking of AT2 Receptors in Vitro-In the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) we have shown that (aggregated) Aβ induces the formation of AT2 receptor oligomers in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. The formation of AT2 oligomers in vivo is due to a two-step process of oxidative and transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking. To analyze whether ROS and transglutaminase were indeed sufficient to support the formation of AT2 oligomers, we reconstituted the cross-linking in a nonneuronal in vitro system. For detection of AT2 receptors in immunoblot, we applied AT2-specific antibodies cross-reacting specifically with the AT2 receptor of ∼65 ± 5 kDa of AT2 receptor-transfected HEK cells (cf. accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). Oxidization of AT2 receptor monomers of ∼65 kDa could be induced in HEK cells expressing NOX-3 as a ROS-generating system, leading to the appearance of an SDS-stable dimeric AT2 form of ∼130 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). NOX-3 was chosen as a constitutively active ROS-generating NADPH oxidase that also shows increased expression in AD patients (17de la Monte S.M. Wands J.R. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2006; 9: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of AT2 receptors in NOX-3-expressing HEK cells was suppressed by pretreatment with the antioxidant diferuloylmethane, confirming involvement of ROS (Fig. 1A, lane 2). ROS targets tyrosine residues of proteins, leading to dityrosine formation. Tyrosine residues of AT2 are located at putative interreceptor contact sites (i.e. the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices III/IV) (18Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Those interreceptor contact sites appear crucial for ROS-mediated cross-linking of AT2, because oxidative cross-linking was strongly diminished in a mutated AT2 receptor lacking three tyrosines of connecting loop III-IV, AT2Tyr→Ala143,148,162 (Fig. 1, B versus A). ROS-dependent cross-linking assembled AT2 for transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking, because the concomitant action of ROS and transglutaminase-2 led to AT2 receptor oligomers, whereas inhibition of transglutaminase-2 by monodansyl cadaverine prevented only the appearance of AT2 oligomers and left the oxidized AT2 dimers intact (Fig. 1C). Thus, transglutaminase targeted AT2 receptors preassembled by oxidative cross-linking. Transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking of oxidized AT2 receptors seemed to require the receptor’s carboxyl terminus, because a mutated AT2 receptor, AT2ΔCTer, lacking the carboxyl terminus was not significantly cross-linked by transglutaminase-2, although oxidative dimerization was evident (Fig. 1D). This finding is in agreement with a model of receptor oligomers identifying COOH-terminal residues as contact sites between dimers (18Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ROS/transglutaminase targeted specifically the AT2 receptor, because the related AT1 receptor appeared as a pure monomer under similar cross-linking conditions (Fig. 1E). The specificity of transglutaminase for oxidized AT2 receptor dimers was further analyzed by a chimeric AT2 receptor with the carboxyl terminus of AT1. The chimeric AT2 receptor, AT2/AT1COO-, was not significantly cross-linked to oligomers by concomitant ROS/transglutaminase action, although (oxidized) AT2/AT1COO- dimers were detected in the presence of the transglutaminase inhibitor (Fig. 1F). This observation further confirms that the carboxyl terminus of the AT2 receptor is required for transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking of (oxidized) AT2 receptor dimers. Altogether, a two-step process of oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking leads to AT2 oligomers in vitro (this work) and in vivo (accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). AT2 Receptor Oligomers Sequester Gαq/11 in Vitro-The biochemical similarity between in vitro formed AT2 oligomers and in vivo detected AT2 oligomers was further analyzed. Similarly to AD patients and mice, AT2 oligomers of HEK cells sequestered Gαq/11, as determined by co-enrichment with Gαq/11 proteins, whereas AT2 monomers/dimers did not significantly interact with Gαq/11 (Fig. 2, A (lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 3) and B). The interaction with an activated G-protein-coupled receptor is an essential part of the G-protein activation step. In agreement with this paradigm, stimulation of muscarinic M1 receptors by carbachol strongly enhanced the interaction of M1 receptors with Gαq, as determined by co-enrichment (Fig. 2C). The presence of AT2 oligomers prevented the carbachol-stimulated M1/Gαq interaction almost entirely (Fig. 2C). Thus, oligomeric AT2 is capable of suppressing the interaction of Gαq with an activated heterologous receptor, as would be expected from its Gαq/11-sequestering capacity. Next, we quantified the carbachol-stimulated interaction of Gαq with the M1 receptor (∼900 fmol/mg) in the presence of increasing levels of AT2 oligomers. We chose the Gαq/11-coupled muscarinic M1 receptor, because impaired G-protein coupling of M1 correlates with disease severity in AD (5Tsang S.W. Lai M.K. Kirvell S. Francis P.T. Esiri M.M. Hope T. Chen C.P. Wong P.T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cross-linked AT2 oligomers potently inhibited the stimulated M1-Gαq interaction in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of ∼30 fmol/mg protein (Fig. 2D). As a control, comparable levels of the AT2ΔCTer mutant that was not cross-linked to oligomers under similar conditions (cf. Fig. 1D) had no significant effect on the carbachol-stimulated M1-Gαq interaction (Fig. 2E). These observations strongly indicate that physiological AT2 receptor expression levels of AD brain are sufficient to exert major effects on the interaction of G(α)q/11 with activated receptors (43.4 ± 2.7 fmol of AT2/mg of protein ± S.E., n = 10, as determined with 125I-labeled AT2 receptor-specific antibodies on prefrontal cortex membranes isolated from AD patients). Gαq/11-sequestering AT2 Receptor Oligomers Inhibit Basal and Carbachol-stimulated Activation of Gαq/11-The AT2 oligomer-mediated sequestration of Gαq/11 proteins was accompanied by reduced Gαq/11 activation either under basal conditions or upon carbachol stimulation (Fig. 3A), whereas the AT2ΔCTer mutant that is not cross-linked to oligomers did not significantly affect the M1 receptor-stimulated signal under similar conditions (Fig. 3B). AT2 Receptor Oligomers Suppress Gαq/11-stimulated Signaling-We analyzed the effect of AT2 oligomers on Gαq/11-stimulated signaling in intact cells by measuring the Gαq/11-stimulated activation of phospholipases C. AT2 oligomers led to a strongly decreased inositol phosphate signal generation either under basal conditions or upon carbachol stimulation of transfected muscarinic M1 receptors (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of M1 receptor-stimulated signaling by AT2 oligomers was confirmed by significantly reduced potency and efficacy of carbachol (Fig. 4B). As a control, ROS and transglutaminase did not significantly affect M1-stimulated signaling in the absence of AT2 under similar conditions (data not shown). Cell surface M1 receptor levels as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with M1-specific antibodies were similar to those of HEK cells expressing dissociable AT2 receptors or cross-linked AT2 oligomers (Fig. 4D, panel 1 versus panel 2). Signaling stimulated by direct activation of G-proteins with GTPγS orAlF4- was also strongly decreased in the presence of cross-linked AT2 oligomers, whereas G-protein-independent inositol phosphate generation triggered by direct activation of phospholipases C with calcium was not changed (Fig. 4A). These findings show that AT2 oligomers inhibit Gαq/11-stimulated signaling. AT2 Oligomers Arrest Constitutively Activated Gα11Q209L-AT2 oligomers also interacted with a constitutively active mutant of Gα11, Gα11Q209L, and suppressed the inositol phosphate signal stimulated by this mutant (Fig. 4A). This observation reveals that AT2 oligomers act in a dominant negative manner and induce the virtual arrest of an activated Gαq/11 protein. The dominant negative activity of the nondissociable oligomeric AT2 receptor platform could account for the potent inhibition of Gαq/11-stimulated signaling at the cell membrane, which is dependent on the release of a limited number of activated Gαq/11 proteins triggered by stimulation of specific receptors. Inhibition of Calcium Signaling and Desensitization by AT2 Oligomers-Impaired M1 receptor-stimulated Gαq/11-protein activation in the presence of AT2 oligomers was also reflected by a decreased rise in the intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4C, panels 1 and 2 versus panels 4 and 5). The Gαq/11 inhibitory effect of the cross-linked AT2 oligomers was independent of the activation of AT2 by angiotensin II (Fig. 4C, panels 4 and 5). Activated G-proteins trigger signal generation as well as signal desensitization. To determine whether AT2 oligomers inhibited the desensitization of the M1 receptor, we pretreated the cells with carbachol. Carbachol pretreatment led to a significant decrease of the M1-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i on cells expressing dissociable AT2 receptors indicative of M1 receptor desensitization (Fig. 4C, panel 3 versus panels 1 and 2). In contrast, the pretreatment with carbachol did not markedly decrease the M1 signal on cells expressing oligomeric AT2 receptors (Fig. 4C, panel 6 versus panels 4 and 5). Thus, AT2 oligomers inhibit signal generation and desensitization of the Gαq/11-coupled M1 receptor. Receptor desensitization is followed by receptor redistribution. Stimulation with carbachol induced prominent M1 receptor redistribution/internalization on cells expressing dissociable AT2 receptors (Fig. 4D, panel 3 versus panel 1). In contrast, inhibition of Gαq/11 proteins by AT2 oligomers led to a significantly reduced carbachol-stimulated M1 receptor redistribution (Fig. 4D, panel 4 versus panel 2). Together, these findings show that cross-linked AT2 oligomers arrest Gαq/11-stimulated signaling, as reflected by inhibition of different signal transduction events triggered by a prototypic Gαq/11-coupled receptor (i.e. the muscarinic M1 receptor). The Truncated AT Δ2CTer Mutant Suppresses AT2 Oligomerization in Vitro and in Vivo-We further assessed the impact of AT2 oligomers on Gαq/11 activity and applied the truncated AT2ΔCTer mutant to interfere with AT2 oligomerization. The AT2ΔCTer receptor when co-expressed with wild-type AT2 prevented the transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking step accounting for AT2 dimer/oligomer transition, as determined in immunoblot with AT2-specific antibodies detecting specifically wild-type AT2 receptors (Fig. 5A). Upon inhibition of AT2 oligomerization, the basal and M1 receptor-stimulated Gαq/11 activation were not significantly impaired by AT2 even in the presence of ROS and activated transglutaminase (Fig. 5B; cf. Fig. 3A). These findings confirm that AT2 oligomers prevent Gαq/11 activation. To suppress Aβ-induced AT2 oligomerization in vivo, we expressed the AT2ΔCTer mutant (that prevented AT2 oligomerization in vitro) in the hippocampal CA1 area of stressed APPSw mice by stereotactic injection of a lentivirus. Similarly as in HEK cells, expression of AT2ΔCTer led to a marked decrease of AT2 oligomerization in the hippocampus of treated “AD mice,” as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 6A). Thus, AT2ΔCTer interfered with transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of AT2 receptors in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of AT2 Oligomerization Slows Progression of Neurodegeneration in AD Mice-Detection of the endogenous AT2 receptor and the transduced AT2ΔCTer by immunohistochemistry revealed prominent neuritic/dendritic AT2 staining in a representative treated AD mouse expressing AT2ΔCTer that was not visible in the control (i.e. a representative APPSw mouse with stress-enhanced Aβ generation and injection of a control lentivirus) (Fig. 6B). Notably, there was prominent neuritic/dendritic AT2 staining in treated AD mice expressing AT2ΔCTer that was not visible in the controls (Fig. 6B). Immunohistochemistry applying MAP2-specific antibodies confirmed this observation and revealed largely intact neurites/dendrites in the injected CA1 area of mice expressing AT2ΔCTer, whereas there was extensive neuritic/dendritic degeneration in the control mice (Fig. 6C; cf. Fig. 7A). These findings strongly suggest that the AT2ΔCTer mutant retarded the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in stressed APPSw mice (Fig. 6C). In accordance with these observations, TUNEL-positive cells were barely detectable in the injected CA1 area of treated AD mice expressing AT2ΔCTer, whereas CA1 neurons of control mice showed prominent TUNEL labeling (Fig. 6D, right versus left panel). Decreased symptoms of neuronal degeneration correlated with significantly reduced hippocampal transglutaminase activity (Fig. 6E). Treated AD mice expressing AT2ΔCTer also displayed a marginally better performance in the CA1-dependent learning task of spatial memory acquisition and retention compared with control AD mice with a high load of cross-linked AT2 receptor oligomers (Fig. 6, F and G). Together these findings strongly suggest that inhibition of AT2 oligomerization by expression of a protein inhibitor (i.e. the AT2ΔCTer mutant) retarded the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in stressed APPSw mice. Inhibition of AT2 Oligomerization Prevents G-protein Dysfunction in AD Mice-Overexpression of wild-type AT2 receptors in AD mice further confirmed the involvement of AT2 receptor(s) (oligomers) in the neurodegenerative process. Although immunohistochemistry revealed intact neurons in the CA1 area of mice with AT2ΔCTer-dependent inhibition of oligomerization, there was profound dendritic pathology in CA1 neurons of stressed APPSw mice overexpressing comparable levels of oligomerization-prone wild-type AT2 receptors (Fig. 7A). Concomitantly, overexpression of AT2 (oligomers) led to strongly impaired M1 receptor signaling compared with the prominent activation of Gαq/11 in mice expressing similar levels of AT2ΔCTer (Fig. 7B). These findings further confirm that AT2 (oligomers) induce Gαq/11 impairment, whereas inhibition of AT2 oligomerization by AT2ΔCTer prevents the development of G-protein dysfunction in transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. In agreement with a role of M1 in nonamyloidogenic processing of APP (19Buxbaum J.D. Oishi M. Chen H.I. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Jaffe E.A. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2094-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), dysfunctional M1 receptor-stimulated G-protein activation of AT2 receptor-expressing mice was accompanied by a marginally decreased hippocampal α-secretase activity compared with mice with expression of AT2ΔCTer and intact M1-stimulated signaling (Fig. 7C). Thus, the α-secretase activity of AD mice was preserved upon inhibition of AT2 oligomerization by expression of an AT2 mutant (this work) and also upon down-regulation of AT2 (oligomerization) by RNA interference (cf. accompanying article (26AbdAlla S.

Altogether, the experiments reveal that targeting of AT2 receptor oligomers by expression of a protein inhibitor is feasible and slows the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in transgenic mice with AD-like pathology. G-protein dysfunction in the brains of AD patients is a characteristic hallmark of clinical AD with neurodegeneration (5Tsang S.W. Lai M.K. Kirvell S. Francis P.T. Esiri M.M. Hope T. Chen C.P.

Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), G-protein dysfunction was linked to AT2 oligomers that form in the brains of AD patients and mice with AD-like symptoms. AT2 receptor oligomers assemble in vivo by a two-step process of oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking, which is triggered consecutively by (aggregated) Aβ in a dose-dependent manner (see the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S.

To further characterize the function of AT2 oligomers, the current study reconstituted the two-step formation of AT2 receptor oligomers in vitro in a transfected cell system. The in vitro experiments revealed that the initial oxidative cross-linking step accounting for the formation of AT2 receptor dimers targets specifically AT2 with its tyrosine residues at putative interreceptor contact sites (18Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), because a mutated AT2 receptor lacking the tyrosines of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices III/IV was not cross-linked by ROS. Oxidative cross-linking assembles AT2 receptors and thereby generates the target for the second transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking step, leading finally to AT2 tetramers/oligomers. Experimental evidence suggests that transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking of oxidized AT2 receptor dimers involves the carboxyl terminus of AT2, which is a putative contact site between receptor dimers according to the rhodopsin model (18Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both cross-linking steps are a direct consequence of aggregated Aβ and the pathogenesis of AD; oxidative cross-linking is due to high levels of ROS triggered by aggregated Aβ (21Butterfield D.A. Boyd-Kimball D. Brain Pathol. 2004; 14: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The second transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking step is also linked to Aβ and the pathogenesis of AD, because cerebral microinjection of Aβ or enhanced formation of (aggregated) Aβ triggered the activation/induction of transglutaminase in mice (see the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). In agreement with a role of Aβ in inducing transglutaminase is the observation that transglutaminase activity is elevated in the brains of AD patients (22Johnson G.V. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Bonelli R.M. Aschoff A. Niederwieser G. Heuberger C. Jirikowski G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Aβ-induced nondissociable oligomeric AT2 receptor assembly seems to constitute a cellular platform that is kinetically favored to interact with activated Gαq/11 proteins. The large interface of nondissociable AT2 receptor oligomers could impede the rapid dissociation of activated Gαq/11 proteins upon binding. As a consequence, the activated Gαq/11 proteins are sequestered and arrested, leading to decreased receptor-stimulated signaling. Mediating Gαq/11 arrest, the cross-linked AT2 oligomers may thus contribute to the well known Gαq/11 dysfunction in AD. Our results suggest that the Gαq/11-protein defect in brain of AD patients also has a pathophysiological role. (i) The G-protein defect mediated by AT2 oligomers is causally linked to the pathogenesis of AD, because it relies on aggregated Aβ-induced ROS and transglutaminase. (ii) The induction of AT2 oligomers by aggregated Aβ was accompanied by hippocampal neurodegeneration, Tau phosphorylation, and neuronal loss (see the accompanying article (26AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Missiry A. Langer A. Sergeev P. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6554-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). (iii) Stereotactic inhibition of cross-linked AT2 oligomers by expression of a mutated AT2 receptor retarded hippocampal Gαq/11 dysfunction and symptoms of hippocampal neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration and compromised neurite integrity may be a direct consequence of the AT2 oligomer-induced Gαq/11 sequestration, as evidenced with hippocampal neurons from brains lacking Gαq/11 (7Wettschureck N. van der Stelt M.

Specifically, intact Gαq/11-mediated signaling protects (hippocampal) neurons from G12/13-induced neurite damage (24Nürnberg A. Bräuer A.U. Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35526-35531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Sayas C.L. Moreno-Flores M.T. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37046-37052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Since G12/13-dependent signaling also links microtubule and microfilament disorganization with Tau phosphorylation (25Sayas C.L. Moreno-Flores M.T. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37046-37052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the AT2-mediated Gαq/11 impairment is likely to induce symptoms of neurodegeneration and increased phospho-Tau levels via an enhanced activation of the G12/13 pathway. Altogether, Gαq/11-inhibitory AT2 receptor oligomers are formed by two sequential cross-linking steps triggered by (aggregated) Aβ. Dominant-negative AT2 oligomers may reflect the process of ongoing Aβ-induced neurodegeneration and also actively contribute to neuron damage."
https://openalex.org/W2029370006,"Homozygous expression of Orai1 bearing the R91W mutation results in the complete abrogation of currents through the store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels, resulting in a form of hereditary severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome (Feske, S., Gwack, Y., Prakriya, M., Srikanth, S., Puppel, S. H., Tanasa, B., Hogan, P. G., Lewis, R. S., Daly, M., and Rao, A. (2006) Nature 441, 179-185). Although heterozygous carriers of the mutation show no clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency, store-operated Ca(2+) entry in their T cells is impaired, suggesting a gene-dosage effect of the mutation. We have recently demonstrated that the functional CRAC channel pore is composed of a tetrameric assembly of Orai1 subunits (Mignen, O., Thompson, J. L., and Shuttleworth, T. J. (2008) J. Physiol. 586, 419-425). Therefore, to directly quantify the effect of the SCID mutant in the heterozygous situation, we generated a series of concatenated tetramers of Orai1 that included different numbers and arrangements of the R91W Orai1 subunits. The data obtained show that inclusion of increasing numbers of mutant subunits results in a graded reduction in CRAC channel currents and that this effect is independent of the spatial arrangement or order of the mutant subunits in the tetramer. Macroscopic biophysical properties of the channels were unchanged by inclusion of the mutant subunits, although the rate at which the current activates on store depletion was slowed. We conclude that incorporation of R91W mutant Orai1 subunits in the CRAC channel pore affects the overall magnitude of its conductance and that this effect is related solely to the number of mutant subunits incorporated. Predictions based on the tetrameric channel structure indicate that the graded effect of incorporation of SCID mutant subunits into such an assembly is quantitatively consistent with the previously demonstrated impaired effects on Ca(2+) entry recorded in the heterozygous carriers."

https://openalex.org/W2156921066,"Cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP-170) is the prototype microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) and is involved in regulating MT dynamics. A comprehensive understanding of the process by which CLIP-170 tracks MT plus ends would provide insight into its function. However, the precise molecular mechanism of CLIP-170 +TIP behavior is unknown, and many potential models have been presented. Here, by separating the two CLIP-170 CAP-Gly domains and their adjacent serine-rich regions into fragments of varied size, we have characterized the minimal plus-end tracking unit of CLIP-170 in vivo. Each CLIP-170 fragment was also characterized for its tubulin polymerization activity in vitro. We found that the two CAP-Gly domains have different activities, whereas CAP-Gly-1 appears incompetent to mediate either +TIP behavior or MT nucleation, a CLIP-170 fragment consisting of the second CAP-Gly domain and its adjacent serine-rich region can both track MT plus ends in vivo and induce tubulin polymerization in vitro. These observations complement recent work on CLIP-170 fragments, demonstrate that CAP-Gly motifs do not require dimerization for +TIP and polymerization-promoting activities, and provide insight into CLIP-170 function and mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2006929763,"The covalent association of inter-alpha-inhibitor-derived heavy chains (HCs) with hyaluronan was first described in synovial fluid from arthritic patients and later described as a structural and functional component of hyaluronan ""cable"" structures produced by many different cells and stimuli. HC transfer has been shown to be mediated by the protein product of TSG-6 (tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6). Considering the accumulation of hyaluronan in airways following asthmatic attacks and the subsequent infiltration of leukocytes, we sought to characterize HC substitution of hyaluronan ""cables"" in primary mouse airway smooth muscle cells (MASM) and primary human airway smooth muscle cells (HASM). We found that cells derived from mice lacking TSG-6 had no defect in hyaluronan production or hyaluronan-mediated leukocyte adhesion when treated with the viral mimic poly(I,C). Functional hyaluronan cables were induced by cycloheximide in the confirmed absence of protein synthesis, with or without simultaneous treatment with poly(I,C). We characterized the species specificity of the antibody other investigators used to describe the HC-hyaluronan complex of hyaluronan cables and found minimal affinity to bovine-derived HCs in contrast to HCs from mouse and human sera. Thus, we cultured MASM and HASM cells in serum from these three sources and analyzed hyaluronan extracts for HCs and other hyaluronan-binding proteins, using parallel cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC) extracts as positive controls. We conclude that, if hyaluronan cables derived from MASM and HASM cells are substituted with HCs, the amount of substitution is significantly below the limit of detection when compared with COC extracts of similar hyaluronan mass."
https://openalex.org/W1970470298,"The ARE/poly-(U) binding factor 1 (AUF1), a protein family consisting of four isoforms, is believed to mediate mRNA degradation by binding to AU-rich elements (ARE). However, evidence exists that individual AUF1 isoforms may stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs. The 3′-untranslated region of the human inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) contains five AREs, which promote RNA degradation. We have recently shown that the RNA-binding protein KSRP is critically involved in the decay of the iNOS mRNA. In this study we examined the effects of the individual AUF1 isoforms on iNOS expression. Overexpression of each AUF1 isoform reduces iNOS expression on mRNA and protein levels to the same extent by modulation of mRNA stability. Accordingly, knockdown of all or individual AUF1 isoforms by an RNA interference approach enhances iNOS expression. The AUF1 effect on iNOS expression is dependent on the iNOS 3′-untranslated region sequence, as demonstrated in transfection experiments with a reporter mRNA. Binding studies showed that all AUF1 isoforms interact with the same AU-rich region in the iNOS-3′-untranslated region. Cytokine stimulation altered intracellular AUF1 binding activities. These data demonstrate that AUF1 is an important factor that promotes iNOS mRNA degradation. Furthermore, all individual AUF1 isoforms act in a similar manner.

In recent years several proteins have been identified that are able to interact with AREs and thereby mediate changes in mRNA stability. The members of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) protein family, especially HuR (11Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anderson P. Kollias G. Kontoyiannis D.L. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 19: 777-789Google Scholar). The closely related proteins T cell-restricted intracellular antigen (TIA)-1 and the TIA-related protein (TIAR) destabilize mRNAs and interfere with translation by binding to ARE sequences (13Dember L.M.

The KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) (15Gherzi R. Lee K.Y. Briata P. Wegmuller D. Moroni C. Karin M. Chen C.Y. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 14: 571-583Google Scholar), the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (16Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol.

The mechanism in which way these RNA-binding proteins mediate mRNA decay is not yet fully understood. It is generally believed that mRNA decay starts with shortening of the poly-A tail followed by degradation of the mRNA by the exosome (multiprotein complex with 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity). Because the exosome is not able to bind directly to the ARE-mRNA it requires the RNA-binding proteins KSRP and TTP for this interaction (18Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell.. 2001; 107: 451-464Google Scholar). In addition, also the 5′-3′ decay pathway is important for the degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs. Here the process starts with the decapping of the mRNA by Dcp1 followed by Xrn1-mediated 5′-3′ degradation of the mRNA body. It has been published that TTP is also able to target ARE-mRNAs to this decay pathway (19Stoecklin G. Anderson P. Adv. Immunol... 2006; 89: 1-37Google Scholar). The ARE/poly(U) binding/degradation factor 1 (AUF1, also named heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein D) is a RNA-binding protein with a dual function in terms of regulation of mRNA stability (20Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). On the one hand a destabilizing effect of AUF1 has been described, but on the other hand some reports demonstrate an mRNA-stabilizing role for this protein (21Lin S. Wang W. Wilson G.M. Yang X. Brewer G. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 7903-7913Google Scholar, 22Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 6960-6971Google Scholar, 23Mazan-Mamczarz K. Kuwano Y. Zhan M. White E.J. Martindale J.L. Lal A. Gorospe M. Nucleic Acids Res..2008Google Scholar). Functional analysis of AUF1 in mRNA degradation is further complicated due to the existence of four different isoforms, which are generated by alternative splicing of one heteronuclear RNA. The family consists of a 45-kDa protein (p45AUF1) which contains all exons, a 42-kDa protein (p42AUF1) with deleted exon 2, a 40-kDa protein (p40AUF1) which lacks exon 7, and a 37-kDa protein (p37AUF1) with both exon 2 and exon 7 deleted (see Fig. 1A). According to the literature, all isoforms display different RNA binding activities, whereas p37AUF1 possesses the highest and p40AUF1 the lowest RNA binding affinity (see Fig. 1A) (24Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics.. 1998; 48: 195-202Google Scholar). Furthermore, some evidence exists that the individual AUF1 isoforms exert different effects in the regulation of mRNA stability depending on their expressional level (25Raineri I. Wegmueller D. Gross B. Certa U. Moroni C. Nucleic Acids Res... 2004; 32: 1279-1288Google Scholar, 26Ing N.H. Massuto D.A. Jaeger L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 1764-1772Google Scholar, 27Sarkar S. Sinsimer K.S.

In addition to these post-transcriptional effects, also AUF1-dependent transcriptional regulation mechanisms have been published (28Jiao R. He Q.Y. Chen H. Hua Z. Jiao Q. Chiu J.F. J. Cell.

In the innate immune system nitric oxide generated by the human inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) is important for the defense of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and tumor cells. The expression of the enzyme is induced by lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines (30Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol... 2001; 11: 66-75Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of the human iNOS mRNA contains five ARE sequences. Transfection experiments in A549/8- or DLD-1 cells showed that these sequences are able to destabilize the mRNA of a heterologous reporter gene (31Rodriguez-Pascual F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Forstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 26040-26049Google Scholar). Therefore, post-transcriptional mechanisms are important for the regulation of iNOS gene expression. In recent studies we demonstrated that the ARE-binding proteins KSRP, HuR, PTB, and tristetraprolin are critically involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of human iNOS expression (32Fechir M.

UV-crosslink experiments with a 32P-labeled transcript of the human iNOS 3′-UTR and DLD-1 total cell extracts showed that several proteins are able to interact with this sequence. One of these proteins seems to be AUF1 (35Fechir M. Schneid C. Linker K. Förstermann U. Kleinert H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol... 2003; 367: R41Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the involvement of AUF1 in the post-transcriptional regulation of human iNOS expression. Moreover, we were interested if all AUF1 isoforms regulate iNOS expression in the same way or if some isoforms exert opposite effects. Overexpression or siRNA-mediated down-regulation of AUF1 indicates that all AUF1 isoforms reduce iNOS expression to a similar extent by decreasing iNOS mRNA stability. All AUF1 isoforms display the same binding pattern to the iNOS 3′-UTR sequence. Transfection data indicate that the four different AUF1 proteins mediate their effects on human iNOS expression via this binding.

The Bradford reagent mix for determination of protein concentration was obtained from Bio-Rad. The monoclonal anti-AUF1 antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss (Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). The DLD-1-TR7 cells and the pTER vector were a kind gift of Dr. M. Weitering, Center for Biomedical Genetics, Utrecht, Netherlands). Cell Culture, Cytokine Treatment, and RNA Isolation—Human colon carcinoma DLD-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Eighteen hours before cytokine induction, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine in the absence of serum and phenol red. iNOS expression in cells was induced with a cytokine mixture (CM) containing human interferon-γ (100 units/ml), interleukin-1β (50 units/ml), and tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml) for the corresponding time periods depending on the experiment. Afterward, supernatant of the cells was used to measure NO–2 by the Sievers Nitric Oxide Analyzer (ADInstruments, Spechbach, Germany), and cells were processed for protein extraction or RNA isolation by guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction as described (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem... 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Establishment of Cell Lines Expressing EGFP-AUF1 Fusion Proteins—To generate DLD-1 cells overexpressing EGFP-AUF1 fusion proteins, cells were transfected with 5 μg of pZeo-EGFP-p37AUF1, -p40AUF1, -p42AUF1, or -p45AUF1 (20Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar) with FuGENE according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable transfectants (DLD-1-pZeo-EGFP-p37AUF1, -p40AUF1, -p42AUF1, or -p45AUF1) were selected with zeocin (0.2 mg/ml). As a control, DLD-1 cells stably transfected with the pZeo-EGFP-C1 vector were also generated (DLD-1-pZeo-EGFP-C1). As the pZeo-EGFP-C1 and pZeo-EGFP-AUF1 constructs code for an EGFP protein or EGFP-AUF1 fusion protein, the zeocin-resistant cell pools were also selected for EGFP expression by fluorescence activated cell sorting. These sorted cell pools were characterized for the expression of EGFP-AUF1 by Western blots using a monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody. Quantitative Reverse Transcription (qRT)-PCR—Gene expression was quantified in a two-step real-time RT-PCR. The cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA samples using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Real-time PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μl in a 96-well spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (iCycler, Bio-Rad). For all genes the final reaction mix contained 2.5 units of Taq-DNA polymerase, Taq-DNA polymerase buffer, and dNTPs (final concentration, 2.5 μm each), forward and reverse primers at final concentrations of 0.4 μm for each primer, the corresponding probe at the final concentration of 0.2 μm, and 2 μl of cDNA. For real-time PCR (40 cycles of 15 s 94 °C, 60 s 60 °C), the oligonucleotides listed below served as sense and antisense primers and Taqman hybridization probes: AUF1, sense 5′-GCCTTTCTCCAGATACACCTGAAG-3′, antisense 5′-CTTATTGGTCTTGTTGTCCATGGG-3′, probe, 5′-TGGTGGTTTTGGTGAGGTGGAATCCATA-3′; iNOS, sense 5′-TGCAGACACGTGCGTTACT-CC-3′, antisense 5′-GGTAGCCAGCATAGCGGATG-3′, probe 5′-TGGCAAGCACGACTTCCGGG-TG-3′; GAPDH, sense 5′-CCCATGTTCGTCATGGGTGT-3′, antisense 5′-TGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGATA-3′, probe, 5′-CTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGCACCC-3′; renilla, sense 5′-TTCGCAACGGGTTTGCC-3′, antisense, 5′-TGTTTACATCTGGCCCACCAC-3′, probe, 5′-AGCCACCATGACTTCGAAAGTTTATGATCCAG-3′; luciferase, sense, 5′-CACAGGTCTCTTCCTGGTTTG-3′, antisense, 5′-TCTTCCAGCGGATAGAATGG-3′, probe 5′-CAGCTGCAAGCCCCACAGTGAAG-3′. Each experimental reaction was performed in triplicate. All primer/probes sets had efficiencies of 100% (±10%). To calculate the relative expression of iNOS or AUF1 mRNA the 2(–ΔΔC(T)) method (37Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods.. 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar) was used. The values of untreated cell samples were set 100%, and the percentage of iNOS or AUF1 mRNA expression was calculated. Analysis of Human iNOS Promoter Activity in Stably Transfected Cells—To investigate the effect of the overexpression of each AUF1 isoform on cytokine-induced iNOS promoter activity, DLD-1–16kb cells (containing a 16-kilobase fragment of the human iNOS promoter cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene) were transiently transfected by lipofection with FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 1.5 μg of the plasmids pZeo-EGFP-C1, pZeo-EGFP-p37AUF1, -p40AUF1, -p42AUF1, or -p45AUF1 were combined with 0.5 μg of the renilla reporter gene plasmid pEF-1α-renilla (38Bros M. Boissel J.P. Godtel-Armbrust U. Forstermann U. Genomics.. 2006; 87: 463-473Google Scholar) for normalization of transfection efficiency. After overnight incubation, cells were stimulated for corresponding time points with or without CM. Then the cells were lysed in 1× Passive Lysis Buffer provided by the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system, and firefly and renilla luciferase activities were determined in 40 and 20 μl of the extracts, respectively. The light units of the firefly luciferase were normalized by those of renilla luciferase after subtraction of extract background. Western Blot Experiments—To study the protein expression in DLD-1 cells, total cell protein was isolated as described (33Linker K. Pautz A. Fechir M. Hubrich T. Greeve J. Kleinert H. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 4813-4827Google Scholar). To study the expression of human AUF1, EGFP-AUF1 fusion protein, or iNOS, extracts (10–50 μg protein) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry electroblotting. All further steps were performed as described (31Rodriguez-Pascual F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Forstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 26040-26049Google Scholar). For detection of AUF1, EGFP-AUF1 fusion protein or iNOS monoclonal anti-AUF1-, anti-EGFP, or anti-iNOS antibodies were used. The immunoreactive proteins on the blots were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of mRNA Stability Using a Tetracycline-inducible Expression Vector—A pcDNA4/TO-based luciferase expression vector (5′-UTR-Luc) containing the first exon, the first intron, and part of the second exon of the human iNOS gene was generated. Transfection of this clone in cells resulted in the expression of an mRNA containing the 5′-UTR of the human iNOS mRNA fused to the luciferase coding region. Integration of the 3′-UTR sequence of the human iNOS mRNA into this vector (3′ to the luciferase stop codon) resulted in the vector 5′-UTR-Luc-3′-UTR (see supplemental Fig. S2). To study binding properties of the different AUF1 isoforms to the iNOS 3′-UTR, a pcDNA4/TO-based luciferase expression vector with the iNOS 5′-UTR and an iNOS 3′-UTR lacking the first, second, and third AU-rich elements was generated (5′-UTR-Luc-3′-UTR without ARE 1–3). DNA sequences of the clones were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method with a sequencing kit from Amersham Biosciences. To analyze the effect of the different AUF1 isoforms on the expression of these luciferase reporter mRNAs, DLD-1-TR7 cells were transiently transfected as described above. To induce luciferase expression, cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Then cells were lysed, and firefly and renilla luciferase mRNA expression and activities were determined as described above. 6-Dichloro-1-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) Experiments—To examine the influence of the different AUF1 isoforms on iNOS mRNA stability, DLD-1-overexpressing AUF1 cells were incubated as indicated, and iNOS expression was induced by cytokines for 4 h. Then 25 μg/ml DRB (Sigma) was added, and RNAs were prepared 0–4 h thereafter. Relative iNOS and GAPDH mRNA amounts were determined by qRT-PCR, and iNOS mRNA was normalized to GAPDH mRNA. The relative amount of iNOS mRNA at 0 h DRB was set at 100%. Curve fittings of the resulting DRB time curves were performed by nonlinear regression using Graph-Pad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitation-qRT-PCR Assay—For determination of intracellular protein-RNA interactions, EGFP-, EGFP-PTB, and EGFP-AUF1 isoform overexpressing DLD-1cells were incubated for 4 h with or without the cytokine mixture. Immunoprecipitation was performed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody. All further steps were performed as described before (33Linker K. Pautz A. Fechir M. Hubrich T. Greeve J. Kleinert H. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 4813-4827Google Scholar). Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-AUF1 Proteins—Procaryotic expression vectors (pGEX2T-p37AUF1, -p40AUF1, -p42AUF1, or -p45AUF1) coding for different GST-AUF1 fusion proteins were generated. Purified GST or GST-AUF1 fusion proteins were prepared using the plasmids pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) and pGEX2T-p37AUF1, -p40AUF1, -p42AUF1, or -p45AUF1 as described (31Rodriguez-Pascual F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Forstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 26040-26049Google Scholar). The yield of the purification procedure was determined by comparison with a bovine serum albumin standard on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. UV Cross-linking Experiments—cDNAs encoding subfragments of the human iNOS 3′-UTR have been described previously (31Rodriguez-Pascual F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Forstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 26040-26049Google Scholar, 32Fechir M. Linker K. Pautz A. Hubrich T. Forstermann U. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Kleinert H. Mol. Pharmacol... 2005; 67: 2148-2161Google Scholar). To generate a cDNA encoding a subfragment B RNA without AU-rich elements (B mut) the oligonucleotides B-mut-up and B-mut-down (5′-CCGGATCCAAGCTTCCCGTGGCGCCATGTCGCACCACTGTGTCGGGCACTGCCTTGTGTACAGTTCGGGC-3′; 5′-GGCCATGGGGAACAGACTGGGTGTTAGTTTTTGCCCGACAGAGGCAGCCCGAACTGTACACAAGGC-3′; mutated sequences are underlined) were annealed and cloned into pCR-Script resulting in the plasmid pCR-B-mut. To generate radiolabeled iNOS 3′-UTR sense probes for RNA binding experiments, 0.5–1 μg of linearized plasmids were in vitro transcribed, and UV cross-linking experiments were performed as described (32Fechir M. Linker K. Pautz A. Hubrich T. Forstermann U. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Kleinert H. Mol. Pharmacol... 2005; 67: 2148-2161Google Scholar, 33Linker K. Pautz A. Fechir M. Hubrich T. Greeve J. Kleinert H. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 4813-4827Google Scholar). Down-regulation of AUF1 Expression by RNA Interference—shRNAs were produced in vitro using chemically synthesized DNA oligonucleotide templates (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) and the MessageMuter shRNA production kit (Epicenter/Biozym, Oldendorf, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. The target sequences for AUF1 based on sequences within the AUF1 coding region: AUF1-exon 1 (5′-GAUUGACGCCAGUAAGAAC-3′), AUF1-exon 2 (5′-ACGAGGAGGAUGAAGGCCA-3′), and AUF1-exon 7 (5′-CUGGAACCAGGGAUAUAGU-3′) (25Raineri I. Wegmueller D. Gross B. Certa U. Moroni C. Nucleic Acids Res... 2004; 32: 1279-1288Google Scholar). As controls, shRNAs with target sequences within the GL2-luciferase coding region (5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3′) (33Linker K. Pautz A. Fechir M. Hubrich T. Greeve J. Kleinert H. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 4813-4827Google Scholar) were synthesized. Moreover, pTER plasmids (39van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep... 2003; 4: 609-615Google Scholar) coding for the AUF1-exon 1 shRNA or for the GL2-luciferase shRNA were used for transient transfection experiments. AUF1 Isoform-specific qRT-PCR—DLD-1 cells were transiently transfected with psiRNAhH1-GFPzeo vectors coding for the same shRNAs directed against AUF1-exon 1, AUF1-exon 2, and AUF1-exon 7 as described above. As control, a psiRNAhH1-GFPzeo vector coding for an shRNA targeting Gl2-luciferase was used. 48 h after transfection RNA was isolated. To distinguish the four different AUF1 isoforms by two-step qRT-PCR, two separate reverse transcription reactions were performed. A primer located in AUF1-exon 7(5′-GTTGCCATAGCCTTGATTCC-3′) allows isoform-specific transcription of p42AUF1 and the p45AUF1 cDNA. With a primer targeting a region spanning AUF1exon 6 to AUF1-exon 8 (5′-CCACTCTGCTGGTCACCAC-3′), only p37AUF1 and p40AUF1 mRNAs were transcribed into cDNA. To analyze the expression of GAPDH, a reverse transcription with a random primer was performed. In qRT-PCR experiments relative amounts of p37AUF1 and p42AUF1 were detected with a sense primer located in AUF1-exon 1 (5′-GTCTGGAGGCACCGAAGG-3′), an antisense primer binding to AUF1-exon 3 (5′-TGATAGGATCTAACTTCAGAGTGCAG-3′), and a probe corresponding to a sequence in AUF1-exon 3 (5′-AAGATTGACGCCAGTAAGAACGAGGAGGA-3′). p40AUF1 and p45AUF1 were distinguished in qRT-PCR experiments using a sense primer located in AUF1-exon 1 (5′-GTCTGGAGGCACCGAAGG-3′), an antisense primer located in AUF1-exon 2 (5′-CGCTGCTTCAGAGTGTCG-3′), and a probe complementary to a region in AUF1-exon 2 (5′-CGAGGAGGATGAAGGCCATTCAAACTC-3′). The reverse transcription and real-time PCR were performed as described above. Statistics—Data represent the means ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least-significant-difference test for comparison of multiple means. Overexpression of Each AUF1 Isoform Reduces Cytokine-induced iNOS Expression in DLD-1 Cells—To determine whether AUF1 is involved in the regulation of iNOS expression, we generated DLD-1 cells constitutively expressing each AUF1 isoform as an EGFP-AUF1 fusion protein (p37, p40, p42, and p45). DLD-1 cells stably expressing EGFP (C1) were used as control. All cells were analyzed for EGFP expression by fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis (data not shown), and overexpression of each AUF1 isoform was confirmed in Western blot experiments (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of the different AUF1 isoforms did not modify endogenous AUF1 expression (Fig. 1C). To induce iNOS expression DLD-1-AUF1 cells were incubated with a cytokine mixture (containing interleukin-1β, human interferon -γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α), and total mRNA and protein were isolated. iNOS-mediated NO production was determined by measuring the nitrite content in the supernatant of the cells. Overexpression of each EGFP-AUF1 fusion protein impaired cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 2, A and B) as well as iNOS-mediated NO production (Fig. 2C). However, cytokine incubation did not alter the expression of endogenous AUF1 or EGFP-AUF1 fusion proteins (Figs. 1, B and C). Also, subcellular localization of EGFP-AUF1 fusion protein was not significantly altered upon cytokine stimulation (see supplemental Fig. S1). Down-regulation of AUF1 Expression Enhances Cytokine-induced iNOS Expression—To confirm these results we tested whether down-regulation of endogenous AUF1 expression using the RNA interference technique resulted in enhanced iNOS expression. Experiments were performed with siRNAs targeting different exons of the AUF1 mRNA. siRNA directed against exon 1 down-regulated expression of all AUF1 isoforms. siRNA against exon 2 reduced expression of p40AUF1 and p45AUF1, whereas siRNA targeting exon 7 selectively decreased p42AUF1 and p45AUF1 expression. DLD-1 cells were transiently transfected with the different AUF1 siRNAs or a luciferase siRNA as control. After transfection cells were incubated in the presence or absence of a cytokine mixture, and the expression of AUF1 and iNOS was analyzed. Fig. 3A demonstrates a decrease of total AUF1 expression on mRNA level in cells treated with the different AUF1 siRNAs compared with luciferase siRNA-treated control cells. Detailed analysis of the mRNA expression of each AUF1 isoform by isoform-specific qRT-PCR experiments demonstr"
https://openalex.org/W2025448067,"GroEL is an essential Escherichia coli molecular chaperon that uses ATP to facilitate correct folding of a range of proteins in a cell. Central to the GroEL substrate diversity is how GroEL recognizes the substrates. The interaction between GroEL and substrate has been proposed to be largely hydrophobic because GroEL interacts with proteins in non-native conformations but not in native forms. Analysis of GroEL substrate proteins reveals that one of its main substrates are proteins with alphabeta folding domains, suggesting that GroEL may stabilize the collapsed alphabeta core by binding to hydrophobic surfaces that are usually buried between the alpha and beta elements. In this study, we characterize the interaction between GroEL and a peptide derived from our previous selection via a phage display method. NMR studies map the peptide-binding site to the region containing Helices H and I, which is consistent with evidence that this region comprises the primary substrate-binding site. The peptide is largely unstructured in solution but adopts a helical conformation when bound to the GroEL apical domain with a moderate affinity (K(d) = 17.1 +/- 2.5 microm). The helical conformation aligns residues to form an amphipathic structure, and the hydrophobic side of this amphipathic helix interacts with GroEL as suggested by fluorescence quenching studies. Together with previous structural studies on the GroEL-peptide complexes, our work supports the notion that the amphipathic secondary elements in the substrate proteins may be the structural motif recognized by GroEL."
https://openalex.org/W1982437886,"The TolQRA proteins of Escherichia coli form an inner membrane complex involved in the maintenance of the outer membrane stability and in the late stages of cell division. The TolQR complex uses the proton motive force to regulate TolA conformation and its interaction with the outer membrane Pal lipoprotein. It has been proposed that an ion channel forms at the TolQR transmembrane helix (TMH) interface. This complex assembles with a minimal TolQ:TolR ratio of 4–6:2 and therefore involves 14–20 TMHs. To define the organization of the transmembrane helices in the membrane within the TolQR complex, we initiated a cysteine scanning study. In this study, we report results for the systematic replacement of each residue of the TolR TMH. Phenotypic analyses first showed that most of the mutants are functional. Three mutants, TolR L22C, D23C, and V24C, were shown to affect TolQR functioning. Disulfide bond complex formation further showed that two TolR anchors are close enough to interact. Two substitutions, L22C and V24C, form high level of dimers, suggesting that the TolR helix rotates as molecular gears between these two positions and that disulfide bond formation between these residues blocked the rotary motion. Mutations of critical residues located within the TolQ TMH2 and TMH3 and the TolR TMH and proposed to form the ion pathway prevent rotation between these two residues.

The proline residue at position 187 of TolQ (TMH3) is also essential and has been proposed to regulate conformational modifications of the TolQR complex in response to ion transit through the aqueous channel (14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, a cysteine scanning study demonstrated that the C-terminal periplasmic domain of TolR forms head-to-tail homo-dimers (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a result that has been confirmed by the NMR structure of the Haemophilus influenzae TolR periplasmic domain (16Parsons L.M. Grishaev A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cysteine accessibility indicates that the same domain changes conformation in response to PMF and to critical residues suspected to form the ion pathway. Consequently, it has been proposed that the C-terminal domain of TolR may regulate ion entrance or ion flows through the TolQ-R TM channel (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The TolQ-TolR complex is homologous to the ExbB-ExbD complex that functions in membrane transport and to the MotA-MotB complex that forms the stator of the flagellar motor (12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Kojima S. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13041-13050Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Zhai Y.F. Heijne W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses on the homologous TolR and ExbD proteins using chemical cross-linkers indicated that TolR forms homo-dimers (8Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Bénédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4476-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ExbD forms dimers and trimers (19Higgs P.I. Myers P.S. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determinants for TolR dimer formation mainly localize in the periplasmic domain of the protein. The three-dimensional structure of the H. influenzae TolR periplasmic domain confirmed the formation of homodimers with a head-to-tail conformation (16Parsons L.M. Grishaev A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas the three-dimensional structure of ExbD obtained under acid pH conditions corresponds to a monomer (20Garcia-Herrero A. Peacock R.S. Howard S.P. Vogel H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 872-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No structural information is available for MotB; however, extensive mutagenesis has been performed using targeted disulfide cross-linking and evidenced that the TMHs from two MotB molecules are close enough to interact (21Braun T.F. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13051-13059Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Using the whole batch of available data, an arrangement of four molecules of MotA and two MotB has been proposed in the flagellar motor (22Braun T.F. Al-Mawsawi L.Q. Kojima S. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on the stoichiometry of one TolA molecule, a model for the arrangement of the TolQRA complex containing four to six TolQ and two TolR molecules has been proposed (12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similar ratios were measured for the ExbB-D-TonB complex (23Higgs P.I. Larsen R.A. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This will form a minimal complex composed of 15–21 helices. To understand how the TolQRA TM segments interact in the membrane and how they mechanically respond to PMF or ion transit, we initiated a cysteine scanning approach. Herein, we performed a cysteine substitution mutagenesis of TolR TMH residues. The phenotypic consequences of residue replacements and the patterns of disulfide cross-linking obtained are consistent with an organization of two TolR TM segments in close contact through two distinct faces, suggesting helix rotation. Further experiments support the model in which ion transit at the TolQR TM helices interface induce a rotary motion of the TolR TM segment between the two faces. Strain, Plasmid Construction, and Growth Conditions—GM1 Escherichia coli K12 strain (WT), and its derivatives, TPS300 and TPS13 (tolR::Cm and tolQR, respectively) (24Sun T.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used in this study. pOK-QR was constructed by insertion of a EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pTPS304 (a ColE1 pUC19 derivatives encoding tolQ-tolR) (24Sun T.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the P15A derivative pOK12 vector (25Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). pUC-R and pOK-R constructs were obtained by deletion of the tolQ gene from plasmid pTPS304 and pOK-QR, respectively, using recombinant PCR (26Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Méjean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and oligonucleotides 5′-TTAAACTCCGCGACAATAGACTTGGGAAGCGCACGAGGCTT and 5′-GTCTATTGTCGCGGAGTTTAAGCAATGGCCAGAGCGCGTGGACGA. In these constructs, the tolQ Shine Dalgarno is followed by tolR gene. tolR mutants were engineered as described previously (12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), using the pUC-R or the pOK-R plasmids as templates. Site-directed substitutions were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis PCR using complementary pairs of oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request). Plasmid pOK-QHA, encoding a functional TolQ protein carrying a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag and compatible with the pUC-R derivatives, will be described elsewhere. pOK-QHA carrying point mutations (T145A, T178A, and P187V TolQ mutant proteins) were constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis. All of the constructs were verified by restriction analyses and further DNA sequencing. Routinely, cells were grown aerobically in LB medium at 37 °C supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml; pUC derivatives), kanamycin (50 μg/ml; pOK derivatives), or chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml). Assays for Outer Membrane Stability—Outer membrane permeability was assessed by measuring the level of detergent susceptibility, as well as the level of periplasmic RNase I release in the extracellular medium. Detergent susceptibility was measured by the level of survival of the strain on 1% deoxycholate supplemented LB plates or on LB liquid medium containing various concentrations of SDS (as described previously) (27Cascales E. Lloubés R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the latter case, survival is reported as the concentration of SDS sufficient to inhibit 50% of the cell growth after 3 h of cultures (LD50). RNase I leakage was measured on RNA-containing plates, as described previously (27Cascales E. Lloubés R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Colicin Tolerance Assay—Colicin activities were checked by the presence of halos on a lawn of the strain to be tested, as described previously (28Journet L. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Lloubés R. Lazdunski C. Bénédetti H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The data are reported as the maximal dilution of the colicin stock sufficient for inhibiting cell growth. In Vivo Disulfide Bond Formation and Immunodetection—In vivo disulfide bond formation was essentially carried out as described previously (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 8 × 108 exponentially growing cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and then treated for 10 min with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) to block reduced thiol groups. When required, the cells were treated with the oxidative catalyst copper (II) orthophenanthroline 0.3 mm (CuoP; Sigma) prior washing in sodium phosphate buffer and blocking with N-ethylmaleimide. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer in the presence or absence of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. In vivo formaldehyde cross-linking was performed as described previously (29Cascales E. Bernadac A. Gavioli M. Lazzaroni J.C. Lloubés R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunodetections were performed using the anti-TolR polyclonal antibody (8Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Bénédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4476-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), secondary goat antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma), and nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma). Sequence Conservation—The TolR, ExbD, and MotB proteins share similarities at the sequence level and probably at the structural and functional levels. Fig. 1A shows a sequence conservation consensus of all TolR, ExbD, and MotB TM anchors available on the protein data base. The general consensus obtained from the TolR, ExbD, and MotB consensuses shows that the aspartate residue at position 23, two leucine residues at positions 28 and 29, and a phenylalanine residue at position 32 are conserved, whereas many other positions present residue with similar hydrophobic properties (positions relative to the E. coli TolR sequence; Fig. 1A). However, because of the nature of a transmembrane helix and the general hydrophobicity of the residues, these residues probably act as structural determinants. The functional role of the Asp23 residue has been documented in the TolR protein, as well as in the ExbD and MotB homologues. It has been proposed that this aspartate plays a central role in the PMF-dependent process and may couple ion or proton transport to mechanical movement within the TolQR-ExbBD-MotAB or PomAB complexes (12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol.

A recent accessibility study showed that it is indeed the case because TolR C-terminal residues display different solvent accessibilities depending on PMF and residues important for channel formation, including the TolR Asp23 residue (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To understand how transmembrane helices organize together in the membrane and how PMF and hydrophilic ion channel residues regulate structural transitions, we initiated a cysteine scanning approach using site-directed mutagenesis. Cysteine Scanning: Mutagenesis and Expression Levels of Cys Substitutions—To gain information about the structural organization and dynamic features of the TolR transmembrane anchor, each amino acid residue of the helix (residues 18–37) (34Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4485-4491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Muller M.M. Vianney A. Lazzaroni J.C. Webster R.E. Portalier R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6059-6061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was individually replaced with cysteine. Mutations were introduced into the pUC-R plasmid, which expresses tolR at WT levels, by a recombinant PCR technique. Steady state levels of cysteine substituted TolR proteins were determined after introduction of the mutated plasmids into the tolR TPS300 strain. Initial studies using the polyclonal anti-TolR antibodies showed that the substituted TolR proteins migrate at the same position and accumulate at comparable levels as native TolR (Fig. 1B). However, as shown previously (5Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Popot J.L. Benedetti H. Samatey F. Lazdunski C. Portalier R. Geli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), mutations of the Asp23 or the Pro187 residue led to migration defects on denaturing gel electrophoresis. Phenotypic Characterization of Single Cysteine Mutants—The 20 singly substituted TolR mutants were tested for outer membrane stability, reflected by their capacity to grow on deoxycholate-containing plates as well as the level of periplasmic components release. Like most transmembrane helices, the TolR transmembrane segment was shown to be remarkably tolerant to cysteine substitution because all but three mutants displayed WT phenotype (Table 1). As expected, the strain producing the D23C TolR protein released RNase I in the medium and did not grow in presence of deoxycholate. Similar phenotypes were observed when the L22C and V24C tolR alleles were expressed. The TolR protein is also parasitized by bacterial toxins, called colicins, to penetrate and kill the target cell (for a review, see Ref. 36Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubés R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). We then tested the collection of substituted TolR mutants for group A colicin uptake, a process independent of PMF (36Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubés R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). All the strain producing the TolR mutants, except D23C, were killed by the Tol-dependent colicins (Table 1). We further tested the tolR substitutions for the uptake of group B colicins after introduction of the mutated plasmids into the exbBD-tolQR strain expressing tolQ (from the pOK-QHA plasmid). In contrast to group A colicins, group B colicins, except colicins 5 and 10, require energy from the ExbBD-TonB or the chimera TolQR-TonB complex (a phenomenon known as “cross-complementation”), to penetrate the cell (36Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubés R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). 3E. L. Goemaere, L. Journet, I. Schalk, R. Lloubes, and E. Cascales, unpublished results. Production of TolQ and the TolRD23C protein in the exbBD-tolQR strain renders cells resistant to all group B colicins tested (B, D, Ia, M, 5, and 10), whereas the L22C and V24C mutations prevented cell killing by group B colicins except colicins 5 and 10 (data not shown). These results confirmed that the D23C mutation abolishes all TolR functions (outer membrane stability and colicin import), whereas the L22C and V24C mutations specifically blocked the PMF-dependent TolR function (outer membrane stability) but not the energy-independent colicin import process. Taken together, the phenotype analysis suggests that the TolR Cys substitutions lie within the three previously characterized classes (Ref. 14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and Fig. 2): functional mutants (class I; all except L22C, D23C, and V24C), nonfunctional mutants (class II: D23C), and discriminative mutants (class III: L22C and V24C). This latter category includes mutations affecting TolQR channel activities, either at the level of channel formation (14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or prevention of conformational changes through disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because of the nature of these substitutions, we suspected the L22C and V24C TolR proteins to dimerize. However, as seen on the helical wheel projection (Fig. 2), the Leu22 and Val24 residues are located on opposite faces, suggesting that if the TolR TMH dimerizes, helix rotation should occur. Alternatively, these positions may be on the same face if the TolR TMH is subjected to important physical constraints such as strong helix torsion.TABLE 1Phenotypes of strains producing Cys-substituted TolR proteinsColicinDOCRNaseANE2DNoneRRRSS++WT444S4-I18C333S4-V19C333S4-P20C334S4-L21C334S4-L22C333SS++D23CRRRSS++V24C333SS++L25C444S4-L26C444S4-V27C334S4-L28C434S2-L29C334S4-L30C334S2+I31C334S4-F32C334S4-M33C434S4-A34C334S3-T35C334S3-A36C334S4-P37C334S3- Open table in a new tab To test whether the phenotypes observed for the TolR L22C and V24C mutants were generated through disulfide bond formation, we performed detergent susceptibility experiments in liquid medium in the presence or absence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Previous studies showed that the growth of E. coli cells is not affected by DTT concentrations up to 5 mm (37Duché D. Baty D. Chartier M. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24820-24825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indeed we observed that the presence of DTT in the medium increase SDS resistance of WT strain by a factor of ∼2 (Table 2). Survival of the TolRL22C- or TolRV24C-producing cells was affected by low concentrations of SDS, whereas resistance to SDS was restored to WT levels (increased resistance factor >15–20-fold) when DTT was added in the medium, suggesting that disulfide bonds reduction by DTT restores TolR function (Table 2). As a control, we showed that DTT has no effect on survival of the TolRD23C-producing strain. These results suggest that the discriminative phenotype (class III) observed for the L22C and V24C TolR mutants is likely engendered by formation of disulfide bonds and not by lateral chain constraints.TABLE 2Survival of TolR mutant strains to the detergent SDSLD50Strain-DTT+DTTNone<0.1<0.1WT0.9>2L22C<0.11.5D23C<0.1<0.1V24C<0.1>2 Open table in a new tab Disulfide Bond Formation between TolR Helix Residues—Journet et al. (8Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Bénédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4476-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that TolR dimerizes, mainly through the central periplasmic domain. To define whether and how the helices of the TolR dimer interact in the membrane, we performed immunodetection of the TolR cysteine derivatives in absence of reducing agent. As shown on Fig. 3A, the two mutants L22C and V24C gave a high level of dimers (**, lower panel), whereas a number of other mutants, including I18C, L21C, L25C, L28C, L29C, form dimers at lower levels (*, lower panel). Interestingly, all of these positions are located on one side of the TolR helix and comprise between the L22C and V24C positions (Fig. 3B). The intensity of dimer formation is enhanced for all these mutants when living cells are treated with the oxidative agent copper (II) ortho-phenanthroline, whereas low levels of dimers of V19C, L26C, V27C, F32C, M33C, T35C, A36C, and P37C TolR mutants appear (data not shown). All of these mutants, including TolRD23C, are likely to assemble correctly because they dimerize and interact with TolQ after in vivo para-formaldehyde cross-linking (data not shown). A helical wheel projection summarizing dimer formation is shown on Fig. 3B. Because of the level of covalently bound TolRL22C and TolRV24C dimers, the phenotype of cells expressing these mutants on outer membrane stability is likely due to prevention of TolR conformational modifications, as shown for the TolRY117C mutant situated in the C-terminal domain (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To confirm that disulfide bond formation between L22C or V24C TolR proteins prevents functioning of the TolQR complex, the growth curves of these cells were monitored in the absence or presence of 0.25% SDS. TolRL22C- and TolRV24C-producing cells grew in LB medium, but their growths were affected in presence of SDS. After 90 min, DTT was added to the final concentration of 5 mm in the culture medium. The TolRL22C- and TolRV24C-producing cells then started growing with a generation time similar to WT cells, demonstrating that reversion of the cross-link by the addition of a reducing agent allows growth to occur in presence of SDS (Fig. 4). In contrast, the addition of DTT has no effect on the growth of the TolRD23C-producing cells, for which TolR function is not altered by disulfide bond formation. Dimerization of TolR-Cys Mutants Affected in Ionizable Key Residues—TolR C-terminal domain has been shown to change conformation relative to the PMF and the presence of key ionizable residues within TolQ and TolR TM helices (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). If TolR transmembrane segments rotate similarly to ratchet gears between Leu22 and Val24, one may hypothesize that this rotation mechanism would be transmitted to the C-terminal domain, leading to conformational modifications. We thus constructed double mutants, including a single cysteine substitution with a high (L22C and V24C) or low (L25C, L28C, L29C) level of dimer formation, in combination with a mutation of the TolR Asp23 (D23A) or TolQ Thr145 (T145A), Thr178 (T178A), or Pro187 (P187V) residues, four residues critical for the TolQR ion pathway (14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These double substitutions mutants were tested for their ability to form dimers in vivo. We showed that mutations within the key ionizable residues Asp23, Thr145, and Thr178 do not affect formation of TolRL22C or TolRV24C dimers, whereas formation of L25C, L28C, or L29C TolR dimers was abolished, even in the presence of dichloro(1,10-phenanthroline) copper(II) (Fig. 5). However, as seen in the case of the formation of the TolR C-terminal Y117C dimer, mutation of the Pro187 residue does not abolish dimer formation. Overall, this suggests that the two Leu22 or the two Val24 residues are in close contact during TolR dimer assembly in the membrane and that rotation between the two helices is induced by torque generation by the TolQR ion channel. The TolQ, TolR, and TolA proteins form a complex at the inner membrane, interacting through their transmembrane segments, as evidenced using chemical cross-linking or isolation of allele-specific suppressive mutations (5Lazzaroni J.C.

Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These led to the conclusion that the transmembrane helix of TolR is at the proximity of the helices II and III of TolQ, whereas TolQ transmembrane III contacts the transmembrane I, which is in interaction with the transmembrane anchor of the TolA protein. Stoichiometry analyses showed that the ratio of the TolQ-TolR-TolA complex is 4–6:2:1 (4Guihard G. Boulanger P. Benedetti H. Lloubes R. Besnard M. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5874-5880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), adding further complexity in helix organization. However, trying to reconcile all the results and the faces of transmembrane segments in interaction has been shown to be difficult, raising the possibility that structural modifications and movements of helices during functioning may occur. The idea that the TolQRA complex undergoes conformational changes was first suggested by the observation that TolA interacts with the outer membrane-anchored peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein Pal in a PMF- and TolQR-dependent manner (10Cascales E. Gavioli M. Sturgis J.N. Lloubés R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Structural modifications of TolA dependent on PMF and on the TolQ and TolR proteins were demonstrated using protease accessibilities (13Germon P. Ray M.C. Vianney A. Lazzaroni J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4110-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated using cysteine accessibilities that the C-terminal periplasmic domain of the TolR protein is subjected to structural modifications (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R.

The observation that the TolQ and TolR helices share similarities, not only with the homologous ExbB and ExbD proteins but also with the flagella stator components MotA and MotB, led to the idea that these three couples of proteins may share a common mechanism of energy transfer (12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Kojima S. Blair D.F.

Acta. 2003; 1614: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This was exemplified by the presence of a conserved aspartate residue with TolR, ExbD, and MotB, which is critical for function (12Cascales E. Lloubés R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Braun V. Gaisser S. Herrmann C. Kampfenkel K. Killmann H. Traub I. J.

Following these studies, it has been proposed that the three helices (TolR, TolQ-II, and TolQ-III) may delimit a channel by which ions transit and that a “signal” is then transmitted to the TolA protein via the TolQ-I segment. An analysis of TolQ transmembrane residues further demonstrated that short length side chain residues are involved in helix packing, whereas hydrophilic residues may participate in the energy transduction mechanism (14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the current model, which is actively tested in our laboratory, a dimer of TolR anchors is surrounded by four to six TolQ molecules, thus allowing the formation of four to six ion pathways, for which channel activity may be regulated by mechanical movements. To determine how the TolQRA helices interact and how they undergo structural modifications, we performed a systematic cysteine scanning of the TolQRA helices. Here, we reported results obtained for the TolR TM helix. Our results clearly showed that cysteines from two distinct monomers are close enough to efficiently form a disulfide bond dimer without the aid of an oxidative agent. Similar results were obtained in a systematic cysteine scanning study of the flagellar MotB protein TMH (21Braun T.F. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13051-13059Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the case of the TolR protein, this is clearly shown for the L22C and V24C mutants. Disulfide bond formation blocks TolR dimers, which prevents function of the Tol system and growth in presence of detergent. Interestingly, this phenotype is reversed by the addition of reducing agent in the medium, as shown for cysteine mutations occluding the SecY protein channel (39Saparov S.M. Erlandson K. Cannon K. Schaletzky J. Schulman S. Rapoport T.A. Pohl P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On a perfect helical wheel projection of the TolR TMH, the Leu22 and Val24 residues are separated by an angle of ∼160°. In between, most substitutions form dimers, albeit at lower levels. These results raise the hypotheses (i) that the TolR transmembrane helix rotates between the two “extreme” positions (Leu22 and Val24) using the “intermediate” positions such as molecular ratchet gears or cogwheels or (ii) that the transmembrane helix is subject to physical torsions or constraints in such a way that all these residues (intermediate and extreme) are located on a reduced, unique face. The first model has been proposed in light of similar results using the MotB transmembrane anchor as model system (21Braun T.F. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13051-13059Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the case of MotB, projection on a similar wheel than the one used in Fig. 2 shows that the angle between the two extreme residues is ∼110°. However, these results cannot discriminate between the two hypotheses. One may hypothesize that in the absence of movement, the TolR dimer rotation will be stopped in both of the extreme positions (hypothesis (i) above), whereas all extreme and intermediate substitutions will still promote helix dimerization (hypothesis (ii) above). Our results using mutations that affect residues that regulate ion transit favor the first hypothesis. It seems thus likely that the two TolR helices from a dimer oscillate between two extreme conformations (Fig. 6). Alternatively, because the 4–6:2 stoichiometry of the TolQR complex represents the “minimal complex,” one may hypothesize that TolR form tetramers. In this case, both L22C and V24C substitutions may form disulfide bonds independently of helix rotation. However, this hypothesis can be ruled out because the L22C/V24C TolR double mutant only forms dimers as single substitutions do (data not shown). The Asp23 residue, which has been proposed to be critical for ion conduction, is located ∼100° from either Leu22 or Val24 on a helical wheel projection (Fig. 2). Using the rotary motion, the Asp23 residue may thus alternate between two different ion channels, as suggested for MotB. Such a rotation may thus place the Thr35 residue at the position previously occupied by the Asp23 residue in the channel. The presence of a hydrophilic residue at that position may thus stabilize the putative aqueous channel. The TolR T35C mutant displayed a WT phenotype, but mutation of the Thr35 residue by an alanine confers cell sensitivity toward deoxycholate, but cells remain sensitive to colicins (data not shown), classifying such a mutation as discriminative (class III), suggesting a functional role of this residue in response to PMF. This implies that rotation of the TolR anchor is functionally important, which is confirmed by the fact that disulfide bond formation with TolR L22C or V24C lead to cells that are impaired in membrane integrity but still sensitive for colicin import (Tables 1 and 2). Because the level of dimerization of the TolR L22C and V24C is higher than for the intermediate position, one may hypothesize that the time necessary to reach one extreme position from the other is fast and that the rotary motion stops transiently at the extreme positions. However, the TolR F32C and T35C mutant do not dimerize, even if these residues are located between the two extreme positions. This may suggest that the two TolR helices from a dimer are not close together on the whole length but rather are closer at the cytoplasmic side than at the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. This may account for the strong dimerization of Leu22 and Val24 residues, which are situated at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane; however, the Ile18 and Leu21 residues, which are located at the cytoplasmic side of the TolR helix, have intermediate dimerization properties. Our results showed that, similarly to TolR C-terminal domain movement (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), TolR helix rotation is regulated by three channel residues, the TolR Asp23 residue and the Thr145 and Thr178 residues located on helices II and III of TolQ, respectively. In the case of the MotAB complex, it has been shown using protease accessibilities that MotA conformation is regulated by the MotB Asp residue (17Kojima S. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13041-13050Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The discriminative mutation P187V does not abolish rotation, a result consistent with the observation that this residue does not regulate TolR C-terminal conformational modification (15Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubés R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The TolQ Pro187 residue has been shown to be required for the Tol complex functioning and has been suggested to couple ion transit to conformational changes (14Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubés R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that TolR anchors rotate independently of Pro187, which thus may regulate conformational modifications of TolQ. Overall, our results showed that two helices from two different TolR molecules are close to each other in the TolQR complex. These two TolR TMHs rotate as molecular gears between two positions, L22C and V24C. This rotation is functionally important for activity of the TolQR ion channel.

https://openalex.org/W2069556856,"In mammals, photoreceptors located in the inner retina convey photic information to the brain, regulating diverse non-image-forming tasks such as pupillary light reflexes and photic synchronization (entrainment) of daily activity rhythms. In nonmammalian vertebrates, the retina, deep brain photoreceptors, and pineal organ may be photoreceptive. Here we investigated light perception in the absence of functional cone and rod photoreceptors using GUCY1* chickens, birds carrying a null mutation that causes blindness at hatch. They showed light responses in both the pupillary light reflex and the entrainment of feeding rhythms to a 12:12 h light-dark cycle. Light responses persisted even when the extraretinal photoperception was abolished, but they were lost after enucleation; this strongly indicates the essential role played by the inner retina. A sensitivity spectrum study for the pupillary reflex that combined pupil responses to different monochromatic lights of various intensities demonstrated that a single opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment peaking at 484 nm drives photic responses; the best fit (lowest sum of squares, R(2)=0.9622) was attained with an opsin:vitamin A2 template. The results are the first characterization of functional inner retinal photoreceptors participating in the regulation of non-image-forming activities in nonmammalian vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2004646106,"Regulation of intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i>) by erythropoietin (Epo) is an essential part of signaling pathways controlling proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors, but regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. TRPC3 and the homologous TRPC6 are two members of the transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) superfamily that are expressed on normal human erythroid precursors. Here we show that TRPC3 expression increases but TRPC6 decreases during erythroid differentiation. This is associated with a significantly greater increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i> in response to Epo stimulation, suggesting that the ratio of TRPC3/TRPC6 is physiologically important. In HEK 293T cells heterologously expressing TRPC and erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R), Epo stimulated an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i> through TRPC3 but not TRPC6. Replacement of the C terminus of TRPC3 with the TRPC6 C terminus (TRPC3-C6C) resulted in loss of activation by Epo. In contrast, substitution of the C terminus of TRPC6 with that of TRPC3 (TRPC6-C3C) resulted in an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i> in response to Epo. Substitution of the N termini had no effect. Domains in the TRPC3 C terminus between amino acids 671 and 746 are critical for the response to Epo. Epo-R and phospholipase Cγ associated with TRPC3, and these interactions were significantly reduced with TRPC6 and TRPC3-C6C chimeras. TRPC3 and TRPC6 form heterotetramers. Coexpression of TRPC6 or C3/C6 chimeras with TRPC3 and Epo-R inhibited the Epo-stimulated increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i>. In a heterologous expression system, Epo stimulation increased cell surface expression of TRPC3, which was inhibited by TRPC6. However, in primary erythroblasts, an increase in TRPC3 cell surface expression was not observed in erythroblasts in which Epo stimulated an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i>, demonstrating that increased membrane insertion of TRPC3 is not required. These data demonstrate that TRPC6 regulates TRPC3 activation by Epo. Endogenously, regulation of TRPC3 by TRPC6 may primarily be through modulation of signaling mechanisms, including reduced interaction of TRPC6 with phospholipase Cγ and Epo-R."

It can be synthesized de novo by either of two pathways known as deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)-dependent and DXP-independent. The DXP-independent pathway is the predominant pathway and is found in most microorganisms and plants.

Recently, an alternative route has come to light that directly results in the biosynthesis of the cofactor form of the vitamin, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP). Moreover, most organisms that can make this essential compound (i.e. microorganisms and plants) in fact utilize this alternative pathway. Remarkably, the newly discovered pathway involves the interplay of just two proteins, a synthase (named Pdx1) and a glutaminase (named Pdx2), jointly displaying glutamine amidotransferase activity (3Raschle T.

Pdx1 and Pdx2 assemble into a 24-subunit complex (12 Pdx1 and 12 Pdx2 subunits) to form the functional vitamin B6 biosynthesis machinery (5Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14609-14620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The intrinsic reactions of the synthase and glutaminase occur at sites distant from each other, separated by ∼26 Å. The Pdx2 active site, where glutamine is hydrolyzed to glutamate and ammonia, is located at the interface between Pdx2 and the N terminus of Pdx1, whereas the active site of Pdx1 is located at the C-terminal end of its (β/α)8-barrel (5Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Tews I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19284-19289Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Zein F. Zhang Y. Kang Y.-N. Burns K. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14609-14620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). During the course of PLP synthesis, ammonia from the hydrolysis of glutamine in the Pdx2 active site is channeled to the Pdx1 active site via a putative tunnel, assumed to be inaccessible to solvent, that runs through the core of the Pdx1 (β/α)8-barrel (5Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Tews I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19284-19289Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At the Pdx1 active site, a pentose phosphate and triose phosphate sugar (i.e. ribose 5-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) are combined along with ammonia to form PLP. Since the active sites of Pdx1 and Pdx2 are remote from each other, tight regulation of enzyme activities coordinated by interdomain signaling is expected. So far, studies have primarily focused on the interaction of Pdx1 with Pdx2 and the direct effect of Pdx1 on the glutaminase activity of Pdx2. Signaling from Pdx2 to the Pdx1 active site and transmission of an interdomain signal between the individual Pdx1 monomers to explain the ornate dodecameric architecture have not yet been explored. X-ray crystallography and biochemical studies have facilitated characterization of the heteromeric PLP synthase as well as of the individual subunits at the molecular level. The structure of the individual glutaminase subunit Pdx2 was the first to be reported and provided insight into the active site architecture (7Bauer J.A. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 27914-27923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and shortly thereafter the Pdx1-Pdx2 complex was solved independently by two groups (5Strohmeier M.

A comparison of the structures of the individual subunits with that of the Pdx1-Pdx2 complex revealed areas that become ordered upon assembly of PLP synthase. In Pdx1, these include the N-terminal tail (residues 2–6), an N-terminal α-helix (residues 7–17), and residues 47–56 that comprise α-helix 2′. (Note that annotation and numbering is that of the Bacillus subtilis protein (5Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Tews I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The N-terminal ordered regions are mainly involved in the interaction with Pdx2, whereas the function of helix 2′ is not yet clear. However, in no case could structural information be provided on residues 270–294 of the Pdx1 C terminus, presumably due to inherent flexibility. Interestingly, in the presence of the pentose phosphate substrate, part of the C-terminal region is observed in the Thermotoga maritima protein (residues 270–280) (6Zein F. Zhang Y. Kang Y.-N. Burns K. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14609-14620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the remainder of the C terminus of Pdx1 (15 residues) has eluded structural analysis and remains to be characterized. Here we report on conformational changes in the Pdx1 protein upon assembly of the heteromeric PLP synthase complex. These occur at two levels, comprising interdomain cooperation between the individual Pdx1 monomers and signaling from the Pdx2 subunit to relay tighter binding of the pentose phosphate substrate. Employing fluorescence and UV-visible spectrometry combined with protein mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the C terminus of Pdx1 is essential in mediating these functionalities in PLP synthase, and we provide insight into the dynamics of this highly flexible region, which has a major role to play in the mechanism of this polymorphic enzyme. Furthermore, through the use of the recently developed technique of specific incorporation of a photoactivatable unnatural amino acid, we demonstrate that the vital role of the Pdx1 C terminus is accomplished by acting as a lever to a neighboring protomer, where it fulfills its catalytic role.

Equilibrium Binding Monitored by Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence-All steady-state fluorescence measurements were conducted on a QuantaMaster 4 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Seefeld, Germany). All spectra were acquired in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm NaCl and at 23 °C. The fluorescence emission spectra of the individual proteins were acquired from 305 to 550 nm after excitation at 295 nm using 2 μm either Pdx1 or Pdx1 ΔW294 and either a 4 or 20 μm concentration of Pdx2 H170N in the presence or absence of 1 mm glutamine, as indicated. Data were recorded in increments of 1 nm with an integration time of 1 s. Each spectrum was corrected for dilution effects. Bandwidths of the excitation and emission monochromator were set to 4 and 8 nm, respectively. For the fluorimetric titration, Pdx1 (either 0.3 or 2 μm) was incubated with varying concentrations of Pdx2 H170N (0–6 μm) in the presence of 1 mm glutamine, and the fluorescence emission at a λmax of 350 nm was measured for 10 s, averaged, and corrected for dilution effects and for any fluorescence signal caused by Pdx2 H170N (photobleaching was negligible with these experimental settings). Samples were preincubated for 5 min at 23 °C prior to the measurement. Equilibrium binding data were analyzed employing nonlinear fitting routines to Equation 1, F([Pdx2H170N])=F0-ΔF2·[Pdx1]·{([Pdx1]+[Pdx2H170N]+Kd)-([Pdx1]+[Pdx2H170N]+Kd)2-4([Pdx1]·[Pdx2H170N])}Eq. 1 where F([Pdx2H170N]) represents the fluorescence signal at a given Pdx2 H170N concentration, F0 is the maximal fluorescence signal, ΔF is the maximal change in fluorescence intensity, [Pdx1] is the Pdx1 concentration, [Pdx2 H170N] is the Pdx2 H170N concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant.

Pre-steady-state Kinetics Followed by Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence-Rapid kinetic measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the slit width was 15 nm. Light emitted from the sample was monitored after passing through a 320-nm cut-off filter. The concentration of Pdx1 was held constant at 0.3 μm, whereas that of Pdx2 H170N was varied in the range of 1.2–4.2 μm. Experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mm glutamine in 20 mm Tris-Cl and 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at 23 °C. In each experiment, 8000 data points were recorded during 200 s, and data from 5–10 traces at identical conditions were averaged. Photobleaching of Pdx1 over the time course of the reaction was subtracted from the fluorescence signal, and the end signal was normalized according to the fluorescence titration of Pdx2 H170N binding to Pdx1. The normalized data were fitted to a double exponential according to Equation 3, F(t)=Ft+α1·exp(-t/τ1)+α2·exp(-t/τ2)Eq. 3 where F(t) represents the fluorescence at time t, α1 and τ1 are the amplitude and the observed relaxation time of the fast relaxation (α2 and τ2 for the slow relaxation, respectively), and Ff is the fluorescence intensity after infinite time due to incomplete Pdx1-Pdx2 assembly.

This method employs an engineered plasmid coding for an orthologous aminoacyl tRNA synthetase pair allowing the incorporation of unnatural amino acids at the position of the amber stop codon. The amber stop codon (TAG) was introduced at either Arg-8, Tyr-261, Arg-288, or Trp-294 in Pdx1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Two plasmids, one (pSup-BpaRS-6TRN: p-benzoyl-phenylalanine) endowing the host cell with the ability to incorporate pBpa through an amber codon and another directing the expression of the amber mutant form of Pdx1, were introduced into E. coli BL21 cells using sequential heat-shock transformation. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A600 of 0.6. Prior to the induction of protein expression by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the medium was supplemented with 1 mm pBpa. Cells were incubated for another 6 h at 37 °C and then harvested by centrifugation and subsequently stored at -80 °C. The respective hexahistidine-tagged proteins, Pdx1 R8:pBpa, Pdx1 Y261:pBpa, Pdx1 R288:pBpa, and Pdx1 W294:pBpa, were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Incorporation of the unnatural amino acid was verified by electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Protein Service at the Functional Genomics Center, Zurich, Switzerland). Cross-linking reactions were performed in a 96-well microtiter plate with a total reaction volume of 100 μl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, on ice. Samples were irradiated at 365 nm using the UV Stratalinker 1800 (EIKO lamps F8T5/BL; Stratagene) for 1–120 min (depending on the experiment). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Where shown, immunodecoration with antibodies against Pdx1 and Pdx2 was carried out as described in Ref. 3Raschle T. Amrhein N.

Nano-liquid Chromatography Separation and MALDI Analysis of Tryptic Peptides-One hundred μm Pdx1 protein sample (wild type or W294:pBpa in a total volume of 100 μl that had been subjected to 60 min of irradiation at 365 nm using the UV Stratalinker 1800) was digested with 2 μg of trypsin for 3 h at 37 °C in 100 mm NH4HCO3. After digestion, trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Peptide separation was performed on an Ultimate chromatography system (Dionex-LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a Probot MALDI spotting device. Five μl of the samples was injected by using a Famos autosampler (Dionex-LC Packings) and loaded directly onto a 75 μm × 150 mm reversed-phase column (PepMap 100; 3 μm; Dionex-LC Packings). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min by using a water/acetonitrile gradient. For MALDI analysis, the column effluent was directly mixed with MALDI matrix (3 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1.1 μl/min via a μ-Tee fitting. Fractions were automatically deposited every 10 s onto a MALDI target plate (Applied Biosystems, Toronto, Canada) using a Probot microfraction collector. A total of 416 spots were collected from each HPLC run. MALDI plates were analyzed on a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a Nd:YAG laser operating at 200 Hz. All mass spectra were recorded in positive reflector mode and generated by accumulating data from 500 laser pulses in the mass range from m/z 750 to 6000. In the MSMS mode, collision-induced dissociation spectra of selected precursor ions were recorded at a collision energy of 1 kV and a collision gas pressure of ∼2 × 10-6 torr. Typically, spectra from 10,000 laser pulses were accumulated. Enzyme Assays-Distinct enzyme activities of PLP synthase can be separately measured by i.e. 1) the rate of glutamine hydrolysis by Pdx2, 2) the formation of the end product PLP, and 3) the formation of the chromophoric reaction intermediate (12Raschle T.

The mutant Pdx1 ΔW294 was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Basel, Switzerland) employing the oligonucleotides 5′-GCAAGAACGCGGCCTCGAGCACCACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGCTCGAGGCCGCGTTCTTGC-3′ as forward and reverse primer, respectively, and pETBsPdx1-His6 as the template. The Pdx1 Δ273–294 mutant was generated using the forward and reverse oligonucleotides, 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGGCTCAAACAGGTACTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAGCTCTTTTGACAACTCAGCG-3′, respectively, to amplify the DNA, with pETBsPdx1-His6 as the template. The fragment was cloned into the NheI/XhoI restriction sites of pET21a (EMD Biosciences) such that when expressed, a hexahistidine tag would be incorporated at the C terminus. Protein expression and purification, for both the native and hexahistidine-tagged proteins, were carried out as described in Ref. 3Raschle T. Amrhein N. Fitzpatrick T.B. J. Biol.

Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216496) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Partial Proteolytic Digestion-Thirty-two μg of Pdx1 was incubated with either 0.0005, 0.0028, or 0.005 μg of trypsin and, when indicated, Pdx2 H170N (30 μg) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 100 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. When present, ribose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and glutamine were each at a final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction was stopped by the addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). One-fifth of the reaction volume was utilized to monitor the progress of proteolytic cleavage by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The remainder of the reaction volume (80 μl) was dialyzed against 0.4% (v/v) formic acid overnight, and the size of the protein fragments was deduced from the latter sample by ESI-mass spectrometry (Waters quadrupole time-of-flight Ultima API, Milford, MA). Light Scattering-PLP synthase complex formation was monitored by changes in 90° scattered light intensity as described in Ref. 14Singh S.K. Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. The increase in scattered light intensity was measured at 23 °C on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer with excitation and emission monochromators set at 400 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were set to 2 nm. The increase in scattered light intensity was measured at an angle of 90° upon mixing equimolar concentrations of Pdx1 and Pdx2 H170N (1 μm) in 20 mm Tris-Cl and 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 1 mm glutamine. In order to relate these measurements with the observed changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, identical measurements were carried out following tryptophan fluorescence essentially as described above with the exception that 1 μm Pdx1 and Pdx2 H170N were used. Equilibrium Binding of B. subtilis Pdx1 and Pdx2-To date, the C terminus of Pdx1, the synthase component of the heteromeric PLP synthase, has escaped both structural and functional characterization. We recognized that PLP synthase from B. subtilis is a particularly amenable system to monitor perturbations in this region by fluorescence spectroscopy. This is because Pdx1 from this organism contains only a single tryptophan residue that is at the very C terminus, whereas its partner protein, Pdx2, does not have any tryptophan residues. Consequently, the tryptophan residue in Pdx1 is an ideal probe to monitor changes in the C-terminal region of the protein during complex formation and substrate binding. The fluorescence emission spectrum of Pdx1 shows a maximum at 350 nm upon excitation at 295 nm (Fig. 1A). Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the fluorescence is due to the single tryptophan residue (Fig. 1A). The Pdx1 fluorescence decreases 2.7% upon incubation with a 2-fold excess of Pdx2 H170N, whereas a 10-fold excess of Pdx2 H170N results in a 6% decrease in Pdx1 fluorescence (Fig. 1B). If in addition to a 2-fold excess of Pdx2 H170N, glutamine was added, a larger quenching of the Pdx1 fluorescence was observed (23%) with no readily apparent shift in the wavelength maximum (Fig. 1A). We therefore propose that the fluorescence signal may comprise two components; one is due to binding of Pdx2 H170N to Pdx1, and the other is due to a conformation of the Pdx1-Pdx2 complex that can only be reached when glutamine is bound to Pdx2 H170N. However, we noted that, depending on the preparation of Pdx2 H170N, the magnitude of the Pdx1 fluorescence decrease, without the addition of glutamine, varies slightly. We suspect that this is a result of Pdx2 H170N co-purifying with a small amount of glutamine, which does not dissociate from the protein under the conditions used. Based on these observations and the previously reported dissociation constant of 6.9 μm for the Pdx1-Pdx2 complex in the absence of glutamine (15Neuwirth M. Flicker K. Strohmeier M. Tews I. Macheroux P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we conclude that the association of Pdx1 with Pdx2 H170N causes only a fraction of the total fluorescence signal change, whereas the remaining larger contribution results from the allosteric effect of glutamine bound to Pdx2. Pdx2 H170N is unable to catalyze glutamine hydrolysis but binds glutamine in a dead-end Michaelis complex (5Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Tews I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19284-19289Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), resulting in an at least 23-fold increase in the affinity of Pdx2 for Pdx1 (15Neuwirth M. Flicker K. Strohmeier M. Tews I. Macheroux P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Titration of Pdx1 with Pdx2 H170N in the presence of added glutamine is characterized by a decrease in fluorescence intensity as a function of Pdx2 H170N concentration (Fig. 1C). Saturation occurs at a Pdx1 to Pdx2 H170N molar ratio of 0.82. The binding constant K could be estimated by titration of Pdx1 with Pdx2 H170N in the presence of added glutamine under nonsaturating conditions (Fig. 1D). A plot of the relative fluorescence change against the ligand concentration results in hyperbolic binding behavior, yielding a Kd of 0.42 ± 0.04 μm. This value is similar to the Kd of 0.3 μm determined by isothermal titration calorimetry under equivalent conditions (15Neuwirth M. Flicker K. Strohmeier M. Tews I. Macheroux P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Real Time Analysis of PLP Synthase Complex Assembly-The observed change in the intrinsic fluorescence of Pdx1 upon interaction with Pdx2 H170N in the presence of added glutamine can be used to determine the kinetics of PLP synthase complex assembly. In a stopped-flow setup, equimolar amounts of Pdx1 and Pdx2 H170N were rapidly mixed in the presence of glutamine, and either the intrinsic fluorescence change or the change in light scattering intensity at 400 nm was followed (Fig. 2A). The recorded fluorescence decrease coincides with an increase in light scattering intensity, indicating that the fluorescence time course indeed reports on complex formation. To obtain information on the involved individual rate constants, stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were performed under pseudo-first order conditions with an excess of Pdx2 H170N in the presence of added glutamine. The concentration dependence of the association reaction was analyzed by varying the Pdx2 H170N concentration (1.2–4.8 μm) while keeping the concentration of Pdx1 constant (0.3 μm). The time courses obtained under these conditions can be described by sums of exponentials. The association time courses display biphasic behavior and were analyzed by a double exponential fit (Fig. 2B). The fast and slow relaxation occurs in time windows that differ by about 1 order of magnitude. Their relaxation times are dependent on the concentration of Pdx2 H170N, as would be expected for a bimol"
https://openalex.org/W1997972447,"Many human diseases are caused by missense substitutions that result in misfolded proteins that lack biological function. Here we express a mutant form of the human cystathionine beta-synthase protein, I278T, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that it is possible to dramatically restore protein stability and enzymatic function by manipulation of the cellular chaperone environment. We demonstrate that Hsp70 and Hsp26 bind specifically to I278T but that these chaperones have opposite biological effects. Ethanol treatment induces Hsp70 and causes increased activity and steady-state levels of I278T. Deletion of the SSA2 gene, which encodes a cytoplasmic isoform of Hsp70, eliminates the ability of ethanol to restore function, indicating that Hsp70 plays a positive role in proper I278T folding. In contrast, deletion of HSP26 results in increased I278T protein and activity, whereas overexpression of Hsp26 results in reduced I278T protein. The Hsp26-I278T complex is degraded via a ubiquitin/proteosome-dependent mechanism. Based on these results we propose a novel model in which the ratio of Hsp70 and Hsp26 determines whether misfolded proteins will either be refolded or degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2081455193,"The C termini of beta-tubulin isotypes are regions of high sequence variability that bind to microtubule-associated proteins and motors and undergo various post-translational modifications such as polyglutamylation and polyglycylation. Crystallographic analyses have been unsuccessful in resolving tubulin C termini. Here, we used a stepwise approach to study the role of this region in microtubule assembly. We generated a series of truncation mutants of human betaI and betaIII tubulin. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with the mutants shows that mutants with deletions of up to 22 residues from betaIII and 16 from betaI can assemble normally. Interestingly, removal of the next residue (Ala(428)) results in a complete loss of microtubule formation without affecting dimer formation. C-terminal tail switching of human betaI and betaIII tubulin suggests that C-terminal tails are functionally equivalent. In short, residues outside of 1-429 of human beta-tubulins make no contribution to microtubule assembly. Ala(428), in the C-terminal sequence motif N-QQYQDA(428), lies at the end of helix H12 of beta-tubulin. We hypothesize that this residue is important for maintaining helix H12 structure. Deletion of Ala(428) may lead to unwinding of helix H12, resulting in tubulin dimers incapable of assembly. Thr(429) plays a more complex role. In the betaI isotype of tubulin, Thr(429) is not at all necessary for assembly; however, in the betaIII isotype, its presence strongly favors assembly. This result is consistent with a likely more complex function of betaIII as well as with the observation that evolutionary conservation is total for Ala(428) and frequent for Thr(429)."
https://openalex.org/W2030546850,"Glutamate transport is coupled to the co-transport of 3Na+ and 1H+ and the countertransport of 1 K+. However, the mechanism of how this process occurs is not well understood. The crystal structure of an archaeal homolog of the human glutamate transporters, GltPh, has provided the framework to begin to understand the mechanism of transport. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 is different from other subtypes in two respects. First, Li+ cannot support transport by EAAT2, whereas it can support transport by the other excitatory amino acid transporters, and second, EAAT2 is sensitive to a wider range of blockers than other subtypes. We have investigated the relationship between the cation driving transport and whether the glutamate analogues, l-anti-endo-3,4-methanopyrrolidine-dicarboxylic acid (MPDC) and (2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate (4MG), are substrates or blockers of transport. We have also investigated the molecular basis for these differences. EAAT2 has a Ser residue at position 441 with hairpin loop 2, whereas the corresponding residue in EAAT1 is a Gly residue. We demonstrate that if the transporter has a Ser residue at this position, then 4MG and MPDC are poor substrates in Na+, and Li+ cannot support transport of any substrate. Conversely, if the transporter has a Gly residue at this position, then in Na+ 4MG and MPDC are substrates with efficacy comparable with glutamate, but in Li+ 4MG and MPDC are poor substrates relative to glutamate.

Glutamate transport by the EAATs is coupled to the co-transport of 3Na+ and 1H+ and the countertransport of 1K+ (4Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), which provides sufficient energy to generate a 106-fold gradient of l-glutamate across the cell membrane. In addition to ion-coupled transport, the binding of Na+ and l-glutamate to the transporter activates an uncoupled chloride conductance, which has been proposed to play a variety of roles from regulating neuronal excitability to enhancing the concentrating capacity of the transporter (5Veruki M.L. Morkve S.H. Hartveit E. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Vandenberg R.J. Huang S. Ryan R.M. Channels. 2008; 2: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of Na+ permits a leak conductance that is also carried by chloride ions (7Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke C. J.

An understanding of the mechanism by which transporters utilize the energy derived from ion gradients to drive the movement of substrates against their concentration gradients is crucial to understanding how transporters work and how they regulate their cellular environment. In this study, we examined the relationship between the coupled cation and a series of substrates and substrate analogues. We have identified the structural basis that determines whether a compound acts as a substrate or a blocker. Crystal structures of an archaeal homolog of glutamate transporters, GltPh, have recently been determined in the presence and absence of substrates and also the blocker d l-threo-β-benzoyloxyaspartate (TBOA) (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), which have greatly enhanced our ability to address the question of how glutamate is transported. GltPh is an Na+-dependent aspartate transporter that also has an uncoupled chloride conductance (11Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). GltPh shares a remarkably high 37% amino acid sequence identity with the EAATs, with the degree of identity considerably higher in the substrate binding site (10Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). GltPh is a homotrimer, with the three protomers coming together to form an extracellular facing bowl-shaped complex. Each protomer consists of eight transmembrane (TM) domains and two helix-turn-helix motifs or hairpin loops, termed HP1 and HP2. The substrate (aspartate) binding site is formed by residues in TM7 and TM8 and the tips of HP1 and HP2. Two putative Na+ binding sites are in close proximity to the bound aspartate. The first is located beneath the aspartate molecule and is formed by backbone carbonyls of residues in TM7 and TM8 and a carboxyl group from Asp405 in TM8. The second is located above the binding site and is formed by backbone carbonyls from HP2 and TM7 (Fig. 1A). In the crystal structure of GltPh in complex with TBOA, the aspartate moiety of TBOA binds in the aspartate binding site, whereas the benzyl group props open HP2, preventing the formation of the second Na+ site. This suggests that the mechanism of TBOA inhibition is a combination of being too bulky to pass through the transporter and also preventing formation of the second Na+ site that is required for transport (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). (2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate (4MG) and l-anti-endo-3,4-methanopyrrolidine-dicarboxylic acid (MPDC) (Fig. 1B) are interesting compounds, because they are transported with similar efficacy to l-glutamate by EAAT1 but have been reported to be blockers of EAAT2 (12Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Bridges R.J. Kavanaugh M.P. Chamberlin A.R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 363-379PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there is a subtle difference between how these compounds bind to EAAT1 and EAAT2. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of GltPh, EAAT1, and EAAT2 in the HP2 region highlights an amino acid residue difference that lies in close proximity to both the substrate binding site and the second Na+ binding site (Fig. 1, A and C). We hypothesize that this residue difference is responsible for differences in cation selectivity between the transporters and that the specificity of cation interactions determines whether compounds, such as 4MG and MPDC, are substrates or blockers.

Mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild type and mutant transporters were linearized with SpeI and cRNA transcribed from the cDNA constructs with T7 RNA polymerase and capped with 5′-7-methylguanosine using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Oocytes were harvested from X. laevis, as previously described, with all procedures in accordance with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for the prevention of cruelty to animals. 50 nl of cRNA was injected into defoliculated, stage V oocytes and incubated at 16 °C in standard frog Ringer's solution (ND96; 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55), supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, 50 μg/ml gentamicin. 2-5 days later, current recordings were made using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the pCLAMP 10 suite of programs and interfaced with a MacLab 2e chart recorder (ADI Instruments, Sydney, Australia) using the Chart software (ADI Instruments). Current-voltage relationships were determined by subtraction of steady state current measurements in the absence of substrate (or blocker) during 100-ms pulses to membrane potentials from -100 to +60 mV (in 10-mV intervals) from current measurements in the presence of substrates and/or blockers. Data Analysis—The analysis of kinetic data was carried out using the Prism software version 4. Current (I) as a function of substrate concentration ([S]) was fitted by least-squares analysis to Equation 1, I/Imax = [S]/(EC50 + [S])(Eq. 1) where Imax represents the maximal current, EC50 is the concentration of substrate that generates a half-maximal current, and [S] is the concentration of substrate. Concentration-dependent inhibition of substrate-induced currents by blockers were fitted to Equation 2, I/Imax = 1 - ([B]/(IC50 + [B]))(Eq. 2) where [B] represents the concentration of the blocker, and IC50 is the concentration of blocker that generates half-maximal inhibition. It has previously been demonstrated that 4MG, threo-3-methylglutamate, TBOA, and kainate are competitive blockers of EAAT2 (12Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12329) Google Scholar). Ionic Currents Mediated by EAAT1 and EAAT2 in Na+ and Li+—EAAT1 and EAAT2 show distinct differences in pharmacology and cation dependence of transport. First, we compare the activities of l-glutamate, MPDC, and 4MG on EAAT1 in Na+- and Li+-based buffers, and then we compare these properties with those observed for EAAT2. Applications of MPDC or 4MG in Na+ to oocytes expressing EAAT1 generate inward currents of an amplitude comparable with that of l-glutamate (Fig. 2A), with K0.5 values of 22 ± 1 and 54 ± 17 μm, respectively (Table 1). These results are consistent with a number of previous studies (1Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. Mol.

In a Li+-based buffer, l-glutamate also generates concentration-dependent inward currents for EAAT1 but with an increased K0.5 of 365 ± 14 μm compared with 20 ± 3 μm in Na+ and a maximal current at -100 mV in Li+ of 15 ± 1% of that measured in Na+. The activity of MPDC on EAAT1 in Li+ shows striking differences compared with its activity in Na+. In Na+, MPDC generates transport currents with an Imax of 26 ± 2% of that for l-glutamate, but in Li+ MPDC does not generate transport currents (Fig. 2, A and B). At membrane potentials less than -60 mV, MPDC generates small concentration-dependent outward currents, and at positive membrane potentials, the current is inward (Fig. 2B). This current voltage profile is more akin to MPDC blocking a leak current. Co-application of increasing concentrations of MPDC with a fixed concentration of glutamate reduces the amplitude of the glutamate transport current (Fig. 2C). Thus, in Li+, MPDC acts as a blocker of glutamate transport by EAAT1, whereas in Na+ it is a substrate (Fig. 2, A and B). By way of comparison, application of the non-selective transporter blocker, TBOA, in Li+ generated a current-voltage profile similar to that of MPDC (Fig. 2B) and also blocked l-glutamate transport currents (Fig. 2C).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for EAAT1, EAAT2, and mutants in Na+ and Li+LigandEAAT1/Na+EAAT1G442S/Na+KmKiaKi values for blockers were calculated from IC50 values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, assuming competitive antagonism (12, 14).ImaxbImax values for substrates are relative to l-glutamate.KmKiImaxμmμmμmμmGlutamate20 ± 3cAll values presented are the mean ± S.E. with n = 4-12.10036 ± 31004MG54 ± 1780 ± 517 ± 29 ± 1MPDC22 ± 126 ± 213 + 25 + 0TBOA2.8 ± 0.36.2 ± 0.4EAAT2/Na+EAAT2S441G/Na+KmKiImaxKmKiImaxμmμmμmμmGlutamate18 ± 31000.6 ± 0.11004MGdApplications of MPDC and 4MG in Na+ to oocytes expressing EAAT2 generate small transport currents that are 4.8 ± 0.4 and 2.8 ± 0.9% of that for glutamate.

Open table in a new tab The actions of 4MG on EAAT1 in Li+ are more complex than that of l-glutamate or TBOA and MPDC and are likely to be a result of a mixture of currents. In Na+, glutamate and 4MG activate significant uncoupled chloride conductances, which are most easily observed as outward currents at positive membrane potentials (2Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 17Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In Li+, glutamate generates inward currents at membrane potentials up to +50 mV (Fig. 2C), which suggests that the substrate-activated anion current is reduced in Li+ (see supplemental material). In Li+, 4MG generates concentration-dependent inward currents of increasing magnitude at negative membrane potentials. However, instead of approaching zero current at positive membrane potentials, as observed for l-glutamate, larger inward currents are generated, with the current voltage plot showing a bell-shaped curve (Fig. 2D). The amplitude of the maximal inward current at positive membrane potentials is not as great as observed for MPDC and TBOA. Furthermore, co-application of increasing 4MG concentrations with a fixed l-glutamate concentration decreased the amplitude of the l-glutamate currents at negative potentials and increased the amplitude at positive potentials (Fig. 2E). These observations could be explained by the following. In Li+ there is standing leak current, which can be observed by application of TBOA or MDPC (see supplemental material for a fuller discussion of this point). Application of l-glutamate blocks the leak current but also generates a significant transport current and activates the uncoupled anion current. At negative membrane potentials, the transport currents dominate the measurements, but at positive membrane potentials, the amplitude of the substrate-activated anion current is equivalent to the amplitude of the blocked leak current, and the current appears to approach a stable level. In the case of 4MG in Li+, it is a partial substrate, and at negative membrane potentials, the amplitude of the transport current is greatly reduced compared with l-glutamate, such that it is comparable with the amplitude of the blocked leak current. At positive membrane potentials, the amplitude of the 4MG-activated anion current is reduced, and the amplitude of the blocked leak current is comparatively larger, resulting in a larger inward current. Finally, for TBOA and MPDC, which act as blockers of transport and of the leak current in Li+, application of maximal concentrations of these compounds (in the absence of l-glutamate) shows the true amplitude of the leak current (Fig. 2B). EAAT2 shows differences in pharmacology and ion dependence of transport compared with EAAT1. First, in Na+, MPDC and 4MG have been reported to be blockers of EAAT2 (when measured at -60 mV), but if we measure MPDC- and 4MG-induced currents at -100 mV, they induce inward currents that are 4.8 ± 0.4 and 2.8 ± 0.9% of the current generated by l-glutamate, respectively (Fig. 3A). This suggests that at -100 mV, these compounds are not blockers but rather are poor substrates. Given the amplitudes of these currents, it is not possible to characterize their kinetics when acting as a substrate. The current-voltage plots for MPDC and 4MG in EAAT2 are bell-shaped (Fig. 3B) and show similarities to that observed for these compounds acting on EAAT1 in Li+ (Fig. 2D), suggesting that they also block a standing leak current. Co-application of MPDC and 4MG with l-glutamate causes concentration-dependent reductions in the l-glutamate-elicited currents, with Ki values of 0.20 ± 0.02 and 3.4 ± 0.2 μm, respectively (Table 1). Second, Li+ cannot substitute for Na+ in supporting transport of l-glutamate (or other substrates) by EAAT2 (Fig. 3A). For additional details on the pharmacological differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2, see the supplemental material. Below we have exploited the pharmacological and ionic differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2 to better understand the molecular basis for ion coupling of transport and how this impacts on whether 4MG and MPDC are substrates, blockers, or poor substrates. Molecular Basis for an Active Transport Complex—In HP2 of EAAT2 there is a Ser residue at position 441, and the corresponding residue in EAAT1 is a Gly residue. Zhang et al. (18Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that mutation of the Ser to a Gly in the rat equivalent of human EAAT2 allows the transporter to use Li+ to drive transport and also reduces the affinity for the EAAT2-selective blocker, dihydrokainate. In the crystal structure of GltPh, this Ser/Gly residue is positioned between the substrate (near the third carbon of aspartate) and the second Na+ ion binding site (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The proximity of this residue to both the substrate and cation binding site prompted us to investigate whether this differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2, which is likely to influence differences in cation selectivity (18Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), is also responsible for determining whether MPDC and 4MG are substrates, blockers, or poor substrates and also how the driving cation influences these properties. Application of l-glutamate to oocytes expressing EAAT2S441G generates inward currents at -100 mV (Fig. 4). The K0.5 for l-glutamate generated currents is 0.6 ± 0.1 μm, which is 33-fold lower than for EAAT2 (Table 1). The maximal current generated by the mutant was also reduced compared with EAAT2, with maximal currents in the 15-50 nA range, compared with 100-250 nA for EAAT2. In contrast to EAAT2, MPDC and 4MG are transported by EAAT2S441G with an efficacy similar to that for l-glutamate (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Thus, this mutation changes the pharmacology of 4MG and MPDC from being poor substrates to substrates of similar efficacy to l-glutamate and generates a transporter with a phenotype very similar to that of EAAT1. We also investigated the reverse mutation in EAAT1, G442S. Glutamate generates similar transport currents in EAAT1G442S compared with that of EAAT1 (Fig. 4), with a K0.5 of 36 ± 3 μm and maximal currents similar to that of EAAT1. The reverse mutation switched the pharmacology of MPDC and 4MG to that observed for EAAT2. The Imax values for MPDC and 4MG were reduced to 4.7 ± 0.2 and 9 ± 1% of the l-glutamate Imax, respectively, as opposed to 26 ± 2 and 80 ± 5% for EAAT1 (Table 1). In comparison, the equivalent relative Imax values for EAAT2 are 4.8 ± 0.4 and 2.8 ± 0.9%, respectively. Thus, the Ser for Gly difference is crucial in determining pharmacological differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2. The EAAT2S441G Mutation Alters Na+ Coupling and the Mechanisms of Action of 4MG and MPDC—It appears that the mechanisms of action of MPDC and 4MG are dependent upon the cation driving transport and also the nature of the amino acid residue in HP2 at position 442 in EAAT1 and the corresponding residue in EAAT2. To investigate further this link between the driving cation and whether an active transport complex is formed, we investigated how changing the driving cation in the mutant transporters influences the mode of action of l-glutamate, MPDC, and 4MG. First, although Li+ cannot substitute for Na+ in allowing l-glutamate transport by the wild type EAAT2 (Fig. 4), Li+ can support l-glutamate transport by EAAT2S441G, generating a current at -100 mV that is 38 ± 1% of that generated in Na+. As mentioned above, in Na+, MPDC and 4MG are substrates of the EAAT2S441G mutant, but if the driving cation is changed to Li+, 4MG and MPDC revert to being transport blockers (Fig. 4), with Ki values for the block of l-glutamate transporter of 1.7 ± 0.5 and 0.34 ± 0.03 μm, respectively (Table 1). For the reverse mutant EAAT1G442S, Li+ cannot support transport of l-glutamate, 4MG, or MPDC, which is similar to that observed for EAAT2 in Li+. Thus, the Ser for Gly difference in HP2 is responsible for the differences in pharmacology between EAAT1 and EAAT2 and also how the driving cation influences the pharmacology. In this study, we have utilized MPDC, 4MG, and Li+ as molecular probes of the substrate and Na+ binding sites and have exploited the subtle pharmacological and amino acid sequence differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2 to investigate how substrate and ion transport are coupled. For EAAT1, Li+ can partially substitute for Na+ in driving the transport of l-glutamate but not transport of MPDC. MPDC changes from being a substrate in Na+ to being a blocker in Li+. The amino acid sequences of EAAT1, EAAT2, and GltPh are closely related in the substrate and ion binding regions (Fig. 1), but there is a Ser residue in EAAT2 within the loop region between HP2a and HP2b, whereas the corresponding residue in GltPh and the other EAATs is a Gly. This Gly for Ser difference has previously been investigated using the rat equivalent of human EAAT2 (19Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and it was found that the S440G mutation reduced the affinity of the EAAT2-selective blocker, dihydrokainate, and also allowed Li+ to drive transport. Two previous studies have also demonstrated that the affinity of Na+ for the transporter is dependent upon the substrate being transported (20Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which provided hints of a link between substrate/blocker interactions and Na+ binding. These observations provide us with the tools to investigate the specificity of the coupling process and why compounds such as MPDC and 4MG are very good substrates for EAAT1 and are either blockers or poor substrates of EAAT2. The results presented in this study show that if the transporter has a Gly residue at position 441/442, then Na+ can drive transport of MPDC or 4MG, but in Li+ they are blockers. Conversely, if the residue is a Ser, then in Na+, MPDC and 4MG are either blockers or very poor substrates (3-5% of the transport activity of l-glutamate; Table 1), and in Li+, transport of all substrates is severely impaired. Thus, the combination of the residue at position 441/442 and the structure of the ligand influences cation specificity, and this in turn determines whether a compound is a blocker or a substrate. A question that arises from these results is whether the differences in activity of MPDC and 4MG can be attributed to differences in cation selectivity at all three cation binding sites or just one or two of the sites. Since a single point mutation can bring about the change in activity of these compounds, the simplest interpretation of the data is that the changes can be attributed to just one of the three cation binding sites. So which Na+ site is likely to be responsible for the switch in the coupling process? In the crystal structure of l-aspartate bound to GltPh, the second Na+ ion is coordinated by backbone carbonyls of Ser349, Ile350, and Thr352 from HP2 and Thr308 from TM7a (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The Ser/Gly residue in HP2 that is responsible for conferring differences in MPDC action and cation coupling (Gly354 in GltPh) lies between the bound aspartate molecule and the second Na+ site and provides a plausible link between cation binding and whether an active transport complex is formed. In the study by Boudker et al. (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that TBOA prevents the formation of the second Na+ site by restricting the movement of HP2. Thus, a plausible explanation for the results in this study is that if the transporter has a Ser in the HP2 loop, then the HP2 movements may be more restricted than if a Gly residue is present. These differences in the degree of movement of HP2 may impact on the specificity of cation coupling and, as a consequence, the pharmacological actions of compounds such as MPDC and 4MG. Other residues have also been implicated in binding of Na+ (22Tao Z. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Tao Z. Zhang Z. Grewer C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 28680-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but none of these additional sites are likely to be in close proximity to the Ser/Gly residue investigated in this study. However, one of the important differences between GltPh and the EAATs is that l-glutamate transport by the EAATs is coupled to the co-transport of three Na+ ions (4Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), whereas in GltPh only two Na+ binding sites have been located (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Until we have a complete picture of the three Na+ sites in a human glutamate transporter, we can only infer that it is the second Na+ site, as defined by Boudker et al. (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which is directly linked to the determination of pharmacological activity and coupling to the transport process. In summary, we have demonstrated that a single amino acid difference between EAAT1 and EAAT2 is responsible for determining differences in cation selectivity between the transporters and that the specificity of cation interactions determines whether compounds, such as 4MG and MPDC, are substrates or blockers.

We have assessed changes in the overall exposure of these proteins to surrounding lipids by quantifying the extent of protein labeling by a photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine analog 1-palmitoyl-2-[9-[2′-[125I]iodo-4′-(trifluoromethyldiazirinyl)-benzyloxycarbonyl]-nonaoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([125I]TID-PC/16) under different conditions.

This decrease in labeling matches qualitatively the decrease in transmembrane surface exposed to the solvent calculated from crystallographic data for SERCA structures. 2) Labeling of PMCA incubated with Ca2+ and calmodulin decreases by approximately the same amount. However, incubation with Ca2+ alone increases labeling by more than 50%. Addition of C28, a peptide that prevents activation of PMCA by calmodulin, yields similar results. C28 has also been shown to inhibit ATPase SERCA activity. Interestingly, incubation of SERCA with C28 also increases [125I]TID-PC/16 incorporation to the protein. These results suggest that in both proteins there are two different E1 conformations as follows: one that is auto-inhibited and is in contact with a higher amount of lipids (Ca2+ + C28 for SERCA and Ca2+ alone for PMCA), and one in which the enzyme is fully active (Ca2+ for SERCA and Ca2+-calmodulin for PMCA) and that exhibits a more compact transmembrane arrangement.

We are interested in obtaining structural information about the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA). This pump is an integral part of the Ca2+ signaling mechanism (8Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is highly regulated by calmodulin, which activates this protein by binding to an auto-inhibitory region and changing the conformation of the pump from an inhibited state to an activated one (8Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Corradi G.R. Adamo H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35440-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Crystallization of PMCA is particularly challenging because there is no natural source from which this protein can be obtained in large quantities. Moreover, the presence of several isoforms in the same tissue further complicates efforts to obtain a homogeneous sample suitable for crystallization. Information about the structure and assembly of the transmembrane domain of an integral membrane protein can also be obtained from the analysis of the lipid-protein interactions. In this work, we have used a hydrophobic photolabeling method to study the noncovalent interactions between PMCA and the surrounding phospholipids under different experimental conditions that lead to known conformations. We employed the photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine analog 1-palmitoyl-2-[9-[2′-[125I]iodo-4′-(trifluoromethyldiazirinyl)-benzyloxycarbonyl]-nonaoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([125I]TID-PC/16) that has been previously used to analyze lipid-protein interfaces (10Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 12Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This reagent is located in the phospholipidic milieu, and upon photolysis it reacts indiscriminately with its molecular neighbors. It is thus possible to directly analyze the interaction between a membrane protein and lipids belonging to its immediate environment (13Durrer P. Galli C. Hoenke S. Corti C. Gluck R. Vorherr T.

Biophys. 2006; 44: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). By measuring the amount of labeling of SERCA in conditions that promote conformations for which there are well resolved crystal structures, we were able to validate this photolabeling approach as a convenient tool for analyzing conformational changes within transmembrane regions. Furthermore, using this technique on PMCA and comparing the results obtained for SERCA, we were able to draw structural conclusions about these proteins under activated and inhibited states. Reagents—All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and purchased mostly from Sigma. Recently drawn human blood for the isolation of PMCA was obtained from the Hematology Section of the Hospital de Clínicas General San Martín and from Fundación Fundosol (Argentina). Blood donation in Argentina is voluntary, and therefore the donor provides informed consent for the donation of blood and for the subsequent legitimate use of the blood by the transfusion service. Purification of PMCA from Human Erythrocytes—PMCA was isolated from calmodulin-depleted erythrocyte membranes by the calmodulin-affinity chromatography procedure (16Filomatori C.V. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane proteins were solubilized in a 0.5% C12E10-containing buffer. After centrifugation the supernatant was loaded into a Sepharose-calmodulin column in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. The column was thoroughly washed with 0.05% C12E10-containing buffer. PMCA was eluted in 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.005% C12E10, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-K, pH 7.4, 4 °C, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol and stored in the same buffer. It has been demonstrated previously that both the conformation and the activity of the protein are preserved in either solubilized or reconstituted purified preparation compared with that located in the erythrocyte (16Filomatori C.V. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentration after purification was about 10 μg/ml. No phospholipids were added at any step along the purification procedure. By measuring inorganic phosphate (see under “Phospholipid Quantification”), we estimated that less than 1 mol of natural phospholipids per mol of PMCA is present in the purified enzyme. The purification procedure described preserves transport activity and maintains the kinetic properties and regulatory characteristics of the enzyme in its native milieu (16Filomatori C.V. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SERCA Preparation—SERCA was directly solubilized with C12E10 (0.5%) from sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes (prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (17Andersen J.P. Lassen K. Moeller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This sample was diluted 100 times in a medium containing 20% (w/v) glycerol, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-K, pH 7.4, 4 °C, 2 mm EGTA. Protein concentration after dilution was 10 μg/ml. Measurement of Ca2+-ATPase Activity—Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C as the initial velocity of release of Pi from ATP as described previously (16Filomatori C.V. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The incubation medium was 7 nm PMCA, 120 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 140 μm soybean phospholipids, 800 μm C12E10, and 2 mm ATP (pH 7.4, and [Ca2+] = 140 μm). Release of Pi was estimated according to the procedure of Fiske and SubbaRow (18Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 179: 66-71Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in a Jasco V-630 Bio spectrophotometer. Preparation of [125I]TID-PC/16—TTD-PC/16 (tin precursor) was a kind gift of Dr. J. Brunner (ETHZentrum, Zürich, Switzerland). [125I]TID-PC/16 was prepared by radioiodination of its tin precursor according to Weber and Brunner (12Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After the reaction was completed, the mixture was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and [125I]TID-PC/16 was purified by passage through a silica gel column (2.5 ml) using chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (65:25:4:1, v/v) as solvent. The elution was monitored by TLC/autoradiography, and the fractions containing the product were dried and stored at –20 °C. Phospholipid Quantification—Phospholipid concentration was measured according to Chen et al. (19Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5835) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Samples and standards containing 10–100 nmol of phosphorus were dried by heating at 100 °C. Mineralization was carried out by adding 0.1 ml of HNO3, 0.9 ml of HClO4 and incubating at 190 °C for 30 min. Inorganic phosphate was determined after Fiske and SubbaRow (18Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 179: 66-71Google Scholar). Labeling Procedure—A dried film of the photoactivatable reagent was suspended in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/C12E10 mixed micelles containing 10 μg/ml of the membrane protein. The samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C before being irradiated for 15 min with light from a filtered UV source (λ ≈ 360 nm). Radioactivity and Protein Determination—Electrophoresis was performed according to the Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE method (20Schaegger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Polypeptides were stained with Coomassie Blue R; the isolated bands were excised from the gel, and the incorporation of radioactivity was directly measured on a gamma counter. The amount of protein was quantified by eluting each stained band, as described previously (21Ball E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 26-27Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), including serum albumin in each gel as a standard for protein quantification. Specific incorporation was calculated as the ratio between measured radioactivity and amount of protein determined for each band. Proteolysis of PMCA—Proteolysis of PMCA was performed for 3 min in the presence of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, 100 μm free Ca2+, and 0.22 μg/ml TLCK-treated chymotrypsin (stored as a stock in dimethylformamide). The reaction was stopped by a 10-fold excess of ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor solution at 4 °C. Immunoblotting—The slabs obtained after SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) microporous membrane (Immobilon) by means of a semi-dry electroblotting system as described by Lauriére (22Lauriére M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Before immunostaining, the Immobilon sheets were treated with blocking solution and then incubated with appropriate dilutions of the primary antibodies (see below) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the streptavidin-phosphatase conjugate anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) were added for 1 h; this step was followed by rinsing. Color development was obtained using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma). Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies used here were raised against different regions of human erythrocyte Ca2+ pump, i.e. 5F10 recognizes the central region (residues 719–738), JA9 the N terminus (residues 51–75), and JA3 the C terminus (residues 1156–1180). The numbering of residues corresponds to human PMCA4b. Specificity was demonstrated by their reaction with the purified enzyme in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system and by their staining in a Western blot (23Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14244-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of SERCA Structure and Accessible Surface Area—The crystal structures used for comparison were as follows: PDB code 1iwo (3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), PDB code 1su4 (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), and PDB code 2ear (1Takahashi M. Kondou Y. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5800-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The transmembrane regions were taken as explicitly defined in Uniprot for sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2, accession number P20647. The ASA of the transmembrane helices was calculated with MolMol (26Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar, 27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) with a solvent radio of 1.4 Å. Superposition of crystal structures was performed with POSA (28Ye Y. Adam G. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Data—All measurements were performed in triplicate to quintuplicate unless is specified in the figures. SDS gels presented under “Results” were chosen as representative of at least three independent experiments. [125I]TID-PC/16 was previously used to identify and characterize regions within membrane proteins that interact with lipids (12Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Durrer P. Galli C. Hoenke S. Corti C. Gluck R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13417-13421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This reagent is a PC analog endowed with a photoactivatable group at the end of one of the fatty acyl chains (Fig. 1). Its physicochemical behavior is indistinguishable from that of PC, i.e. it shows identical mobility on TLC plates using different solvent systems (data not shown). Moreover, its interaction with transmembrane regions has been shown to be identical to that of PC (14Villamil Giraldo A.M. Castello P.R. González Flecha F.L. Moeller J.V. Delfino J.M. Rossi J.P.F.C. FEBS. 2006; 580: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Villamil Giraldo A.M. Castello P.R. González Flecha F.L. Delfino J.M. Rossi J.P.F.C. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 44: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Additionally, regarding membrane protein-lipid interactions PC is considered the least selective lipid (29Marsh D. Horvath L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 267-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In other words, transmembrane regions are expected to behave as an homogeneous surface displaying no specific binding sites for this phospholipid. This fact simplifies the interpretation of our results, allowing for a direct correlation between level of [125I]TID-PC/16 incorporation and amount of protein surface exposed to surrounding lipids. We have chosen SERCA as the P-type ATPase paradigm because a well defined three-dimensional structure is available for most of its conformations (1Takahashi M. Kondou Y. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5800-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 4Toyoshima C. Mizutani T.

Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Analysis of the results will be based on the SERCA reaction cycle proposed by de Meis and Vianna (30de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2. The cycle starts with binding of Ca2+ to E1. E1Ca is represented by the structure known as PDB code 1su4 (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). E1Ca binds ATP. E1Ca-ATP is represented by the PDB code 1vfp (4Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) structure. The release of ADP leads to E1PCa. The structure of E1PCa is known as PDB code 3ba6 (5Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.M.L. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Moller J.V. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Conformational transition and release of two Ca2+ ions to the lumen yields E2P, represented by the PDB code 3b9b (5Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.M.L. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Moller J.V. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) structure. Finally, E2 conformation (stabilized by the inhibitor thapsigargin) is represented by PDB code structures 2ear (1Takahashi M. Kondou Y. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5800-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and 1iwo (3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The most striking rearrangement in protein structure occurs when the enzyme binds Ca2+, i.e. between 2ear (E2TG) and 1su4 (E1Ca). The different assembly of transmembrane segments in these conformations results in a decrease of the protein average exposure to surrounding lipids whenever Ca2+ is present. The extent of interaction between SERCA and membrane lipids under each condition was quantified by calculating the accessible surface area (ASA) of the transmembrane region. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Accessible surface area of SERCA transmembrane regionCrystal structureConditionASARelative hydrophobicityConformationÅ2%2earTg + EGTA8701100E21iwoTg + EGTA823594.6E23b9bBeF4-816493.8E21su4Ca2+711481.7E11vfpCa2+ + AMPPCP729583.8E13ba6E1PCa735084.5E1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows the specific incorporation of [125I]TID-PC to SERCA in the presence of EGTA, Ca2+, and EGTA and thapsigargin. The extent of protein labeling measured in the presence of calcium was lower than that found in the presence of EGTA and considerably lower than that measured in the presence of EGTA and thapsigargin. This experimental result is in qualitative agreement with the predicted lipid-exposed area of the protein under each condition based on ASA calculations (Table 1). The effect of thapsigargin is probably the result of the stabilization of the enzyme in E2, i.e. under this condition SERCA is quantitatively fixed in a unique conformation. Indeed, it has only been possible to obtain SERCA crystals in the presence of EGTA provided that thapsigargin is also present. Effect of Ca2+ and Calmodulin—Because experiments with SERCA show that the incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 yields the results expected according to ASA calculations, we decided to quantify the amount of labeling of PMCA (for which no crystal structures are yet available) in different conditions. Fig. 4 shows that [125I]TID-PC/16 binds to PMCA in different amounts according to the conformational state of the enzyme. In the presence of Ca2+, the incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 is nearly 50% higher than the incorporation of the reagent in the absence of this ion. This result is opposite to that obtained for SERCA under identical conditions and indicates that in PMCA the amount of area directly exposed to membrane lipids increases upon Ca2+ binding. The effect of 1.6 μm calmodulin on the incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 to PMCA is also shown. Labeling in the presence of calmodulin was carried out either in the presence of EGTA or in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+. The amount of labeling of PMCA in the presence of EGTA and calmodulin is identical to that obtained in the presence of EGTA alone. Under this condition in which no binding of calmodulin to PMCA occurs, a possible sequestering effect of the reagent by calmodulin is tested. Binding of calmodulin to the enzyme dramatically reduces the extent of protein labeling to about 52% of the labeling in the presence of Ca2+ alone, indicating that in this condition PMCA exhibits less lipid exposure than in any other conformational state. This behavior is similar to that observed for SERCA after addition of Ca2+ that leads E2 to E1. This suggests that regarding the transmembrane domain, the PMCA conformation in which the enzyme is no longer auto-inhibited, i.e. in the presence of calmodulin and Ca2+, is similar to that adopted by SERCA after addition of Ca2+ alone. Ca2+ concentration used in these labeling experiments was similar to that routinely used for Ca2+-ATPase measurements. Experiments performed under the same conditions but lowering Ca2+ concentration to 1 μm yielded identical results to those shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, Mg2+ failed to mimic the effects observed with Ca2+, i.e. protein labeling in the presence of 3.75 mm Mg2+ was indistinguishable from that determined in the presence of EGTA. This evidence strongly supports the specificity of the effects exerted by Ca2+ on the extent of protein labeling. In addition, Fig. 4 shows the effect of removal of the PMCA C terminus by proteolysis with TLCK-chymotrypsin. It is well known that proteolysis of PMCA by chymotrypsin yields a pump that is fully active lacking the C-terminal region, and hence does not bind calmodulin. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the SDS-PAGE of the experiment. An immunoblot of the truncated PMCA (data not shown) reveals that JA3, a monoclonal antibody raised against residues 1156–1180, did not react with the truncated protein indicating the complete removal of the C terminus. In the presence of EGTA, the level of reagent incorporation to truncated PMCA is indistinguishable from that obtained under the same condition for the undigested enzyme. On the other hand, Ca2+ decreased the incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 in the truncated PMCA to 83%. This result indicates that cleavage of the calmodulin binding region of PMCA mimics not only its activation by calmodulin but also the effect of calmodulin on the incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 in its transmembrane domain. Effect of C28—To further explore the structural relationship between the level of exposure to phospholipids and activation by calmodulin, we assayed the effect of C28, a peptide made after the sequence of the calmodulin binding domain of PMCA. Fig. 5 shows that, as reported previously (31Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17120-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), C28 inhibits with high affinity the calmodulin activation of PMCA. This behavior is interpreted as the consequence of C28 binding to calmodulin, which preserves an auto-inhibited conformation of PMCA. In such conditions, C28 also reverts the effect of calmodulin on [125I]TID-PC/16 incorporation to PMCA. It has also been reported that at micromolar concentrations, C28 partially inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase activity of SERCA (31Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17120-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the presence of C28 results not only in the described inhibitory effect on SERCA activity but also in an almost 20% increment of [125I]TID-PC/16 incorporation. This result suggests that indeed C28 is able to promote an inhibited conformation in SERCA analogous to the one observed in PMCA in the absence of calmodulin. Effect of Other Ligands—Table 2 summarizes the relative incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 in the presence of different ligands, both in SERCA and in PMCA.TABLE 2Relative incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16ConditionSERCAPMCAConformationSpecific incorporationConformationSpecific incorporationEGTAE2100 ± 3E2100 ± 3EGTA + TGE2151 ± 10E2100 ± 3EGTA + CaME2NDE299 ± 3EGTA + C28E298 ± 3E299 ± 3EGTA + vanadateE297 ± 5E2100 ± 7Ca2+E175 ± 4E1I155 ± 2Ca2+ + CaME170 ± 7E1A80 ± 2Ca2+ + CaM + C28E1INDE1I144 ± 3Ca2+ + C28E1I117 ± 3E1I150 ± 9Ca2+ + TGE1; E291 ± 3E1I154 ± 8Ca2+ + LaIIIE1NDE1I156 ± 4Ca2+ + ATP + LaIIIE1P89 ± 4E1P155 ± 8Ca2+ + vanadateE1; E292 ± 3E1; E2125 ± 9 Open table in a new tab From the observation of Table 2 we can draw the following conclusions. 1) Ca2+ has opposite effects on SERCA and PMCA when compared with pumps that had been labeled in the presence of EGTA or EGTA and thapsigargin. In SERCA Ca2+ decreases the amount of labeling, whereas in the case of PMCA it increases it. 2) Addition of calmodulin and Ca2+ (CaM + Ca2+) to PMCA decreases the amount of labeling in manner similar to how Ca2+ does to SERCA. 3) Addition of C28 to SERCA produces a larger level of incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16, in a way similar to the effect of Ca2+ on PMCA in the absence of calmodulin. 4) Addition of La3+ and Ca2+ increases the labeling as Ca2+ alone does. 5) Finally, addition of La3+ + Ca2+ and ATP, a condition that blocks the interconversion between E1P and E2P (32Lutherbacher S. Schatzmann H.J. Experientia (Basel). 1983; 39: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), yields the same amount of labeling as Ca2+ alone. This suggests that E1P, the conformation stabilized by La3+ and ATP, has similar exposition to phospholipids than E1CaI. La3+ alone was not tested in SERCA. Finally, vanadate has no effect on the incorporation if [125I]TID-PC/16 in the absence of Ca2+, and in the presence of Ca2+ has opposite effects in SERCA and PMCA. In SERCA, it increases the level of incorporation when compared with Ca2+ alone, and in the case of PMCA it decreases the incorporation level, again, when compared with Ca2+ alone. These results are consistent with the idea that vanadate partially antagonizes the effects of Ca2+ (33Rossi J.P. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 648: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

We have developed a methodological approach based on the use of a photoactivatable probe to study the structure of the transmembrane region of PMCA in different conformations. By quantifying the amount of labeling by [125I]TID-PC/16, we were able to estimate the differential interaction of PMCA conformers with surrounding phospholipids. The procedure is validated by making comparisons with the known crystal structures of SERCA, for which a well defined three-dimensional structure is available (1Takahashi M. Kondou Y. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5800-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A major structural difference between SERCA and PMCA is the presence of a C-terminal auto-inhibitory region in the latter. Activation of PMCA by calmodulin has been explained by binding of this protein to the C-terminal end, thus removing the inhibitory interactions from the cytosolic core. It should be noted that this hypothesis for auto-inhibition does not predict changes in the transmembrane region. However, the results in this paper show for the first time that the auto-inhibited conformation is a distinct one (at least in the E1Ca phase of the PMCA reaction cycle) and that the conformational changes induced by auto-inhibition do expose additional surfaces to phospholipids. Because the vast majority of phospholipids present in our experiments is phosphatidylcholine and the photoactivatable reagent used is a phosphatidylcholine analog, no higher affinity sites are expected to be sensed under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the possibility that upon Ca2+ binding sites with different affinity for phospholipids are either exposed or buried cannot be ruled out. Efforts are currently underway in our laboratory to explore this alternative. It is worth noting that although PMCA has specific sites for acidic phospholipids (35Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11800-11805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no such sites have been identified for neutral phospholipids. The auto-inhibited conformation was also obtained by adding the calmodulin-binding peptide C28 to an E1Ca-CaM state of PMCA, showing the reversibility of the conformational transition (36Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Caride A.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2009-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Calmodulin-binding peptides from related transporters have shown to inhibit SERCA as well (31Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17120-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that addition of C28 in conditions in which this peptide inhibits SERCA also induces an increase in [125I]TID-PC/16 labeling in this pump as well. This fact suggests that C28 can induce an inhibitory conformation like the one present in PMCA in the absence of calmodulin. This evidence allows us to propose the existence of two different E1 conformations as follows: E1I is the auto-inhibited PMCA and E1A is the activated one (in the presence of calmodulin or after removing the C-terminal tail by controlled proteolysis). In this sense, the E1A is the conformation naturally present in SERCA. Addition of C28 to SERCA mimics the E1I conformation present in the auto-inhibited PMCA. It is noteworthy that a short hydrophilic peptide like C28 drives a profound change at the hydrophobic transmembrane region. It is interesting to analyze the effects of two inhibitors of PMCA, La3+ and vanadate. La3+ is known to stabilize E1Ca, and in the presence of ATP it blocks the reaction cycle in E1P (32Lutherbacher S. Schatzmann H.J. Experientia (Basel). 1983; 39: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that La3+ and ATP produce the same level of incorporation than Ca2+ alone suggests that the transmembrane arrangement of E1P is similar to the one of E1Ca (E1I). On the other hand, early experiments on the kinetics of vanadate inhibition showed that it is antagonized by Ca2+ (33Rossi J.P. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 648: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a result consistent with the idea of Ca2+ and vanadate binding to alternate conformations. In addition, vanadate binds to the E2 conformation of SERCA, and thus the apparent vanadate affinity also depends upon the El to E2 equilibrium. The intermediate level of reagent incorporation measured in the presence of vanadate and Ca2+ is indeed indicative of the coexistence of E1 and E2 states. In conclusion, by detecting differences in the access of the photoactivatable probe [125I]TID-PC/16 to both PMCA and SERCA, we were able to assess lipid exposure of the transmembrane domain of well characterized kinetic intermediates. Moreover, we were able to uncover the involvement of the transmembrane region in the auto-inhibition of PMCA. Remarkably, we found out a similar conformational state generated by C28 in SERCA. We are greatly indebted to Dr. J. Brunner, Department of Biochemistry, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETHZ), Zürich, Switzerland, for the kind gift of TTD-PC/16 (tin precursor) and to Dr. Delia Takara from the School of Dentistry, Buenos Aires University, for the generous gift of purified SERCA."

Recently, herpesvirus glycoprotein G (gG) was identified as a member of the vCKBP-4 subfamily. The structural domains of gG important for binding to chemokines and biological activity, however, are unknown. Here, we used equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) as a model to determine residues in EHV-1 gG that are involved in the processes of chemokine binding and interaction with target cells. First, comprehensive analysis of glycosylation of EHV-1 gG revealed that N-glycosylation is not required for binding of gG to chemokines but is essential for biological activity of the protein. Second, the epitope responsible for the binding to chemokines was localized to 40 amino acids in the hypervariable region (amino acids 301-340) of the protein. Third, hybrid molecules, designed as loss- and gain-of-function gG proteins, were engineered. In these hybrid glycoproteins the hypervariable regions of EHV-1 gG, a vCKBP, and the closely related EHV-4 gG, which does not display any chemokine binding capabilities, were exchanged. gG variants containing the EHV-1 hypervariable region were able to bind chemokines and were biologically active, whereas hybrid gGs containing the corresponding region of EHV-4 gG were not.

Chemokines are chemoattractant molecules that regulate traffic and effector functions of leukocytes and are key regulators of inflammation and immune surveillance (1Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). Given the central role chemokines play in antiviral defense, it is not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to thwart and/or modulate chemokine function to their benefit. Several virus-encoded proteins with chemokine modulatory properties have been identified, mainly in herpesviruses and poxviruses, based on their sequence similarities with host chemokines or chemokine receptors (2McFadden G. Lalani A. Everett H. Nash P. Xu X. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Lusso P.

In many cases, viral chemokine modulators are pirated from host genomes. In addition, some viruses have been shown to express viral chemokine-binding proteins (vCKBP), 2The abbreviations used are: vCKBP, viral chemokine-binding protein; gG, glycoprotein G; VZV, varicella zoster virus; EHV, equine herpesvirus; sgG, secreted gG; IL, interleukin; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.2The abbreviations used are: vCKBP, viral chemokine-binding protein; gG, glycoprotein G; VZV, varicella zoster virus; EHV, equine herpesvirus; sgG, secreted gG; IL, interleukin; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. which do not share any sequence similarity with known chemokines or chemokine receptors (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Webb L.M. Alcami A. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). vCKBP can bind chemokines with high affinity and efficiently neutralize their ability to establish a gradient along which immune cells migrate. vCKBP are divided in four subfamilies based on their origin and structures. Proteins from the vCKBP-1 and vCKBP-2 subfamilies are encoded by poxviruses, and their chemokine binding profiles have been studied in much detail (7Webb L.M. Alcami A. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Seet B.T. McFadden G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 24-34PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the 35-kDa vCKBP (also designated viral chemokine inhibitor) of cowpox virus and a vCKBP encoded by the vaccinia virus A41L have been resolved, giving better insights in the mechanism of action of one family of vCKBP (9Carfi A.

The vCKBP M3 is encoded by the murine gammaherpes-virus-68 (MHV-68) and is the only member of the vCKBP-3 subfamily (11Parry C.M. Simas J.P. Smith V.P. Stewart C.A. Minson A.C. Efstathiou S.

Virol. 2000; 74: 6741-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The structure of M3 has also been determined, which is remotely related to that of vCKBP-2 members albeit with a completely different connecting topology (13Alexander J.M. Nelson C.A. van B.V. Lau E.K. Studts J.M. Brett T.J. Speck S.H. Handel T.M. Virgin H.W. Fremont D.H. Cell. 2002; 111: 343-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The most recently published vCKBP, constituting the vCKBP-4 subfamily, is glycoprotein G (gG), which is encoded by several alphaherpesviruses (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Webb L.M. Alcami A. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No data on the structure of gG are available to date, and the functional domains of this glycosylated vCKBP, involved in chemokine binding and biological activity, have thus far remained undetermined. Members of the Alphaherpesvirinae have a narrow in vivo host range, a short replication cycle, and the capacity to establish a lifelong latent infection (14Pellett P.E. Roizmann B. Herpesviridae. 5th Ed. Lippincott, Wilkinson and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2479-2499Google Scholar). The length of their linear, double-stranded DNA genome varies between ∼120 and 180 kilobase pairs and generally consists of regions of unique sequences flanked by direct or inverted repeat sequences. This subfamily includes the human pathogens herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agents of cold sores, genital ulcerous disease, and chickenpox/shingles, respectively. A number of animal viruses related to these human viruses are also allocated to this group, among them equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), which genetically and biologically is most similar to VZV. Significant progress is currently made in demonstrating the potential of alphaherpesviral gG to intercept chemokine networking at different levels (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Webb L.M. Alcami A. Mini. Rev. Med.

Hereby, EHV-1 has been used most frequently as a model to investigate the pathophysiological importance of gG binding on chemotaxis and cell trafficking, both in vitro and in vivo. EHV-1 initially replicates in the upper respiratory system, whereupon B and T cells in the tonsils become infected, which ultimately leads to a leukocyte-associated viremia. The viremia enables EHV-1 to reach internal organs and virus infection can result in abortion or disorders of the central nervous system (16Allen G.P. Bryans J.T. Prog. Vet. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 2: 78-144PubMed Google Scholar). A close relative of EHV-1, EHV-4, generally remains localized to the upper respiratory tract and rarely can escape immune control and cause systemic disease (17van Maanen C. Vet.Q. 2002; 24: 58-78PubMed Google Scholar, 18Patel J.R. Heldens J. Vet.J. 2005; 170: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Both viruses encode gG as a type I integral membrane protein with their N-terminal part relatively conserved, but their extracellular C-terminal part highly divergent (19Crabb B.S. Studdert M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6332-6338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length, membrane-anchored form of EHV-1 gG has vCKBP properties because recombinant gG expressed on the surface of insect cells was capable of binding human CXCL1 and CXCL8 (also designated IL-8) (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Secreted EHV-1 gG (sgG) has also been shown to bind a broad range of chemokines with high affinity and in a species-independent manner; EHV-1 sgG is capable of interfering with chemotaxis of human and equine neutrophils induced by human or equine IL-8, respectively, as well as that of murine neutrophils mediated by the IL-8 relative KC in vitro (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another study demonstrated a functional interference of EHV-1 gG with chemotaxis of murine neutrophils and macrophages induced by the proinflammatory chemokine CCL3 (21Van de Walle G.R. Sakamoto K. Osterrieder N. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, EHV-1 sgG was shown to have a significant effect on the migration of immune cells into murine airways in vivo (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Van de Walle G.R. Sakamoto K. Osterrieder N. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas EHV-1 gG clearly has vCKBP activities both in vitro and in vivo, no such role was found for its EHV-4 counterpart (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because the structural features of gG important for binding to chemokines are unknown, the objective of this study was to systematically evaluate and analyze residues of EHV-1 gG to provide insights into the region(s) of alphaherpesviral gG responsible for the binding to chemokines and its bioactivity as a vCKBP. Cells—Equine fibroblasts (NBL6) were grown and maintained in growth medium (minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Equine neutrophils were isolated by density centrifugation of heparinized blood from healthy horses on a discontinuous Percoll gradient as described previously (22Pycock J.F. Allen W.E. Morris T.H. Res. Vet. Sci. 1987; 42: 411-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the cells were resuspended in minimal essential medium at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml and used immediately in chemotaxis assays. Plasmids—The His-tagged secreted fragment of EHV-1 gG (pBac11EHV-1sgG) has been described previously (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was used to amplify and add a His tag to the secreted region of EHV-4 gG. Briefly, DNA was purified from NBL6 cells infected with the EHV-4 isolate VLS#829 (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using the Gentra Puregene cell kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. This DNA served as a template for PCR amplification of the truncated secreted version of EHV-4 gG. Primers containing CpoI restriction sites within the 5′ overhang, EHV-4 gGFCpoI and gGRCpoI (Table 1), allowed insertion of EHV-4 gG into the pBac11 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). DNA purified from correct clones were subsequently electroporated into DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen) harboring the baculovirus BAC sequence exactly as detailed previously (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L.

The expression cassette, which includes EHV-1 sgG and a C-terminal His6 tag, was amplified from pBac11EHV-1sgG. To allow efficient translocation into the periplasm, the OmpA signaling sequence was introduced as an N-terminal fusion protein with EHV-1 sgG. EcoRI and a HindIII restriction sites in the 5′ primer overhangs of gG-OmpA- for and EHV-gG-His-Rev (Table 1) facilitated the insertion of secreted EHV-1 gG into the pBad24 vector (ATCC, Manassas, VA), which was used for inducible expression of gG upon addition of arabinose. Recombinant plasmids containing EHV-1 gG were isolated, and their identities were confirmed via restriction digestion and sequencing. For periplasmatic expression of proteins spanning the extracellular part of EHV-1 gG, a standard vector containing an N-terminal OmpA signaling sequence and a C-terminal His6 tag was generated based on pBAD24. Briefly, the OmpA-His cassette was generated by PCR using the overlapping primer 5′-GGAATTCACCATGAAAAAGACAGCTATCGCGATTGCAGTGGCACTGGCTGGTTTCGCTAC-3′ as forward and 5′-GCCAAGCTTCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTATGAGGCCTGCGCTACGGTAGCGAAACCAGCCAGTGCC-3′ as reverse primer, respectively, and was cloned into pBAD24 via the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined). A StuI restriction site between OmpA and the His6 tag facilitated the insertion of the EHV-1 gG peptides, which were 100 amino acids (aa) in length and overlapped by 50 aa each (primers A-F are given in Table 1). Gene Splicing by Overlap Extension PCR—To exchange the hypervariable regions of EHV-1 and EHV-4 gG (Fig. 1A), recombinant plasmids pBac11EHV-4sgG and pBac11EHV-1sgG were used as templates to create chimeras using gene splicing by overlap extension PCR as described previously (23Warrens A.N. Jones M.D. Lechler R.I. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, gene splicing by overlap extension PCR involves different sets of primers (Table 2) to create three separate PCR products (Fig. 1B). With this technique, two sgG chimera PCR products were created: EHV-1sgG259-359, containing the hypervariable region of EHV-4 gG within the EHV-1 gG backbone (loss-of-function chimera), and EHV-4sgG258-325, containing the hypervariable region of EHV-1 gG within the EHV-4 gG backbone (gain-of-function chimera) (Fig. 1C). The final PCR products were cloned into the pBac11 for baculovirus expression using CpoI primer pairs as described in Table 1 (pBac11EHV-1sgG259-359 and pBac11EHV-4sgG258-325).TABLE 2Primers for designing EHV-1 sgG259-359 and EHV-4 sgG258-325 chimeraa Directionality of the primer.b The type used in the sequences coordinates with the colors used in Fig. 1B (underlining, green; bold type, blue).

Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant baculovirus bacmid DNA encoding His-tagged secreted gG's (EHV-4 sgG-His, EHV-1sgG259-359-His, or EHV-4sgG258-325-His) were transfected into Sf9 insect cells using Celfectin (Invitrogen), and recombinant viruses were plaque purified twice. For the expression of His-tagged secreted gGs, Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0, and supernatants were collected and dialyzed overnight against PBS (2.5 mmol of NaH2PO4, 7.5 mmol of Na2HPO4, 145 mmol of NaCl, pH 7.2). For bacterial expression of His-tagged EHV-1 sgG (or EHV-1 gG peptides), Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Novagen) was transformed with pBaD24sgG-His DNA and incubated in a shaker (220 rpm) at 32 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol until an A550 of 0.5 was reached. To induce gene expression, arabinose (Sigma; 1% final concentration) was added to the cell culture for 3 h. Subsequently, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in buffer P (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm sucrose, 1 mm Na2EDTA) and incubated for 30 min on ice. To eliminate spheroplasts, the suspension was centrifuged twice at 4,000 × g for 15 min, followed by 27,000 × g for 15 min, and dialyzed twice against PBS at 4 °C. Protein expression was verified by Western blotting with antibodies against EHV-1 gG, EHV-4 gG (24Huang J. Hartley C.A. Ficorilli N.P. Crabb B.S. Studdert M.J. Arch. Virol. 2005; 150: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and/or the poly-histidine tag. For purification of His-tagged proteins, TALON resin (Clontech, La Jolla, CA) was used, exactly as described previously (25Kamil J.P. Tischer B.K. Trapp S. Nair V.K. Osterrieder N. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6984-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fractions containing His-tagged proteins were collected, and their purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford assay following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Enzymatic Deglycosylation of EHV-1 gG—O-Deglycosylation of secreted EHV-1 gG was performed with 10 milliunits of neuraminidase (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 1 milliunit of O-glycosidase (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C. For N-deglycoslylation reactions, peptide N-glycosidase F enzyme (New England Biolabs) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, EHV-1 sgG was incubated first for 10 min at 100 °C in 1× denaturation buffer (New England Biolabs) and then in the presence of peptide N-glycosidase F enzyme for 1 h at 37 °C in 1× G7 buffer (New England Biolabs) containing Nonidet P-40. Western Blotting—Western blot analyses were performed essentially as described previously (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To detect gG, polyclonal rabbit anti-gG antibodies (1:500) were used that recognize the hypervariable domain of gG of EHV-1 or EHV-4 (both antisera were kindly provided by Drs. C. Hartley and M. J. Studdert) (24Huang J. Hartley C.A. Ficorilli N.P. Crabb B.S. Studdert M.J. Arch. Virol. 2005; 150: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Penta-His (1:1000; Qiagen) and anti-HA (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies were used to detect His-tagged and HA-flagged proteins respectively. Anti-mouse (1:7,500) or anti-rabbit (1:5,000) IgG peroxidase conjugates were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Peptides—Small peptides of 20 aa in length spanning the hypervariable region of EHV-1 gG were commercially synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and are shown in Table 3.TABLE 3Peptides covering the hypervariable region of EHV-1 gGNameRegionSequenceaSequences are given in the single-letter amino acid codes.P1261-280LRQATGPQTLLVGAVGLRILP2281-300AQAWKFVGDETYDTIRAEAKP3301-320NLETHVPSSAAESSLENQSTP4321-340QEESNSPEVAHLRSVNSDDSa Sequences are given in the single-letter amino acid codes. Open table in a new tab Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Wells of a microtiter plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with recombinant equine IL-8 (5 μg/ml in coating buffer consisting of 15 mmol of Na2CO3, 35 mmol of NaHCO3, pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 3% skim milk powder in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. To detect the binding of recombinantly expressed His-tagged gG proteins, a dilution series of the protein was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by penta-His antibodies (1:500) for 1 h and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1/5000) for 1 h at 37 °C, diluted in 0.3% skim milk powder in PBS. To determine the inhibitory effect of the 20-aa-long peptides on the binding of baculovirus-expressed EHV-1 sgG, a dilution series of the small peptides (or a combination of the small peptides) was first added to the coated wells for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by baculovirus-expressed His-tagged EHV-1 sgG (6 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Penta-His antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were used as described above. Binding of peroxidase-conjugated antibodies was colorimetrically determined at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Richmond, VA) and BD OptEIA reagent A and B (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as a substrate. In general, the wells were washed three times after coating and blocking and nine times between other steps. Chemotaxis Assays—Chemotaxis assays were performed as previously described (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng/ml of equine IL-8 (Serotec, Oxford, UK) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with recombinantly expressed gG constructs (0.3 μg/ml) and applied to the lower chambers of 12-well Costar Transwell plates (Corning Costar Co., Cambridge, MA). The wells were covered with a polycarbonate membrane with a 3-μm pore size, 1 × 104 equine neutrophils were added to the top chamber, and assay plates were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Equine IL-8 and medium alone were included in each experiment to serve as positive and negative controls, respectively. After incubation, the cells in the lower chamber were stained, counted under a light microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 25), and expressed as a percentage of chemotaxis based on the amount of input cells, unless indicated otherwise. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test for paired data were used to test for statistically significant differences. The data given are the means, and the bars show standard deviations. N-Glycosylation Sites Present on EHV-1 gG Do Not Bind Chemokines Directly but Are Essential for Biological Activity of the vCKBP—In the original description of alphaherpesviral vCKBPs it was discussed that glycosylation of gG might be important for proper function as a vCKBP (6Bryant N.A. Davis-Poynter N. Vanderplasschen A. Alcami A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, because no information was available on the exact glycosylation status of EHV-1 gG, we performed enzymatic deglycosylations of EHV-1 gG to evaluate the extent of post-translational modifications of EHV-1 gG and investigate their importance for chemokine binding. The programs NetNGlyc 1.0 and NetOGlyc 3.1 were used to predict possible N- and O-glycosylation sites on gG. First, because EHV-1 gG was predicted to contain three O-linked glycosylation sites, we performed enzymatic O-deglycosylation of EHV-1 gG using supernatants of EHV-1-infected cells. However, Western blot analysis with anti-EHV-1 gG antibodies showed that removal of O-linked carbohydrates from EHV-1 gG did not increase the mobility of the protein, suggesting that EHV-1 gG either does not contain O-linked glycans or that there are too few O-glycans added to the protein, which would result in a discernable change of mobility as assayed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). We were able to exclude ineffective cleavage of O-glycans and proper action of O-glycosidase and neuraminidase because we detected increased mobility of the HA-flagged secreted gC protein from supernatants of VZV-infected cells that was used as a control (Fig. 2A). The gC of the VZV vaccine strain P-Oka is predicted to contain 24 O-linked glycosylation sites, based on the NetOGlyc prediction server (version 3.1). As to the importance of O-glycosylation for biological activity of gG, we used enzymatically O-deglycosylated gG in our previously established chemotaxis assays (20Van de Walle G.R. May M.L. Sukhumavasi W. von Einem J. Osterrieder N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was observed that gG treated with enzymes removing O-linked sugars was able to interfere with the migration of equine neutrophils in the IL-8-induced chemotaxis assay to the same extent as seen with untreated gG (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicated that post-translational modification by addition of O-glycans is not important for proper function of the vCKBP encoded by EHV-1 gG. We also performed N-glycosidase F treatment of EHV-1-infected supernatants, because EHV-1 gG is predicted to contain four N-linked glycosylation sites. This treatment resulted in an increased mobility of gG from 51 to 41kDa after SDS-PAGE, and this lower apparent molecular weight exactly corresponded to the predicted molecular weight of the unglycosylated form of secreted gG (Fig. 2A). In addition, the VZV gC-HA control predicted to contain five N-linked glycosylation sites (26Cohen J.I. Seidel K.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3087-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also exhibited increased mobility after N-glycosydase F treatment (Fig. 2A). The N-deglycosylated gG was dialyzed twice against PBS, because it was observed that the buffer used for enzymatic deglycosylation had an inhibitory effect on neutrophil migration by itself (data not shown). Testing the N-deglycosylated gG in chemotaxis assays revealed that removal of N-linked glycans impaired vCKBP activity of EHV-1 gG, because the viral protein was no longer capable of reducing neutrophil migration (Fig. 2B). To corroborate this finding, a second experimental approach was employed, and secreted EHV-1 gG was recombinantly expressed in E. coli to yield His-tagged EHV-1 gG without glycosylation. As seen in Fig. 3A, expression of gG by bacteria resulted in a protein of ∼41 kDa, which exactly corresponds to the size of N-glycosidase F-treated gG (Fig. 2A). As a control, the glycosylated His-tagged gG expressed in insect cells was included and migrated as a glycosylated gG prote"
https://openalex.org/W2124430541,"When I was asked to write a Reflections article for the Journal of Biological Chemistry, I initially hesitated, mainly because I had already written several papers on the story of the discovery of the ubiquitin system (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Lessons from the discovery of the ubiquitin system.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system..Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar-4Hershko A. The Nobel Foundation, Stockholm, Sweden.Les Prix Nobel 2004. 2005; : 187-200Google Scholar). On second thought, however, it seemed worthwhile to write about it from a different aspect, about what can be learned from this story. I hope that some of the lessons may be of help to students or young investigators in their future work.I first became interested in biochemistry when I was a medical student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The curriculum of most medical schools includes a considerable amount of basic science, and many medical students are not always happy about it, but I enjoyed my courses in biochemistry so much that I wanted to do some laboratory research. I was very fortunate to have Jacob Mager of the Hebrew University as my first mentor in biochemistry (Fig. 1). Mager was a biochemist of immense knowledge, indeed a walking encyclopedia of biochemical sciences. He was also a very strict and rigorous experimentalist; every experiment had to be done with all possible controls, and every result had to be verified from all possible angles. I owe a lot to him for providing me with a solid and broad background of sound and rigorous biochemistry.Having completed my medical studies and my Ph.D. thesis with Mager, I went on to do my postdoctoral training with Gordon Tomkins at the University of California in San Francisco (Fig. 2). Here again, I was very fortunate to find another outstanding mentor in science. Gordon was totally different from Mager: he did not care much about controls or experimental detail, but he was richly imaginative. Gordon was always bursting with new ideas, and he was a great inspiration to his postdoctoral fellows and to his colleagues. Thus, I was very lucky to have, at the beginning of my life in science, this blessed mix of two very different mentors. In effect, it is important in science to have vision and new ideas, but then it is equally important to refrain from getting carried away and to test rigorously, with a lot of self-criticism, whether your idea is correct. Having these two mentors taught me to aspire to this combination. So the first lesson from my life in science is the importance of having good mentors (Table 1, Lesson 1). Reading scientific literature is also very important, but one learns how to approach and solve problems in research mainly from daily contact with mentors. I believe that students should choose their mentors very carefully and, if possible, to have different kinds of mentors for graduate and postgraduate training.FIGURE 2Gordon Tomkins (circa 1973).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 1Some lessons from my life in science (thus far) 1. It is very important to have good mentors. You learn how to do good science from prolonged interaction with good teachers. 2. Find an important research subject that is not yet interesting to others; otherwise, the ""big guys"" will get there before you! Do not go with the mainstream. 3. Accidental observations may be the most important ones. Grab your luck! 4. Use whatever experimental approach is most suitable for your objective. It may not necessarily be the latest or ""state-of-art"" technology. It may even be ""old-fashioned"" biochemistry! 5. Do not get discouraged by many unsuccessful experiments. To make important contributions, you need patience, persistence, and perseverance. 6. Discoveries are made in work driven by curiosity and excitement. Do not let your ""chores"" overcome your excitement and fun in science. 7. Never leave bench work, and you shall continue to have a lot of excitement and fun. Open table in a new tab Another lesson from my personal experience is that a young scientist should look for a research subject that is important but unique and not yet in the mainstream of current research (Table 1, Lesson 2). It is not a good idea for a young investigator to try to compete with big laboratories on a currently popular subject because the ""big guys"" will get there before you do! It was during my postdoctoral work with Gordon Tomkins that I became interested in the mechanisms of intracellular protein degradation. At that time, there was a general interest in protein synthesis and its regulation. Very few researchers were investigating the opposite process of protein degradation, although the importance of protein degradation in the control of enzyme levels had already been recognized (5Schimke R.T. Doyle D. Control of enzyme levels in animal tissues.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1970; 39: 929-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Most people in the Tomkins lab were working on the mode by which steroid hormones induce the synthesis of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), but Gordon agreed that I could work on the opposite process, the degradation of TAT. So good fortune, perhaps combined with some good intuition, led me to work on a subject that I believed was biologically important but not yet interesting to many others, so I did not have to worry much about the competition.One of the first experiments that I did in the Tomkins lab influenced much of my subsequent work. I found then, quite by accident I must admit, that the degradation of TAT in hepatoma cells was blocked by potassium fluoride, an inhibitor of cellular ATP production (6Hershko A. Tomkins G.M. Studies on the degradation of tyrosine aminotransferase in hepatoma cells in culture. Influence of the composition of the medium and adenosine triphosphate dependence.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 710-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). I should also confess that only after I observed this result did I research the literature and found that Simpson (7Simpson M.V. The release of amino acids from proteins in liver slices.J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 201: 143-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously reported that the degradation of labeled proteins in liver slices required cellular energy. Even though my finding was not entirely novel, I was very much impressed by it because it suggested that proteins in cells are degraded by a system that is different from the known proteolytic enzymes. It seemed to me reasonable to assume that in this as-yet-unknown system, energy is utilized for the high selectivity of intracellular protein degradation. Therefore, much of my subsequent work was trying to elucidate how proteins are degraded in cells and why energy is needed for this process. The lesson that may be drawn from this part of the story is that accidental observations may be the most important ones (Table 1, Lesson 3). I stumbled on the energy dependence of protein degradation by accident (combined with ignorance), but then I did not let go. Grab your luck when you get it and never let it pass you by!After my postdoctoral work, I returned to Israel, set up my laboratory at the Technion (where I have remained ever since), and tried to find out how cellular proteins are degraded. It was clear to me that the only appropriate way to investigate the workings of a completely unknown system was that of ""classical"" biochemistry. This includes the use of a cell-free system that faithfully reproduces energy-dependent protein degradation in vitro and separation of its components by fractionation, followed by purification and characterization of the different enzyme components to understand their mode of action. This is what my laboratory has actually done (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hershko A. The Nobel Foundation, Stockholm, Sweden.Les Prix Nobel 2004. 2005; : 187-200Google Scholar). Much of this work was done during the times when the powerful technologies of molecular biology were emerging. Many biochemists at that time became ""converted"" to molecular biologists, and some regarded classical biochemistry as old-fashioned. However, I insisted on using biochemistry because this was the only way to reach the objective of learning how proteins are degraded in cells. Molecular genetics can (and should) be applied mainly when at least part of the basic biochemistry of the system under investigation is already known. For example, it would not have been possible to define the roles of some protein kinases in cell division or signal transduction without any prior knowledge of the biochemistry of protein kinases. Similarly, such an unexpected process as the role of ubiquitin ligation in protein degradation probably could not have been discovered by molecular biology or genetics alone, without any biochemical knowledge. Of course, molecular genetics was vitally important later on for the discovery of the variety of functions of the ubiquitin system in a multitude of cellular processes. The lesson that may be learned is to use whatever experimental approach is most suitable for the research objective, which may not necessarily be the most ""fashionable"" or ""state-of-art"" technology (Table 1, Lesson 4). I suspect that ""old-fashioned"" biochemistry will continue to be needed for many future discoveries because much of the genome encodes proteins of totally unknown function.As noted, the story of the discovery of the ubiquitin system has already been described (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Lessons from the discovery of the ubiquitin system.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system..Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar-4Hershko A. The Nobel Foundation, Stockholm, Sweden.Les Prix Nobel 2004. 2005; : 187-200Google Scholar). Briefly, we have fractionated an ATP-dependent cell-free proteolytic system from reticulocytes, initially described by Etlinger and Goldberg (8Etlinger J.D. Goldberg A.L. A soluble ATP-dependent proteolytic system responsible for the degradation of abnormal proteins in reticulocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and isolated a small heat-stable protein that was essential for the activity of this system (9Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. A heat-stable polypeptide component of an ATP-dependent proteolytic system from reticulocytes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Much of this work was done by Aaron Ciechanover, who was then my graduate student. The small protein was later identified by Wilkinson et al. (10Wilkinson K.D. Urban M.K. Haas A.L. Ubiquitin is the ATP-dependent proteolysis factor from reticulocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7529-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as ubiquitin, a protein of previously unknown function. Following its purification, we found that ubiquitin became associated with high molecular weight material in an ATP-dependent process (11Ciechanover A. Heller H. Elias S. Haas A.L. Hershko A. ATP-dependent conjugation of reticulocyte proteins with the polypeptide required for protein degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In collaboration with Ernie Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, we then identified the high molecular weight derivatives as covalent conjugates of ubiquitin with substrate proteins (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proposed role of ATP in protein breakdown: conjugation of proteins with multiple chains of the polypeptide of ATP-dependent proteolysis..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we proposed in 1980 that covalent amide linkage of ubiquitin to proteins targets them for degradation (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proposed role of ATP in protein breakdown: conjugation of proteins with multiple chains of the polypeptide of ATP-dependent proteolysis..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).Ernie Rose was the third person, in addition to Mager and Tomkins, who had a great influence on my life in science (Fig. 3). He is well recognized for his work on enzyme mechanisms, a field about which I know very little. He also had a side interest in protein degradation. That was the reason he invited me to his laboratory for a sabbatical year in 1977–1978 and for many subsequent visits. He likes problem solving, and his approach to science is analytical. I am more intuitive, so we complemented each other very well. He is also sharply critical, and this got me out of trouble on occasions when my imagination ran away despite my training with Mager. Ernie contributed greatly to the discovery of the of the ubiquitin system by excellent suggestions and important criticisms.FIGURE 3Ernie Rose in the library of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia (circa 1992).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following the discovery of the ligation of ubiquitin to proteins and the proposal of the ubiquitin tagging hypothesis, my laboratory spent the next decade on the identification of the enzyme components of this pathway. We did this again using the old-fashioned biochemical approaches of fractionation, purification, characterization, and reconstitution. We concentrated mainly on enzymes involved in the ligation of ubiquitin to proteins: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, the ubiquitin carrier protein E2, and the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (13Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. Components of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system. Resolution, affinity purification, and role in protein breakdown.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the role of the E3 enzymes is to bind specific protein substrates and suggested that the selectivity of protein degradation is determined mainly by the substrate specificity of different E3 enzymes (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Heller H. Eytan E. Reiss Y. The protein substrate binding site of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system..J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11992-11999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since 1990, I have been working on some roles of the ubiquitin system in cell cycle control, again using biochemical approaches and relevant cell-free systems. This resulted in the identification of two ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes: the cyclosome, now also called anaphase-promoting complex or APC/C, involved in the degradation of mitotic cyclins and some other cell cycle regulatory proteins in exit from mitosis (work done in collaboration with Joan Ruderman) (15Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. The cyclosome, a large complex containing cyclin-selective ubiquitin ligase activity, targets cyclins for destruction at the end of mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and SCFSkp2, which targets the p27 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases for degradation in the G1-to-S phase transition (work done in collaboration with Michele Pagano) (16Carrano A. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Skp2 is required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the Cdk inhibitor p27..Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 17Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. The cell cycle regulatory protein Cks1 is required for the SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitylation of p27..Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). At present, I am trying to use biochemical approaches to gain insight into the mechanisms by which the mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint system regulates the activity of APC/C (18Braunstein I. Miniowitz S. Moshe Y. Hershko A. Inhibitory factors associated with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in mitotic checkpoint.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).As is evident from this brief description of nearly 40 years of my work on protein degradation, it required a lot of time, patience, and perseverance. Naturally, one writes only about successful experiments, but the young reader should realize that these were always preceded by a much larger number of failed experiments. I often think that if I were not so persistent (or just plain obstinate), I would not have made any important research contributions. So if you believe that your research objective is really important and is experimentally approachable, do not get discouraged by a large number of unsuccessful experiments. If nothing works for many months, try a different approach, but do not abandon your research objective. To make an important contribution, there is a need for much of what may be called the three ""Ps”: persistence, patience, and perseverance (Table 1, Lesson 5).Despite the great multitude of unsuccessful experiments, when I look back at my life in science, I realize how much excitement and fun it brought during all these years. I think that this is the right way to do science. If you want to make discoveries, you have to work in a way that excites you. Everyone knows that we have plenty of chores in our scientific life. We must write grant applications, and we have to publish papers to get grants or to get promoted. Although these are duties that we have to do, we should not let these chores become our main occupation. One does not make discoveries when just collecting data to publish papers, which in turn would serve to get more grants, and so on. Discoveries are made in work driven by curiosity and excitement (Table 1, Lesson 6).My last lesson, Lesson 7, for the young and not-so-young scientists is never to leave bench work. I have always done (and I am still doing and greatly enjoying) bench work, often on a daily basis, and I find it very important for creativity. Testing your ideas yourself will excite you greatly. When I do an experiment myself, there is great anticipation and excitement until the results are obtained. When I see results that are unexpected, then I get even more excited. There is a very intense involvement in research when it is performed with your own hands.I would like to emphasize, mainly for the young or naïve readers, that not all of my lessons apply to everybody. Max Perutz, a great pioneer in protein crystallography, also loved bench work and was most happy in the laboratory doing experiments. However, he also wrote (19Perutz M.F. I Wish I'd Made You Angry Earlier. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 412Google Scholar) that ""when Crick and Watson lounged around, arguing about problems for which there existed as yet no firm experimental data instead of getting down to the bench and doing experiments, I thought they were wasting their time. However,...they sometimes achieved most when they seemed to be working least... There is more then one way of doing good science."" This is certainly correct.Finally, although it is great to do experiments with your own hands, you cannot accomplish everything by yourself. One needs the help of dedicated research teams, students, and colleagues. I was very fortunate to have highly devoted research teams for many years. In my laboratory at the Technion, my associates Dvora Ganoth, Hanna Heller, Esther Eytan, Sarah Elias, and Clara Segal and my wife, Judith Hershko, all gave me tremendously devoted help for many years, for which I am most grateful. Throughout the years, I was fortunate to have many graduate students (among them, Aaron Ciechanover), too many to list here, many of whom made very important contributions to the discovery of the ubiquitin system, to the basic biochemistry of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, or to some of its roles in cell cycle control. When I was asked to write a Reflections article for the Journal of Biological Chemistry, I initially hesitated, mainly because I had already written several papers on the story of the discovery of the ubiquitin system (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershko A.

On second thought, however, it seemed worthwhile to write about it from a different aspect, about what can be learned from this story. I hope that some of the lessons may be of help to students or young investigators in their future work. I first became interested in biochemistry when I was a medical student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The curriculum of most medical schools includes a considerable amount of basic science, and many medical students are not always happy about it, but I enjoyed my courses in biochemistry so much that I wanted to do some laboratory research. I was very fortunate to have Jacob Mager of the Hebrew University as my first mentor in biochemistry (Fig. 1). Mager was a biochemist of immense knowledge, indeed a walking encyclopedia of biochemical sciences. He was also a very strict and rigorous experimentalist; every experiment had to be done with all possible controls, and every result had to be verified from all possible angles. I owe a lot to him for providing me with a solid and broad background of sound and rigorous biochemistry. Having completed my medical studies and my Ph.D. thesis with Mager, I went on to do my postdoctoral training with Gordon Tomkins at the University of California in San Francisco (Fig. 2). Here again, I was very fortunate to find another outstanding mentor in science. Gordon was totally different from Mager: he did not care much about controls or experimental detail, but he was richly imaginative. Gordon was always bursting with new ideas, and he was a great inspiration to his postdoctoral fellows and to his colleagues. Thus, I was very lucky to have, at the beginning of my life in science, this blessed mix of two very different mentors. In effect, it is important in science to have vision and new ideas, but then it is equally important to refrain from getting carried away and to test rigorously, with a lot of self-criticism, whether your idea is correct. Having these two mentors taught me to aspire to this combination. So the first lesson from my life in science is the importance of having good mentors (Table 1, Lesson 1). Reading scientific literature is also very important, but one learns how to approach and solve problems in research mainly from daily contact with mentors. I believe that students should choose their mentors very carefully and, if possible, to have different kinds of mentors for graduate and postgraduate training. Another lesson from my personal experience is that a young scientist should look for a research subject that is important but unique and not yet in the mainstream of current research (Table 1, Lesson 2). It is not a good idea for a young investigator to try to compete with big laboratories on a currently popular subject because the ""big guys"" will get there before you do! It was during my postdoctoral work with Gordon Tomkins that I became interested in the mechanisms of intracellular protein degradation. At that time, there was a general interest in protein synthesis and its regulation. Very few researchers were investigating the opposite process of protein degradation, although the importance of protein degradation in the control of enzyme levels had already been recognized (5Schimke R.T. Doyle D. Control of enzyme levels in animal tissues.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1970; 39: 929-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Most people in the Tomkins lab were working on the mode by which steroid hormones induce the synthesis of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), but Gordon agreed that I could work on the opposite process, the degradation of TAT. So good fortune, perhaps combined with some good intuition, led me to work on a subject that I believed was biologically important but not yet interesting to many others, so I did not have to worry much about the competition. One of the first experiments that I did in the Tomkins lab influenced much of my subsequent work. I found then, quite by accident I must admit, that the degradation of TAT in hepatoma cells was blocked by potassium fluoride, an inhibitor of cellular ATP production (6Hershko A. Tomkins G.M. Studies on the degradation of tyrosine aminotransferase in hepatoma cells in culture. Influence of the composition of the medium and adenosine triphosphate dependence.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 710-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). I should also confess that only after I observed this result did I research the literature and found that Simpson (7Simpson M.V. The release of amino acids from proteins in liver slices.J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 201: 143-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously reported that the degradation of labeled proteins in liver slices required cellular energy. Even though my finding was not entirely novel, I was very much impressed by it because it suggested that proteins in cells are degraded by a system that is different from the known proteolytic enzymes. It seemed to me reasonable to assume that in this as-yet-unknown system, energy is utilized for the high selectivity of intracellular protein degradation. Therefore, much of my subsequent work was trying to elucidate how proteins are degraded in cells and why energy is needed for this process. The lesson that may be drawn from this part of the story is that accidental observations may be the most important ones (Table 1, Lesson 3). I stumbled on the energy dependence of protein degradation by accident (combined with ignorance), but then I did not let go. Grab your luck when you get it and never let it pass you by! After my postdoctoral work, I returned to Israel, set up my laboratory at the Technion (where I have remained ever since), and tried to find out how cellular proteins are degraded. It was clear to me that the only appropriate way to investigate the workings of a completely unknown system was that of ""classical"" biochemistry. This includes the use of a cell-free system that faithfully reproduces energy-dependent protein degradation in vitro and separation of its components by fractionation, followed by purification and characterization of the different enzyme components to understand their mode of action. This is what my laboratory has actually done (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hershko A. The Nobel Foundation, Stockholm, Sweden.Les Prix Nobel 2004. 2005; : 187-200Google Scholar). Much of this work was done during the times when the powerful technologies of molecular biology were emerging. Many biochemists at that time became ""converted"" to molecular biologists, and some regarded classical biochemistry as old-fashioned. However, I insisted on using biochemistry because this was the only way to reach the objective of learning how proteins are degraded in cells. Molecular genetics can (and should) be applied mainly when at least part of the basic biochemistry of the system under investigation is already known. For example, it would not have been possible to define the roles of some protein kinases in cell division or signal transduction without any prior knowledge of the biochemistry of protein kinases. Similarly, such an unexpected process as the role of ubiquitin ligation in protein degradation probably could not have been discovered by molecular biology or genetics alone, without any biochemical knowledge. Of course, molecular genetics was vitally important later on for the discovery of the variety of functions of the ubiquitin system in a multitude of cellular processes. The lesson that may be learned is to use whatever experimental approach is most suitable for the research objective, which may not necessarily be the most ""fashionable"" or ""state-of-art"" technology (Table 1, Lesson 4). I suspect that ""old-fashioned"" biochemistry will continue to be needed for many future discoveries because much of the genome encodes proteins of totally unknown function. As noted, the story of the discovery of the ubiquitin system has already been described (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Lessons from the discovery of the ubiquitin system.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system..Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar-4Hershko A. The Nobel Foundation, Stockholm, Sweden.Les Prix Nobel 2004. 2005; : 187-200Google Scholar). Briefly, we have fractionated an ATP-dependent cell-free proteolytic system from reticulocytes, initially described by Etlinger and Goldberg (8Etlinger J.D. Goldberg A.L. A soluble ATP-dependent proteolytic system responsible for the degradation of abnormal proteins in reticulocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and isolated a small heat-stable protein that was essential for the activity of this system (9Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. A heat-stable polypeptide component of an ATP-dependent proteolytic system from reticulocytes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Much of this work was done by Aaron Ciechanover, who was then my graduate student. The small protein was later identified by Wilkinson et al. (10Wilkinson K.D. Urban M.K. Haas A.L. Ubiquitin is the ATP-dependent proteolysis factor from reticulocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7529-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as ubiquitin, a protein of previously unknown function. Following its purification, we found that ubiquitin became associated with high molecular weight material in an ATP-dependent process (11Ciechanover A. Heller H. Elias S. Haas A.L. Hershko A. ATP-dependent conjugation of reticulocyte proteins with the polypeptide required for protein degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In collaboration with Ernie Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, we then identified the high molecular weight derivatives as covalent conjugates of ubiquitin with substrate proteins (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proposed role of ATP in protein breakdown: conjugation of proteins with multiple chains of the polypeptide of ATP-dependent proteolysis..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we proposed in 1980 that covalent amide linkage of ubiquitin to proteins targets them for degradation (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proposed role of ATP in protein breakdown: conjugation of proteins with multiple chains of the polypeptide of ATP-dependent proteolysis..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Ernie Rose was the third person, in addition to Mager and Tomkins, who had a great influence on my life in science (Fig. 3). He is well recognized for his work on enzyme mechanisms, a field about which I know very little. He also had a side interest in protein degradation. That was the reason he invited me to his laboratory for a sabbatical year in 1977–1978 and for many subsequent visits. He likes problem solving, and his approach to science is analytical. I am more intuitive, so we complemented each other very well. He is also sharply critical, and this got me out of trouble on occasions when my imagination ran away despite my training with Mager. Ernie contributed greatly to the discovery of the of the ubiquitin system by excellent suggestions and important criticisms. Following the discovery of the ligation of ubiquitin to proteins and the proposal of the ubiquitin tagging hypothesis, my laboratory spent the next decade on the identification of the enzyme components of this pathway. We did this again using the old-fashioned biochemical approaches of fractionation, purification, characterization, and reconstitution. We concentrated mainly on enzymes involved in the ligation of ubiquitin to proteins: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, the ubiquitin carrier protein E2, and the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (13Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. Components of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system. Resolution, affinity purification, and role in protein breakdown.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the role of the E3 enzymes is to bind specific protein substrates and suggested that the selectivity of protein degradation is determined mainly by the substrate specificity of different E3 enzymes (1Hershko A. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Heller H. Eytan E. Reiss Y. The protein substrate binding site of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system..J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11992-11999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since 1990, I have been working on some roles of the ubiquitin system in cell cycle control, again using biochemical approaches and relevant cell-free systems. This resulted in the identification of two ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes: the cyclosome, now also called anaphase-promoting complex or APC/C, involved in the degradation of mitotic cyclins and some other cell cycle regulatory proteins in exit from mitosis (work done in collaboration with Joan Ruderman) (15Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. The cyclosome, a large complex containing cyclin-selective ubiquitin ligase activity, targets cyclins for destruction at the end of mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and SCFSkp2, which targets the p27 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases for degradation in the G1-to-S phase transition (work done in collaboration with Michele Pagano) (16Carrano A. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Skp2 is required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the Cdk inhibitor p27..Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 17Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. The cell cycle regulatory protein Cks1 is required for the SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitylation of p27..Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). At present, I am trying to use biochemical approaches to gain insight into the mechanisms by which the mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint system regulates the activity of APC/C (18Braunstein I. Miniowitz S. Moshe Y. Hershko A. Inhibitory factors associated with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in mitotic checkpoint.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As is evident from this brief description of nearly 40 years of my work on protein degradation, it required a lot of time, patience, and perseverance. Naturally, one writes only about successful experiments, but the young reader should realize that these were always preceded by a much larger number of failed experiments. I often think that if I were not so persistent (or just plain obstinate), I would not have made any important research contributions. So if you believe that your research objective is really important and is experimentally approachable, do not get discouraged by a large number of unsuccessful experiments. If nothing works for many months, try a different approach, but do not abandon your research objective. To make an important contribution, there is a need for much of what may be called the three ""Ps”: persistence, patience, and perseverance (Table 1, Lesson 5). Despite the great multitude of unsuccessful experiments, when I look back at my life in science, I realize how much excitement and fun it brought during all these years. I think that this is the right way to do science. If you want to make discoveries, you have to work in a way that excites you. Everyone knows that we have plenty of chores in our scientific life. We must write grant applications, and we have to publish papers to get grants or to get promoted. Although these are duties that we have to do, we should not let these chores become our main occupation. One does not make discoveries when just collecting data to publish papers, which in turn would serve to get more grants, and so on. Discoveries are made in work driven by curiosity and excitement (Table 1, Lesson 6). My last lesson, Lesson 7, for the young and not-so-young scientists is never to leave bench work. I have always done (and I am still doing and greatly enjoying) bench work, often on a daily basis, and I find it very important for creativity. Testing your ideas yourself will excite you greatly. When I do an experiment myself, there is great anticipation and excitement until the results are obtained. When I see results that are unexpected, then I get even more excited. There is a very intense involvement in research when it is performed with your own hands. I would like to emphasize, mainly for the young or naïve readers, that not all of my lessons apply to everybody. Max Perutz, a great pioneer in protein crystallography, also loved bench work and was most happy in the laboratory doing experiments. However, he also wrote (19Perutz M.F. I Wish I'd Made You Angry Earlier. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 412Google Scholar) that ""when Crick and Watson lounged around, arguing about problems for which there existed as yet no firm experimental data instead of getting down to the bench and doing experiments, I thought they were wasting their time. However,...they sometimes achieved most when they seemed to be working least... There is more then one way of doing good science."" This is certainly correct. Finally, although it is great to do experiments with your own hands, you cannot accomplish everything by yourself. One needs the help of dedicated research teams, students, and colleagues. I was very fortunate to have highly devoted research teams for many years. In my laboratory at the Technion, my associates Dvora Ganoth, Hanna Heller, Esther Eytan, Sarah Elias, and Clara Segal and my wife, Judith Hershko, all gave me tremendously devoted help for many years, for which I am most grateful. Throughout the years, I was fortunate to have many graduate students (among them, Aaron Ciechanover), too many to list here, many of whom made very important contributions to the discovery of the ubiquitin system, to the basic biochemistry of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, or to some of its roles in cell cycle control. I thank Michael Fry and Karl Skorecki for helpful comments on the manuscript. This article was based on a lecture delivered at the Technion Symposium ""Marking 60 Years of Science in Israel"" on May 19, 2008."
https://openalex.org/W2074734327,"In the history of biology, the early 1950s to the mid-1960s represent a period of landmark discoveries that led to the establishment of a new science named Molecular Biology. The discovery of the double helical structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 facilitated the formulation of specific questions related to the hottest questions of the time, gene replication and expression. Many ambitious and talented scientists with varied backgrounds (geneticists, biochemists, microbiologists, physicists, and others) initiated work toward similar goals. Thus, starting with the confirmation in Escherichia coli of the hypothesis that DNA replication was semiconservative and, shortly thereafter, the discovery of mRNA, the formulation of the operon model for regulation of gene expression, and finally the elucidation of the genetic code, a flood of important discoveries arrived during this period. The favorite experimental system during this time was E. coli and its bacteriophages, i.e. prokaryotic systems. But, as exemplified by the demonstration of the universality (with minor exceptions) of the genetic code as well as the earlier demonstration of the similarity in major metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle from bacteria to humans, biologists assumed that the fundamental biological principles discovered in E. coli must be largely correct for other organisms. In fact, there was a famous saying (generally attributed to Jacques Monod), “What is true for E. coli is also true for elephants.” Thus, there was a kind of feeling among ambitious people who participated in this early development of molecular biology that most of the important questions in biology, specifically questions asked using E. coli as a model organism, had been answered. Many people thought that cellular differentiation and morphogenesis could be the next major question in molecular biology and started to switch from E. coli to other experimental organisms, mostly eukaryotes, to study the questions related to differentiation or other phenomena uniquely observed in eukaryotes. The most extreme expression of this view came from Gunther Stent. Soon after the formal event marking the final decipherment of the genetic code, the Cold Harbor Symposium in 1966, he published an article in Science entitled “That Was the Molecular Biology That Was” (1Stent G.S. Science. 1968; 160: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), followed in 1969 by the publication of an expanded version as a book entitled “The Coming of the Golden Age: A View of the End of Progress” (2Stent G.S. The Coming of the Golden Age: A View of the End of Progress. Natural History Press, Garden City, NY1969Google Scholar). After reviewing not only the history of progress in science, biology in particular, but also progress in other human activities, such as music and painting, Stent concluded that there may be no major conceptual breakthroughs remaining to be made in science. The exception perhaps would be in studying functions of the human brain, and this notion, the end of progress, might be equally true for art and other human activities. Such opinions were a strong influence on some early-day molecular biologists who had made significant contributions to the development of “classical molecular biology” using E. coli. This was exemplified by the exodus of many people from E. coli to other experimental systems at a time when many important problems in E. coli still remained unsolved. Like Seymour Benzer, who switched from E. coli molecular biology to Drosophila neurobiology in the late 1960s, Stent himself left E. coli molecular biology and switched to neurobiology using the leech as an experimental system. Among other early E. coli molecular biologists who switched their fields/systems, notably successful persons were, for example, George Streisinger, who initiated zebrafish research, and Sydney Brenner, who initiated research using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. I started scientific research related to fermentation biochemistry as a student of the University of Tokyo in 1950. At that time, Japan was still struggling to recover from the destruction and social turmoil caused by its defeat in the Second World War. The country was isolated from the rest of the world, and we started to learn only very slowly about the progress in science that took place abroad during the war and immediately thereafter. By carrying out research related to microbial metabolism of organic acids such as tartaric acid (3Nomura M. J. Agric. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1953; 27: 46-50Google Scholar), I learned some old biochemical and microbiological techniques used in the 1930s. Although I enjoyed doing the research and found some satisfaction in my modest achievements, I became keenly aware that my research would make no significant contribution to progress in the mainstream of basic science. Fortunately, I was able to come to the United States as a postdoctoral fellow in late 1957 and to work with three people prominent in the then emerging field of molecular biology. I stayed in the United States for three years, the first two of which I spent in Sol Spiegelman's laboratory at the University of Illinois, with summer intermissions spent with Jim Watson at Harvard. The third year I spent with Seymour Benzer at Purdue University in Indiana (Fig. 1). In addition, through these three people and through attending several meetings, I became acquainted with several noted molecular biologists, such as Gunther Stent, who played significant roles in the early days of molecular biology. In the summer of 1959, I took the Phage Course at Cold Spring Harbor, taught by George Streisinger, Frank Stahl, and Salvador Luria. Because I had significant experience in doing research (albeit in old-fashioned ways, as mentioned above), I had few problems in carrying out biochemical experiments aimed at some specific goals. In fact, the experiments I did with Benjamin Hall during the last three months in Spiegelman's laboratory yielded exciting results. We investigated whether small amounts of RNA synthesized in E. coli after phage T2 infection (discovered a few years earlier by Volkin and Astrachan (4Volkin E. Astrachan L. Virology. 1956; 2: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) were identical to rRNAs as predicted by the central dogma (as it was conceived then, i.e. before the discovery of mRNA). We discovered that the T2-specific RNAs (the name we gave to mRNA encoded by T2 genome) were clearly different from the E. coli rRNAs in their sizes and could be physically separated and concluded that that they must represent intermediate information carriers between phage DNA and phage-specific proteins (5Nomura M. Hall B.D. Spiegelman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1960; 2: 306-326Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because I had arranged to move to Benzer's laboratory, there was not enough time to do the follow-up experiments that I wished to do, and the work was published in an incomplete form. The real proof for the concept of mRNA was achieved only subsequently using the same phage-infected E. coli system by Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson (6Brenner S. Jacob F. Meselson M. Nature. 1961; 190: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) as well as Jim Watson's group (7Gros F. Hiatt H. Gilbert W. Kurland C.G. Risebrough R.W. Watson J.D. Nature. 1961; 190: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although I was very uneasy in leaving the above-mentioned “important” experiments without completion, I was also eager to learn genetics in Benzer’s laboratory. Because of the war and post-war turmoil, my basic science education in Japan was very fragmentary and inadequate, and none of the courses I took included genetics, even an elementary description of Mendelian genetics. So, as I learned biochemistry mostly through my actual participation in various research projects, mainly in fermentation biochemistry, I thought that I would be able to learn genetics through my actual participation in suitable research projects. Thus, I made an arrangement to work with Benzer, who was doing beautiful research on T4 phage genetics. I remember Jim Watson’s comments on my plan; he said something like “you are going backward by starting ‘classical’ phage genetics; you should come to Harvard to go forward.” I replied that I would go backward to learn genetics and continued in my decision to join Benzer’s laboratory. I carried out mainly two projects. One was to identify the protein encoded by rII genes of phage T4. Benzer requested that I do it, saying that “you are a biochemist, and therefore, you should be able to identify the protein.” The second was to use genetic approaches to examine whether rII deletions make the distance between two outside markers shorter as one would expect from real physical deletions of DNA. Although the rII genetics worked beautifully, and I even made an unexpected new discovery, the presence of two kinds of heterozygotes in crosses of T4 (8Nomura M. Benzer S. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), I failed to identify rII gene products. (The presence of two kinds of heterozygotes in T4 was later explained by the discovery of terminal redundancy of the phage T4 genome by George Streisinger (9Streisinger G. Cairns J. Stent G.S. Watson J.D. Phages and the Origins of Molecular Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Woodbury, NY1992: 335-340Google Scholar).) After three years of experience as a postdoctoral fellow working in these prominent laboratories in the mainstream of molecular biology, I was ready to start my own independent research as a (prokaryotic) molecular biologist. I returned to Japan in 1960 and took a position as an assistant professor in the Institute of Protein Research at Osaka University. Knowing the system in Japan at that time, I had applied to the National Institutes of Health for a research grant and received everything I asked for. Thanks to this financial support, I was able to organize my own laboratory and start research with complete independence. To avoid competition in the field of mRNA and to accomplish something unique, I decided to work on the mode of action of colicins. My long-term goal was to study membrane structure and function by analyzing biochemical changes that follow binding of colicin proteins to their specific receptors. We soon started to obtain various interesting results (10Nomura M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 315-324Crossref Google Scholar) and to have stimulating interactions with Salvador Luria, who also had a similar goal, switching from his celebrated classical work on phage genetics to colicin research around the same time (11Luria S.E. A Slot Machine, A Broken Test Tube: An Autobiography. Harper & Row, New York1984: 103-113Google Scholar). However, I also kept my interests in mRNA and ribosomes, and ribosome research eventually became the main research project in my laboratory during the time from the mid-1960s to 1980s. In the meantime, I moved back to the United States in 1963 and took a faculty position in the Department of Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, making the rather difficult personal decision of leaving my own country and committing myself to doing research in the United States. In the mid-to-late 1960s, I had my own interesting unsolved questions related to ribosomes and colicins and was too busy to think seriously about other research subjects/organisms. However, a serendipitous event was to change that. In early 1970, I received an invitation from Niels Ole Kjeldgaard and Kjeld Marcker to spend a year as a visiting professor at the newly created Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, where they had recently moved. I knew both of them professionally. Marcker, working with Fred Sanger at the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Cambridge, England, discovered formylmethionyl-tRNA as an initiator tRNA in E. coli (12Marcker K. Sanger F. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and subsequently demonstrated the presence of a unique (unformylated) methionyl-tRNA functioning as an initiator tRNA in a eukaryotic system, too (13Smith A.E. Marcker K.A. Nature. 1970; 226: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We had recently demonstrated that the 30 S small ribosomal subunit binds formylmethionyl-tRNA (14Nomura M. Lowry C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 946-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that dissociation of the 70 S ribosome into 30 S and 50 S subunits is obligatory for initiation of protein synthesis in E. coli (15Guthrie C. Nomura M. Nature. 1968; 219: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our discovery provided a functional explanation for the bipartite structure of the ribosome. At that time, many people were studying the mechanism of protein synthesis using in vitro systems containing poly(U) as mRNA and ribosomes consisting mostly of 70 S ribosomes. The synthesis of polyphenylalanine was measured using radioactive phenylalanine. Thus, it was generally assumed that the initiation of protein synthesis takes place on 70 S ribosomes. I presented our work at the Nucleic Acid Gordon Conference in 1967, which generated heated discussions with other workers, including collaborators of Marcker from the Cambridge MRC Laboratory. As for Kjeldgaard, I knew his work with Ole Maaløe in Copenhagen on ribosome biosynthesis, in particular the discovery of growth rate-dependent control of ribosome synthesis (16Maaløe O. Kjeldgaard N.O. Control of Macromolecular Synthesis. W. A. Benjamin, Inc., New York1966Google Scholar). I also had an occasion to meet him in the ribosome meeting in Berlin in 1967. However, when I received the invitation, we had just recently demonstrated that the 50 S ribosomal subunit from Bacillus stearothermophilus could be reconstituted from its molecular components (17Nomura M. Erdmann V.A. Nature. 1970; 228: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), as had been done for the E. coli 30 S subunit several years earlier (18Traub P. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the concept that the tertiary structure of proteins is determined by the primary amino acid sequence had been established at that time, how more complex biological structures are generated was not necessarily clear. Our work demonstrated that the information for correct ribosome structures is present in their molecular components. In addition, ribosome reconstitution systems provided new ways to study ribosomes. Thus, to extend this initial work, my laboratory was busy working on various aspects of ribosome structures, functions, and in vitro assembly reactions. For this reason, I was initially hesitant to take a sabbatical leave, but I also thought that it might be a good time to pause and think about the future direction of my research and especially about the possibility of switching to eukaryotic molecular biology. Hearing that Marcker was starting several new projects related to gene expression in eukaryotic systems made this invitation attractive. Eventually, I accepted the invitation, or rather half of it, and spent about six months in Aarhus. Marcker had brought some excellent young researchers from Cambridge. One of these young researchers, Alan Smith, had developed a mammalian in vitro protein-synthesizing system and identified the initiator tRNA. There had been several published observations suggesting that interferons inhibit mammalian protein synthesis in virus-infected cells but not in uninfected cells. In discussion of these observations with Marcker, we thought that the in vitro protein-synthesizing system developed by Alan could be useful to study the mechanism of the apparent specific inhibition of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. Marcker was very interested in interferons and had obtained a “purified” preparation of an interferon. Because I had learned several techniques from Alan, e.g. how to make Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in mice and active extracts for protein synthesis, Marcker suggested that I pursue this project. After growing the mouse L cells and infecting them with a virus, I was unable to confirm the specific inhibition of virus growth by interferon, possibly because the activity of the interferon preparation was too weak. In retrospect, the laboratory was too new, and several projects that were going on were still in preliminary stages with the exception of the mammalian in vitro protein-synthesizing system. More fundamentally, my interest in mammalian molecular biology was rather opportunistic and not based upon my own specific questions. Still, I thought that my experience would be useful to my understanding and possible transition to eukaryotic molecular biology in the future. My visit to Aarhus did not inspire me to switch to eukaryotic molecular biology, but my daily contact and discussion with Kjeldgaard’s group made me realize that there were several unsolved and challenging questions related to ribosome biosynthesis remaining to be studied in E. coli. For example, to explain the growth rate-dependent control of ribosome synthesis, Maaløe had just published a theoretical paper proposing a “passive control” model of ribosomal protein (r-protein) synthesis (19Maaløe O. Dev. Biol. 1969; 3: 33-58Google Scholar). In addition, he suggested that some of the r-proteins might act as an inducer of rRNA synthesis, explaining how equimolar synthesis of rRNA and r-proteins might be achieved (19Maaløe O. Dev. Biol. 1969; 3: 33-58Google Scholar). To me, his model was too speculative, but it could be tested experimentally. Watching the Danish groups (people in both Maaløe’s lab in Copenhagen and Kjeldgaard’s lab in Aarhus) studying the questions using growing E. coli cells and repeating many measurements under many different conditions, I thought that such questions could be studied biochemically once the genes for these ribosomal components were isolated. Cloning technology had not yet been developed, but some E. coli genes had been isolated as transducing phages, such as λgal-transducing phages. In addition, many r-protein genes were thought to be clustered near the str gene, the first gene identified to encode a r-protein. In fact, this identification had been recently achieved in my laboratory using the ribosome reconstitution technique (20Ozaki M. Mizushima S. Nomura M. Nature. 1969; 222: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, by the end of my sabbatical, I decided not to switch from E. coli to other systems but to initiate research in a new direction, regulation of synthesis of ribosomes and ribosomal components in E. coli. It took a few years, but we were successful in integrating λ phages near the str gene (and at some other loci) on the chromosome and in isolating many r-protein genes as transducing phages (e.g. Refs. 21Jaskunas S.R. Lindahl L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and 22Jaskunas S.R. Lindahl L. Nomura M. Nature. 1975; 256: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the breakthrough discovery of gene cloning technology together with other technological progress around the same time in the mid-1970s allowed isolation of all the genes for rRNA in E. coli (23Kenerley M.E. Morgan E.A. Post L. Lindahl L. Nomura M. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 931-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ellwood M. Nomura M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and helped to expedite progress of our regulation studies. In this way, we discovered that co-regulation of the synthesis of most, if not all, r-proteins is achieved by a feedback repression using some r-proteins as repressors at the level of translation rather than at the level of transcription. We demonstrated that as long as rRNA synthesis continues, r-proteins synthesized are assembled into ribosomes and that when r-protein synthesis exceeds rRNA production, repressor r-proteins accumulated in the pool prevent further translation of r-protein mRNA. This model, coupling of r-protein mRNA translation with rRNA synthesis, explains near-stoichiometric production of all r-proteins relative to rRNA (25Fallon A.M. Jinks C.S. Strycharz G.D. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3411-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Yates J.L. Arfsten A.E. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1837-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Nomura M. Symp. Soc. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 39: 199-220Google Scholar). At that time, because of the strong influence of the original operon model proposed by Monod and Jacob, virtually everyone who worked on gene regulation was focused on processes that operated at the level of transcription. Co-regulation of many unlinked genes by coupling of r-protein production from separate mRNAs with a single event, ribosome assembly, was also novel and broader than co-regulation of physically linked genes by a repressor in the original operon model. Thus, our model broke through a conceptual barrier. Soon molecular biologists were finding numerous regulatory mechanisms that involved the control of translation. I remember that some years later in 1986, when a symposium was organized by the British Microbiological Society to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the operon model, I was very happy to be able to discuss our model by contrasting it with the original operon model (27Nomura M. Symp. Soc. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 39: 199-220Google Scholar). My serious interest in doing research using yeast started after we elucidated an outline of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of ribosome synthesis in E. coli in the early 1980s. After the discovery of the feedback regulation of translation of r-protein mRNA mentioned above, I thought that such a simple and beautiful principle that ensures near-stoichiometric production of all r-proteins relative to rRNA synthesized might be used in other organisms, including eukaryotes. Thus, I started to think about testing such a possibility experimentally. At that time, we were still busy in studying details of the mechanisms of translational regulation by repressor r-proteins we had identified for several E. coli r-protein operons. In addition, we had just discovered that growth rate-dependent regulation of rRNA synthesis involves a feedback mechanism (28Jinks-Robertson S. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Cell. 1983; 33: 865-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and were carrying out various experiments to establish and extend this conclusion. Nevertheless, I thought that testing the possible universality of the regulation models obtained in the E. coli system should be feasible if we selected a suitable eukaryote(s) and that this might be an occasion to switch to eukaryotic molecular biology. In the mid-1970s, a series of technological developments (gene cloning and DNA sequencing in particular) revolutionized biology, enabling research scientists to isolate genes from almost any organism. Watching the remarkable progress in eukaryotic molecular biology, it was natural for me to think about testing the ideas on regulation using a yeast system. When I was a student working on projects related to fermentation biochemistry, I had occasion to grow some yeast and fungal strains. Thus, although I did not learn the physiology or genetics of these organisms, yeast was certainly not an unfamiliar organism. In addition, some of my former professional friends and former graduate/postdoctoral students had already switched to yeast from prokaryotic molecular biology, and I was witnessing their activities in the new fields. More directly, I was also following the research on yeast ribosomes, mostly using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by people such as Jon Warner and Rudy Planta. Initially, I was not certain whether it would be better to work on S. cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae was already being proven as an attractive model eukaryote, as exemplified by Lee Hartwell's work on the cell cycle. However, several young people trained in the S. cerevisiae system as well as established people who had switched from E. coli had already started to work on S. cerevisiae ribosomes, especially the obvious experiments such as cloning and characterizing r-protein genes. The field of yeast ribosomes appeared to be becoming crowded. I considered working on S. pombe mainly because relatively few people, mostly in Europe and Japan, were doing research using S. pombe, and they were primarily focused on the cell cycle. Thus, in the fall of 1983, I spent a week or so in the laboratory of Masayuki Yamamoto, learning about this organism and the necessary experimental techniques for yeast genetics. Yamamoto worked with me on E. coli r-protein gene expression as a postdoctoral student and then switched to S. pombe, focusing first on mitosis in Mitsuhiro Yanagida's lab at Kyoto University and then initiating research on meiosis in his own lab at the University of Tokyo. I also had discussions with Yanagida, who had recently isolated mutants of S. pombe defective in topoisomerases I and II (top1 and top2) and found that total RNA accumulation stopped under conditions in which both top1 and top2 activities were conditionally inactivated by temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations. I decided to use this double mutant to test the question of coupling of r-protein gene expression with rRNA accumulation. Separately, however, I asked one of the graduate students, who had just finished a small project related to E. coli ribosome research in his first year, whether he was willing to start to work on the yeast S. cerevisiae. The student, Mike Wittekind, was courageous enough to agree with this proposition. He spent a week or so in Tom Petes' lab, then at the University of Chicago, to learn necessary techniques and other basics and started our first S. cerevisiae project. My suggestion was to fuse the gene for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) to the GAL1 promoter and construct a strain in which rRNA synthesis by Pol I could be diminished by shifting cultures from galactose to glucose medium. By growing such a strain in galactose and then shifting to glucose medium and thus repressing Pol I synthesis, one should be able to examine the question of coupling of r-protein gene expression with rRNA synthesis. In this way, we started to do yeast experiments using two different yeast systems but asking the same specific questions. However, progress of the yeast research was initially very slow, partly because our research was disrupted by the move of the laboratory from Madison to Irvine, CA, which took place from 1984 to 1985. The experiments using S. pombe were carried out by a postdoctoral student, Masahiro Yamagishi. With the mutant strain obtained from Yanagida and the method of pulse-chase isotope labeling to measure synthesis rates of individual r-proteins, a method adapted from the one used routinely in our E. coli ribosome projects, we obtained clear results for many r-proteins analyzed; synthesis of r-proteins continued for a long time in the absence of rRNA synthesis, and overproduced r-proteins were slowly degraded (29Yamagishi M. Nomura M. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation was the absence of feedback repression of r-protein synthesis, which was clearly different from the E. coli system. At that time, Jon Warner’s group and others were carrying out experiments using cloned r-protein genes to see whether there was a feedback regulation as was observed for E. coli cells in similar gene dosage experiments done a few years earlier by our laboratory (25Fallon A.M. Jinks C.S. Strycharz G.D. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3411-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the initial results obtained in the yeast system were interpreted to favor the model of translational feedback coupled with rRNA synthesis, it eventually became clear that the apparent absence of an increase in r-protein synthesis rate in proportion to gene dosage is due to a rapid degradation of overproduced r-proteins in the absence of rRNA to interact with and assemble into ribosomes (e.g. Refs. 30Warner J.R. Mitra G. Schwindinger W.F. Studney M. Fried H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1512-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31ElBaradi T.T.A.L. van der Sande C.A.F.M. Mager W.H. Raue H.A. Planta R.J. Curr. Genet. 1986; 10: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Maicas E. Pluthero F.G. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 664-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results of our experiments using S. pombe were certainly consistent with this conclusion obtained with the S. cerevisiae systems. Although it took time to construct strains, Mike Wittekind’s experiments using S. cerevisiae also demonstrated unambiguous results, supporting the absence of coupling of r-protein synthesis with rRNA accumulation by translational feedback (34Wittekind M. Kolb J.M. Dodd J. Yamagishi M. Memet S. Buhler J.-M. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2049-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In retrospect, it is not surprising that yeast and E. coli use different mechanisms to control the synthesis of ribosomal components. As I myself was well aware, it had long been realized that the specific mechanisms underlying certain biological functions, including mechanisms of gene regulation, are the consequences of evoluti"

https://openalex.org/W4231252468,"As I look back, I realize that serendipity has played a major role in my life. I grew up in Santiago, Chile. As far back as I can remember I was interested in plants and animals, enjoying my Aunt Olga's farm, where I could observe the reproduction of rabbits and crossed plants of different colors. When I was a teenager a devastating earthquake in the South killed an aunt and two infant cousins who happened to be at the epicenter just for one night. That unfair tragedy convinced me that life had been created by natural forces, and the way to prove it was by synthesizing a living cell in vitro. I wanted to be a scientist and decided that I would direct my efforts toward that aim. My bad grades in high school on all the subjects that required memory, except biology and math, almost prevented me from being accepted to the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy. The Faculty of Biology and Medicine was out of my reach. During my college years I read everything I could find about the biology of cells and decided that I should first study the simplest of all self-reproducing organisms, namely viruses. To get my degree I had to work on a research problem, and by luck I read a paper that W. M. Stanley had published on the crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (1Stanley W.M. Isolation of a crystalline protein possessing the properties of Tobacco mosaic virus.Science. 1935; 28: 644-645Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). I asked the Director of the Department of Viruses at the Instituto Bacteriologico de Chile that was dedicated to growing viruses and producing vaccines if I could work on my thesis there and in return help with the work. I repeated Stanley's procedures, growing Nicotiana tabacum for infection and isolation of TMV and Nicotiana glutinosa, which produces single lesions, for quantifying the virus, and obtained beautiful pictures of the crystals (2Rotman R. Ensayo de Purificacion del Virus del Mosaico del Tabaco.Ph.D. thesis, Universidad de Chile. 1944; Google Scholar). At that time, the fact that a self-reproducing entity could be just a molecule was of great philosophical discussion and reassuring to me. In 1946, I applied to the Institute of International Education for a scholarship to continue my studies on the chemical nature of viruses in the United States. Serendipity led me to Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri where the Bacteriology Department had an instructor, A. D. Hershey, who was teaching such a course (Fig. 1). When I arrived, the Director, Dr. Bronfenbrenner, informed me that because of post-war constraints the course had not been scheduled. He suggested that I should take the Medical Bacteriology course instead and perform research with him. The project consisted of purifying bacteriophage to determine its phosphorus content. I was the third student that was assigned to that task because the previous ones had found phosphorus and according to Bronfenbrenner the phage had only protein and the presence of phosphorus indicated contamination. I worked hard to purify the phage through more procedures than necessary and, of course, I found phosphorus. I was truly desolate thinking that my year in the United States was a flop. Then, Hershey took pity on me and decided to give a special course on phage the next semester for the 7 graduate students. I will never forget that course because he used phage as units of infection that could demonstrate the quantitative aspects of biological problems. In 1950 when Hershey moved to the Carnegie Institute in Cold Spring Harbor he became famous for the ""phage course"" that he continued to give every summer. Hershey received the Nobel Prize in 1969, together with Delbruck and Luria, for showing that only DNA is introduced into the cell upon infection. At the end of the academic year Hershey asked me if I wanted to be his assistant for a project he was just starting. I was delighted and asked permission from the Institute of International Education to stay longer, which was approved. This opportunity was invaluable to me because Hershey had a unique mind for performing research such as I have never seen in other scientists. For example, when I asked him a question about the results that I was getting in phage crosses he did not respond right away, but the next day he gave me 3 type-written pages with an analysis of the question. He described the different results that were possible to get from that cross, how each result should be interpreted, and what experiments could be performed to discriminate among the possible interpretations. His ego was completely detached from the importance of the experiments that we were doing, namely showing for the first time that there is genetic exchange (DNA recombination) of the virus when it is reproducing inside the bacterium (3Hershey A.D. Rotman R. Linkage among genes controlling inhibition of lysis in a bacterial virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1948; 34: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Hershey A.D. Rotman R. Genetic recombination between host-range and plaque-type mutants of bacteriophage in single bacterial cells.Genetics. 1949; 34: 44-71PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, after 5 months of work the Immigration Department sent me a serious letter informing me that if I did not leave the United States immediately they would deport me in 3 weeks because I had a student visa and was not supposed to work as an assistant. I was forced then to leave in February. Another serendipitous event that year was meeting Maurice Sussman, who was Sol Spiegelman's graduate student. He was very intelligent and totally engrossed in research, and we became inseparable. In 1948 I came back to the United States to marry him. I also became Spiegelman's graduate student. At that time, performing science with Sol was another unique experience. He was only a few years older than us with not many more years of scientific experience but talked as an old pro. He always had one problem dominating his mind and thought about it 18 h a day. We had coffee breaks every 4 h to talk about experiments and we worked until 11 p.m. The problem that he assigned to me was Saccharomyces chevalieri's ""long term adaptation"" to galactose utilization (5Winge O. Roberts C. C. R. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg Ser. Physiol... 1948; 24: 263-315Google Scholar). This strain of yeast required days of contact with galactose before the population became positive, in contrast with other strains of yeast that adapted in a few hours. I was supposed to find out its mechanism. Sol already had a working hypothesis that this strain had ""plasmagenes"" that controlled the synthesis of the new enzymes, and he expected me to prove it. The first possibility was that a few cells in the growing population spontaneously mutated to gal+, followed by selection. I used the statistical analysis of Luria and Delbruck (6Luria S.E. Delbruck M. Mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance.Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine whether this was the mechanism. My results clearly showed that it was a massive population change requiring the continuous presence of galactose. At that time there were no available techniques to determine whether it was a cytoplasmic or a nuclear phenomenon. Nevertheless, Sol published my results as: ""On the cytoplasmic nature of long term adaptation in yeast"" (7Spiegelman S. Sussman R. Pinska E. On the cytoplasmic nature of ""long-term adaptation"" in yeast..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1950; 36: 591-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It took 47 years to shed light on that phenomenon; a paper published in 1997 (8Yano K.I. Fukasawa T. Galactose-dependent reversible interaction of Gal3p with Gal80p in the induction pathway of Gal4p-activated genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed the ""two-step model"" of gal operon induction, involving three specific interacting proteins necessary to start transcription of the gal promoter in the nucleus. Later Sol contributed significantly to science, always in a pioneering way, for example studying viruses that induce cancer. One example of his creative mind was demonstrating the in vitro evolution of an RNA virus (9Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Cole P.E. Nishihara T. Spiegelman S. Evolution in vitro: sequence and phenotype of a mutant RNA resistant to ethidium bromide.J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In 1950 I had my first son, Paul, and we moved to Evanston, Illinois because Maurice had accepted an appointment as an instructor and established a laboratory in the biology department at Northwestern University. Maurice wanted to apply the powerful approaches of the newly constituted discipline of molecular biology to phenomena of cell differentiation and morphogenesis that attend the genesis of multicellular organization. He chose to study the cellular slime molds, primitive amoebae that displayed two distinct and separate phases, namely growth and differentiation. He established controlled conditions to study their development in sufficient number and synchronously to be able to identify and study the kinetics and logistics of key biochemical events, particularly the synthesis of new proteins that attend differentiation into fruiting body (10Sussman M. The origin of cellular heterogeneity in the slime molds, Dictyosteliacae.J. Exp. Zool. 1951; 118: 407-418Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). I wanted children, and although taking care of them has always been my first priority, I did not want to quit science completely in doing so. However, at that time, no laboratory would hire a woman with a child and able to work only part-time, so I started work in Maurice's laboratory for 2 h a day. Two more sons came along 3 and 4 years apart. Our income was very low and we could not afford baby-sitters. Moreover, in those days fathers did not participate in the daily care of the offspring. My mother came to my rescue because she understood my passion for science, and so with the last two babies she left the family in Chile and came to help me for 8 months each trip. With her overseeing the children I was able to increase the hours I spent in the laboratory. The focus of Maurice's research at that time was to isolate mutants that grow normally but have aberrant morphogenesis (11Sussman R. Sussman M.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1956: 125-154Google Scholar). In 1958 we moved to the biology department of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts (with a professorship for Maurice but no academic appointment for me) where we found excellent graduate students and an exciting scientific atmosphere. The chairman of biochemistry, Nathan Kaplan, was a genius in recruiting young scientists with creative minds. He arranged to have our laboratory adjacent to the biochemistry laboratories. People that happened to meet in the hall started to talk about their latest scientific results, which led to open discussions. I would not have been able to learn the latest techniques in molecular biology and apply them to slime molds without the daily contact with Julius Marmur (15Marmur J. Doty P. Determination of the base composition of deoxyribonucleic acid from its thermal denaturation temperature.J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 5: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar) (who was so generous in sharing the latest information), Larry Grossman (16Kaplan J.C. Kushner S.R. Grossman L. Enzymatic repair of DNA; purification of two enzymes involved in the excision of thymine dimmers from ultraviolet-irradiated DNA..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Molecular growth requirements of single mammalian cells.Science. 1957; 126: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) among others (Figs. 2 and 3). I continued to collaborate with the ongoing research in our laboratory, which had more students and post-docs (18Sussman R. Sussman M. Ennis H.L.

Brandeis University, 1970.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In 1961, we took a sabbatical year to work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. I chose to work with François Jacob and upon arrival told him that I was interested in studying repressors of lysogenic viruses. These bacterial viruses, upon infection, had a choice of either expressing most of their genes, thereby reproducing, lysing the host, and producing clear plaques on the bacterial lawn or expressing only two genes (CI and CII), which repressed all the lytic genes and produced turbid plaques. At that time the repressors were inferred from clear plaque mutations in these two loci that complemented each other. Their chemical nature was still unknown because they had not been isolated yet. François went to his stock of lambda phages and gave me vials of several mutants that according to him were ""bizarre."" I plated them; they all had the clear phenotype, but their complementation to the CI group was peculiar. I kept plating them but had no clue why they behaved differently. Serendipity again occurred one day when I removed the agar plates from the 37 °C incubator and all the plaques of the λ CI 857 mutant were turbid. I immediately looked at the temperature of the incubator, and it was 1 degree lower, which meant that the mutation produced a temperature-sensitive repressor, implying that it was a protein. After determining all the parameters affecting its induction (the denaturation curve was very sharp with a Tm at 36–37 °C) we published the paper in Comptes Rendus (23Sussman R. Jacob F. Sur un systeme de repression thermosensible chez le bacteriophage lambda d'Escherichia coli..C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1962; 254: 1517-1519Google Scholar). One day François told me that Jacques Monod had suggested that if repressors are proteins, I should be able to isolate mutants that are clear on the regular Escherichia coli indicator strain but turbid in suppressor strains of E. coli, because these strains contain mutant tRNAs that insert the right amino acid in response to the mutated codon, producing active repressor. I succeeded in isolating several mutants, and we published these results again in Comptes Rendus (24Jacob F. Sussman R. Monod J. Sur la nature du represseur assurant l'immunite des bacteries lysogenes.C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1962; 254: 4214-4216Google Scholar). These mutants were very useful later in constructs of plasmids with genes inducible by shifts in temperature. They also allowed Mark Ptashne to isolate and purify lambda repressor (25Ptashne M. Isolation of the lambda phage repressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 306-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). My detailed data on the properties of these phages were never published in an English journal, but upon my return I was invited to present the work at the Department of Genetics of Yale University and at Harvard Medical School. Back at Brandeis, Maurice started to focus on the appearance and disappearance of proteins during morphogenesis (26Sussman M. Protein synthesis and the temporal control of genetic transcription during slime mold development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and I analyzed the RNA metabolism, comparing the growing cells to the differentiating ones (27Sussman R. RNA metabolism during cytodifferentiation in the cellular slime mold Polysphondelium pallidum.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 149: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For this project I had to use Polysphondelium pallidum, a slime mold that was able to grow axenically, finding that ribosomal RNA was synthesized continually, including through the process of differentiation, at a time when not only the nutrients were absent but when the cells were degrading the existing RNA and protein (26Sussman M. Protein synthesis and the temporal control of genetic transcription during slime mold development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The common knowledge at the time was that ""shift-down"" conditions were correlated with inhibition of ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein synthesis. We speculated that the mRNA synthesized during differentiation required specialized ribosomes coded from different genes than the ones used in the vegetative state. To answer that question, I took advantage of a hybridization procedure that had just been designed by Gillespie and Spiegelman (28Gillespie D. Spiegelman S. A quantitative assay for DNA-RNA hybrids with DNA immobilized on a membrane.J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) based on competition hybridization of labeled rRNAs from vegetative and differentiating cells to P. pallidum DNA. We showed that both ribosomal messages competed equally well for the complementary DNA sequences, indicating that the same genes coded them. As a control we used Dictyostelium discoideum DNA, which only allowed partial competition as expected from a different rRNA sequence (27Sussman R. RNA metabolism during cytodifferentiation in the cellular slime mold Polysphondelium pallidum.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 149: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The other hypothesis that new messenger RNA has to be transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by nascent ribosomes remains untested. While we were speculating about ribosomes, Alexander Rich at MIT showed that proteins were synthesized in large ribosomal aggregates, which he called polyribosomes (29Kiho Y. Rich A. Induced enzyme formed on polyribosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). I collaborated with his post-doc, W. D. Phillips, showing that the primitive slime molds also synthesized proteins in polyribosomes (30Phillips W.D. Rich A. Sussman R. The isolation and identification of polyribosomes from cellular slime molds.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 80: 508-510PubMed Google Scholar). During those 22 years that I worked on Dictyostelium I never received any remuneration. Maurice and I had agreed that it was not ethical to ask a granting agency to pay the wife of the principal investigator. I am reflecting on this only to stress how unfair the treatment of women in science was in those times and in our case how brainwashed scientists could be. In 1973 I became independent to pursue my own choice of scientific problems when we accepted an invitation to work at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. I was appointed ""Martze Bahir"" (equivalent to Associate Professor) in the Department of Molecular Biology at Hadassah Medical School. I had my own laboratory and started to work on a problem that interested me greatly: the phenomenon of ""SOS repair"" in bacteria. The publication of Evelyn Witkin (31Witkin E.M. The radiation sensitivity of Escherichia coli B: a hypothesis relating filament formation and prophage induction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) had inspired me, and even before I had the possibility of working on that problem I already had a hypothesis to explain why damage to the bacterial chromosome or inhibition of DNA replication elicited a number of seemingly unrelated phenomena: cessation of cell division, inhibition of septum formation leading to filamentation, increased mutagenesis, production of colicin and de-repression of lysogenic viruses. I had learned a great deal about DNA repair from Larry Grossman and proposed that the affected genes were controlled by repressors such as those in lambda phage that were present at a very low concentration sufficient to inhibit transcription of its operon. During repair of the chromosome several intermediates of the DNA helix are produced and if the repressors had affinity for a specific DNA repair product they would bind to it when present, thus decreasing the effective concentration needed to silence their own operators. At Hebrew University I finally had a chance to test the hypothesis, and serendipity brought me Hanna BenZeev, who applied to be my technician. She was extremely competent and intelligent. To prove the hypothesis, we used a competition filter binding assay with extracts of lambda repressor and radioactive DNA and showed that E. coli DNA did not compete in the binding of repressor to lambda DNA, whereas DNA extracted from bacteria undergoing SOS repair did compete. Moreover, the non-inducible repressor (ind–), used as control, did not compete. Also, increasing the DNA damage of the bacteria resulted in DNA with increased interference in the competition assay (32Sussman R. BenZeev H. A proposed mechanism of bacteriophage lambda induction: acquisition of binding sites for the lambda repressor by the induced host DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1973-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Only two and a half years later, when we moved to the University of Pittsburgh, I had a chance to purify repressor and to prepare E. coli DNA containing different specific lesions in Larry Grossman's laboratory. We proved that lambda repressor had a greater affinity for double-stranded DNA containing single strand gaps (33Sussman R. Resnick J. Calame K. Baluch J. Interaction of bacteriophage lambda repressor with non-operator DNA containing single strand gaps.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it turned out that my hypothesis was wrong; Roberts, Roberts, and Mount (34Roberts J.W. Roberts C.W. Mount D.W. Inactivation and proteolytic cleavage of phage lambda repressor in vitro in an ATP-dependent reaction..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) established that RecA was the protein that bound to ssDNA and was activated to cleave the repressors. I still have the intuition that the affinity of repressors for gapped ssDNA is necessary to increase their local concentration at the RecA/ssDNA catalytic site. Serendipity continued at the University of Pittsburgh, where two of the brightest graduate students applied to work in my laboratory: Jim Resnick and John Baluch. We established many important parameters of the SOS repair mechanism (35Baluch J. Sussman R. Resnick J. Induction of prophage without amplification of recA protein.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Baluch J. Chase J.W. Sussman R.

E. coli single-strand DNA binding protein from wild type and lexC113 mutant affects in vitro proteolytic cleavage of phage lambda repressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interaction of single-strand binding protein and RecA protein at the single-strand DNA site..J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At that time I had to work very hard to get tenure: teaching new courses every semester, getting good evaluations from students, publishing enough articles, and of course receiving continued support from NIH and NSF. The grants lasted long after I got tenure, took early retirement from the University of Pittsburgh at 66, and became an Associate Scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. The move was motivated by our desire to be close to our children, who lived in Massachusetts. I am fascinated by RecA, a mere 37.8-kDa protein that is the physiological equivalent of the vertebrate p53, because it exhibits a great number of sophisticated enzymatic activities necessary to protect the bacterial cell from diverse injuries (for review see Ref. 40Walker G.C. Mutagenesis and inducible responses to deoxyribonuleic acid damage in Escherichia coli.Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein forms a helical complex with ssDNA and NTP for all these activities. One subset of the activities requires a high RecA/DNA ratio and no hydrolysis of NTP (the co-protease activity and D loop formation) whereas the other subset requires NTPase activity necessary for recombination of two homologous duplexes. The work that I consider my best is postulating that RecA undergoes an allosteric change in structure/function dictated by the number of nucleotides available when forming the required ternary complex (41Sussman R. Sharma S.K. Kuzirian A. Catalytic activities of recA protein are dependent on the lattice length of the single-strand DNA ligand..Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The dynamics envisioned for a cell that undergoes a DNA lesion is as follows. When pol III encounters a distorted chromosome, it cannot proceed replicating the DNA, giving rise to small ssDNA gaps. SSB present in a large concentration in the cell binds to the ssDNA to protect it from DNases. Chrysogelos and Griffith (42Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Escherichia coli single-strand binding protein organizes single-stranded DNA in nucleosome-like units..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) established that SSB organizes the ssDNA into nucleosome-like loops linked by 30 bases free of protein. We have shown that RecA binds to these linkers with a stoichiometry of 8 RecA monomers per linker, that is 3–4 nucleotides/monomer (39Cohen S.P. Resnick J. Sussman R. Interaction of single-strand binding protein and RecA protein at the single-strand DNA site..J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This turns out to be the saturated complex, exhibiting the highest co-protease activity, designated state ""a"" (RecA*). Thus, the complex proceeds to catalyze the cleavage of LexA thereby derepressing the genes under its control, including recA, sfiA, and umuD, which have to be cleaved by RecA* to become a subunit of pol V. This polymerase is competent to replicate DNA containing lesions, which is probably repressed under normal cell life because it is error prone. Pol V proceeds to enlarge the ssDNA gap, thus allowing RecA to contact more nucleotide phosphates. RecA then changes to state ""b,"" which is proficient as an ATPase, thereby becoming a recombinase. If this were correct, it would be the first example of a protein responding to the specific temporal requirements of the cell by changing catalytic activities. Despite the excellent studies performed analyzing complexes of RecA with ssDNA and dsDNA, we still do not know its atomic interactions with DNA, which requires crystallization. Until now that task was unattainable because of the dynamism of the system. Our contribution to this problem is to show that small oligos, in the presence of ATPγS, retain enzymatic activities and are very stable; the RecA/dT16 behaves like a saturated complex catalyzing the self-cleavage of repressors, whereas RecA/dT24 has ATPase activity necessary for ssDNA recombination (40Walker G.C. Mutagenesis and inducible responses to deoxyribonuleic acid damage in Escherichia coli.Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). I believe that these stable complexes will be easy to crystallize, thus helping to establish their structure/function. I am very fortunate to have witnessed the birth and development of molecular biology. I am extremely grateful to Susana Levy and Jane McLaughlin for correcting a draft of this article and providing many helpful comments."
