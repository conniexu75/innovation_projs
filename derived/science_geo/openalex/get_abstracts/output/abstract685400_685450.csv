To examine these attributes systematically, we profiled metastatic biopsies and matched organoid models at single-cell resolution. In vivo, we identify a new intermediate PDAC transcriptional cell state and uncover distinct site- and state-specific tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Benchmarking models against this reference map, we reveal strong culture-specific biases in cancer cell transcriptional state representation driven by altered TME signals. We restore expression state heterogeneity by adding back in vivo-relevant factors and show plasticity in culture models. Further, we prove that non-genetic modulation of cell state can strongly influence drug responses, uncovering state-specific vulnerabilities. This work provides a broadly applicable framework for aligning cell states across in vivo and ex vivo settings, identifying drivers of transcriptional plasticity and manipulating cell state to target associated vulnerabilities."

The safety and efficacy of gene therapies rely upon expressing a transgene in affected cells while minimizing off-target expression. Here we show organ-specific targeting of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids after intravenous delivery, which we achieved by employing a Cre-transgenic-based screening platform and sequential engineering of AAV-PHP.eB between the surface-exposed AA452 and AA460 of VP3. From this selection, we identified capsid variants that were enriched in the brain and targeted away from the liver in C57BL/6J mice. This tropism extends to marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), enabling robust, non-invasive gene delivery to the marmoset brain after intravenous administration. Notably, the capsids identified result in distinct transgene expression profiles within the brain, with one exhibiting high specificity to neurons. The ability to cross the blood-brain barrier with neuronal specificity in rodents and non-human primates enables new avenues for basic research and therapeutic possibilities unattainable with naturally occurring serotypes."

However, the study of infodemics is relatively new, and little is known about their relationship with epidemics management. Here, we discuss unresolved issues and propose research directions to enhance preparedness for future health crises. The COVID-19 information epidemic, or “infodemic,” demonstrates how unlimited access to information may confuse and influence behaviors during a health emergency. However, the study of infodemics is relatively new, and little is known about their relationship with epidemics management. Here, we discuss unresolved issues and propose research directions to enhance preparedness for future health crises. The COronaVIrus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shown the critical role of information diffusion in health emergencies and crisis management. The complexities of science knowledge and the scientific method are difficult to communicate to a broad audience—especially in light of heterogeneity in science literacy (Ruths, 2019Ruths D. The misinformation machine.Science. 2019; 363: 348Google Scholar). This context tends to yield extreme oversimplifications (e.g., zero risk/critical risk) that may polarize narratives. At the same time, the ongoing revisions of evidence and an overabundant and changing information landscape may induce confusion for policy-makers and civil society (Gallotti et al., 2020Gallotti R. Valle F. Castaldo N. Sacco P. De Domenico M. Assessing the risks of ‘infodemics’ in response to COVID-19 epidemics.Nat. Hum. Behav. 2020; 4: 1285-1293Google Scholar; Tangcharoensathien et al., 2020Tangcharoensathien V. Calleja N. Nguyen T. Purnat T. D’Agostino M. Garcia-Saiso S. Landry M. Rashidian A. Hamilton C. AbdAllah A. et al.Framework for managing the COVID-19 infodemic: methods and results of an online, crowdsourced WHO technical consultation.J. Med. Internet Res. 2020; 22: e19659Google Scholar). For example, the problem of vaccine hesitancy seems to be related to an eroded trust in institutions fueled by misinformation spreading. Such a process has been called an information epidemic or “infodemic,” and it is a clear example of how virtually unlimited online access to information may influence events unfolding in the physical world. Our grasp of what an “infodemic” is and how it happens is still shallow and evolving. A possible reason for the mist around the term “infodemic” may reside in its very nature of an intuitive umbrella term that, however, includes many ramifications ranging from communication to epidemiology and that links to several open scientific debates such as that on misinformation spreading and its effects on society (Simon and Camargo, 2021Simon F.M. Camargo C.Q. Autopsy of a metaphor: The origins, use and blind spots of the ‘infodemic’.new media & society. 2021; : 1-22https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211031908Google Scholar). To be more specific, the term “infodemic,” intended to mean an “epidemic of information,” was introduced by Rothkopf, 2003Rothkopf, D.J. (2003) When the Buzz Bites Back. The New York Times. May 11, 2003. 1https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2003/05/11/when-the-buzz-bites-back/bc8cd84f-cab6-4648-bf58-0277261af6cd/.Google Scholar to define the amplification effect of the news about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to information technologies. A more recent definition of “infodemic” emphasized the element of misinformation spreading rapidly through social media platforms and other outlets (Zarocostas, 2020Zarocostas J. How to fight an infodemic.Lancet. 2020; 395: 676Google Scholar). However, misinformation does not fully capture the complexity of the phenomenon, which seems to be strongly related to the evolving business model of information dissemination, currently dominated by social media (Cinelli et al., 2020Cinelli M. Quattrociocchi W. Galeazzi A. Valensise C.M. Brugnoli E. Schmidt A.L. Zola P. Zollo F. Scala A. The COVID-19 social media infodemic.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 16598Google Scholar). In light of this, “infodemic” was redefined as “an overabundance of information—some accurate and some not—that occurs during an epidemic” (Tangcharoensathien et al., 2020Tangcharoensathien V. Calleja N. Nguyen T. Purnat T. D’Agostino M. Garcia-Saiso S. Landry M. Rashidian A. Hamilton C. AbdAllah A. et al.Framework for managing the COVID-19 infodemic: methods and results of an online, crowdsourced WHO technical consultation.J. Med. Internet Res. 2020; 22: e19659Google Scholar). The uptake of an infodemic definition that does not directly tackle the concept of misinformation seems to point toward a bigger problem than the “true vs false” dichotomy, naturally limited by the fact that the concept of truth may differ across social groups. For this reason, other aspects related to human behavior, particularly the tendency of individuals to select information confirming their beliefs and ignore dissenting information (Del Vicario et al., 2016Del Vicario M. Bessi A. Zollo F. Petroni F. Scala A. Caldarelli G. Stanley H.E. Quattrociocchi W. The spreading of misinformation online.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 554-559Google Scholar), should be taken into account to better understand the infodemic process. Indeed, it is reasonable to hypothesize that behaviors are important for infodemic development as much as they impact the epidemic sphere by altering the chains of disease transmission (e.g., using masks, teleworking, and quarantining to reduce infection spread). However, it remains to be fully established the extent to which the infodemic affects behaviors that, in turn, may be relevant to the dynamics of pandemics. The apparent analogies between epidemics and infodemics have led to the suggestion that scientists and policy-makers can investigate, model, and monitor the two phenomena similarly (Scales et al., 2021Scales D. Gorman J. Jamieson K.H. The Covid-19 Infodemic—Applying the Epidemiologic Model to Counter Misinformation.N Engl J Med. 2021; 385: 678-681Google Scholar). Here, we argue that an infodemic, although intertwined with an epidemic, is a distinct phenomenon resulting from many interacting and overlapping processes such as the production, consumption, and amplification of (potentially harmful) information online. Thus, these processes’ analogies, differences, and interplay must be considered to develop practical guidelines for managing and preventing future epidemics. This paper aims to spark discussions and collaboration to enhance preparedness for future health crises and improve the ability to anticipate the economic and social impact of policies put in place. We start by outlining analogies between epidemics and infodemics, as well as critical differences. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of considering them as mutually dependent and interacting phenomena also pointing out specific challenges for the future. Hopefully, a deeper understanding of the relationship between infodemics and epidemics will lead to insights that allow early prediction of epidemiological trends and effective management of communication during epidemic outbreaks and vaccination campaigns. Information diffusion and social contagion processes are often characterized using epidemic or epidemic-inspired models, to the extent that rapidly sharing information is said to be “going viral.” However, information and epidemic spreading also entail critical differences. Epidemic. For epidemic processes of infectious diseases, the root cause is identifiable in a pathogen with certain biological features (e.g., infectious period, transmissibility, asymptomatic forms of infection) that spreads in a population through contacts between humans. During an epidemic, infectious agents belong to a single strain, although variants of the original agent may emerge over time. Infodemic. For what concerns an infodemic, the agent is represented by a message broadcast in a given medium (e.g., a particular conspiracy theory in a viral video, a statistic on vaccine efficacy in a tweet). Such a message can appear in many forms depending on the communication channel and not necessarily be deceptive or harmful. Unlike the relationship between a pathogen and a host, the message is subject to the audience’s interpretation and it can be perceived as hostile due to cognitive processes, misinterpretations, and the way it is presented on the medium. Epidemic. For epidemics, the medium is represented by routes of transmission (e.g., respiratory, oral-fecal route, sexual contacts) whose involvement depends also on the pathogen which mainly drives prevention strategies. Infodemic. In the case of infodemics, the medium is the communication channel. Conversely from the case of epidemics, the possible set of media able to fuel infodemic processes is constantly evolving with agents (messages) possibly navigating and mutating from medium to medium. Furthermore, while some media are subject to moderation that regulate their functioning some others are nearly impossible to monitor (e.g., dark web communities or closed online groups), thus making some routes of transmission essentially unobservable. Another subtle difference between epidemic and infodemic is the possibility of media platforms to tune the amount of information that one can retrieve both about them and about the agent under investigation. Two relevant examples are the case of Facebook narrowing the possibility to collect user data after the Cambridge Analytica issue or the case of Gab, an independent social media platform, accusing academics to smear their platform with a consequent downgrade of their API. Furthermore, due to phenomena such as media fragmentation, the user base can be extremely heterogeneous across communication channels as different media serve different purposes (exchanging opinions, watching the news, gaming) and entail a different level of attention to gather relevant information (watching TV versus reading a news article). Such a strong fragmentation of hosts for the pathogen across transmission routes seems to be more nuanced in the case of epidemics. Finally, while the number of routes of transmission is essentially open ended for the infodemic, it is not the case for epidemics (routes of transmission are neither infinite nor continuously evolving with the pathogen). Epidemic. The timescale depends on several factors, such as human behaviors relevant to the pathogen’s transmission route, the pathogen’s biological features, and the immune response of individuals. The evolution of an epidemic is usually made up of subsequent waves due to the accumulation of susceptible individuals over time. For example, according to simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-like models, epidemic waves take off when the basic reproductive number of the disease—a function of the features of the virus, the contact patterns, and the fraction of the population that is susceptible—surpasses the critical threshold. The infection of individuals, then transitioning to an immune or recovered state, leads over time to an epidemic wave, followed by a decreasing incidence of cases given a diminishing proportion of susceptible individuals. Beyond the natural evolution of an epidemic, waves may occur when population immunity is partial and public health measures are temporary. Upon the cessation of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions and social measures (Perra, 2021Perra N. Non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A review.Phys. Rep. 2021; 913: 1-52Google Scholar), susceptible population members are more likely to be exposed to the pathogen (Di Domenico et al., 2020Di Domenico L. Pullano G. Sabbatini C.E. Boëlle P.-Y. Colizza V. Impact of lockdown on COVID-19 epidemic in Île-de-France and possible exit strategies.BMC Med. 2020; 18: 240Google Scholar). Infodemic. At the moment of writing, the timescale of an infodemic is a key factor that still requires a post hoc investigation in order to be formalized. Nonetheless, previous studies displayed how the dynamics of information spreading are based on social contagion, the spread of ideas, attitudes, norms, or behavioral patterns from person to person through social influence, imitation, and conformity. Social contagion depends on users’ attitudes, tendencies, intentionality, social influence, and ties; therefore, its strength and duration are likely to depend upon several factors, such as pre-existing beliefs, polarization on a topic and its complexity, the extent to which information is considered reliable, and users’ engagement. Considering such dynamics, the wavy evolution of an epidemic could be disregarded by the infodemic, whereas the production of new information regarding the disease could be continuous and potentially decoupled from epidemic waves. Epidemic. The process of epidemic spreading relies on the patterns of contacts along which transmission occurs (individuals who have a connection are at risk for transmission). For epidemic processes, physical proximity and/or interaction with the agent or infectious hosts are required to transmit the disease by means of specific behaviors such as social gathering, sex, etc. Networks of interactions and average daily contacts may be heterogeneous across geographical areas (the higher the number of contacts in a time unit, the higher the velocity to develop and spread the infection), and non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially reduce the density and frequency at which (new) links occur. Infodemic. In the case of an infodemic, the transmission is remote and has no potential boundaries in terms of geographical scale. Furthermore, information spreading is becoming more and more rapid due to disintermediated communication and content production allowed by social media. Therefore networks of interaction, such as those underlying social media, are beyond any geographical boundary and reshape continuously around new topics with users segregating in echo chambers (where questionable information proliferates with more ease) and with recommendation algorithms that may reinforce shared narratives and foster individual polarization (Cinelli et al., 2021Cinelli M. De Francisci Morales G. Galeazzi A. Quattrociocchi W. Starnini M. The echo chamber effect on social media.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 (e2023301118)Google Scholar). Relatedly, the current technological infrastructure for information diffusion leaves room for strategic campaigns attempting to influence the information ecosystem (information operations) where certain agents may act as (super)spreaders (Ferrara et al., 2016Ferrara E. Varol O. Davis C. Menczer F. Flammini A. The rise of social bots.Commun. ACM. 2016; 59: 96-104Google Scholar). Epidemic. Depending on the availability of a vaccine, immunization campaigns and non-pharmaceutical interventions represent a milestone for controlling and possibly stopping disease epidemics. Furthermore, epidemiologic surveillance can be implemented efficiently to protect the risk categories and or contain outbreaks by guiding preventive interventions that may target specific population groups. In general, according to the biological characteristics of agents and route of transmission, several control measures can be implemented, such as isolating the source of infection and preserving individuals from contacts; protecting individuals through NPI; or implementing mass immunization or targeted immunization when the population at risk is clearly identifiable. Infodemic. The case for immunization campaigns and immunity to an infodemic is less clear. Investing in building capacities for critical thinking (e.g., science literacy and media literacy) and other practices such as pre-bunking (Roozenbeek et al., 2020Roozenbeek J. van der Linden S. Nygren T. Prebunking interventions based on “inoculation” theory can reduce susceptibility to misinformation across cultures. Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). Misinformation Review, 2020https://doi.org/10.37016//mr-2020-008Google Scholar) may help to blunt an infodemic’s negative impact. However, the potential impact of an “immunization strategy” in an infodemic, intended to encourage health-positive behaviors when facing polarization and conspiracy theories, is debated (Soveri et al., 2021Soveri A. Karlsson L.C. Antfolk J. Lindfelt M. Lewandowsky S. Unwillingness to engage in behaviors that protect against COVID-19: the role of conspiracy beliefs, trust, and endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine.BMC Public Health. 2021; 21: 684Google Scholar). National or community-wide movement restrictions, and other public health measures such as isolation or quarantine, do not have a clear counterpart in the online realm, and equivalent restrictions may not have a similar effect. For instance, removing content or banning a user from a platform may be incompatible with respect to freedom of expression and makes it more difficult for public health teams to identify population concerns. Furthermore, strong moderation policies may cause mass migration on other platforms and thus result in unintended consequences such as further segregation and a rise of less regulated and monitored fringe communities. Nonetheless, both infodemics and epidemics can be counteracted individually (for example through vaccination and skill-building) and collectively (through physical distancing and changing social norms). Protective behavior against outbreaks is associated with the notion of health risk, and individual behaviors and attitudes can vary due to risk perception. On the contrary, being exposed to an infodemic may not be perceived as a risk for personal health and safety or as a threat at all, despite posing a significant health risk. The apparent analogies between epidemics and online infodemics are summarized in Table 1.Table 1The main analogies between epidemics and infodemicsFeaturesEpidemicsInfodemicsAgentInfectious agent (i.e., virus, bacterium, fungus, parasite…)Type of message in a given medium (e.g., particular conspiracy theory in a viral video, a statistic on vaccine efficacy in a tweet)MediumRoute of transmission (respiratory, oral-fecal route, sexual contacts…)Communication channel (news, social media platform, newsgroup, radio program, blog…)TimescaleInfectious period, reproductive numberHow quickly information spreads and accumulates, including the persistence of mis- and dis-informationNetwork of interactionThe pattern of contacts along which transmission occurs (individuals who have a contact at risk for transmission)Communication network for the user and content interaction (nodes of transmission, interconnectedness, clustering, homophily, content filtering algorithms)Control measuresActions to limit the epidemic (vaccination campaigns, non-pharmaceutical interventions, epidemiological surveillance)Actions to limit the infodemic (skill building, science and media literacy, pre-bunking) Open table in a new tab While the interplay between information about the disease and disease propagation has long been identified as a key challenge in epidemiology, the infodemic during the COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of how the information ecosystem and narratives may influence behaviors and public health outcomes. How the people perceive an epidemic may potentially impact choices that individuals, communities, and authorities make for infection prevention and control, with possible adverse effects such as:•Authorities’ delays in identifying, developing, and implementing effective and appropriate policies based on the best available information at the time. This is typical of “new” epidemics, where spread mechanisms can be very different from those of previously known outbreaks. Conversely, adopting appropriate policies leading to a substantial reduction of the infection rate may make people underestimate the seriousness of an issue. Early success might also lead people to disbelieve there was an actual issue or emergency to be addressed. Often, logical cause-effect links are lost.•A community may reject policies and expert advice. This is more likely when an infodemic erodes trust in institutions, generally exacerbated by economic crises and rumors or misinformation. Acceptance of policies depends on a myriad of factors: identity, values, education, and more. Proper policies may eventually be perceived as inappropriate due to the infodemic process making the outcome of policy efforts, in the context of a dynamic society with lower resistance and resilience to misinformation, difficult to predict. Beyond the initial perception of epidemics by authorities and citizens, which may reduce the effectiveness of the very first countermeasures from preventing epidemic spreading, infodemics may undermine vaccination campaigns. Vaccinations have always been a central topic in mis- and disinformation environments, often related to conspiracy theories, and infodemics may increase the number of people believing in such theories, especially from the pool of individuals with low epidemics-related culture (e.g., low understanding of biological immunization mechanism, or mathematical effect of exponential growths), leading to less diffused immunization. Another issue is related to adverse events following immunization (AEFI), whose occurrence may lead to a negative hype about vaccine safety. Therefore, since information signals and trends may precede and foreshadow variations in vaccination coverage and incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, the behavior of the time lag between these events is a field for further study. There is significant potential to develop social listening methods for openly shared information to feed into epidemiological surveillance and early warning systems. The intersection between infodemics and epidemics represents one of the most critical areas for future studies to improve preparedness and population health globally. Indeed, social media radically changed the mechanism by which we access information and form our opinions. We need to better understand how individuals acquire or avoid information and how those decisions may influence their behavior. Despite the several projects and initiatives aimed at providing correct information to users, the impact of this information on personal choices is still an open issue."
https://openalex.org/W4200040888,"In understanding circuit operations, a key problem is the extent to which neuronal spiking reflects local computation or responses to upstream inputs. We addressed this issue in the hippocampus by performing combined optogenetic and pharmacogenetic local and upstream inactivation. Silencing the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) largely abolished extracellular theta and gamma currents in CA1 while only moderately affecting firing rates. In contrast, CA3 and local CA1 silencing strongly decreased firing of CA1 neurons without affecting theta currents. Each perturbation reconfigured the CA1 spatial map. However, the ability of the CA1 circuit to support place field activity persisted, maintaining the same fraction of spatially tuned place fields and reliable assembly expression as in the intact mouse. Thus, the CA1 network can induce and maintain coordinated cell assemblies with minimal reliance on its inputs, but these inputs can effectively reconfigure and assist in maintaining stability of the CA1 map."
https://openalex.org/W4200389756,"African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boar and is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The ASFV virion contains a long double-stranded DNA genome, which encodes more than 150 proteins. However, the immune escape mechanism and pathogenesis of ASFV remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the pyroptosis execution protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a new binding partner of ASFV-encoded protein S273R (pS273R), which belongs to the SUMO-1 cysteine protease family. Further experiments demonstrated that ASFV pS273R-cleaved swine GSDMD in a manner dependent on its protease activity. ASFV pS273R specifically cleaved GSDMD at G107-A108 to produce a shorter N-terminal fragment of GSDMD consisting of residues 1 to 107 (GSDMD-N1-107). Interestingly, unlike the effect of GSDMD-N1-279 fragment produced by caspase-1-mediated cleavage, the assay of LDH release, cell viability, and virus replication showed that GSDMD-N1-107 did not trigger pyroptosis or inhibit ASFV replication. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism involved in the inhibition of ASFV infection-induced pyroptosis, which highlights an important function of pS273R in inflammatory responses and ASFV replication."
https://openalex.org/W4200110365,"The anterior insular cortex (aIC) plays a critical role in cognitive and motivational control of behavior, but the underlying neural mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that aIC neurons expressing Fezf2 (aICFezf2), which are the pyramidal tract neurons, signal motivational vigor and invigorate need-seeking behavior through projections to the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). aICFezf2 neurons and their postsynaptic NTS neurons acquire anticipatory activity through learning, which encodes the perceived value and the vigor of actions to pursue homeostatic needs. Correspondingly, aIC → NTS circuit activity controls vigor, effort, and striatal dopamine release but only if the action is learned and the outcome is needed. Notably, aICFezf2 neurons do not represent taste or valence. Moreover, aIC → NTS activity neither drives reinforcement nor influences total consumption. These results pinpoint specific functions of aIC → NTS circuit for selectively controlling motivational vigor and suggest that motivation is subserved, in part, by aIC's top-down regulation of dopamine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4200176496,"Bangladesh positioned as third rice producing country in the world. In Bangladesh, regional growth and trend in rice production determinants, disparities and similarities of rice production environments are highly desirable. In this study, the secondary time series data of area, production, and yield of rice from 1969–70 to 2019–20 were used to investigate the growth and trend by periodic, regional, seasonal and total basis. Quality checking, trend fitting, and classification analysis were performed by the Durbin-Watson test, Exponential growth model, Cochrane-Orcutt iteration method and clustering method. The production contribution to the national rice production of Boro rice is increasing at 0.97% per year, where Aus and Aman season production contribution significantly decreased by 0.48% and 0.49% per year. Among the regions, Mymensingh, Rangpur, Bogura, Jashore, Rajshahi, and Chattogram contributed the most i.e., 13.9%, 9.8%, 8.6%, 8.6%, 8.2%, and 8.0%, respectively. Nationally, the area of Aus and Aman had a decreasing trend with a -3.63% and -0.16% per year, respectively. But, in the recent period (Period III) increasing trend was observed in the most regions. The Boro cultivation area is increasing with a rate of 3.57% per year during 1984–85 to 2019–20. High yielding variety adoption rate has increased over the period and in recent years it has found 72% for Aus, 73.5% for Aman, and 98.4% for Boro season. As a result, the yield of the Aus, Aman, and Boro seasons has been found increasing growth for most of the regions. We have identified different cluster regions in different seasons, indicating high dissimilarities among the rice production regions in Bangladesh. The region-wise actionable plan should be taken to rapidly adopt new varieties, management technologies and extension activities in lower contributor regions to improve productivity. Cluster-wise, policy strategies should be implemented for top and less contributor regions to ensure rice security of Bangladesh."

https://openalex.org/W4200498631,"In this paper we analyze panel data (N = 400) to investigate the change in attitudes towards the Covid-19 measures and the change in compliance behavior between the first and second lockdowns in a sample of young adults from the University of Bern, Switzerland. We find considerable fatigue. While respondents expressed high acceptance of and compliance with the Covid-19 measures during the first lockdown, both acceptance and compliance behavior decreased substantially during the second lockdown. Moreover, we show via a structural equation model that respondents' compliance behavior is largely driven by the perception of how others behave and by the acceptance of the Covid-19 measures. All other effects scrutinized e.g., individual and social risk perception, trust in politics, and pro-social orientations affect compliance behavior via the acceptance of Covid-19 measures. We also conduct two tests of causality of the estimated relation between attitudes towards the measures and social distancing behavior. The first test incorporates the effect of compliance behavior reported during the first lockdown on attitudes during the second lockdown. The second test involves estimating a first difference panel regression model of attitudes on compliance behavior. The results of both tests suggest that the effect of Covid-19 attitudes on social distancing behavior can be interpreted causally."
https://openalex.org/W4226253489,"Proper regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics is critical for cellular processes including cell division and intracellular transport. Plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) dynamically track growing MTs and play a key role in MT regulation. +TIPs participate in a complex web of intra- and inter- molecular interactions known as the +TIP network. Hypotheses addressing the purpose of +TIP:+TIP interactions include relieving +TIP autoinhibition and localizing MT regulators to growing MT ends. In addition, we have proposed that the web of +TIP:+TIP interactions has a physical purpose: creating a dynamic scaffold that constrains the structural fluctuations of the fragile MT tip and thus acts as a polymerization chaperone. Here we examine the possibility that this proposed scaffold is a biomolecular condensate (i.e., liquid droplet). Many animal +TIP network proteins are multivalent and have intrinsically disordered regions, features commonly found in biomolecular condensates. Moreover, previous studies have shown that overexpression of the +TIP CLIP-170 induces large ""patch"" structures containing CLIP-170 and other +TIPs; we hypothesized that these structures might be biomolecular condensates. To test this hypothesis, we used video microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). Our data show that the CLIP-170-induced patches have hallmarks indicative of a biomolecular condensate, one that contains +TIP proteins and excludes other known condensate markers. Moreover, bioinformatic studies demonstrate that the presence of intrinsically disordered regions is conserved in key +TIPs, implying that these regions are functionally significant. Together, these results indicate that the CLIP-170 induced patches in cells are phase-separated liquid condensates and raise the possibility that the endogenous +TIP network might form a liquid droplet at MT ends or other +TIP locations."

Here, we explored women's participation in ecology conferences by analyzing female representation, behavior, and personal experience at the 1st Meeting of the Iberian Society of Ecology (SIBECOL). The conference had 722 attendees, 576 contributions, and 27 scientific sessions. The gender of attendees and presenters was balanced (48/52% women/men), yet only 29% of the contributions had a woman as last author. Moreover, men presented most of the keynote talks (67%) and convened most of the sessions. Our results also showed that only 32% of the questions were asked by women, yet the number of questions raised by women increased when the speaker or the convener was a woman. Finally, the post-conference survey revealed that attendees had a good experience and did not perceive the event as a threatening context for women. Yet, differences in the responses between genders suggest that women tended to have a worse experience than their male counterparts. Although our results showed clear gender biases, most of the participants of the conference failed to detect it. Overall, we highlight the challenge of increasing women's scientific leadership, visibility and interaction in scientific conferences and we suggest several recommendations for creating inclusive meetings, thereby promoting equal opportunities for all participants."

Investigating the influential profiles, which have been examined insufficiently, will help to inform the reduction of SSB consumption. The present research examines the current trend in SSB consumption and associated factors among children in China, in order to inform policy development.Secondary data was extracted from China's Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS; 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011), a repeated cross-sectional research, and a Chi-squared test was applied to compare SSB consumption in the last year, queried by social demographical, `environmental, behavioral, and parental factors. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was employed to examine the trend and effects of the multiple factors.A total of 6015 Chinese children aged 6-17 years were investigated. From 2004 to 2011, the percentage of SSB consumption in children increased from 72.6% to 90.3%. The prevalence in urban areas was higher than the prevalence in rural areas, higher in high schools than primary and middle schools, higher in east coast affluent provinces than other provinces, and higher in high-income households than low-income households. Other associated factors include children's fast food and salty snacks preference, level of physical activity, sedentariness, and parental education. The strongest association with SSB consumption in children was the mother's SSB consumption (adjusted odds ratio: 5.54, 95% CI: 3.17-9.67).Children's SSB consumption has increased significantly in China, and is associated with socio-economic, demographic, level of physical activity, food preference, and parental factors. Future strategies aimed at reducing SSB consumption among children need to consider these factors."
https://openalex.org/W4225553143,"How the functions of multicellular organs emerge from the underlying evolution of cell types is poorly understood. We deconstructed evolution of an organ novelty: a rove beetle gland that secretes a defensive cocktail. We show how gland function arose via assembly of two cell types that manufacture distinct compounds. One cell type, comprising a chemical reservoir within the abdomen, produces alkane and ester compounds. We demonstrate that this cell type is a hybrid of cuticle cells and ancient pheromone and adipocyte-like cells, executing its function via a mosaic of enzymes from each parental cell type. The second cell type synthesizes benzoquinones using a chimera of conserved cellular energy and cuticle formation pathways. We show that evolution of each cell type was shaped by coevolution between the two cell types, yielding a potent secretion that confers adaptive value. Our findings illustrate how cooperation between cell types arises, generating new, organ-level behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4226479312,"Background Individuals recovering from COVID-19 are known to have antibodies against the Spike and other structural proteins. Antibodies against Spike have been shown to display viral neutralization. However, not all antibodies against Spike have neutralizing ability although they may be cross-reactive. There is a need for easy-to-use SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing assays for the determination of virus-neutralizing activity in sera of individuals. Here we describe a PCR-based micro‐neutralization assay that can be used to evaluate the viral neutralization titers of serum from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Methods The SARS-CoV-2 strain used was isolated from a nasopharyngeal specimen of a COVID-19 case. The limiting dilution method was used to obtain a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of Vero cells. For the micro‐neutralization assay, 19 serum samples, with positive IgG titers against Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) were tested. After 24 hours, infected cells were inspected for the presence of a cytopathic effect, lysed and RNA RT-PCR conducted for SARS-CoV-2. PCR target Ct values were used to calculate percent neutralization/inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Results Out of 19 samples, 13 samples gave 100% neutralization at all dilutions, 1 sample showed neutralization at the first dilution, 4 samples showed neutralization at lower dilutions, while one sample did not demonstrate any neutralization. The RBD ODs and neutralization potential percentages were found to be positively correlated. Conclusion We describe a rapid RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. This can effectively be used to test the antiviral activity of serum antibodies for the investigation of both disease-driven and vaccine-induced responses."
https://openalex.org/W4200357230,"Fibronectin (FN), an essential component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is assembled via a cell-mediated process in which integrin receptors bind secreted FN and mediate its polymerization into fibrils that extend between cells, ultimately forming an insoluble matrix. Our previous work using mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells identified the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) and its binding to FN as essential for the formation of insoluble FN fibrils. In this study, we investigated the contributions of HS at an early stage of the assembly process using knockdown of exostosin-1 (EXT1), one of the glycosyltransferases required for HS chain synthesis. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with decreased EXT1 expression exhibited a significant reduction in both FN and type I collagen in the insoluble matrix. We show that FN fibril formation is initiated at matrix assembly sites, and while these sites were formed by cells with EXT1 knockdown, their growth was stunted compared with wild-type cells. The most severe defect observed was in the polymerization of nascent FN fibrils, which was reduced 2.5-fold upon EXT1 knockdown. This defect was rescued by the addition of exogenous soluble heparin chains long enough to simultaneously bind multiple FN molecules. The activity of soluble heparin in this process indicates that nascent fibril formation depends on HS more so than on the protein component of a specific HS proteoglycan. Together, our results suggest that heparin or HS is necessary for concentrating and localizing FN molecules at sites of early fibril assembly."
https://openalex.org/W4200590556,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of ozone ultrafine bubble water (OUFBW) on the formation and growth of Candida albicans ( C . albicans ) biofilms and surface properties of denture base resins. OUFBWs were prepared under concentrations of 6 (OUFBW6), 9 (OUFBW9), and 11 ppm (OUFBW11). Phosphate buffered saline and ozone-free electrolyte aqueous solutions (OFEAS) were used as controls. Acrylic resin discs were made according to manufacturer instructions, and C . albicans was initially cultured on the discs for 1.5 h. A colony forming unit (CFU) assay was performed by soaking the discs in OUFBW for 5 min after forming a 24-h C . albicans biofilm. The discs after initial attachment for 1.5 h were immersed in OUFBW and then cultured for 0, 3, and 5 h. CFUs were subsequently evaluated at each time point. Moreover, a viability assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Alamar Blue assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test were performed. To investigate the long-term effects of OUFBW on acrylic resin surface properties, Vickers hardness (VH) and surface roughness (Ra) were measured. We found that OUFBW9 and OUFBW11 significantly degraded the formed 24-h biofilm. The time point CFU assay showed that C . albicans biofilm formation was significantly inhibited due to OUFBW11 exposure. Interestingly, fluorescence microscopy revealed that almost living cells were observed in all groups. In SEM images, the OUFBW group had lesser number of fungi and the amount of non-three-dimensional biofilm than the control group. In the Alamar Blue assay, OUFBW11 was found to suppress Candida metabolic function. The qRT-PCR test showed that OUFBW down-regulated ALS1 and ALS3 expression regarding cell-cell, cell-material adhesion, and biofilm formation. Additionally, VH and Ra were not significantly different between the two groups. Overall, our data suggest that OUFBW suppressed C . albicans growth and biofilm formation on polymethyl methacrylate without impairing surface properties."
https://openalex.org/W4200085365,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many health systems in low resource settings to their knees. The pandemic has had crippling effects on the already strained health systems in provision of maternal and newborn healthcare. With the travel restrictions, social distancing associated with the containment of theCOVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers could be faced with challenges of accessing their work stations, and risked burnout as they offered maternal and newborn services. This study sought to understand the experiences and perceptions of healthcare providers at the frontline during the first phase of the lockdown as they offered maternal and newborn health care services in both public and private health facilities in Uganda with the aim of streamlining patient care in face of the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future disasters.Between June 2020 and December 2020, 25 in-depth interviews were conducted among healthcare providers of different cadres in eight Public, Private-Not-for Profit and Private Health facilities in Kampala, Uganda. The interview guide primarily explored the lived experiences of healthcare providers as they offered maternal and newborn healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the in depth interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Themes and subthemes were identified using both inductive thematic and phenomenological approaches.The content analysis of the in depth interviews revealed that the facilitators of maternal and newborn care service delivery among the healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic included; salary bonuses, the passion to serve their patients, availability of accommodation during the pandemic, transportation to and from the health facilities by the health facilities, teamwork, fear of losing their jobs and fear of litigation if something went wrong with the mothers or their babies. The barriers to their service delivery included; lack of transport means to access their work stations, fear of contracting COVID-19 and transmitting it to their family members, salary cuts, loss of jobs especially in the private health facilities, closure of the non-essential services to combat high patient numbers, inadequate supply of Personal Protective equipment (PPE), being put in isolation or quarantine for two weeks which meant no earning, brutality from the security personnel during curfew hours and burnout from long hours of work and high patient turnovers.The COVID-19 Pandemic has led to a decline in quality of maternal and newborn service delivery by the healthcare providers as evidenced by shorter consultation time and failure to keep appointments to attend to patients. Challenges with transport, fears of losing jobs and fear of contracting COVID-19 with the limited access to personal protective equipment affected majority of the participants. The healthcare providers in Uganda despite the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic are driven by the inherent passion to serve their patients. Availability of accommodation and transport at the health facilities, provision of PPE, bonuses and inter professional teamwork are critical motivators that needed to be tapped to drive teams during the current and future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4200504534,"Happiness levels often fluctuate from one day to the next, and an exogenous shock such as a pandemic can likely disrupt pre-existing happiness dynamics. This paper fits a Marko Switching Dynamic Regression Model (MSDR) to better understand the dynamic patterns of happiness levels before and during a pandemic. The estimated parameters from the MSDR model include each state's mean and duration, volatility and transition probabilities. Once these parameters have been estimated, we use the one-step method to predict the unobserved states' evolution over time. This gives us unique insights into the evolution of happiness. Furthermore, as maximising happiness is a policy priority, we determine the factors that can contribute to the probability of increasing happiness levels. We empirically test these models using New Zealand's daily happiness data for May 2019 -November 2020. The results show that New Zealand seems to have two regimes, an unhappy and happy regime. In 2019 the happy regime dominated; thus, the probability of being unhappy in the next time period (day) occurred less frequently, whereas the opposite is true for 2020. The higher frequency of time periods with a probability of being unhappy in 2020 mostly correspond to pandemic events. Lastly, we find the factors positively and significantly related to the probability of being happy after lockdown to be jobseeker support payments and international travel. On the other hand, lack of mobility is significantly and negatively related to the probability of being happy."
https://openalex.org/W4200530814,"The present study analysed the molecular and agro-morphological diversity in a set of 92 diverse cauliflower genotypes and two each of cabbage and broccoli. Field evaluation of the genotypes was done in randomized block design (RBD) at two locations (i.e. IARI, New Delhi and ICAR-RC-NEH Region, Barapani) during Rabi2019-20. Genotypes showed variation for all the eight observed traits at both locations and, the differences in early and snowball groups were distinct. Pusa Meghna, DC-33-8, Pusa Kartiki and CC-14 were earliest for curd initiation. Genotypes showed higher values for curd traits at Delhi. Molecular diversity was detected with 90 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR). Number of alleles ranged from 1 to 9 with mean value of 2.16 and the highest polymorphic information content (PIC) value was observed for primer BoGMS0742 (0.68) with a mean value of 0.18. Cluster analysis using agro-morphological traits substantiated classification of the genotypes for maturity groups. However, SSR analysis revealed four clusters and with a composite pattern of genotype distribution. STRUCTURE analysis also supported the admixture and four subpopulations. The studyindicates for introgression of genetic fragments across the maturity groups, thereby, potential for use in further genetic improvement and heterosis breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4226070825,"Modifications in sphingolipid (SL) metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics are key factors implicated in cancer cell response to chemotherapy, including chemotherapy resistance. In the present work, we utilized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, selected to be refractory to various chemotherapeutics, to explore the interplay between SL metabolism and mitochondrial biology supportive of multidrug resistance (MDR). In agreement with previous findings in cytarabine or daunorubicin resistant AML cells, relative to chemosensitive wildtype controls, HL-60 cells refractory to vincristine (HL60/VCR) presented with alterations in SL enzyme expression and lipidome composition. Such changes were typified by upregulated expression of various ceramide detoxifying enzymes, as well as corresponding shifts in ceramide, glucosylceramide, and sphingomyelin (SM) molecular species. With respect to mitochondria, despite consistent increases in both basal respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, direct interrogation of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system revealed intrinsic deficiencies in HL60/VCR, as well as across multiple MDR model systems. Based on the apparent requirement for augmented SL and mitochondrial flux to support the MDR phenotype, we explored a combinatorial therapeutic paradigm designed to target each pathway. Remarkably, despite minimal cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), co-targeting SL metabolism, and respiratory complex I (CI) induced synergistic cytotoxicity consistently across multiple MDR leukemia models. Together, these data underscore the intimate connection between cellular sphingolipids and mitochondrial metabolism and suggest that pharmacological intervention across both pathways may represent a novel treatment strategy against MDR."
https://openalex.org/W4200154322,"The CO2-fixing enzyme rubisco is responsible for almost all carbon fixation. This process frequently requires rubisco activase (Rca) machinery, which couples ATP hydrolysis to the removal of inhibitory sugar phosphates, including the rubisco substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). Rubisco is sometimes compartmentalized in carboxysomes, bacterial microcompartments that enable a carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism (CCM). Characterized carboxysomal rubiscos, however, are not prone to inhibition, and often no activase machinery is associated with these enzymes. Here, we characterize two carboxysomal rubiscos of the form IAC clade that are associated with CbbQO-type Rcas. These enzymes release RuBP at a much lower rate than the canonical carboxysomal rubisco from Synechococcus PCC6301. We found that CbbQO-type Rcas encoded in carboxysome gene clusters can remove RuBP and the tight-binding transition state analog carboxy-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate from cognate rubiscos. The Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans genome encodes two form IA rubiscos associated with two sets of cbbQ and cbbO genes. We show that the two CbbQO activase systems display specificity for the rubisco enzyme encoded in the same gene cluster, and this property can be switched by substituting the C-terminal three residues of the large subunit. Our findings indicate that the kinetic and inhibitory properties of proteobacterial form IA rubiscos are diverse and predict that Rcas may be necessary for some α-carboxysomal CCMs. These findings will have implications for efforts aiming to introduce biophysical CCMs into plants and other hosts for improvement of carbon fixation of crops."
https://openalex.org/W4200184436,"Oxidative stress is emerging as a contributing factor to the homeostasis in cystic diseases. However, the role antioxidant enzymes play in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) remains elusive. Peroxiredoxin 5 (Prdx5) is an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of H2 O2 and alkyl hydroperoxide and plays an important role in different biological processes. In this study, we show that Prdx5 is downregulated in a PKD mutant mouse model and ADPKD patient kidneys. Knockdown of Prdx5 resulted in the formation of cysts in a three-dimensional mouse inner medullar collecting duct (IMCD) cell Matrigel culture system. The mechanisms of Prdx5 deficiency mediated cyst growth include: (1) induction of oxidative stress as indicated by increased mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1, an oxidant stress marker; (2) activation of Erk, S6 and mTORC1, which contribute to cystic renal epithelial cell proliferation and cyst growth; (3) abnormal centrosome amplification and multipolar spindle formation which result in genome instability; (4) upregulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora kinase A, important mitotic kinases involved in cell proliferation and ciliogenesis; (5) impaired formation of primary cilia in mouse IMCD3 and retinal pigment epithelial cells, which could be rescued by inhibiting Plk1 activity; and (6) restraining the effect of Wnt3a and Wnt5a ligands on primary cilia in mouse IMCD3 cells, while regulating the activity of the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in a separate cilia independent mechanism, respectively. Importantly, we found that targeting Plk1 with its inhibitor, volasertib, delayed cyst growth in Pkd1 conditional knockout mouse kidneys. Together, these findings indicate that Prdx5 is an important antioxidant that regulates cyst growth via diverse mechanisms, in particular, the Prdx5-Plk1 axis, and that induction and activation of Prdx5, alone or together with inhibition of Plk1, represent a promising strategy for combatting ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W4200244480,"Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain incompletely understood, especially among ambulatory, non-hospitalized individuals. With host factors, symptoms predictive of SARS-CoV-2 could be used to guide testing and intervention strategies.Between March 16 and September 3, 2020, we examined the characteristics and symptoms reported by individuals presenting to a large outpatient testing program in the Southeastern US for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing. Using self-reported symptoms, demographic characteristics, and exposure and travel histories, we identified the variables associated with testing positive using modified Poisson regression.Among 20,177 tested individuals, the proportion positive was 9.4% (95% CI, 9.0-9.8) and was higher for men, younger individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities (all P<0.05); the positivity proportion was higher for Hispanics (26.9%; 95% CI. 24.9-29.0) compared to Blacks (8.6%; 95% CI, 7.6-9.7) or Whites (5.8%; 95% CI, 5.4-6.3). Individuals reporting contact with a COVID-19 case had the highest positivity proportion (22.8%; 95% CI, 21.5-24.1). Among the subset of 8,522 symptomatic adults who presented for testing after May 1, when complete symptom assessments were performed, SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR was detected in 1,116 (13.1%). Of the reported symptoms, loss of taste or smell was most strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with an adjusted risk ratio of 3.88 (95% CI, 3.46-4.35). The presence of chills, fever, cough, aches, headache, fatigue and nasal congestion also significantly increased the risk of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, while diarrhea or nausea/vomiting, although not uncommon, were significantly more common in those with a negative test result. Symptom combinations were frequent with 67.9% experiencing ≥4 symptoms, including 19.8% with ≥8 symptoms; report of greater than three symptoms increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.In a large outpatient population in the Southeastern US, several symptoms, most notably loss of taste or smell, and greater symptom burden were associated with detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Persons of color and those with who were a contact of a COVID-19 case were also more likely to test positive. These findings suggest that, given limited SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, symptom presentation and host characteristics can be used to guide testing and intervention prioritization."
https://openalex.org/W4200627034,"Molecular-bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by low levels of vaginal Lactobacillus species and is associated with higher risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Perceived psychosocial stress is associated with increased severity and persistence of infections, including STIs. American Indians have the highest rates of stress and high rates of STIs. The prevalence of molecular-BV among American Indian women is unknown. We sought to evaluate measures of psychosocial stress, such as historic loss (a multigenerational factor involving slavery, forced removal from one's land, legally ratified race-based segregation, and contemporary discrimination) and their association with the vaginal microbiota and specific metabolites associated with BV, in 70 Northwestern Plains American Indian women. Demographics, perceived psychosocial stressors, sexual practices, and known BV risk factors were assessed using a modified version of the American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Risk and Protective Factors Project survey. Self-collected mid-vaginal swabs were profiled for bacterial composition by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolites quantified by targeted liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Sixty-six percent of the participants were classified as having molecular-BV, with the rest being either dominated by L. crispatus (10%) or L. iners (24%). High levels of lifetime trauma were associated with higher odds of having molecular-BV (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 2.5, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.1-5.3). Measures of psychosocial stress, including historic loss and historic loss associated symptoms, were significantly associated with lifestyle and behavioral practices. Higher scores of lifetime trauma were associated with increased concentrations of spermine (aFC: 3.3, 95% CrI: 1.2-9.2). Historic loss associated symptoms and biogenic amines were the major correlates of molecular-BV. Historical loss associated symptoms and lifetime trauma are potentially important underlying factors associated with BV."
https://openalex.org/W4226030793,"The importance of implementing new methodologies to study the ever-increasing amount of Covid-19 data is apparent. The aftermath analysis of these data could inform us on how specific political decisions influenced the dynamics of the pandemic outbreak. In this paper we use the Italian outbreak as a case study, to study six different Covid indicators collected in twenty Italian regions. We define a new object, the Covidome, to investigate the network of functional Covid interactions between regions. We analyzed the Italian Covidome over the course of 2020, and found that Covid connectivity between regions follows a sharp North-South community gradient. Furthermore, we explored the Covidome dynamics and individuated differences in regional Covid connectivity between the first and second waves of the pandemic. These differences can be associated to the two different lockdown strategies adopted for the first and the second wave from the Italian government. Finally, we explored to what extent Covid connectivity was associated with the Italian geographical network, and found that Central regions were more tied to the structural constraints than Northern or Southern regions in the spread of the virus. We hope that this approach will be useful in gaining new insights on how political choices shaped Covid dynamics across nations."
https://openalex.org/W4200000770,"3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a compound derived from the digestion of indole-3-carbinol, found in the broccoli family. It induces apoptosis and autophagy in some types of human cancer. DIM extends lifespan in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The mechanisms by which DIM induces apoptosis and autophagy in humans and expands lifespan in fission yeasts are not fully understood. Here, we show that DIM induces apoptosis and autophagy in log-phase cells, which is dose-dependent in fission yeast. A high concentration of DIM disrupted the nuclear envelope (NE) structure and induced chromosome condensation at an early time point. In contrast, a low concentration of DIM induced autophagy but did not disrupt NE structure. The mutant defective in autophagy was more sensitive to a low concentration of DIM, demonstrating that the autophagic pathway contributes to the survival of cells against DIM. Moreover, our results showed that the lem2 mutant is more sensitive to DIM. NE in the lem2 mutant was disrupted even at the low concentration of DIM. Our results demonstrate that the autophagic pathway and NE integrity are important to maintain viability in the presence of a low concentration of DIM. The mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy induction by DIM might be conserved in fission yeast and humans. Further studies will contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy by DIM in fission yeast and humans."

This study aims to determine the risk factors associated with mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural Mozambique.Retrospective case-control study in a rural area of Bilene District, on the coast of southern Mozambique, performed from January 2017 to June 2018. The analysis considered the clinical data of HIV exposed children with definitive HIV positive results and their respective infected mothers (cases), and the data of HIV exposed children with definitive HIV negative results and their respective infected mothers (controls) registered in At Risk Child Clinics from 1st January 2017 to 30th June 2018 at the Macia and Praia de Bilene health facilities in Bilene district, Gaza province-Mozambique.Ninety pregnant women with HIV were involved in the study, including 30 who had transmitted the infection to their children and 60 who had not. Statistical analysis, adjusted for maternal age and gestational age at first antenatal care visit, showed that independent risk factors for transmission were gestational age at first visit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.36), non-adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (56.7% vs. 5%; aOR 14.12, 95% CI 3.15-63.41); a viral load of 1000 copies/mL or more (90% vs. 5%; aOR: 156, 95% CI 22.91-1,062) and female sex of the neonate (80% vs. 51.7%; aOR: 4.43, 95% CI 1.33-15.87).A high viral load and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy are important predictors of mother-to-child HIV transmission."

In this Scandinavian case study, we investigate how accessibility to EHC varies spatially in order to reveal potential socio-spatial disparities in access. Distinct measures of EHC accessibility were calculated for southern Sweden in a network analysis using a Geographical Information System (GIS) based on data from 2018. An ANOVA test was carried out to investigate how accessibility vary for different measures between urban and rural areas, and negative binominal regression modelling was then carried out to assess potential disparities in accessibility between socioeconomic and demographic groups. Areas with high shares of older adults show poor access to EHC, especially those in the most remote, rural areas. However, rurality alone does not preclude poor access to EHC. Education, income and proximity to ambulance stations were also associated with EHC accessibility, but not always in expected ways. Despite indications of a well-functioning EHC, with most areas served within one hour, socio-spatial disparities in access to EHC were detected both between places and population groups."
https://openalex.org/W4200544563,"Background Hepatitis B and C are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with prevalence among the highest in the World. However, several challenges impede the progression towards the elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030 as suggested by the World Health Organization Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis, including the lack of knowledge on the scale of this epidemic in the region. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis B and C among female sex workers (FSW) in Togo. Methods This ancillary study from a national cross-sectional bio-behavioral study was conducted in 2017 using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method, in eight towns of Togo among FSW. Socio-demographic, behavioral and sexual characteristics were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for HIV, hepatitis B and C serological testing. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and a logistic regression model. Results Out of the 1,036 FSW recruited for this study, biological analyses for viral hepatitis were completed for 769 of them. The median age was 26 years [IQR: 22–33] and 49.8% (n = 383) had attained secondary school. The prevalence of hepatitis B was 9.9% [95% CI: (7.9–12.2)] and the prevalence of hepatitis C was 5.3% [95% CI: (3.9–7.2)]. Higher hepatitis B and C prevalence was associated with recruitment out of Lomé (aOR: 6.63; 95%CI: 3.51–13.40, p &lt; 0.001 and OR: 2.82; 95% CI: [1.37–5.99]; p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and, for hepatitis B, with never using condoms for vaginal intercourse (OR: 3.14; 95%CI: [1.02–8.71]; p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Results from this study reveals high prevalence of hepatitis B and C among FSW in Togo and an opportunity for advocacy toward the introduction of immunizations and treatment in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4226214174,"Early life stress (ELS) is an important risk factor for the development of depression. Impairments in reward learning and feedback sensitivity are suggested to be an intermediate phenotype in depression aetiology therefore we hypothesised that healthy adults with a history of ELS would exhibit reward processing deficits independent of any current depressive symptoms. We recruited 64 adults with high levels of ELS and no diagnosis of a current mental health disorder and 65 controls. Participants completed the probabilistic reversal learning task and probabilistic reward task followed by depression, anhedonia, social status, and stress scales. Participants with high levels of ELS showed decreased positive feedback sensitivity in the probabilistic reversal learning task compared to controls. High ELS participants also trended towards possessing a decreased model-free learning rate. This was coupled with a decreased learning ability in the acquisition phase of block 1 following the practice session. Neither group showed a reward induced response bias in the probabilistic reward task however high ELS participants exhibited decreased stimuli discrimination. Overall, these data suggest that healthy participants without a current mental health diagnosis but with high levels of ELS show deficits in positive feedback sensitivity and reward learning in the probabilistic reversal learning task that are distinct from depressed patients. These deficits may be relevant to increased depression vulnerability."

Early identification of patients at increased risk incident-HF may allow for focused allocation of preventative care resources. Health information exchange (HIE) data span the entire spectrum of clinical care, but there are no HIE-based clinical decision support tools for diagnosis of incident-HF. We applied machine-learning methods to model the one-year risk of incident-HF from the Maine statewide-HIE.We included subjects aged ≥ 40 years without prior HF ICD9/10 codes during a three-year period from 2015 to 2018, and incident-HF defined as assignment of two outpatient or one inpatient code in a year. A tree-boosting algorithm was used to model the probability of incident-HF in year two from data collected in year one, and then validated in year three. 5,668 of 521,347 patients (1.09%) developed incident-HF in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the model c-statistic was 0.824 and at a clinically predetermined risk threshold, 10% of patients identified by the model developed incident-HF and 29% of all incident-HF cases in the state of Maine were identified.Utilizing machine learning modeling techniques on passively collected clinical HIE data, we developed and validated an incident-HF prediction tool that performs on par with other models that require proactively collected clinical data. Our algorithm could be integrated into other HIEs to leverage the EMR resources to provide individuals, systems, and payors with a risk stratification tool to allow for targeted resource allocation to reduce incident-HF disease burden on individuals and health care systems."

Disposal of solid medical waste (SMW) was assessed by questionnaire-based surveys, unstructured interviews and field observations. Microbiological analysis identified species and counts of bacteria present in SMW from both sources. Sociodemographic factors influencing the method of SMW disposal in households were evaluated using logistic regression analysis, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. Open burning (29%), burying (25%) and disposal at a dumpsite (49%) were common methods used by households to discard SMW. SMW disposal at a dumpsite was associated with age of respondents in households. Older people (50+ years) were three times more likely to place SMW in household waste later discarded at a dumpsite, compared to younger persons (20-30 years) [a0R, 95%CI = 3.37, 1.41-8.02]. In sub-district level healthcare facilities, open burning and burying were the most common methods used.

Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp. and Clostridium tetani were found exclusively in untreated SMW generated in the healthcare facilities. Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were found in one sample of treated SMW. The microbial load in SMW from healthcare facilities and households ranged from 0.036 x 103cfc/mg to 0.167 x 103 cfc/mg and from 0.118 x 103cfc/mg to 0.125 x 103cfc/mg respectively. This highlights the need for institutionalizing appropriate treatment methods in sub-district level facilities or strengthening the linkages with higher level facilities to ensure regular and adequate treatment of SMW. Public guidance on management of SMW generated in households which is context specific should also be provided."

The study seeks to examine the foundation and potential of forest green food industry in Yunnan Province. By constructing the industrial competitive advantage model, this paper measured and analyzed the competitiveness of forest green food industry in Yunnan Province from 2016 to 2020 by using fuzzy evaluation method and AHP. The conclusions were as follows: (1) The competitiveness of forest green food industry in Yunnan Province was at a medium level with competitiveness index of 83.98. (2) The competitive advantage of forest green food industry in Yunnan Province mainly depended on key factors such as natural endowment and education level. The area is however not having comparative advantage in general factors and important factors. Therefore, there is the need to put in place measures to realise the full potential of forest green food industry in the area by providing players in the sector with requisite skills."
https://openalex.org/W4200282646,"Person-centred maternity care (PCMC) is acknowledged as essential for achieving improved quality of care during labour and childbirth. Yet, evidence of healthcare providers' perspectives of person-centred maternity care is scarce in Nigeria. This study, therefore, examined the perceptions of midwives on person-centred maternity care (PCMC) in Enugu State, South-east Nigeria.This study was conducted in seven public hospitals in Enugu metropolis, Enugu State, South-east Nigeria. A mixed-methods design, involving a cross-sectional survey and focus group discussions (FGDs) was used. All midwives (n = 201) working in the maternity sections of the selected hospitals were sampled. Data were collected from February to May 2019 using a self-administered, validated PCMC questionnaire. A sub-set of midwives (n = 56), purposively selected using maximum variation sampling, participated in the FGDs (n = 7). Quantitative data were entered, cleaned, and analysed with SPSS version 20 using descriptive and bivariate statistics and multivariate regression. Statistical significance was set at alpha 0.05 level. Qualitative data were analysed thematically.The mean age of midwives was 41.8 years ±9.6 years. About 53% of midwives have worked for ≥10 years, while 60% are junior midwives. Overall, the prevalence of low, medium, and high PCMC among midwives were 26%, 49% and 25%. The mean PCMC score was 54.06 (10.99). High perception of PCMC subscales ranged from 6.5% (dignity and respect) to 19% (supportive care). Midwives' perceived PCMC was not significantly related to any socio-demographic characteristics. Respectful care, empathetic caregiving, prompt initiation of care, paying attention to women, psychosocial support, trust, and altruism enhanced PCMC. In contrast, verbal and physical abuses were common but normalised. Midwives' weakest components of autonomy and communication were low involvement of women in decision about their care and choice of birthing position. Supportive care was constrained by restrictive policy on birth companion, poor working conditions, and cost of childbirth care.PCMC is inadequate in public hospitals as seen from midwives' perspectives. Demographic characteristics of midwives do not seem to play a significant role in midwives' delivery of PCMC. The study identified areas where midwives must build competencies to deliver PCMC."
https://openalex.org/W4200453113,"Successive orchard plantings of almond and other Prunus species exhibit reduced growth and yield in many California soils. This phenomenon, known as Prunus replant disease (PRD), can be prevented by preplant soil fumigation or anaerobic soil disinfestation, but its etiology is poorly understood and its incidence and severity are hard to predict. We report here on relationships among physicochemical variables, microbial community structure, and PRD induction in 25 diverse replant soils from California. In a greenhouse bioassay, soil was considered to be ""PRD-inducing"" when growth of peach seedlings in it was significantly increased by preplant fumigation and pasteurization, compared to an untreated control. PRD was induced in 18 of the 25 soils, and PRD severity correlated positively with soil exchangeable-K, pH, %clay, total %N, and electrical conductivity. The structure of bacterial, fungal, and oomycete communities differed significantly between the PRD-inducing and non-inducing soils, based on PERMANOVA of Bray Curtis dissimilarities. Bacterial class MB-A2-108 of phylum Actinobacteria had high relative abundances among PRD-inducing soils, while Bacteroidia were relatively abundant among non-inducing soils. Among fungi, many ASVs classified only to kingdom level were relatively abundant among PRD-inducing soils whereas ASVs of Trichoderma were relatively abundant among non-inducing soils. Random forest classification effectively discriminated between PRD-inducing and non-inducing soils, revealing many bacterial ASVs with high explanatory values. Random forest regression effectively accounted for PRD severity, with soil exchangeable-K and pH having high predictive value. Our work revealed several biotic and abiotic variables worthy of further examination in PRD etiology."
https://openalex.org/W4200535616,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Demographic differential has been linked with the treatment outcome and survival in recent literature, mostly from the developed world. Considering diversity in population characteristics across income strata, it's worth assessing the link in low- and middle-income population as well. Current study aimed to assess the association of demographic characteristics with lung cancer survival in Bangladeshi lung cancer patients.All newly diagnosed primary lung cancer cases attending the national institute of cancer research & Hospital (NICRH), a tertiary cancer care center in Dhaka, Bangladesh between 2018 and 2019 were considered for the study. Demographic information and clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical records by a trained physician. Survival estimate was generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across demographic and clinicopathological categories using the log-rank test. Hazard ratio and 95% CI for treatment options are generated fitting multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. Among 1868 patients, 84.6% were males and 15.4% were females, average (± standard deviation) age at diagnosis was 59.6±10.9 years, only 10.8% had not consumed tobacco of any form. Around two-thirds of the patient had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score ≥2, 29.5% had at least one comorbidity and 19.4% had metastasis at the time of presentation. Higher survival was associated with institutional education (HR 0.9; 95% CI 0.77, 0.99), and receipt of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.46, 0.65; p <0.001). In contrast, lower survival was associated with older age between 60-69 years (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.3, 1.5;), age ≥ 70 years (HR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.7), having any comorbidity (HR 1.1; 95% CI 1.0, 1.3), with ECOG score ≥ 3 (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.01, 1.96) and receipt of radiotherapy treatments only (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3, 1.9).Older age, presence of one or more comorbidity, poorer performance status, and treatment with only RT appeared as a significant predictor of poorer prognosis of lung cancer in Bangladeshi patients. In contrast, having institutional education and treatment with combined Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy appeared as a predictor of a better prognosis. The finding of this study could serve as a basis for future studies inquiring into novel approaches for certain subgroups of patients believed to be challenged in limited resources."

While data from additional cohorts with longitudinal measurements are needed, PWH are a target population for lung cancer screening with LDCT."
https://openalex.org/W4200309440,"SP16 is an innovative peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminus of α1-Antitrypsin (AAT), corresponding to residues 364-380, and contains recognition sequences for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). LRP1 is an endocytic and cell-signaling receptor that regulates inflammation. Deletion of Lrp1 in Schwann cells increases neuropathic pain; however, the role of LRP1 activation in nociceptive and neuropathic pain regulation remains unknown. Herein, we show that SP16 is bioactive in sensory neurons in vitro. Neurite length and regenerative gene expression were increased by SP16. In PC12 cells, SP16 activated Akt and ERK1/2 cell-signaling in an LRP1-dependent manner. When formalin was injected into mouse hind paws, to model inflammatory pain, SP16 dose-dependently attenuated nociceptive pain behaviors in the early and late phases. In a second model of acute pain using capsaicin, SP16 significantly reduced paw licking in both male and female mice (p < .01) similarly to enzymatically inactive tissue plasminogen activator, a known LRP1 interactor. SP16 also prevented development of tactile allodynia after partial nerve ligation and this response was sustained for nine days (p < .01). Immunoblot analysis of the injured nerve revealed decreased CD11b (p < .01) and Toll-like receptor-4 (p < .005). In injured dorsal root ganglia SP16 reduced CD11b+ cells (p < .05) and GFAP (p < .005), indicating that inflammatory cell recruitment and satellite cell activation were inhibited. In conclusion, administration of SP16 blocked pain-related responses in three distinct pain models, suggesting efficacy against acute nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain. SP16 also attenuated innate immunity in the PNS. These studies identify SP16 as a potentially effective treatment for pain."
https://openalex.org/W4200345190,"Numerous field experiments based on the correspondence testing procedure have documented that gender bias influences personnel selection processes. Nowadays, algorithms and job platforms are used for personnel selection processes because of their supposed neutrality, efficiency, and costs savings. However, previous research has shown that algorithms can exhibit and even amplify gender bias. The present research aimed to explore a possible gender bias in automated-job alerts generated in InfoJobs, a popular job platform in Spain. Based on the correspondence testing procedure, we designed eight matched resumes in which we manipulated the gender of the candidate for two different professional sectors (female-dominated vs. male-dominated) and two different levels of age (24 vs. 38). We examined the 3,438 offers received. No significant differences were observed in the automated-job alerts received by female and male candidates as a function of occupation category, salary, and the number of long-term contracts included in the alerts. However, we found significant differences between the female-dominated and the male-dominated sectors in all the mentioned variables. Some limitations and implications of the study are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W4200358262,"Globally, epilepsy is the commonest neurological disorder in adults. It has significant health and economic consequences to the affected individuals and the family. There is ample evidence that epileptic patients are at increased risk of poor sleep quality than the general population. However, there is limited evidence on sleep quality among epileptic patients and associated factors in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of poor sleep quality and associated factors among adult patients with epilepsy.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among adult epileptic patients attending follow-up care at referral hospitals in the Amhara region. A total of 575 epileptic patients were recruited using a stratified systematic random sampling technique. An interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire and record review were used for data collection. To assess sleep quality the pretested Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) tool was used. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with poor sleep quality. Variables with a p-value less than 0.2 in the bivariable binary logistic regression analysis were considered for the multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. In the multivariable binary logistic regression analysis, the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported to declare the statistical significance and strength of association. Model fitness was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and was adequate (p>0.05). Multicollinearity of the independent variables was assessed using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and the mean VIF was less than 10.A total of 565 participants were enrolled in the study with a response rate of 98.3%. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among adult epileptic patients was 68.8% [95% CI: 64.8%, 72.5%]. In the multivariable binary logistic regression, being unable to read and write [AOR = 3.16, 95%CI: 1.53, 6.51], taking polytherapy treatment [AOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.21], poor medication adherence [AOR = 2.53, 95%CI: 1.02, 6.23] and having poor support [AOR = 2.72, 95%CI: 1.53, 4.82] and moderate social support [AOR = 1.89, 95%CI: 1.05, 3.41] were significantly associated with higher odds of poor sleep quality.Poor sleep quality is a major public health concern in Ethiopia. The patient's level of education, number of medication use, medication adherence, and social support were found significant predictors of poor sleep quality. These findings highlight improving medication adherence and social support are effective strategies to improve the sleep quality of epileptic patients. Besides, it is better to give special emphasis to those epileptic patients with a low level of education and taking polytherapy to enhance sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W4200396138,"Coronavirus (Covid-19) is a respiratory disease mostly affecting old aged and those with comorbidities. Due to resource constraints in developing countries, control of Covid-19 was based on preventive measures. However, there is variation in adherence to these precautionary measures from place to place among communities. Therefore, this study assessed the practice of Covid-19 preventive measures and associated factors among residents of Southern, Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was employed on residents of Southern, Ethiopia. Interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect data from households through systematic random sampling methods. Data was entered, coded, and analyzed using STATA version 16. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between outcome variables and predictor variables. Finally, the interpretation of Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value was done for statistically significant factors of Covid-19 preventive measures practice.The proportion of residents who had good practice of Covid-19 preventive measures was 31.3% (95% CI: 26.5, 36.1). Out of 364 residents, 264 (72.5%) used facemasks, 218 (59.9%) washed their hands frequently, 167 (45.9%) practiced social distancing, 135 (37.1%) stayed at home, 75 (18.1%) avoided handshaking and 228 (62.6%) used hand sanitizer. Following government directions (AOR = 225; 95% CI: 68.6, 738), good knowledge about Covid-19 (AOR = 3.47; 95% CI: 1.12, 10.73), having access to water supply (AOR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.05, 8.18), belief towards protectiveness of preventive measure (AOR = 3.53; 95% CI: 1.08, 11.61) and chronic illness (AOR = 5.09; 95% CI: 1.44, 17.96) were significantly associated with practice of Covid-19 preventive measures.In this study, the proportion of residents practicing Covid-19 preventive measures was low. Having comorbidity, following government directions, knowledge about Covid-19 and access to water supply were significantly associated with Covid-19 preventive measures practice. Therefore, government and all concerned stakeholders should increase the accessibility of infrastructure and provide continuous awareness creation campaigns regarding Covid-19 mode of transmission, sign and symptom, and protectiveness of Covid-19 preventive measures. Moreover, dissemination of teaching aids using local languages and close monitoring of community compliance to Covid-19 preventive measures is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W4200411989,"Indigenous and other marginalized racial/ethnic minorities have poorer health status than majority populations, including higher rates of type 2 diabetes. These disparities have typically been addressed using a 'deficit-based' discourse that isolates disease management from the broader social, economic, political context and does not incorporate patient perspectives. We aimed to explore factors affecting glycemic control among Indigenous Arabs with diabetes in Israel using a strengths-based approach that centered participants' knowledge of their context, needs, resources and strengths. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed methods study, which included 10 focus groups (5 men's, 5 women's) and 296 quantitative in-person surveys. Participants with diagnosed diabetes were randomly drawn from the patient list of the largest healthcare service organization (survey response rate: 93%). Prominent and interconnected themes emerged from focus group discussions, including: diet, physical activity, and social, economic, mental/psychological and political stress. The discussions raised the need for adapting diabetes management approaches to incorporate participants' communal, physical and psychological well-being, and socioeconomic/political realities. The connections between these factors and diabetes management were also reflected in multivariable analyses of the survey data. Women (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.09-4.63), people with disabilities (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.28-4.64), and unemployed people (OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.28-5.44) had higher odds of economic barriers to diabetes management. Furthermore, female sex (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.25-4.09), unemployment (OR: 4.07; 95% CI: 1.64-10.10), and suboptimal glycemic control (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41 per 1-unit increase in HbA1c) were associated with moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. A pro-active, team-based healthcare approach incorporating Indigenous/minority participants' knowledge, experience, and strengths has the potential to improve individuals' diabetes management. Healthcare services should be structured in ways that enable providers to listen to their patients, address their key concerns, and foster their strengths."
https://openalex.org/W4200161400,"A recent research study on prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in Burundi reported high prevalence and endemicity of Theileria parva, Anaplasma marginale and Babesia bigemina infections in cattle. Detailed information about tick species infesting animals, their distribution and genetic diversity in Burundi is outdated and limited. This study therefore assessed the prevalence and genetic diversity of tick species infesting cattle across agroecological zones (AEZs) in Burundi. A cross-sectional study on the occurrence of tick species was conducted in 24 districts of Burundi between October and December 2017. Differential identification and characterization of ticks collected was conducted using tick morphological keys and molecular tools (cox1 and 12S rRNA gene). Chi-square test was used to test for association between agroecological zones and the prevalence of tick species. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using bayesian and maximum likelihood algorithms. A total of 483 ticks were collected from the five AEZs sampled. Six tick species comprising of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, R. sanguineus, R. evertsi evertsi, R. microplus, R. decoloratus and Amblyomma variegatum were observed. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus were the most prevalent ticks (~45%). A total of 138 specimens (28%) were found to be Rhipicephalus microplus, suggesting an emerging threat for cattle farmers. Twelve R. appendiculatus cox1 haplotypes were obtained from 106 specimens that were sequenced. Two cox1 haplotypes of R. microplus which clustered into previously reported Clade A were observed. Rhipicephalus sanguineus and R. evertsi evertsi ticks, the vectors of numerous zoonotic pathogens, were collected from cattle, which constitute a high risk for public health. These findings reveal an overlapping distribution of tick vectors in Burundi. The design of ticks and tick-borne diseases control strategies should consider the distribution of different vectors across the AEZs particularly the presence of the highly invasive R. microplus tick in Burundi and the potential risk of introducing the pathogenic Babesia bovis."

https://openalex.org/W4200333443,"Proper dendritic morphology is fundamental to nerve signal transmission; thus, revealing the mechanism by which dendrite arborization is regulated is of great significance. Our previous studies have found that the epigenetic molecule chromodomain Y-like (CDYL) negatively regulates dendritic branching. Current research mostly focuses on the processes downstream of CDYL, whereas the upstream regulatory process has not been investigated to date. In this study, we identified an upstream regulator of CDYL, the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (TRIM32), which promotes dendrite arborization by mediating the ubiquitylation and degradation of CDYL. By using mass spectrometry and biochemistry strategies, we proved that TRIM32 interacted with CDYL and mediated CDYL ubiquitylation modification in vivo and in vitro. Overexpressing TRIM32 decreased the protein level of CDYL, leading to an increase in the dendritic complexity of primary cultured rat neurons. In contrast, knocking down TRIM32 increased the protein level of CDYL and decreased the dendritic complexity. The truncated form of TRIM32 without E3 ligase activity (ΔRING) lost its ability to regulate dendritic complexity. Most importantly, knockdown of CDYL abolished the reduced complexity of dendrites caused by TRIM32 knockdown, indicating that the TRIM32-mediated regulation of dendritic development depends on its regulation of downstream CDYL. Hence, our findings reveal that TRIM32 could promote dendrite arborization by mediating CDYL degradation. This work initially defines a novel biological role of TRIM32 in regulating mechanisms upstream of CDYL and further presents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CDYL-related neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4200164276,"Coral reef fisheries are vital to the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide but are challenging to manage due to the high diversity of fish species that are harvested and the multiple types of fishing gear that are used. Fish traps are a commonly used gear in reef fisheries in the Caribbean and other regions, but they have poor selectivity and frequently capture juvenile fish, impacting the sustainability of the fishery. One option for managing trap fisheries is the addition of escape gaps, which allow small fish to escape. We compared catches of traps with and without two 2.5 cm (1 inch) escape gaps on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. No significant differences were found in the mean fish length, total fish biomass, number of fish, fish species richness, and Shannon diversity index between hauls of the two trap designs, though traps with escape gaps did catch larger proportions of wider-bodied fish and smaller proportions of narrow-bodied fish. Furthermore, traps with gaps caught a smaller proportion of small-sized fish and fewer immature fish (though differences were not statistically significant). Linear mixed effect models predict that soak time (the length of time between trap hauls) increases the mean catch length, total catch biomass and total number of species in the catch. The relatively modest evidence for the effect of the gaps on catch may be explained by the long soak times used, which could have allowed most smaller-sized fish to escape or be consumed by larger individuals before hauling in both traps with and without escape gaps. Despite the small differences detected in this study, escape gaps may still offer one of the best options for improving sustainability of catches from fish traps, but larger escape gaps should be tested with varying soak times to determine optimum escape gap size."
https://openalex.org/W4200285010,"The 'Iron Hypothesis' suggests a fertilization of the Southern Ocean by increased dust deposition in glacial times. This promoted high primary productivity and contributed to lower atmospheric pCO2. In this study, the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia subcurvata, known to form prominent blooms in the Southern Ocean, was grown under simulated glacial and interglacial climatic conditions to understand how iron (Fe) availability (no Fe or Fe addition) in conjunction with different pCO2 levels (190 and 290 μatm) influences growth, particulate organic carbon (POC) production and photophysiology. Under both glacial and interglacial conditions, the diatom grew with similar rates. In comparison, glacial conditions (190 μatm pCO2 and Fe input) favored POC production by P. subcurvata while under interglacial conditions (290 μatm pCO2 and Fe deficiency) POC production was reduced, indicating a negative effect caused by higher pCO2 and low Fe availability. Under interglacial conditions, the diatom had, however, thicker silica shells. Overall, our results show that the combination of higher Fe availability with low pCO2, present during the glacial ocean, was beneficial for the diatom P. subcurvata, thus contributing more to primary production during glacial compared to interglacial times. Under the interglacial ocean conditions, on the other hand, the diatom could have contributed to higher carbon export due to its higher degree of silicification."
https://openalex.org/W4200373308,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common allergic inflammatory diseases worldwide. In AR, increased blood flow and vascular permeability in nasal mucosa cause rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. We investigated the role of an 11Z,14Z-eicosadienoic acid-derived metabolite, 15-hydroxy-11Z,13Z-eicosadienoic acid (15-HEDE), in functional changes in vasculature and nasal congestion in AR. Repeated intranasal administration of Ovalbumin (OVA) caused AR symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal congestion, in mice. OVA administration increased the level of 15-HEDE in nasal lavage fluid, which reached approximately 0.6 ng/ml after ten OVA treatments. Upon measuring vascular contraction, treatment with 0.1-3 μM 15-HEDE did not cause contraction in mouse aortae, while it dilated aortae that were pre-contracted by thromboxane receptor stimulation. Pretreatment with the voltage-gated K+ (KV ) channel inhibitor 4-aminopyridine significantly inhibited the 15-HEDE-induced vascular relaxation. Intravital imaging showed that administration of 1 μg 15-HEDE dilated blood vessels, and Mile's assay demonstrated that this administration also caused dye leakage, indicating vascular hyperpermeability in mouse ears. Computed tomography scanning and morphological study revealed that administration of 3 μg 15-HEDE narrowed nasal passages and thickened nasal mucosa in mice. Finally, we confirmed that treating mice with 3 μg 15-HEDE caused rhinitis symptoms, such as abdominal breathing, and reduced respiratory frequency, suggesting nasal congestion. 15-HEDE caused vasodilation by activating KV channels and increased vascular permeability, which may lead to nasal congestion. Furthermore, 15-HEDE might be a new lipid mediator that exacerbates nasal congestion in AR."

Patients with HZI (ICD-10: B02) were retrospectively identified. Laryngeal diseases were defined by ICD-10 codes for five subgroups: 1) malignant disease, 2) benign disease, 3) vocal cord palsy, 4) inflammatory disease, and 5) reflux disease.Among the Korean population older than 20 years, 12,809 experienced HZI. Subjects with HZI were more likely to be older (mean age: 51.54 years vs. 48.06 years, p <0.0001). The proportion of subjects with laryngeal disease was higher in those with HZI than in those without HZI (55.55% vs. 41.37%, p <0.0001). Laryngeal disease was significantly associated with HZI in multiple regression analysis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.71-1.84) after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, cerebral stroke, and depression. Among laryngeal disease subgroups, inflammatory disease (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09) and reflux (OR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.15-1.25) were associated with HZI.HZI is independently associated with laryngitis. Results of this study have implications for etiological investigations and prevention strategies for laryngitis."
