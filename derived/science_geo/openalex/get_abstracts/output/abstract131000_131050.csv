https://openalex.org/W2001333805,"p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities were significantly increased in mouse hearts after chronic transverse aortic constriction, coincident with the onset of ventricular hypertrophy. Infection of cardiomyocytes with adenoviral vectors expressing upstream activators for the p38 kinases, activated mutants of MAP kinase kinase 3b(E) (MKK3bE) and MAP kinase kinase 6b(E) (MKK6bE), elicited characteristic hypertrophic responses, including an increase in cell size, enhanced sarcomeric organization, and elevated atrial natriuretic factor expression. Overexpression of the activated MKK3bE in cardiomyocytes also led to an increase in apoptosis. The hypertrophic response was enhanced by co-infection of an adenoviral vector expressing wild type p38β, and was suppressed by the p38β dominant negative mutant. In contrast, the MKK3bE-induced cell death was increased by co-infection of an adenovirus expressing wild type p38α, and was suppressed by the dominant negative p38α mutant. This provides the first evidence in any cell system for divergent physiological functions for different members of the p38 MAP kinase family. The direct involvement of p38 pathways in cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis suggests a significant role for p38 signaling in the pathophysiology of heart failure. p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities were significantly increased in mouse hearts after chronic transverse aortic constriction, coincident with the onset of ventricular hypertrophy.

The direct involvement of p38 pathways in cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis suggests a significant role for p38 signaling in the pathophysiology of heart failure. A variety of pathophysiological stimuli, such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, valvular diseases, viral myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to an increase in cardiac workload and elevated mechanical stress on cardiomyocytes. In response to hemodynamic overload, an adaptive hypertrophic response is triggered, which is characterized by an increase in the mass and volume of individual myocytes, resulting in an increase of heart weight without an increase in the number of cardiomyocytes (reviewed in Refs. 1Grossman W. Am. J. Med. 1980; 69: 576-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar and2Chien K.R. Zhu H. Knowlton K.U. Miller-Hance W. Van-Bilsen M. O'Brien T.X. Evans S.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). During the hypertrophic response, cardiomyocytes activate a distinct pattern of gene expression that eventually results in qualitative and quantitative alterations in contractile protein content and the induction of an embryonic gene program (3Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 4Simpson P.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 51: 189-202Crossref Google Scholar). As hemodynamic overload persists, the stressed heart enters a critical transition from compensatory hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure. Chamber dilatation, excitation-contraction uncoupling, abnormal interstitial morphology, sarcomeric disorganization, altered energy metabolism, and the loss of viable myocytes are common features found in end-stage failing hearts (5Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Braunwald E. Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 1626-1649Google Scholar). Signaling molecules that transduce the signals from this extracellular stress to different cellular compartments play central roles in mediating the hypertrophic process and the transition to heart failure. Accordingly, the identification and characterization of these signaling molecules have been the focus of intense study in recent years (6Lembo G. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 752: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One recently identified group of signaling molecules that mediates environmental stress responses in various cell types is the family of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; TAC, transverse aortic constriction; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiaziazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. kinases. The p38 MAP kinase activity is activated by dual phosphorylation on a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif in response to endotoxin, cytokines, physical stress (such as hyperosmolarity), and chemical stress (such as hydrogen peroxide) (7Han J.

Recently, it has been reported that in ischemia/reperfusion-treated hearts, p38 MAP kinase activities are elevated in association with the onset of hypertrophy and programmed cell death (30Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J.

In addition, p38 kinase activities are also significantly induced in transgenic mouse hearts expressing activated Ha-Ras(V12), correlating with the onset of cardiac hypertrophy. 2J. J. Hunter, M. Shimizu, J. Brown, V. P. Sah, K. Gottshall, C. Milano, R. Lefkowitz, J. H. Brown, and K. R. Chien, submitted for publication. However, the specific function of p38 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac cell apoptosis have not yet been directly demonstrated. The intracellular activation cascade for p38 MAP kinases under physiological conditions is still unclear, but several upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) have been identified from in vitroanalysis, including MKK3b and MKK6b (24Lin A.

Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 12Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D.

Two well characterized isoforms, α and β, share extensive sequence similarity and a broad range of tissue distribution, including relatively high levels in the heart (8Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 27Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegener J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

Although different isoforms of p38 have similar kinase activities in vitro on a given substrate, their specific functions under in vivophysiological conditions are largely unknown. The present study was designed to critically assess the potential function of the p38 pathway in the onset of features that relate to cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy and failure. The p38 MAP kinase activities are activated during hypertrophy following in vivo pressure overload, suggesting their potential role in signal transduction of mechanical stimuli. To dissect specific functions of the p38 MAP kinases, we utilized recombinant adenoviruses to achieve efficient expression of the p38 signaling molecules in cultured cardiomyocytes, which allowed biochemical as well as morphological analysis on entire cell populations. Forced activation of p38β activity results in characteristic features of hypertrophy, whereas the activation of p38α activity leads to the induction of myocyte apoptosis. The opposing effects of the p38 MAP kinase isoforms suggest that the activation of the p38 pathway may contribute to the development of hypertrophy and the transition to overt heart failure. Transverse thoracic aortic constriction was performed as described previously (32Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.R. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 33Rockman H.A. Ono A.S. Ross R.S. Jones L.R. Karimi M. Bhargava V. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, in the anesthetized animals, a 7–0 nylon suture ligature was tied against a 27-gauge needle at the transverse aorta to produce a 65–70% constriction following the removal of the needle. At 4 h or 7 days after surgery, animals from the experimental and sham-operated groups were killed and the hearts removed. Ventricular chambers were weighed and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing activated MKK3bE, MKK6bE, wild type p38α, wild type p38β and their corresponding dominant negative (TGY → AGF) mutants, p38αdn and p38βdn, driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter were generated as described previously (22Huang S.

Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3932-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, recombinant adenoviruses expressing GFP and Ha-Ras-v were generated using cDNAs from pEGFP (CLONTECH) and mutant Ha-Ras(V12) (35Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). All recombinant adenoviruses were tested for transgene expression in cardiac myocytes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, or kinase assays. The concentrated recombinant adenoviruses were prepared and titered as described (34Wang Y. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3932-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared using a Percoll gradient method as described previously (36Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myocytes from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were plated in serum-containing medium (4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:medium 199, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm glutamine) overnight. Subsequently, the cells were changed into low serum medium containing 1% horse serum and 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100 particles/cell for 12 h. The cells were then cultured in serum-free medium for an additional 36–70 h before morphological or biochemical analysis. Protein extracts from heart or myocytes were prepared and assayed for kinase activities, as described previously (37Ramirez M.T. Sah V.P. Zhao X.-L. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14057-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, crushed frozen heart tissue or cells were harvested in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. p38 kinases were immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 antiserum (from J. Han (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. The kinase assays were then performed at 30 °C using [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic protein (Sigma) or glutathioneS-transferase-ATF2 as a substrate. The phosphorylated substrate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. The incorporated32Pi in the substrate was quantified by radioanalytic scanning (AMBIS). A similar protocol was used to assay kinase activities of ERK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) using myelin basic protein and c-Jun as substrates, as described previously (37Ramirez M.T. Sah V.P.

Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100. The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) protein was detected using rabbit anti-rat α-ANF polyclonal antibody (Peninsula Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Life Science). The F-actin was detected using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). The tropomyosin was detected using a monoclonal antibody CH1 (a kind gift from Dr. Jim Lin, University of Iowa) and a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Life Science). The ANF and EF-1α mRNA were detected using a Direct-Protect kit according to manufacturer's recommendations (AMBION). Briefly, the rat ANF cDNA (pGEM-ANF) (54Chen J. Chien K.R. Circulation. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar) or EF-1α cDNA (45Villarreal F.J. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Giordano F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 735-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was linearized with XhoI orDdeI and used as templates for generation of radiolabeled riboprobes using polymerase T7 and SP 6, respectively. The protected fragments were separated on a 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by radioactive scanning (AMBIS). Cell survival was analyzed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiaziazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method (38Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development. 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as reported previously. Briefly, myocytes were cultured in triplicate in 24-well tissue culture plates and infected with adenoviruses as described above. The cells were then stained with 500 μg/ml MTT (Sigma) for 4 h, and the positively stained cells were counted as living cells. For analysis of apoptotic cells, a DNA fragmentation assay was performed as described previously using a DNA isolation kit (Purogene) and standard agarose gel electrophoresis (49Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Fragmented and condensed nuclei in apoptotic cells were also identified by staining cultured cells with Hoescht 33258 dye as described (49Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Analyses between two groups were performed using unpaired two-tailed t tests, withp values less than 0.001 as being significantly different. To establish the functional role of the p38 pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we measured the p38 MAP kinase activity in mouse hearts that had been exposed to pressure overload following transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Previous studies have established that chronic TAC in mice can induce several conserved phenotypic features of ventricular hypertrophy with concentric enlargement of the ventricular chamber, an increase in heart weight/body weight ratio, and a concomitant activation of immediate early genes and embryonic marker genes (such as ANF) expression (32Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.R. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar,33Rockman H.A. Ono A.S. Ross R.S. Jones L.R. Karimi M. Bhargava V. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2694-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In hearts, isolated 4 h after TAC, the p38 MAP kinase activities were not significantly different from the basal level activity (Fig. 1). Seven days after surgery, however, a marked elevation of p38 activity was observed in TAC animal hearts as compared with those from the sham-operated group. Activation of the p38 MAP kinase activities during the development of hypertrophy suggested a potential role for this pathway in mediating defined features of the hypertrophic response. To study the function of the p38 pathway in neonatal cardiac myocytes, we utilized recombinant adenoviruses as an efficient gene delivery vector to express various p38 signaling molecules (22Huang S. Jiagn Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. Krushel L.A.

Cardiol. 1996; 28: 735-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As demonstrated using a recombinant adenovirus expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, greater than 90% of the myocytes expressed the transgene, a much higher level of expression as compared with conventional calcium phosphate methods (Fig.2 A). The constitutively activated mutants of two upstream activators for the p38 kinases, MKK3bE and MKK6bE, as well as the wild type and dominant negative mutants of the p38 MAP kinase α and β isoforms, were constructed in recombinant adenoviruses (22Huang S. Jiagn Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and their expression in infected cardiac myocytes was detected at comparable levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). When cardiomyocytes were infected with vectors expressing MKK3bE and MKK6bE, the endogenous p38 MAP kinase activities were induced 12.2-fold and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the endogenous JNK activity and ERK activity were not activated by either virus (data not shown). This result was consistent with previous studies that have established MKK3b and MKK6b as specific upstream activators of the p38 MAP kinases (26Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 27Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegener J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of the activated p38 pathway on cardiomyocytes, a number of independent effects on cellular morphology were assayed including surface area, F-actin organization, and sarcomere organization. The expression of a marker of the hypertrophic response, ANF, was also monitored by immunohistochemistry and RNase protection assays. In comparison to uninfected cells, MKK3bE- and MKK6bE-infected cells displayed an increase in cell surface area, enhanced organization of sarcomeric units with increased nonstriated myofibrils, and induction of ANF expression (TableI and Fig.3). Levels of ANF mRNA, as quantified by RNase protection, were elevated approximately 2.9-fold by MKK3bE and 4.6-fold by MKK6bE (Fig. 4). These are all well characterized features of myocardial cell hypertrophy in thisin vitro assay system induced by other bona fide hypertrophic stimuli (3Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 4Simpson P.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 51: 189-202Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of MKK3bE and MKK6bE were indeed mediated by the p38 MAP kinases, cardiomyocytes were treated with SB202190, a pyridinyl imidazole compound that specifically inhibits p38 kinase activity (12Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Hey J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strichler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fischer S.M. Livi G.P. While J.R.

As shown in Figs. 3and 4, addition of the p38 inhibitor suppressed both morphological changes and ANF expression in either MKK3bE- or MKK6bE-infected myocytes. Based on morphological and biochemical criteria, these results suggested that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway was sufficient to induce hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes.Table IMorphological analysis of cardiac myocytes infected with adv vectors expressing signaling molecules in the p38 MAP kinase pathwayAdv infectionRelative cell surface areaSarcomere organizationAtrial natriuretic peptide expressionarbitrary units ± S.E.Untreated1.00 ± 0.09−−LacZ1.49 ± 0.03−−MKK3bE +none2.05 ± 0.09++p38α1.06 ± 0.09−−p38β2.35 ± 0.07+++p38αdn2.69 ± 0.12−++p38βdn0.99 ± 0.11+−MKK6bE +none2.67 ± 0.11++p38α2.24 ± 0.11++/−p38β4.42 ± 0.09*+++p38αdn2.07 ± 0.08++p38βdn2.10 ± 0.08++/− Open table in a new tab Figure 4RNase protection assay for the expression of ANF mRNA. A, total RNA was isolated from approximately 500,000 myocytes treated in the absence of viral vector (C,lane 1) or a vector that directs the expression of the activated mutant Ha-Ras (H-Ras, lane 2). They were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. RNA samples from myocytes treated with MKK3bE (lanes 3–8) and MKK6bE (lanes 9–14) vectors, in combination with other p38 viruses or the p38 inhibitor were used as indicated. The lower levels of the EF-1a mRNA signal in lanes 3 and 7 resulted from the induction of cell death by MKK3bE expression. The ANF mRNA induction was determined by comparison with the control samples following normalization to the EF-1α mRNA level. These data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further observations at a later time point indicated that infection of MKK3bE also led to a significant increase in cell death (Fig.5 A). Using the MTT staining method as a quantitative cell survival assay, we estimated that the number of viable myocytes dropped to approximately 50% 72 h after infection as compared with control samples (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, MKK6bE did not appear to induce myocyte death (Fig.5 B) even though its expression level was comparable with that of the MKK3bE in myocytes (Fig. 2 B). Although it has been suggested from previous in vitro studies that p38α and p38β isoforms may have preferential upstream activators and different downstream target substrates (27Jiang Y. Chen C.

To dissect the specific roles of these two isoforms in mediating cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy and cell death, adenoviruses expressing the wild type and dominant mutants of p38α or p38β were co-infected along with recombinant adenoviruses that direct the expression of MKK3bE or MKK6bE. Overexpression of the wild type p38α or p38β isoform alone in myocytes had little effect, with the exception of a modest increase in cell surface area that was occasionally associated with adenoviral infection (Table I). 3Y. Wang and K. R. Chien, unpublished observations.Overexpression of wild type p38α in MKK3bE-infected cells, however, disrupted the hypertrophic morphology (Fig. 5 A), partially inhibited ANF induction from 2.9-fold to 1.8-fold (Fig. 4), reduced the cell surface area to basal levels (Table I), and led to a marked induction of cell death (Fig. 5 C). Although p38α did not appear to significantly affect the size and survival of the MKK6bE-infected cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5 B, Table I), the ANF mRNA induction was significantly reduced from 4.6-fold to 2.8-fold (Fig. 4). In contrast, overexpression of wild type p38β augmented the MKK3bE-induced hypertrophy (Fig. 5 A), and further induced the ANF mRNA expression from 2.9-fold to 3.9-fold (Fig. 4). Forced activation of p38β also promoted cell survival in the MKK3bE-infected myocytes, as indicated by the MTT assay (Fig. 5 C). In MKK6bE-infected cells, overexpression of wild type p38β also had a positive, albeit marginal, effect on the already highly elevated ANF mRNA levels, increasing its expression from 4.6- to 5.4-fold (Fig.4). The surface area was also further increased from 2.67-fold over basal levels to 4.42-fold (Table I). From these results, we postulated that activation of p38β was able to induce several features of the hypertrophic response and also promoted survival of cardiac myocytes, whereas activation of p38α was able to antagonize such an effect and resulted in cell death.

However, its validity as a O·̄<sub>2</sub>-detecting probe has recently been questioned in view of its ability to undergo redox cycling in several <i>in vitro</i>enzymatic systems, which produce little or no O·̄<sub>2</sub>. Whether and to what extent lucigenin redox cycling occurs in systems that produce significant amounts of O·̄<sub>2</sub> has not been carefully investigated. We examined and correlated three end points, including sensitive measurement of lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence (LDCL), O<sub>2</sub> consumption by oxygen polarography, and O·̄<sub>2</sub> production by 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-<i>N</i>-oxide spin trapping to characterize the potential of lucigenin to undergo redox cycling and as such to act as an additional source of O·̄<sub>2</sub> in various enzymatic and cellular systems. Marked LDCL was elicited at lucigenin concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μm in all of the O·̄<sub>2</sub>-generating systems examined, including xanthine oxidase (XO)/xanthine, lipoamide dehydrogenase/NADH, isolated mitochondria, mitochondria in intact cells, and phagocytic NADPH oxidase. These concentrations of lucigenin were far below those that stimulated additional O<sub>2</sub> consumption or O·̄<sub>2</sub> production in the above systems. Moreover, a significant linear correlation between LDCL and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome <i>c</i> reduction was observed in the XO/xanthine and phagocytic NADPH oxidase systems. In contrast to the above O·̄<sub>2</sub>-generating systems, no LDCL was observed at non-redox cycling concentrations of lucigenin in the glucose oxidase/glucose and XO/NADH systems, which do not produce a significant amount of O·̄<sub>2</sub>. Thus, LDCL still appears to be a valid probe for detecting O·̄<sub>2</sub> production by enzymatic and cellular sources."

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ADP-induced platelet activation have not been elucidated. We demonstrated earlier the existence of two distinct ADP receptors on platelets, one coupled to phospholipase C, P2TPLC, and the other to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, P2TAC (Daniel, J. L., Dangelmaier, C., Jin, J., Ashby, B., Smith, J. B., and Kunapuli, S. P. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 2024–2029), in addition to the previously described P2X1 receptor. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA clone encoding the P2Y1 receptor from a human platelet cDNA library by homology screening with radiolabeled P2Y1-P2Y6 receptor cDNAs. ADP or 2-methyl(thio)-ADP-induced intracellular calcium increases were inhibited by the P2Y1 receptor-specific antagonists, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (A3P5PS), adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphate (A3P5P), and adenosine 2′-phosphate 5′-phosphate (A2P5P), in a concentration-dependent manner, but not by ARL 66096 or α,β-MeATP. A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P also inhibited the shape change of aspirinated platelets induced by 10 μm ADP or 3 μm 2-methyl(thio)-ADP in a concentration-dependent manner, with complete inhibition occurring at 300 μm. On the other hand ARL 66096 (100 nm), a potent P2TAC antagonist and α,β-methylene-ATP (40 μm), a P2X1 receptor agonist, had no effect on ADP-induced platelet shape change.

Jonsen A. Laland S. Hellem A.J. Owren P. Nature. 1961; 192: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). When exposed to ADP, platelets undergo shape change from smooth discs to spiculated spheres, activate the fibrinogen receptor, causing platelets to aggregate, release granule contents, and produce thromboxane A2 (2Gachet C. Hechler B. Leon C. Vial C. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J.P. Platelets. 1996; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,3Mills D.C.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These effects have been postulated to be mediated by a platelet ADP receptor, antagonized by ATP (2Gachet C. Hechler B.

Several molecules have been proposed to be the platelet ADP receptor, including aggregin, a 100-kDa protein that covalently binds to 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (4Colman R.W. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 274-278Google Scholar), and a platelet glycoprotein IIb, a component of the fibrinogen receptor on platelets (5Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jackson B. Jamieson G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but none has been conclusively demonstrated to be a platelet ADP receptor. ADP causes several intracellular responses in platelets: inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, formation of inositol trisphosphate, mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, rapid calcium influx, and activation of phospholipase A2 (3Mills D.C.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Several compounds, including ARL 66096, ARL 67085, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel, have been utilized to block ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent platelet aggregation both in vitro and in vivo (3Mills D.C.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The receptors to which extracellular nucleotides bind and transduce signals have been classified as P2 receptors and are divided into two subclasses: P2X intrinsic ion channels and P2Y metabotropic receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins (6Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). These receptor subtypes are numbered in the order of cloning and to date eight subtypes of P2X receptors and six subtypes of P2Y receptors have been cloned (7Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P.

Gachet and co-workers (9Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) have recently shown that ADP responses at the P2Y1 receptor are antagonized by ATP and proposed that the P2Y1 receptor may be the ADP receptor on platelets coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We have provided evidence for two distinct ADP receptors, one coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, the P2TAC receptor, and the other coupled to the activation of phospholipase C, P2TPLC, in human platelets (10Daniel J.L.

Here, we demonstrate that in human platelets, the ADP receptor coupled to calcium mobilization through activation of phospholipase C (P2TPLC) is the P2Y1 receptor and that this receptor plays an important role in the ADP-mediated platelet shape change. We also provide evidence that neither the P2X1 receptor, activated by α,β-MeATP resulting in rapid calcium influx, nor the P2TAC receptor, coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, play any role in the ADP-induced platelet shape change.

The DNA insert from the positive clone was obtained in Bluescript KS vector by in vivo excision procedures. The complete nucleotide sequence of both strands was determined by dideoxy chain termination using T3 and T7 primers. The nucleotide sequence analysis was performed using the GCG package. Agonist-induced platelet shape change was determined using Chronolog Lumi-aggregometer as described earlier (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 36: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We screened a human platelet cDNA library in λZapII by low stringency hybridization with radiolabeled P2Y1-P2Y6 cDNAs. Upon screening nearly 1,000,000 recombinants, two cDNA clones encoding the P2Y1 receptor were isolated by this approach. Both clones were sequenced by the dideoxy termination technique and found to be identical. This clone contains an open reading frame of 840 base pairs which is flanked by 456 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence ending in a poly(A)+ tail. We have previously cloned two forms of the P2Y1 receptor, the short form and the long form, from human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells with divergent 3′-untranslated regions and poly(A)+ signals (14Ayyanathan K. Webbs T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The platelet P2Y1 appears to have a unique 3′-untranslated region and a poly(A)+ signal. The sequence of the platelet P2Y1 receptor in relation to the short form and the long form is shown in Fig. 1. Although we also used radiolabeled P2Y2-P2Y6 cDNAs as probes, no signals hybridizing to these probes were seen. Since the human P2Y1 receptor is known to be coupled to the phospholipase C pathway, resulting in mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores (9Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 20Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P, known P2Y1 selective antagonists (21Boyer J.L. Romeroavila T. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1323-1329PubMed Google Scholar), on ADP-induced intracellular calcium increases. As shown in Fig.2 A, ADP increased intracellular calcium levels in platelets, an effect which was inhibited by the P2Y1 specific antagonists, A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P, in a concentration-dependent manner, with complete inhibition occurring at 30-fold molar excess. Similar inhibition of 3 μm 2-MeSADP-induced mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores was observed by all the three P2Y1 antagonists (Fig. 2 B). ARL 66096 (100 nm) and α,β-MeATP, a platelet P2X1 receptor agonist (8MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), did not affect ADP-induced calcium mobilization from intracellular stores (data not shown) (10Daniel J.L.

These results strongly suggest a correlation between the ADP-induced mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores and platelet shape change. We investigated whether the P2Y1 receptor in platelets is functionally coupled to physiological responses by using the recently described (21Boyer J.L. Romeroavila T. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1323-1329PubMed Google Scholar) P2Y1 receptor-specific antagonists, A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P on ADP-induced platelet shape change. To block aggregation and enhance the platelet shape change signal, we used SC52012 at 1 μm, an inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to its receptor (19Zablocki J.A. Miyano M. Garland R.B. Pireh D. Schretzman L. Rao S.N. Lindmark R.J. Panzer-Knodle S.G. Nicholson N.S. Taite B.B. Salyers A.K. King L.W. Campion J.G. Feigen L.P. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A3P5PS inhibited ADP and 2-MeSADP-induced platelet shape change in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained with A3P5P and A2P5P (data not shown). We have previously demonstrated that the P2TAC receptor-specific antagonist, ARL 66096 (22Humphries R.G. Robertson M.J. Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 179-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), neither caused nor inhibited ADP-induced platelet shape change (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggesting that the P2TAC receptor does not play any significant role in ADP-induced platelet shape change. We have previously shown that the ARL 66096, a P2TAC selective antagonist, blocked ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To ensure that the P2Y1-specific antagonists are not acting at the P2TACreceptor, we have tested the ability of A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P to block ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase on platelets. As shown in Fig. 4, none of these antagonists, used at the concentration that inhibited platelet shape change, abrogated ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. α,β-MeATP also did not block ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, while the control, ARL 66096, did (Fig. 4). MacKenzie et al. (8MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) demonstrated a P2X1 receptor, which upon activation by α,β-MeATP in the presence of extracellular calcium caused rapid calcium influx. Gachet et al. (23Gachet C. Cattaneo M. Ohlmann P. Hechler B. Lecchi A. Chervalier J. Cassel D. Mannucci P.M. Cazenave J.-P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 91: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) proposed that the receptor mediating ADP-induced rapid calcium influx also mediates ADP-induced platelet shape change. Hence, we investigated the role of this P2X1 receptor on ADP-induced platelet shape change. In the presence of 1 mm extracellular calcium, α,β-MeATP did not cause platelet shape change when used at the highest concentration eliciting rapid calcium influx. Also, at this concentration, α,β-MeATP neither inhibited shape change nor potentiated ADP-induced platelet shape change (Fig.5). These results suggest that the P2X1 receptor does not play a role in the ADP-induced platelet shape change. Subsequent to the demonstration of three distinct ADP receptors on platelets, namely, a P2TAC receptor, coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a P2TPLC receptor, coupled to mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores through activation of phospholipase C, and a P2X1 receptor, coupled to the rapid calcium influx (10Daniel J.L.

Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we initiated molecular cloning of these P2 receptor subtypes from platelets. While our studies were in progress, Gachet and co-workers (9Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ATP is an antagonist at the P2Y1 receptor and also detected the P2Y1 receptor by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of platelet RNA. We used the low stringency hybridization approach to isolate the cDNA clone for the P2TPLC receptor from the platelet cDNA library. This strategy resulted in a P2Y1 receptor cDNA clone, representing a P2Y1 mRNA species utilizing a unique polyadenylation signal different from the short and long forms reported previously (14Ayyanathan K. Webbs T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We failed to isolate any other cDNA clones encoding the P2Y2-P2Y6 receptors in our screening using this strategy. The different forms of P2Y1 purinoceptor mRNAs result from differential usage of the polyadenylation signals. The 3′-noncoding region of the long form contains 3 consensus polyadenylation sites (AATAAA) at 1477, 1676, and 2149 nt. The short form of cDNA resulted from the use of the first consensus polyadenylation signal (1477 nt) while the platelet form utilized the second polyadenylation signal at 1676 nt. The long form mRNA probably results from the utilization of a different polyadenylation signal, since the 3′-untranslated region extends 275 nucleotide beyond the last consensus polyadenylation site (2149 nt) to end in a poly(A) tail (14Ayyanathan K. Webbs T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the 3′-noncoding region of the long form does not encode a consensus polyadenylation signal prior to the poly(A) tail. Moreover, the long form contains three copies of the AUUUA sequence motif, which is thought to be responsible for destabilization of mRNA (24Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar), while the platelet form contains only one such motif. Thus the long transcript may be more unstable than the platelet form which in turn might be less stable than the short form. Several studies have shown that the 3′-untranslated regions of mRNAs are implicated in many functions, such as translational regulation (25Wharton R.P. Struhl G. Cell. 1991; 67: 955-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26Sinto M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), regulation of cell growth and differentiation (27Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 903-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), mRNA localization during oogenesis (28Macdonald P.M. Struhl G. Nature. 1988; 336: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and intracellular mRNA localization (29Davis I. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1991; 67: 927-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although no experimental evidence is currently available, the different lengths of 3′-noncoding regions in these three P2Y1 receptor transcripts could be of functional importance. Activation of platelets by ADP results in platelet shape change and aggregation, release of thromboxane A2, and release of granule contents (2Gachet C. Hechler B. Leon C. Vial C. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J.P. Platelets. 1996; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Mills D.C.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Since P2TAC-specific antagonists, ARL 66096 and ARL 67085, inhibit platelet aggregation and have no effect on the platelet shape change (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 22Humphries R.G. Robertson M.J. Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 179-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of the P2Y1 receptor in ADP-induced platelet shape change. Until recently, the P2 receptors lacked specific antagonists (and specific agonists). Hence, nonspecific antagonists such as suramin, PPADS, and reactive blue 2 have been used in the past (30Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Harden and co-workers (21Boyer J.L. Romeroavila T. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1323-1329PubMed Google Scholar) identified three adenine nucleotide analogs, A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P, as specific P2Y1 antagonists, which had no effect at the P2Y2, P2Y4, and the P2Y6 receptors (21Boyer J.L. Romeroavila T. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1323-1329PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, these P2Y1-specific antagonists were used to demonstrate the functional role of the platelet P2Y1 receptor in ADP-induced mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores and platelet shape change. Furthermore, we have evaluated the contribution of the P2TAC and the P2X1 receptors, depicted in our three receptor model for ADP-induced platelet activation (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar), to platelet shape change induced by ADP. All the three P2Y1 receptor-specific antagonists inhibited ADP-induced mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores (Fig. 2) and platelet shape change (Fig. 3) in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, these antagonists do not block ADP-induced adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4), indicating that they do not inhibit ADP-induced shape change by acting at the P2TAC receptor. These results suggest that the P2Y1 receptor plays an important role in ADP-induced platelet shape change and that intracellular calcium increases may be required for platelet shape change. These three P2Y1 receptor-specific antagonists required high concentrations (20-fold molar excess) to completely inhibit functional responses induced by 10 μmADP. However, other investigators have determined that ATP is a weak antagonist, requiring at least 200-fold molar excess, to block the ADP-induced platelet shape change (31Macfarlane D.E. Mills D.C.B. Blood. 1975; 46: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pA2 value for ATP at ADP-induced intracellular calcium mobilization in platelets was 5.1 (32Hall D.A. Hourani S.M.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P are more potent antagonists than ATP at the platelet P2Y1 receptor. The human P2Y1 receptor has been known to couple to mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores through activation of phospholipase C and formation of inositol trisphosphate (9Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 20Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the P2Y1 receptor from platelet cDNA library and the concentration-dependent inhibition of ADP-induced intracellular calcium mobilization by the P2Y1 receptor selective antagonists demonstrate that the P2Y1 receptor is the platelet P2TPLC receptor, coupled to inositol trisphosphate formation and mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, proposed earlier (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Since myosin phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in ADP-induced platelet shape change (18Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we predict that the P2Y1 receptor mediated signaling events will lead to the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. α,β-MeATP has earlier been shown to have no effect at the P2Y1 receptor stably expressed in Jurkat cells (9Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (20Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). α,β-MeATP, causing an increase in intracellular calcium through P2X1 receptor-mediated rapid calcium influx in the presence of 1 mm extracellular calcium, failed to elicit platelet shape change (Fig. 5) suggesting that these increases are insufficient to evoke shape change. Apparently, intracellular calcium increases and/or other signal transduction events, coupled to the P2Y1 receptor, are required for this physiological response. Thus, contrary to the proposal of Gachet et al. (23Gachet C. Cattaneo M. Ohlmann P. Hechler B. Lecchi A. Chervalier J. Cassel D. Mannucci P.M. Cazenave J.-P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 91: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the P2X1 receptor does not play a significant role in the ADP-induced shape change. Pretreatment with α,β-MeATP did not inhibit ADP-mediated shape change suggesting that the P2X1 receptor does not in any way modulate the effects mediated through the P2Y1 receptor. ARL 66096, a P2TAC specific antagonist, failed to inhibit ADP-induced platelet shape change and mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, while blocking the ADP-induced adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, even at high concentrations, A3P5PS, A3P5P, and A2P5P did not block ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4). These results conclusively demonstrate that the P2TAC receptor does not play a role in the ADP-induced platelet shape change. Leonet al. (9Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) proposed that the P2Y1 receptor is indeed the elusive platelet ADP receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Our results demonstrate that the P2Y1 receptor is not coupled to adenylyl cyclase, as the P2Y1 receptor selective antagonists failed to abrogate ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, but inhibited ADP-induced calcium mobilization and platelet shape change in a concentration-dependent manner. ARL 66096 failed to inhibit platelet shape change and calcium mobilization induced by ADP (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar), while blocking the ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Thus, we conclude that the P2Y1 receptor is not the P2TACreceptor. A P2Y receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase has been characterized in C6-2B rat glioma cells (33Boyer J.L. Lazarowski E.R. Chen X.-H. Harden T.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1140-1146PubMed Google Scholar) and in B10 rat brain capillary endothelial cells (34Webb T.E. Feolde E. Vigne P. Neary J.T. Runberg A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The P2Y1 receptor mRNA sequences were amplified from these cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and no other P2Y receptor mRNA was amplified (34Webb T.E. Feolde E. Vigne P. Neary J.T. Runberg A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, Webb et al. (34Webb T.E. Feolde E. Vigne P. Neary J.T. Runberg A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggested that the P2Y1 receptor couples to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in different cells. However, since the pharmacological agents used in their studies are not specific for the P2Y1 receptor, we believe that C6-2B cells and B10 cells express multiple P2 receptor subtypes: the P2Y1 receptor, that was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and at least one other P2 receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Boyer et al. (35Boyer J.L. Zohn I.E. Jacobson K.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) demonstrated differential effects of P2 receptor antagonists, suramin, reactive blue 2, and PPADS, on the turkey erythrocyte P2Y receptor, coupled to phospholipase C, and the C6-2B P2Y receptor, coupled to adenylyl cyclase. PPADS inhibited 2-MeSATP-induced phospholipase C activation in turkey erythrocytes, while even at 100 μm it had no effect on 2-MeSATP-induced adenylyl cyclase inhibition in C6-2B cells (35Boyer J.L. Zohn I.E. Jacobson K.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown earlier that the P2 receptors in HEL cells, from which the human P2Y1 receptor has been cloned (14Ayyanathan K. Webbs T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), do not couple to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (36Vittet D. Mathieu M.-N. Launay J.-M. Chevillard C. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 1129-1134PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the P2Y receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase is not expressed in these cells, while ADP-induced calcium mobilization from intracellular stores, a P2Y1 receptor response, was observed. We ruled out the possibility of a splice variant of the P2Y1 receptor which may be coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, since previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the human P2Y1 receptor is encoded by an intronless gene at chromosome 3q25 (37Ayyanathan K. Naylor S.L. Kunapuli S.P. Som. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We speculate that the P2 receptor in B10 and C6-2B cells, coupled to adenylyl cyclase, may be the same receptor as the P2TACreceptor in platelets. In conclusion, we have cloned a P2Y1 receptor cDNA clone from a human platelet cDNA library and demonstrated that this receptor mediates ADP-induced mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores and shape change in platelets. The other two ADP receptors on platelets, the P2TAC receptor, coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and the P2X1 receptor, coupled to rapid calcium influx, do not play a role in platelet shape change induced by ADP. We are grateful to Dr. Gerald L. Roth, VA Medical Center, Seattle, WA, for the human platelet cDNA library. We also thank Drs. Barrie Ashby and J. Bryan Smith, Department of Pharmacology, Temple University Medical School, for helpful advice and critically reviewing this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2048443303,"Acting through cell surface receptors, ADP activates platelets resulting in shape change, aggregation, thromboxane A2 production, and release of granule contents. ADP also causes a number of intracellular events including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, and rapid calcium influx in platelets. However, the receptors that transduce these events remain unidentified and their molecular mechanisms of action have not been elucidated. The receptor responsible for the actions of ADP on platelets has been designated the P2T receptor. In this study we have used ARL 66096, a potent antagonist of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and a P2X ionotropic receptor agonist, α,β-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate, to distinguish the ADP-induced intracellular events. ARL 66096 blocked ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, but did not affect ADP-mediated intracellular calcium increases or shape change. Both ADP and 2-methylthio-ADP caused a 3-fold increase in the level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate over control levels which peaked in a similar fashion to the Ca2+ transient. The increase in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was of similar magnitude to that of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. α,β-Methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate did not cause an increase in either of the inositol trisphosphates. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of two distinct platelet ADP receptors in addition to the P2X receptor: one coupled to adenylyl cyclase and the other coupled to mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphates. Acting through cell surface receptors, ADP activates platelets resulting in shape change, aggregation, thromboxane A2 production, and release of granule contents.

These results clearly demonstrate the presence of two distinct platelet ADP receptors in addition to the P2X receptor: one coupled to adenylyl cyclase and the other coupled to mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphates. ADP was the first low molecular weight agent recognized to cause platelet aggregation (1Hellem A. Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 12: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gaarder A. Jonsen A. Laland S. Hellem A.J. Owren P. Nature. 1961; 192: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It is stored in the dense granules of human platelets and is an important platelet agonist as evidenced by the fact that patients with defective ADP storage have bleeding tendencies (3Holmsen H. Weiss H.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1979; 30: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Holmsen H. Weiss H.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1970; 19: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Activation of platelets by ADP follows a defined sequence. The first event, shape change, occurs when discoid shaped resting cells are rapidly converted to spiculated spheres. Shape change is followed by platelet aggregation and granule secretion which releases more ADP as well as many other substances (5Mills D.C.B. Robb I.A. Roberts G.C.K. J. Physiol. 1968; 195: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Acting extracellularly, ADP causes a number of intracellular events including rapid calcium influx (6Sage S.O. Rink T.J.

Sci. 1972; 201: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An increase in intracellular Ca2+ may be due to an increase in inositol trisphosphate (10Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C.A. Selak M. Smith J.B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Heemskerk J.W.M. Vis P. Feijge M.A.H. Hoyland J. Mason W.T. Sage S.O. J. Biol.

In addition, arachidonic acid, liberated from platelet membranes due to activation of phospholipase A2, is converted to thromboxane A2, itself a powerful platelet agonist. Despite this knowledge the exact identity of platelet ADP receptors responsible for functional responses of ADP are not fully defined and the mechanism by which aggregation occurs is still under investigation. The idea that ADP's effects on platelets are receptor-mediated was indicated by the finding that ATP shows true competitive inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation and adenylyl cyclase inhibition (16Macfarlane D.E. Mills D.C.B. Blood. 1975; 46: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other nucleoside triphosphates are also competitive antagonists of ADP and have similar activity ratios for inhibition of aggregation and for inhibition of ADP's effect on adenylyl cyclase (17Cusack N.J. Hourani S.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 76: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Evidence that an ADP receptor couples to G-proteins is based on the fact that ADP stimulates the binding of GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; α,β-MeATP, α,β-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate; 2-MeSADP, 2-methylthio-adenosine 5′-diphosphate; ARL 66096, 2-propylthio-d-β,γ-difluoromethylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate; IP3, unspecified isomer of inositol trisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4)P3, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; α,β-MeATP, α,β-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate; 2-MeSADP, 2-methylthio-adenosine 5′-diphosphate; ARL 66096, 2-propylthio-d-β,γ-difluoromethylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate; IP3, unspecified isomer of inositol trisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4)P3, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate. to platelet membranes in humans and rats (18Gachet C. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Hilf G. Wieland T. Jacobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The receptors activated by extracellular nucleotides have been classified as P2 receptors and are divided into two subclasses: P2X intrinsic ion channels and P2Y metabotropic receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins (19Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). These receptor subtypes are numbered in the order of cloning and to date eight subtypes of P2X receptors and six subtypes of P2Y receptors have been cloned (20Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Schwabe U. Williams M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because of its pharmacologic profile, the identity of platelet ADP receptor(s) could not be assigned to any cloned member of the P2Y receptor family and hence has been designated P2T (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Hourani S.M. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Several molecules have been proposed to be the platelet ADP receptor, including aggregin, a 100-kDa protein that covalently binds to 5′-p-fluorosulfonyl benzoyladenosine (23Colman R.W. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 274-278Google Scholar), and platelet glycoprotein IIb, a component of the fibrinogen receptor on platelets (24Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jackson B. Jamieson G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but none has been conclusively demonstrated to be a platelet ADP receptor. Using α,β-MeATP as the agonist, MacKenzie et al.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) demonstrated an ADP receptor in platelets, suggested to be the P2X1 receptor, that could cause a rapid calcium influx but not internal Ca2+ mobilization. However, it is unclear whether α,β-MeATP can activate any physiological platelet responses (7MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol.

They expressed this receptor in Jurkat cells and demonstrated that ATP is an antagonist at this receptor and postulated that the P2Y1 receptor is the platelet ADP receptor coupled to adenylyl cylase inhibition (25Léon C.

In this report, we provide evidence that there are two separate receptors for ADP on the platelet surface; one coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, designated P2TAC, and a second coupled to mobilization of intracellular calcium stores through inositol phosphate production, designated P2TPLC, in addition to the intrinsic ion channel P2X, coupled to rapid calcium influx previously demonstrated by MacKenzie et al. (7MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). ATP is an antagonist at both the receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and that coupled to increases in inositol phosphates. Apyrase (Type V), ADP, ATP, fibrinogen, and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were from Sigma. Fura-2 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). ARL 66096 was a gift from Fisons (now known as Astra Research Laboratories, Loughborough, United Kingdom). RGDS was from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). [32P]PO4, [3H]1,3,4-IP3, [3H]1,4,5-IP3, [3H]adenine, and [14C]cAMP were from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). 2-MeSADP and α,β-MeATP were from Research Biologics, Inc. (Natick, MA). Human blood was collected from informed healthy volunteers in acid/citrate/dextrose. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 180 × g for 15 min at ambient temperature and was recentrifuged (800 × g for 15 min, ambient temperature). The platelet pellet was resuspended in 0.5 volumes of autologous plasma and incubated with32PO4 (0.25 mCi/ml) at 37 °C. After 15 min, fura-2 (3 μm) and aspirin (1 mm) were added and the incubation at 37 °C continued for another 45 min. Platelets were isolated from the incubation medium by gel filtration as described previously (27Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C.A. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The final buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.0 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mmglucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 20 μg/ml apyrase. The platelet count was adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml. All experiments were carried in buffers with no added Ca2+ unless otherwise noted. Platelets (1.0 ml) were activated in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 spectrofluorimeter in a water jacketed cuvette maintained at 37 °C with stirring. Fura-2 fluorescence was monitored continuously using settings of 340 nm (excitation) and 510 nm (emission). Fura-2 fluorescence signals were calibrated as described by Pollock et al. (28Pollock W.K. Rink T.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1:10 volume of ice-cold 6.6 n HClO4 and kept on ice until further processing. After addition of HClO4, 0.02 μCi each of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 were added to each sample and the samples were centrifuged. Supernatants were adjusted to pH 7.5–8.0 by addition of 2 m K2CO3and the precipitate of KClO4 was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was treated at 37 °C overnight with inorganic pyrophosphatase (10 units/ml) in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Each sample was treated with 100 mg of charcoal (Darco, G-60) for 5 min on ice to remove nucleotides. Charcoal was removed by centrifugation (3 min at 5000 × g) followed by filtration through Rainin microfilterfuge tubes. Separation of inositol phosphates was accomplished using a Rainin Rabbit HP HPLC and a Whatman Partisil 10 SAX column. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with a 45-min gradient of water as initial buffer and 1.5 mammonium formate adjusted to pH 3.7 with H3PO4, as final buffer. Fractions were collected and counted in a LKB liquid scintillation counter with windows set to separate 3H and32P. The [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 standards were used to indicate the positions of their 32P counterparts and to correct for recovery. For aggregation experiments, aspirated platelets were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 15 min and resuspended in the same buffer that was used for gel filtration. Platelet shape change and aggregation (0.5-ml samples) were measured in a Chronolog lumi-aggregometer with stirring at 37 °C. Fibrinogen (400 μg/ml) was added to all samples. The base line was set using the platelet suspension diluted 1:1 with platelet suspension buffer to increase the gain of the aggregometer output. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine and aspirin (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C (29Mao G.-F. Jin J.-G. Bastepe M. Ortiz-Vega S. Ashby B. Prostaglandins. 1996; 52: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Platelets were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 800 × g for 15 min and resuspended in the same buffer as was used for gel filtration. Reactions were stopped with 1m HCl and 4000 disintegrations/min of [14C]cAMP as recovery standard. Cyclic AMP was determined by the method of Salomon (30Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as percentage of total [3H]adenine nucleotides. The time course of ADP and 2-MeSADP-induced increases in [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 are compared with the changes in intracellular Ca2+ in Fig.1, A and B, respectively. Both agonists caused a rapid increase in [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 that reached peak levels at about 3-fold over basal at the earliest measured time of 2 s. [32P]Ins(1,3,4)P3 also increased rapidly. Intracellular Ca2+ also increased rapidly and decreased to near control levels at 30 s. The concentration dependence of ADP and 2-MeSADP-induced inositol phosphate formation and intracellular [Ca2+] mobilization is shown in Fig.2, A and B, respectively. Both agonists caused a concentration-dependent increase in the two isomers of IP3. There was a good correlation between the concentration dependence of Ca2+ mobilization and IP3metabolism for both agonists. The EC50 for ADP was about 1 μm, which is comparable with published results for induction of shape change and Ca2+ mobilization (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The EC50 for 2-MeSADP was about 4-fold lower which is in agreement with the published activity of 2-MeSADP for induction of platelet Ca2+ mobilization (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). α,β-MeATP induced a small Ca2+ transient similar to that shown by MacKenzie et al. (7MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) but only if the suspension buffer contained 1 mm Ca2+. However, it did not induce a significant increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation (TableI). In addition, α,β-MeATP did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. An increase in external Ca2+ from nominal (approximately 10 μm) to 1 mm had no effect on the amount of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or cyclic AMP formed when platelets were stimulated by ADP (Table I).Table IComparison of the effect of ADP and α,β-MeATP on platelet adenylyl cyclase activity and Ins(1,4,5)P3 formationAgonist[3H]c AMP (% total [3H]adenine)Disintegrations/min [32P]Ins (1,4,5)P3Basal3.17 ± 0.06127 ± 24ADP (10 μm)1.38 ± 0.111-aSignificantly different than control by analysis of variance (Fisher's test).

Open table in a new tab ARL 66096 is an ATP analog that is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (31Humphries R.G. Tomlinson W. Ingall A.H. Cage P.A. Leff P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, ARL 66096 was an effective inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, resulting in complete inhibition of aggregation at 100–300 nm. However, ARL 66096 failed to block shape change even when a concentration of 1 μm was used (Fig. 3). Since ARL 66096 inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, we expected that it would be equally effective as an inhibitor of ADP-induced Ca2+mobilization and IP3metabolism. However, concentrations known to effectively inhibit aggregation had no effect on either Ca2+ mobilization (Fig.4) or IP3 formation (TableII). Since inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is another major intracellular effect of ADP on platelets, we investigated the ability of ARL 66096 to block the ADP-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig.5). ARL 66096 inhibited this response in the same concentration range as it inhibited aggregation. In contrast to ARL 66096, ATP blocked ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization, shape change, and aggregation within the same concentration range (data not shown).Table IIThe effect of ARL 66096 on ADP-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 formationAgonistDisintegrations/min [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3Basal127 ± 24ADP (10 μm)317 ± 982-aSignificantly different than control by analysis of variance (Fisher's test).

Incubations were continued for 2 min after ADP addition after which stopping solution was added. Forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP level in the absence of ADP was 4.2% of total [3H]adenine nucleotide.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the effect of ADP on platelets remain obscure. It is well accepted that the effects of ADP in platelets are receptor-mediated and this receptor has been designated P2T receptor. However, several observations have remained unexplained. First, 2-MeSADP is at least 100-fold more potent than ADP in causing platelet aggregation and adenylyl cyclase inhibition, but only 4-fold more potent in mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Second, the thienopyridine analogs ticlopidine and clopidogrel when used in vivo are potent and specific inhibitors of ADP-induced platelet aggregation and antagonize ADP inhibition of prostaglandin E1-activated adenylyl cyclase in intact platelets (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, these compounds do not block ADP-induced shape change or intracellular calcium mobilization (32Mills D.C.B. Puri R.N. Hu J. Minnitti C. Granna C. Freedman M. Colman R.F. Colman R.W. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) nor do they affect ADP-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain and pleckstrin in platelets (33Savi P. Artcanuthurry V. Bornia J. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Levytoledano S. Herbert J.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Third, a congenital defect in platelet function attributed to an ADP receptor defect has been described by Nurden et al. (34Nurden P. Savi P. Heilman E. Bihour C. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. Nurden A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation was abnormal and ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was abolished. However, ADP-induced shape change was unaltered. Finally, several megakaryocytic cell lines and human erythroleukemia cells have been reported to express platelet ADP receptors (35Akbar G.K. Dasari V.R. Sheth S.B. Ashby B. Mills D.C.K. J. Receptor Signal Transd. Res. 1996; 16: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Murgo A.J. Contrera J.G. Sistare F.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Gardell S.J. Thromb. Res. 1995; 77: 235-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) but ADP does not inhibit adenylyl cyclase in these cell lines (38Vittet D. Mathieu M.N. Launay J.M. Chevillard C. Exp. Hematol. 1997; 20: 1129-1134Google Scholar). Hourani and Hall (22Hourani S.M. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have proposed a two-receptor model to explain the actions of ADP on platelet function. In this model, rapid calcium influx is mediated by a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel while adenylyl cyclase inhibition and intracellular Ca2+mobilization are modulated by the P2T receptor through multiple G-proteins. A similar model was advocated by Gachet and co-workers (26Gachet C. Hechler B. Léon C. Vial C. Leray C. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J.P. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 271-275Google Scholar), who proposed that the P2Y1 receptor is the P2T receptor mediating inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. They propose that calcium entering through P2X receptor activation could cause mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores by a calcium-induced calcium release mechanism. Severe deficiencies of the latter model are first that the P2X receptor agonist, α,β-MeATP, does not produce either the extent or duration of Ca2+ mobilization that ADP produces (7MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and second that ADP can cause intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in the absence of external Ca2+. Although phospholipase C activation and inositol phosphate formation have been shown to be important in mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores in many cellular systems, this intracellular effect of ADP-induced platelet activation has been controversial. In this paper, we have confirmed our earlier findings that ADP causes an increase in inositol trisphosphates using high performance liquid chromatography to separate inositol trisphosphate isomers and show that there is a significant, 3-fold increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3, which is the isomer that causes release of intracellular stores of Ca2+ (39Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar). Overall the increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 correlate well with changes in intracellular Ca2+. However, Ca2+ levels start to decline at 10 s while IP3 levels remain relatively high. This suggests that the initial release of Ca2+ may trigger resequestration mechanisms that rapidly lower intracellular Ca2+ levels. Levels of intracellular Ca2+, even through much lower than the peak concentration, remain above basal for 30 s (Fig. 1), especially in the presence of 1 mmexternal Ca2+ (7MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that ARL 66096 had no effect on ADP-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, in the range where it is known to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation (31Humphries R.G. Tomlinson W. Ingall A.H. Cage P.A. Leff P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The possibility that the effects of ADP on platelets are mediated through at least two different receptors has long been the subject of conjecture (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Hourani S.M. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using ARL 66096, we can clearly separate two distinct responses of platelets to ADP. ARL 66096 was able to completely inhibit ADP-induced aggregation at a concentration as low as 100 nm while it had no effect platelet shape change at concentrations over 10-fold higher. ARL 66096 also did not inhibit ADP-induced Ca2+mobilization or IP3 production in this range. MacKenzie et al. (7MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have shown a receptor of the P2X family, P2X1, on platelets that is coupled to rapid Ca2+influx. α,β-MeATP, a P2X receptor agonist, while causing a small transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ of a few seconds duration, failed to cause prolonged mobilization of intracellular calcium, IP3 formation, or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3). Thus IP3 formation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase are independent of the P2X receptor activation. These data can best be explained if there are two separate receptors for ADP on platelets apart from the P2X1 receptor on platelets that is coupled to rapid Ca2+ influx, one coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the other coupled to phospholipase C-Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, we propose a three-receptor model to explain the effects of ADP on platelet activation. This model explains several of the inconsistencies that two receptors models fail to explain. We propose that 2-MeSADP has relatively higher affinity at the ADP receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibition, that thienopyridines selectively inhibit signal transduction through this same receptor, and that the patient described by Nurden et al. (34Nurden P. Savi P. Heilman E. Bihour C. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. Nurden A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) has a defect in this receptor but not in the ADP receptor coupled to activation of phospholipase C. Finally, hemopoetic cell lines have been shown to lack the ADP receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibition but express the ADP receptor coupled to activation of phospholipase C. Currently the platelet ADP receptor has been designed P2T (21Mills D.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Hourani S.M. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Since this nomenclature does not distinguish between the two physiological receptors that we have defined, we propose a new nomenclature that will functionally distinguish the platelet ADP receptors; a P2TAC receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a P2TPLCreceptor coupled to activation of phospholipase C, and the P2X1 receptor responsible for rapid Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6 and Table III). The IUPHAR committee has recommended that the uncloned ADP receptor on platelets should be designated P2YADP, as the P2Y receptor at which ADP is an agonist (20Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Schwabe U. Williams M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, since both the P2TPLC and P2TAC receptors respond to ADP and are not cloned at this stage, the name P2YADP would not distinguish the two receptors that we have defined. After cloning, these receptors will be designed with standard P2Y numbering. The accompanying paper (40Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (406) Google Scholar) describes the molecular identity of the P2TPLC receptor and its functional role in platelet activation. The fact that P2Y1 has been shown to couple through a G-protein dependent mechanism to phospholipase C activation, IP3 formation, and Ca2+ mobilization (25Léon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 41Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J.

https://openalex.org/W2002552794,"The three mammalian hyaluronan synthase (HAS) genes and the related Xenopus laevis gene,DG42, belong to a larger evolutionarily conserved vertebrate HAS gene family. We have characterized additional vertebrate HAS genes from chicken (chas2 and chas3) andXenopus (xhas2, xhas3, and a uniqueXenopus HAS-related sequence, xHAS-rs). Genomic structure analyses demonstrated that all vertebrate HAS genes share at least one exon-intron boundary, suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestral gene.

Northern analyses revealed a similar temporal expression pattern of HAS genes in developing mouse andXenopus embryos. Expression of mouse Has2, Has3, andXenopus Has1 (DG42) led to hyaluronan biosynthesis in transfected mammalian cells. However, only mouse Has2 and Has3 expressing cells formed significant hyaluronan-dependent pericellular coats in culture, implying both functional similarities and differences among vertebrate HAS enzymes.

Simple linear carbohydrate polymers make up the largest biomass on the Earth. These polymers include cellulose, chitin, and arguably their vertebrate equivalent, hyaluronan (HA). 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase; UTR, untranslated region; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TRU, turbidity reducing unit.1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase; UTR, untranslated region; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TRU, turbidity reducing unit. All of these polymers play protective or supporting roles in the organisms in which they are synthesized; cellulose makes up the plant cell wall, chitin makes up fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons, and hyaluronan is an important component of skin, cartilage, and connective tissue. The hyaluronan capsule synthesized by group A streptococci also plays a protective role in this bacterium, shielding the organism from the host's immune system (1Kass E.H. Seastone C.V. J. Exp.

Moreover, in vertebrates hyaluronan can influence cell behavior including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation through interactions with specific cell-surface HA receptors such as CD44 and RHAMM (6Hall C.L.

The three gene products share 55–71% sequence identity. In addition, they display sequence homology with the Streptococcus pyogenes HA synthase, HasA, to the developmentally regulated Xenopus laevis DG42 protein and to other β-glycosaminyltransferases such as the rhizobial NodC proteins, yeast chitin synthases, and a recently reported family of putative plant cellulose synthases (18Spicer A.P. Olson J.S. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8957-8961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expression of any one mammalian HAS gene leads to HA biosynthesis by transfected mammalian cells, suggesting a critical role for these enzymes in the HA biosynthetic pathway. The three mammalian HAS genes are localized on separate autosomes (24Spicer A.P. Seldin M.F. Olsen A.S. Brown N. Wells D.E. Doggett N.A. Itano N. Kimata K. Inazawa J. McDonald J.A. Genomics. 1997; 41: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that this gene family may have arisen through comparatively ancient gene duplication events.A controversy has emerged regarding the true biological function of theXenopus DG42 protein (25Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4523-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DG42 has been described as both a putative chito-oligosaccharide synthase (26Semino C.E. Robbins P.W.

Furthermore, some of these studies have proposed that there may be functional overlap in these two biosynthetic pathways, with chitin oligosaccharides possibly acting as primers that are required for and the limiting factor for hyaluronan biosynthesis (25Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4523-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report the results of studies designed to elucidate the relationships between HAS family members and XenopusDG42. These studies demonstrate that the Xenopus DG42 gene is a member of a larger vertebrate gene family that includes the mammalian HAS genes. The data presented also show that the vertebrate hyaluronan synthases are differentially expressed and have related but distinct enzymatic properties.DISCUSSIONGene families typically arise through a process of sequential gene duplication and divergence. In addition to relatedness based upon simple sequence conservation, family members may share other characteristics such as location within the genome, similarity of flanking genes (for gene families that have arisen by large genome-wide duplications (44Ruddle F.H. Bentley K.L. Murtha M.T. Risch N. Development. 1994; : 155-161Google Scholar)), and the locations of exon-intron boundaries within the genes (45Brown N.P. Whittaker A.J. Newell W.R. Rawlings C.J. Beck S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 46Aruga J. Nagai T. Tokuyama T. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y. Chapman V.M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1043-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the identification of a mammalian gene family encoding putative hyaluronan synthases. The human and mouse HAS genes are located on three separate autosomes within the mammalian genome (24Spicer A.P. Seldin M.F. Olsen A.S. Brown N. Wells D.E. Doggett N.A. Itano N. Kimata K. Inazawa J. McDonald J.A. Genomics. 1997; 41: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This suggests that the HAS gene family arose comparatively early in vertebrate evolution consistent with the existence of the HAS gene family in X. laevis (Fig. 1). Furthermore, sequence alignments indicated that an apparentHAS2 orthologue exists in the zebrafish (Fig. 1). In addition to HAS1 (DG42), HAS2, andHAS3 orthologues, a unique HAS-related sequence, designatedxHAS-rs, was identified in Xenopus. cDNA clones predicted a protein of 583 amino acids that was similar in structure to other HAS members and most closely related to the xHas1 (DG42) protein (65% identity).The conserved genomic structures of vertebrate HAS genes, includingxhas1 (DG42) and xHAS-rs, suggest that they represent a single gene family arising from a common ancestral gene. All HAS genes share a common exon-intron boundary, between exons 2 and 3. Based upon shared exon-intron boundaries, the HAS genes could be split into two subfamilies (Fig. 4 and Table I). Our data support a model of three sequential gene duplication events; the first event generating two related genes that diverged to form the HAS1 and HAS2 lineages, followed by two additional events to generate HAS1 and HAS-rs and HAS2 and HAS3, respectively. Our future experiments will attempt to trace the origin of the vertebrate HAS gene family.Northern analyses demonstrated that the three mammalian HAS genes have distinct patterns of expression in the developing embryo and in the adult, suggesting that the regulatory elements that control transcription of these genes have diverged substantially. However, the embryonic expression patterns of mouse Has genes were very similar to those of their orthologues in the developingXenopus embryo (Fig. 5 A). This suggests that although the transcriptional regulatory elements of HAS genes have diverged substantially between genes, the regulatory elements may have been essentially conserved between species. Significantly, the embryonic pattern of expression of mouse Has1 was the most restricted and corresponded closely to the pattern observed for XenopusHas1 (DG42). Thus, our genomic structure and expression data strongly suggest that mouse Has1 represents the orthologue ofXenopus DG42. Thus, we propose a re-evaluation of the nomenclature for the X. laevis DG42 gene and its encoded product and suggest that this gene be named xhas1.The functions of the mammalian HAS proteins and Xenopus Has1 (DG42) have been previously assessed by ourselves and other investigators (13Itano N.

Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies have employed in vitro transcription/translation, expression in bakers' yeast, and expression in a number of established mammalian cell lines. We have extended these studies to a functional comparison of vertebrate HAS enzymes in a single mammalian cell line, COS-1. Results from our studies suggest that vertebrate HAS enzymes are not functionally equivalent. Thus, mouse Has1, although previously shown to be active in other mammalian cell lines (13Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), was not significantly active in COS-1 cells. In contrast, mouse Has2 and mouse Has3 expression led to the formation of substantial HA-dependent pericellular coats. However, the size of the HA synthesized in vitro by Has2 membranes was substantially larger than that synthesized by Has3 membranes. Interestingly, membrane preparations of XenopusHas1 (DG42) expressing COS-1 cells possessed substantial HA synthase activity in vitro and synthesized a comparatively small hyaluronidase-sensitive polymer, yet COS-1 and 293 cells failed to form HA-dependent pericellular coats in culture. Thus, it appears that polymer size and subsequent fate of the newly synthesized HA may be regulated by expression of a specific HAS enzyme in a given cell type.The most recently identified HAS family member, XenopusHAS-rs, has been inactive in all functional assays performed to date. Genomic structure and expression analyses support the hypothesis that the xHAS-rs gene duplicated from the xhas1(DG42) gene. All of our efforts to identify a mammalian orthologue have failed. Significantly, expressed sequence tag (EST) clones for all three mammalian HAS genes have been identified through homology searches of public domain data bases. 3A. P. Spicer and J. A. McDonald, unpublished observations. No other HAS-related sequences have been identified. It is possible, therefore, that thexHAS-rs gene arose by a duplication event that occurred after the divergence of the amphibian lineage. Alternatively, this gene may have arisen before the amphibian divergence and subsequently been lost from some vertebrate lineages. It is entirely possible that the open reading frame for the xHAS-rs gene is not stably expressed and that this gene is thus non-functional. The sequence around the predicted translation initiation codon (ATG) ofxHAS-rs does not conform to the most favorable Kozak initiation signal of A or G at −3 base pairs.The vertebrate HAS enzymes are related to other eukaryotic β-glycosaminyltransferases, including the chitin and cellulose synthases, at the primary amino acid sequence level. These gene families may have evolved from independent origins, their sequence identities being the result of functional convergence. There are many examples of enzymes that catalyze the same reaction evolving independently. These include the superoxide dismutases, alcohol dehydrogenases, and serine proteases (reviewed in Ref. 47Doolittle R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 15-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that the eukaryotic chitin, cellulose, and HA synthases have evolved through divergent evolution from a common ancestral eukaryotic β-glycosaminyltransferase and thus constitute a super family of genes.The S. pyogenes hyaluronan synthase, HasA, is encoded within the HAS operon, which encodes three polypeptides including HasA, HasB (a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase), and HasC (a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) (48Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similar operons occur in other Gram-positive bacteria; for instance the operon controlling type 3 polysaccharide capsule biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Significantly, the Cap3B glycosyltransferase enzyme encoded within this operon is also flanked by ORFs encoding a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (49Arrecubieta C. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cap3B is 26% identical to HasA and creates a similar polysaccharide, consisting of β1→3-linked disaccharide units of cellobiuronic acid (GlcUAβ1→4Glc) (50Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the HAS operon of group A streptococci evolved in the context of other prokaryotic capsule polysaccharide synthase operons, rather than by horizontal gene transfer (51Syvanen M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) from eukaryotes as has been recently proposed (52Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This would suggest that HAS enzymes have evolved independently on at least two occasions, to generate the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes, respectively. As genes encoding additional related β-glycosaminyltransferases are cloned, the evolution of these enzymes can be more fully investigated. In particular, the cloning of invertebrate (Drosophila or crab for instance) or vertebrate (Paralipophrys trigloides, the blennie, a teleost fish, one of the rare vertebrates that appears to synthesize chitin within its pectoral fins (53Wagner G.P. Lo J. Laine R. Almeder M. Experentia (Basel). 1993; 49: 317-319Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) chitin synthase genes would represent a major advance in this area.In conclusion, we have attempted to define genetic, transcriptional, and functional relationships among vertebrate HA synthases. Differences in mRNA expression patterns in concert with apparent functional differences suggest that there are multiple levels of regulation of HA biosynthesis in vertebrates. Future experiments will continue investigation into the molecular evolution of this gene family and will consider the respective role and functional relationships of HA synthases in vivo using the mouse as a model. Simple linear carbohydrate polymers make up the largest biomass on the Earth. These polymers include cellulose, chitin, and arguably their vertebrate equivalent, hyaluronan (HA). 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase; UTR, untranslated region; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TRU, turbidity reducing unit.1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase; UTR, untranslated region; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TRU, turbidity reducing unit. All of these polymers play protective or supporting roles in the organisms in which they are synthesized; cellulose makes up the plant cell wall, chitin makes up fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons, and hyaluronan is an important component of skin, cartilage, and connective tissue. The hyaluronan capsule synthesized by group A streptococci also plays a protective role in this bacterium, shielding the organism from the host's immune system (1Kass E.H. Seastone C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1944; 79: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Wessels M.R. Moses A.E. Goldberg J.B. DiCesare T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to protective and supporting roles based upon physicochemical properties, simple carbohydrate polymers can act as signaling molecules. For example, in leguminous plants short lipochito-oligosaccharides produced by rhizobial species signal the formation of the specialized root nodule structure (4Göttfert M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 104: 39-64Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Schultze M. Kondorosi A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vertebrates hyaluronan can influence cell behavior including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation through interactions with specific cell-surface HA receptors such as CD44 and RHAMM (6Hall C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2041750289,"Since the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that induce the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells into the osteogenic cells, we identified the relevant signaling molecules responsible for mediating BMP-2 effects on mesenchymal precursor cells. BMP-2 induces osteoblastic differentiation of the pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C2C12 by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production. As recent studies have demonstrated that cytoplasmic Smad proteins are involved in TGF-β superfamily signaling, we plan to isolate the relevant Smad family members involved in osteoblastic differentiation. We identified human Smad5, which is highly homologous to Smad1. BMP-2 caused serine phosphorylation of Smad5 as well as Smad1. In contrast, TGF-β failed to cause serine phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad5. We found Smad5 is directly activated by BMP type Ia or Ib receptors through physical association with these receptors. Following phosphorylation, Smad5 bound to DPC4, another Smad family member, and the complex was translocated to the nucleus. Overexpression of point-mutated Smad5 (G419S) or a C-terminal deletion mutant DPC4 (DPC4ΔC) blocked the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin production, and Smad5-DPC4 signaling cascades upon BMP-2 treatment in C2C12 cells. These data suggest that activation of Smad5 and subsequent Smad5-DPC4 complex formation are key steps in the BMP signaling pathway, which mediates BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation of the C2C12 mesenchymal cells. Since the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that induce the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells into the osteogenic cells, we identified the relevant signaling molecules responsible for mediating BMP-2 effects on mesenchymal precursor cells.

Among BMPs, BMP-2 and BMP-4 have been shown to promote the development of bone and cartilage by inducing the differentiation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells into the osteoblastic cells or cartilage cells, respectively (2Hogan B.L.M.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of BMP on differentiation of these cells toward bone and cartilage are poorly understood. BMPs exert their diverse biological effects through two types of transmembrane receptors, BMP type I (BMPIR) and type II (BMPRII) receptors (6Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

BMPIR is further subclassified into BMP type IaR (also called ALK3) and IbR (also called ALK6) (6Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Upon binding to the type II receptors, BMPs induce heterodimerization between BMP type I and type II receptors, and transduce signals into the cytoplasm (6Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Recent studies have shown that cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including Mad (mother against dpp), theXenopus homologue of Mad, Xmad1, Xmad2, and several human homologues of Mad, Smads, play critical roles in TGF-β superfamily signaling (7Massagué J.

DPC4 (Smad4) was initially found to be a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancers (17Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T.M.S. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fisher A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). DPC4 is not phosphorylated but forms a complex with Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 upon BMP or TGF-β treatment (18Lagma G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

Thus, DPC4 may have unique roles in TGF-β superfamily signaling. Interestingly, Smad6 (20Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.-Y. Deeds J.D. Feeley R. Gimeno C.J. Woolf E.A. Tayber O.

Despite these data, it is not known whether these Smad family members are specific for these growth factors, or whether the growth factors may utilize different Smad family members for different biological effects. Furthermore, considering the multifunctional properties of the BMPs, it is possible that there are still unidentified Smad family members. In the present study, we first sought Smad family members that might be involved in BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cells. We isolated several human Smad family members including Smad5. Because the functional roles of Smad5 in TGF-β superfamily signaling have not been fully characterized as yet, we focused our efforts on Smad5 and found that Smad5 was directly activated by BMP type Ia or Ib receptors upon BMP-2 stimulation and transduced BMP-2 signals to the nucleus by forming a complex with DPC4. Moreover, we demonstrate that Smad5 and DPC4 play a critical role in the induction of the osteoblastic differentiation of the pluripotent mesenchymal cells C2C12 by BMP-2. 293 cells, L6 cells and C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). NMuMg cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). Anti-HA polyclonal antibody, anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, and anti-Flag monoclonal antibody were purchased from BAbCO, Transduction Laboratories, and IBI, respectively. Anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine polyclonal antibodies were purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. Human homologues of Mad cDNA were isolated using the PCR-nested cloning approach. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed based on the conserved region of Drosophila Mad (22Raftery L.A. Twombly V. Wharton K. Gelbart W.M.

After PCR amplification, predicted size PCR products were subcloned into TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and their DNA sequences were determined by dideoxy DNA sequencing kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The PCR products were released from TA-cloning vector with EcoRI, and radiolabeled with random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and [32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Human 293 cell cDNA library (gifted by Joseph Schlessinger and Ivan Dikic) were screened with radiolabeled probes and positive clones were isolated by two additional round of screening. The isolated clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. BMP type Ia (BMPIaR), Ib (BMPIbR), BMP type II (BMPRII), TGF-β type I (TGF-βRI), and TGF-β type II (TGF-βRII) receptors, and Flag-Smad1 were used as described previously (10Hoodless P.A. Haerry T.

The site-directed mutagenesis of Smad1, Smad3, Smad5, and DPC4 was performed using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequences analysis. Mutant Smad1, mutant Smad3, and mutant Smad5 were generated by replacing glycine 419, 379, or 419 by serine, respectively. Mutant DPC4 was generated by introducing stop codon at C-terminal region of DPC4. 293 cells, NMuMg cells, L6 cells, or C2C12 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Tfx-50 (Promega) according to the manufacture's protocol. The cells were serum-starved with DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 16 h, and treated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 or 10 ng/ml TGF-β for 15 min. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer (PBS), and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mmsodium orthovanadate) (25Nishimura R.

The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, 16,000 × g. The lysates were incubated with antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or protein G-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol, and supernatants were recovered as immunoprecipitate samples. These samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted with anti-antibodies. The samples were visualized with horseradish peroxidase coupled to protein A (KPL) or horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cappel), and enhanced by ECL detection kits (Amersham). For 32P metabolic labeling, serum-starved cells were incubated phosphate-free DMEM for 3 h, and then incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi (NEN Life Science Products) for 3 h. The lysates of cells treated with or without 100 ng/ml BMP-2 or 10 ng/ml TGF-β for 15 min were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The cells were serum-starved with DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 16 h, and treated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 for 40 min. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde-PBS. After 15 min of incubation with 0.1% Triton-PBS, the cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS, incubated with anti-Flag antibody (1:500) for 2 h, and washed six times with 0.1% Triton-PBS, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.). The cells were extensively washed with PBS and visualized by fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). The number of cells whose nucleus was stained by anti-Flag antibody was counted per hundred cells at four independent fields. Smad5 and DPC4 cDNA were subcloned into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in frame. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity column (25Nishimura R. Li W.

After extensively washing the beads, the molecules associated with GST fusion proteins were determined by Western blotting using anti-HA polyclonal or anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies. BMPIbR or TGF-βRI was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells overexpressing HA-tagged BMPIbR or TGF-βRI using anti-HA antibody, and the amount of immunoprecipitated receptors were examined by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Soluble form of recombinant GST-Smad5 or GST-DPC4 fusion proteins (1 μg) were incubated with immunoprecipitated HA-tagged BMPIbR or TGF-βRI in the presence of 5 mm MnCl2 and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) at 28 °C for 20 min (26Kretzschmar M.

Since Smad5 shows high homology to Smad1 that is phosphorylated by BMP-2 (10Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

To carry out the experiments, we tagged Flag-epitope (10Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

As shown Fig.2 A, Smad5 was clearly phosphorylated by BMP-2 (lane 2). In contrast, TGF-β had no effect on the phosphorylation of Smad5 (Fig. 2 A,lane 6). Western blotting analysis using antibodies to phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine revealed that the serine residue(s) of Smad5 was phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). Neither tyrosine nor threonine residues were phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and8). Point-mutated Smad5 in which the highly conserved 419 glycine residue was replaced by serine was not phosphorylated by BMP-2 (Fig. 2, lane 4 in A and B), as shown previously for Smad1 (10Hoodless P.A.

Since their results are not consistent with our present data, we determined Smad5 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β or BMP-2 in NMuMg cells. As shown in Fig.2 C, BMP-2 caused Smad5 phosphorylation (lane 6), whereas TGF-β did not cause Smad5 phosphorylation in NMuMg cells (lane 5). Smad1 showed identical responsiveness to BMP-2 (lanes 2 and 3) to that of Smad5, as shown previously (10Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

On the other hand, we observed that Smad3 was not phosphorylated by BMP-2, but TGF-β clearly phosphorylated Smad3 in NMuMg cells (lanes 8 and 9). We further confirmed the specificity of Smad5 responsiveness to BMP-2 by overexpressing constitutively active BMPIR or TGF-β type I receptors (TGF-βRI). It has been demonstrated that point mutation of BMPIaR at position 233 (glutamine to aspartic acid), BMPIbR at 203 (glutamine to aspartic acid), or TGF-βRI at 204 (threonine to aspartic acid) renders these receptors constitutively active without their corresponding ligands and type II receptors (10Hoodless P.A.

Smad5 was serine-phosphorylated in the presence of constitutively active mutant BMPIaR (233D) or BMPIbR (203D) without BMP-2 stimulation (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2 and6). In contrast, Smad5 phosphorylation did not occur in the presence of constitutively active mutant TGF-βRI (204D) (Fig.2 D, lane 10). Of note, the mutant Smad5 (G419S) in which glycine 419 was replaced by serine was not phosphorylated, even in the presence of constitutively active mutant BMPIaR (233D) (Fig. 2 D, lane 4) or BMPIbR (203D) (Fig.2 D, lane 8). Wild-type BMPIaR or BMPIbR (lanes 1 and 5) failed to serine-phosphorylate Smad5 in the absence of BMP-2. Moreover, recombinant GST-Smad5 was also phosphorylated by BMPIRs, but not by TGF-βRI in vitro(Fig. 2 E), whereas GST-DPC4 was not phosphorylated by BMPIbR or TGF-βRI. These data clearly show that Smad5 is a downstream signaling molecule specific for BMP in two different cell models. To further determine the interaction of Smad5 with BMPIR, we next explored whether Smad5 physically associates with BMPIRs. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in 293 cells that were co-transfected with HA-BMPIbR and Flag-Smad5. As shown in Fig.3 A, Smad5 was co-immunoprecipitated with BMPIbR in a BMP-2-dependent manner (lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with this result obt"

Dietary fatty acids are converted to arachidonic acid, which serves as precursor of prostaglandins (PGs). PGJ2 derivatives function as activating ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a nuclear hormone receptor that is central to adipogenic determination. We report here that PGF2α blocks adipogenesis through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, resulting in inhibitory phosphorylation of PPARγ. Both mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and PPARγ phosphorylation are required for the anti-adipogenic effects of PGF2α. Thus, PG signals generated at a cell surface receptor regulate the program of gene expression required for adipogenesis by modulating the activity of a nuclear hormone receptor that is directly activated by other PG signals. The balance between PGF2α and PGJ2 signaling may thus be central to the development of obesity and diabetes. Fat cell differentiation is a critical aspect of obesity and diabetes.

PPARγ, the nuclear receptor for PGJ2 derivatives, plays a central role in adipogenesis (12Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

An endogenous PPARγ ligand is therefore likely to be an important metabolic regulator. The rate-limiting step in PGJ2 biosynthesis is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX) (18Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). The actions of different enzymes upon the COX product PGH2 lead to numerous PGs that have different effects on growth, differentiation, and function of many tissues, including PGF2α (7Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). PGF2α is known to be synthesized by preadipocytes but does not activate PPARγ (9Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23975-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and by contrast has a potent inhibitory effect upon adipocyte differentiation (19Casimir D.A.

Thus, products of AA metabolism downstream of COX have opposing effects upon adipogenesis. Although the adipogenic effects of PGJ2 derivatives involve direct activation of nuclear PPARγ, PGF2α utilizes a specific GPCR on the cell surface to initiate intracellular signal transduction (21Sugimoto Y.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5641-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We and others recently showed that activation of the MAP kinase pathway phosphorylates PPARγ and inhibits adipogenesis (25Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13452-13457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Although insulin can induce phosphorylation of ectopic PPARγ in cells expressing ectopic insulin receptor (27Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), insulin is adipogenic, and its ability to activate MAP kinase does not play an important role during adipogenesis (28Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, the physiological inducer of PPARγ phosphorylation is unknown. Thus we considered whether PGF2α might work through this pathway. Here we show that PGF2α induces phosphorylation of PPARγ via activation of MAP kinase and that this is required for inhibition of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis by PGF2α. 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone). Cell were differentiated into mature adipocytes as described previously (29Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments PGs (Cayman Chemical), PD98059 (Calbiochem), or retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma) were added simultaneously with the differentiation medium at day 0 or as indicated and maintained throughout. Compounds were dissolved in either ethanol or Me2SO according to manufacturer instructions. For acute treatment with PGs, cells were treated for 30 min and then harvested for protein. Retroviral gene transduction of 3T3-L1 cells with PPARγ2 or PPARγ2 (S112A) were performed as described previously (26Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Briefly, infected 3T3-L1 cells were selected in G418 and grown to confluence in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% iron-enriched fetal bovine serum). 2 days post-confluency (day 0) vehicle control or PGs were added to medium and maintained throughout. Morphology and RNA were analyzed at day 10. Isolation of total RNA and Northern blots were performed as described previously (29Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA probes for aP2, adipsin, and actin were labeled with 32P using random hexamers. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3T3-L1 cells using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with pepstatin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). Extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged 30 min at 4 °C. 100 μg of soluble protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel, acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 100 with 4 m urea), and immunoblots were performed as described previously (29Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody (New England BioLabs) was used at a 1:400 dilution. We first determined whether PGF2α activates MAP kinase. Fig.1 A shows that indeed, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with PGF2α leads to a dose-dependent increase in activated MAP kinase. Similar MAP kinase activation was observed with fluprostenol, a specific ligand for the PGF2α receptor (FP receptor) (23Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Bayne M.A. Metters K.M. Slipetz D.M. Grygorczyk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2632-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not with 15d-PGJ2. Note that PD98059, the specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar), also prevented the activation of MAP kinase by PGF2α and fluprostenol. We next tested whether MAP kinase activation was required for inhibition of adipogenesis by PGF2α. Fig. 1 B shows the morphology of 3T3-L1 cells 7 days after exposure to differentiation medium. As expected, PGF2α, fluprostenol, and RA blocked acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype, whereas 15d-PGJ2 did not. The MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 had little effect on its own. However, it completely prevented inhibition of adipogenesis by PGF2α and by fluprostenol, indicating that MAP kinase activation was required for the anti-adipogenic effects of these compounds. This effect of PD98059 was specific for inhibition by PGF2α and fluprostenol, because PD98059 had no effect on the ability of RA to inhibit adipogenesis, consistent with evidence that RA acts by antagonizing the effects of C/EBP (29Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a mechanism that would be predicted to be independent of MAP kinase. We also assessed the effects of MAP kinase inhibition on the induction of fatty acid binding protein aP2 and adipsin, two adipocyte-specific genes that serve as markers of the differentiation process (31Cook K.S. Hunt C.R. Spiegelman B.M. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 100: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Bernlohr D.A. Angus C.W. Lane M.D. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1897; 237: 402-405Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that induction of aP2 and adipsin was blocked by PGF2α and by RA. Consistent with the cellular morphology, MAP kinase inhibition prevented inhibition of the adipocyte-specific genes by PGF2α but not by RA. Indeed, MAP kinase inhibition caused a reproducible increase in aP2 expression, consistent with a recent report that MAP kinase activation is anti-adipogenic (28Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Given the ability of PGF2α to activate MAP kinase and the inhibitory effects of MAP kinase phosphorylation on the activity of PPARγ, we next tested the effects of PGF2α on PPARγ phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of PPARγ2 on serine 112 can be detected by differences in electrophoretic mobility of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. Fig. 2 A shows that 3T3-L1 cells on day 4 of a standard differentiation protocol express abundant PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 protein, with about equal amounts of the hypophosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of each. Treatment with PGF2α increased the phosphorylation state of the PPARγ isoforms in a concentration-dependent manner, and the phosphorylation was blocked by the MAP kinase inhibitor. Similar results were obtained with fluprostenol. By contrast, 15d-PGJ2 had no effect upon the phosphorylation state of PPARγ1 or PPARγ2, and PD98059 had no independent effect. Prostacyclin (PGI2) also had no effect on PPARγ phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus PGF2α activation of MAP kinase resulted in phosphorylation of endogenous PPARγ in 3T3-L1 cells. PGF2α-induced phosphorylation of PPARγ inhibited its transcriptional activity as previously shown for phosphorylation of PPARγ by other agents (data not shown). We next tested whether PGF2α-induced phosphorylation of PPARγ correlated with inhibition of adipogenesis. Fig. 2 B shows that PPARγ protein was not reproducibly detectable on day 0, and the differentiation process involves amplification of PPARγ expression by a feed-forward mechanism. The ability of PPARγ ligands to induce adipogenesis (14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 34Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that functional PPARγ is present in the preadipocyte, and thus hyperphosphorylation by PGF2α would inhibit their function. However, PGF2α inhibition of adipogenesis also blocked the feed-forward induction of PPARγ, preventing analysis of PPARγ phosphorylation due to technical limitations (data not shown). Nevertheless, we were able to test the correlation between inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ phosphorylation by addition of PGF2α at times when PPARγ protein was expressed. Fig. 2 B shows that PPARγ protein was induced between days 1 and 2 of adipogenesis and reached maximum levels by days 3 and 4. Both PPARγ and PPARγ2 were present in nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated states, with similar ratios of nonphosphorylated to phosphorylated PPARγ throughout differentiation. Addition of PGF2α at day 3 caused a marked reduction in adipocyte differentiation, as indicated by a dramatic (70%) reduction in aP2 gene expression on day 7 (Fig. 2 C) as well as by a similar reduction in adipogenesis as assessed by cell morphology (data not shown). PPARγ induction is itself a marker of adipocyte differentiation, and indeed PPARγ levels were lower in the PGF2α-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus the ability of PGF2α to inhibit adipogenesis correlated with the phosphorylation of endogenous PPARγ. Thus far we have shown that the ability of PGF2α to activate MAP kinase is essential for its ability to inhibit adipogenesis, that MAP kinase activation by PGF2α is sufficient to phosphorylate PPARγ in 3T3-L1 cells, and that this phosphorylation correlates with inhibition of differentiation. We next tested whether the ability to phosphorylate PPARγ was necessary for PGF2α to inhibit adipogenesis. We previously showed that ectopic expression of PPARγ2 results in adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (35Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21473-21478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PGF2α-induced phosphorylation of the ectopic PPARγ2 would inhibit its ability to induce adipogenesis, whereas adipocytic differentiation induced by PPARγ2 (S112A) would be unaffected by activation of MAP kinase by PGF2α. Indeed, Fig.3 A shows that PGF2α completely prevented adipogenesis due to PPARγ2 expression but had little or no effect upon adipogenesis caused by PPARγ2 (S112A). In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 potentiated the adipogenicity of both wild type and mutant PPARγ. Fig. 3 B shows that the wild type PPARγ was nearly completely phosphorylated by PGF2α, whereas the PPARγ2 (S112A) was not phosphorylated at all. Fig. 3 C shows that this difference in susceptibility to the effects of PGF2α was reflected in the expression of the adipocyte marker adipsin. PGF2α completely prevented the ability of PPARγ2 to induce adipsin but had no effect on adipsin induction by the nonphosphorylatable form of PPARγ2. Again, 15d-PGJ2 functioned as an activating ligand of both forms of PPARγ. Our results shed important new light on the role of cell surface and nuclear receptors for eicosanoids. Some eicosanoids, such as leukotriene B4, interact with both cell surface receptors and nuclear PPARα, and these signaling pathways are cooperative (9Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P.

In contrast, PGF2α and PGJ2 derivatives are different products of AA metabolism with opposing biological effects mediated by cell surface and nuclear receptors, respectively. These converge on the PG nuclear receptor PPARγ as in the model shown in Fig.4. 3T3-L1 cells are known to produce PGF2α, and in accordance with recent suggestions our model proposes that a PPARγ ligand related to PGJ2 is endogenously produced during adipogenesis. However, the expression of PGD synthase in adipocytes has not been established, and it is likely that prostaglandins or other PPARγ ligands derived from paracrine, endocrine, as well as pharmacological sources outside the fat cell could also influence this process. In any case, in a single cell type, PGs can function both by binding to GPCRs (PGF2α) or to nuclear hormone receptors (PGJ2 and derivatives). Despite the different types of receptors bound by PGF2α and PGJ2 derivatives, both the inhibition of PPARγ activity by PGF2α-driven phosphorylation as well as activation of PPARγ by noncovalent PG ligand binding could be physiologically relevant not only in adipocytes but also in other cell types that express PPARγ, such as lung (39Michael L.F.

Moreover, because other eicosanoids function via cell surface and nuclear receptors, similar opportunities exist for convergent regulation of biological processes by eicosanoids that either bind directly to or modulate the phosphorylation state of nuclear hormone receptors. Chronic exposure of adipocytes to AA causes a state of insulin resistance associated with down-regulation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (43Tebbey P.W. McGowan K.M. Stephens J.M. Buttke T.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, AA-derived PGF2α levels are increased in diabetic humans (44Barnett A.H.

The link between free fatty acid levels and the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes has been recognized for many years (46Randle P.J. Priestman D.A. Mistry S. Halsall A. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our results provide a potential molecular mechanism relating fatty acids to both increased and decreased activity of the adipogenic nuclear receptor PPARγ. Because thiazolidinediones that activate PPARγ are potent antidiabetic compounds (47Nolan J.J. Ludvik B. Beerdsen P. Joyce M. Olefsky J. New Eng. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), the ability of PGF2α to inhibit the activity of PPARγ suggests that the FP receptor may be a novel therapeutic target for diabetes.

We have examined communications between these stress- and mitogen-induced signaling pathways.We show here that the stress cascade activator arsenite activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in addition to p38 albeit with different kinetics. Whereas p38 is an early response kinase, ERK activation occurs with delayed time kinetics at 2–4 h. We observed activation of ERK upon arsenite treatment in many different cell lines. ERK activation is strongly enhanced by overexpression of p38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) but is blocked by dominant negative kinase versions of p38 and MKK6 or the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580.

One of these stress-activated pathways leads to the activation of the MAPK family member p38 by the upstream dual specificity kinase MKK6 (MAPK kinase 6), the other parallel cascade recruits the “stress-activated protein kinases” (SAPKs, also termed c-Jun N-terminal kinases, JNKs) through the MEKK/SEK kinase module (MEK kinase, SAPK/ERK kinase). In contrast to the detailed knowledge of cellular responses triggered by the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade, the physiological consequence of stress cascade activation is an open issue. Both cascades were reported to be involved in stress response, cell cycle delay or apoptosis as well as in the activation of immune reactive cells (reviewed in Ref. 3Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that stress- and mitogen-induced kinase cascades are interconnected at several levels. Besides cascade convergence at the level of transcription factors (6Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 7Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Cahill M.A. Janknecht R.

Other examples include kinases such as Tpl-2, which activates both ERK and JNK/SAPKs (12Salmeron A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D. Narsimhan R.P. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A more indirect connection involves induction of an autocrine loop. An oncogenic form of Raf activates the SEK/SAPK pathway, by inducing transcription and release of an autocrine factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (13McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This factor subsequently activates SAPKs by binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor.Although extensive literature documents cross-talk between signaling cascades, there are no reports on activation of the mitogenic cascade by elements of stress-induced kinase cascades. We have now identified such a connection, which is initiated by the stress inducer, arsenite. Arsenite is highly carcinogenic (15Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 16Hartwig A. Biometals. 1995; 8: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and an effective activator of p38 (17Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Since the compound exhibits no detectable mutagenic activity (16Hartwig A. Biometals. 1995; 8: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), it is more plausible that it acts as a tumor promoter. However, the molecular mechanism of this tumor-promoting activity is unknown.On a molecular level, arsenite acts as a sulfhydryl reagent which binds to free thiol (–SH) groups of proteins (15Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). All protein tyrosine phosphatases contain such –SH groups (18Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and it was recently shown that arsenite inhibits a JNK phosphatase, presumably via this mechanism (19Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Additionally, arsenite activates the MKK6/p38 pathway (17Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar) as well as the SEK/SAPK pathway. In previous work, no effect on ERK has been reported, suggesting that arsenite is purely a stress-inducing reagent (17Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 19Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) .We report here that ERK is activated by arsenite in a delayed fashion with different kinetics than ERK activation by growth factors. The activation mechanism involves the MKK6/p38 pathway and the Ras/Raf/MEK-signaling cassette. De novo protein synthesis appears not to play a role, indicating that ERK activation is controlled by a novel intracellular mechanism, connecting stress and mitogenic signaling.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the stress-inducing agent arsenite activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK 1 and 2 in a delayed fashion, compared with stimulation of cells by mitogens. Employing various active and inactive forms of signaling molecules as well as specific inhibitors, we have demonstrated that the MKK6/p38 pathway as well as the Ras/Raf/MEK-signaling module plays a role in stress-induced ERK activation. The link between p38 and Ras/Raf is yet unclear. However,de novo protein synthesis appears not to be involved. Since activation of ERK1/2 was not observed with stress-inducing agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (data not shown) and anisomycin, which transiently and less potently activates the MKK6/p38 pathway, we assume that a strong and sustained p38 activation is required for stimulation of the mitogenic pathway.This assumption is supported by the finding that an active form of MKK6 alone is able to activate the mitogenic cascade. p38 protein amount appears to be rate limiting, since coexpression of p38 with MKK6 (EE) leads to a further increase in ERK activity. However, additional arsenite treatment of constitutively activated MKK6-expressing cells results in a more elevated ERK activation. It might be possible that this is a quantitative effect in that the MKK6 (EE) mutant is not as active as arsenite stimulated wild-type MKK6 and therefore results in a weaker activation of ERK compared with stimulation by arsenite. On the other hand it cannot be ruled out that another arsenite-specific signal may be involved in ERK activation. This secondary signal might either arise from a direct effect on a phosphatase (19Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or from activation of yet unidentified pathways that indirectly interfere with ERK activation. Thus, we cannot completely rule out that the differences observed here are qualitative rather than quantitative.The fact that ERK activation by constitutively active MKK6 could be blocked by the MEK specific inhibitor PD98059 demonstrates that there is a link between the activated MKK6/p38 pathway and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade mediated by a yet unknown downstream effector of p38. So far p38 is known to regulate gene expression from various promoters (24Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), presumably via direct phosphorylation of transcription factors. However, since activation of ERK occurs in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, transcription factors do not appear to play a role here. Other effectors of p38 are members of the MAPKAP-kinase family, namely MAPKAP-K2, 3pK/MAPKAP-K3 (9Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the recently identified kinases Mnk1 and Mnk2 (10Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 11Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of these kinases have been shown to activate the mitogenic cascade. Thus, a novel effector of p38 could be involved in the process described here. This novel effector may either be an autocrine factor released to the medium when phosphorylated, an upstream component of the Ras/Raf initiated cascade which is directly regulated via phosphorylation by p38, or an indirect adaptor or mediator protein. With respect to this mechanism, Ras might be activated in a growth factor receptor-independent fashion. For example, dominant negative Ras (RasN17) was shown to block the TPA-induced effect of protein kinase C on the downstream cascade (26Furstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicating that at least some protein kinase C isoforms may act upstream of Ras.Although we now have some knowledge of signaling pathways involved in ERK activation by arsenite, the biological consequences remain to be elucidated. In addition to the toxic effect of arsenite, the compound exhibits a highly carcinogenic activity (15Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 16Hartwig A. Biometals. 1995; 8: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Since no mutagenic effects could be demonstrated, arsenite seems to act as a tumor promotor. However, the mechanism of this tumor-promoting activity is still unclear. The novel observation of a relatively weak but sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade may be an explanation for the mode of arsenite action in carcinogenesis.In summary, we have identified a novel pathway of ERK activation that differs in mechanism from the classic route of activation by mitogens in that MKK6 and p38 play a role here. This is a first example of an involvement of a stress kinase cascade in activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which may be important with respect to the quality of the signals mediated by the mitogen-activated kinases ERK1/2. There are several parallel signal transduction cascades in mammalian cells that connect extracellular stimuli with gene expression in the nucleus.

We report here that ERK is activated by arsenite in a delayed fashion with different kinetics than ERK activation by growth factors. The activation mechanism involves the MKK6/p38 pathway and the Ras/Raf/MEK-signaling cassette. De novo protein synthesis appears not to play a role, indicating that ERK activation is controlled by a novel intracellular mechanism, connecting stress and mitogenic signaling. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the stress-inducing agent arsenite activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK 1 and 2 in a delayed fashion, compared with stimulation of cells by mitogens. Employing various active and inactive forms of signaling molecules as well as specific inhibitors, we have demonstrated that the MKK6/p38 pathway as well as the Ras/Raf/MEK-signaling module plays a role in stress-induced ERK activation. The link between p38 and Ras/Raf is yet unclear. However,de novo protein synthesis appears not to be involved. Since activation of ERK1/2 was not observed with stress-inducing agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (data not shown) and anisomycin, which transiently and less potently activates the MKK6/p38 pathway, we assume that a strong and sustained p38 activation is required for stimulation of the mitogenic pathway.This assumption is supported by the finding that an active form of MKK6 alone is able to activate the mitogenic cascade. p38 protein amount appears to be rate limiting, since coexpression of p38 with MKK6 (EE) leads to a further increase in ERK activity. However, additional arsenite treatment of constitutively activated MKK6-expressing cells results in a more elevated ERK activation. It might be possible that this is a quantitative effect in that the MKK6 (EE) mutant is not as active as arsenite stimulated wild-type MKK6 and therefore results in a weaker activation of ERK compared with stimulation by arsenite. On the other hand it cannot be ruled out that another arsenite-specific signal may be involved in ERK activation. This secondary signal might either arise from a direct effect on a phosphatase (19Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or from activation of yet unidentified pathways that indirectly interfere with ERK activation. Thus, we cannot completely rule out that the differences observed here are qualitative rather than quantitative.The fact that ERK activation by constitutively active MKK6 could be blocked by the MEK specific inhibitor PD98059 demonstrates that there is a link between the activated MKK6/p38 pathway and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade mediated by a yet unknown downstream effector of p38. So far p38 is known to regulate gene expression from various promoters (24Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), presumably via direct phosphorylation of transcription factors. However, since activation of ERK occurs in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, transcription factors do not appear to play a role here. Other effectors of p38 are members of the MAPKAP-kinase family, namely MAPKAP-K2, 3pK/MAPKAP-K3 (9Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the recently identified kinases Mnk1 and Mnk2 (10Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 11Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of these kinases have been shown to activate the mitogenic cascade. Thus, a novel effector of p38 could be involved in the process described here. This novel effector may either be an autocrine factor released to the medium when phosphorylated, an upstream component of the Ras/Raf initiated cascade which is directly regulated via phosphorylation by p38, or an indirect adaptor or mediator protein. With respect to this mechanism, Ras might be activated in a growth factor receptor-independent fashion. For example, dominant negative Ras (RasN17) was shown to block the TPA-induced effect of protein kinase C on the downstream cascade (26Furstenau U. Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kennerknecht I. Knepel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicating that at least some protein kinase C isoforms may act upstream of Ras.Although we now have some knowledge of signaling pathways involved in ERK activation by arsenite, the biological consequences remain to be elucidated. In addition to the toxic effect of arsenite, the compound exhibits a highly carcinogenic activity (15Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 16Hartwig A. Biometals. 1995; 8: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Since no mutagenic effects could be demonstrated, arsenite seems to act as a tumor promotor. However, the mechanism of this tumor-promoting activity is still unclear. The novel observation of a relatively weak but sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade may be an explanation for the mode of arsenite action in carcinogenesis.In summary, we have identified a novel pathway of ERK activation that differs in mechanism from the classic route of activation by mitogens in that MKK6 and p38 play a role here. This is a first example of an involvement of a stress kinase cascade in activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which may be important with respect to the quality of the signals mediated by the mitogen-activated kinases ERK1/2.

NHE3, the predominant epithelial isoform, is found in apical membranes of renal and intestinal epithelial cells, where it contributes to NaCl (re)absorption. NHE activity has been detected in endomembrane vesicles of epithelial cells, but the precise compartment involved and its functional role have not been defined. Many aspects of the targeting machinery that defines the compartmentation and polarity of epithelia are also functional in nonepithelial cells. We therefore compared the targeting of NHE1, the basolateral isoform, with that of NHE3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. To circumvent the confounding effects of endogenous exchangers, epitope-tagged constructs of NHE1 and NHE3 were stably expressed in antiport-deficient (AP-1) cells. While NHE1 was found almost exclusively in the surface membrane, NHE3 was also found intracellularly, accumulating in a juxtanuclear compartment. Confocal microscopy showed this compartment to be distinct from the Golgi,trans-Golgi network, and lysosomes. Instead, NHE3 colocalized with transferrin receptors and with cellubrevin, markers of recycling endosomes. The activity of NHE3 in endomembranes was assessed by targeting pH-sensitive probes to the recycling endosomes using a chimeric cellubrevin construct with an accessible extracellular epitope. Fluorescence ratio imaging indicated that cellubrevin resides intracellularly in an acidic compartment. In AP-1 cells, endosomal acidification was unaffected by omission of Na+but was dissipated entirely by concanamycin, a blocker of H+-ATPases. In contrast, the cellubrevin compartment was more acidic in NHE3 transfectants, and the acidification was only partially reduced by concanamycin. Moreover, removal of extracellular Na+ resulted in a significant alkalization of the endocytic compartment. These results indicate that NHE3 is present and active in recycling endosomes. By recruiting NHE3 to the plasma membrane, modulation of vesicular traffic could contribute to the regulation of Na+ reabsorption across epithelia.

To maintain the intracellular pH near neutrality, most mammalian cells actively extrude H+ in exchange for extracellular Na+, a process mediated by the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; Cbv, cellubrevin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; pHE, endosomal pH; pHc, cytosolic pH; Tfn, transferrin; Tfn-R, transferrin receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGN, trans-Golgi network; BCECF, 5′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; Cbv, cellubrevin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; pHE, endosomal pH; pHc, cytosolic pH; Tfn, transferrin; Tfn-R, transferrin receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGN, trans-Golgi network; BCECF, 5′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. or antiporter. Exchange of Na+ for H+ across the plasma membrane is a tightly coupled, electroneutral process that is generally sensitive to inhibition by amiloride and benzoyl guanidinium compounds. NHEs are integral membrane phospho(glyco)proteins with 10–12 predicted transmembrane domains and a sizable carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain Ca2+ believed to face the cytoplasm (1Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2Yun C.H. Tse C.M. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Six members of the NHE family have been identified to date. NHE1, thought to be the “housekeeping” isoform, is found on the plasma membranes of virtually all animal cells, including the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, where it is believed to control cytosolic pH (pHc) and to play a role in cell volume regulation (3Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). NHE2, -3, -4, and -5 display a more restricted tissue distribution, probably reflecting specialized functions, whereas NHE6 is expressed in all tissues examined to date. NHE3 is the best characterized of these isoforms; it is predominantly expressed in kidney and gut, where it is found on the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells. This isoform is thought to play a central role in transepithelial reabsorption of Na+. NHE activity has been described in endosomes of the renal cortex, where it was postulated to play a potential role in the maintenance of endosomal pH (4Hilden S.A. Ghoshroy K.R. Madias N.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1311-F1319PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sabolic I. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1245-F1253PubMed Google Scholar). While the early studies of renal subcellular fractions did not identify the isoform detected functionally, they demonstrated that the endosomal NHE was poorly sensitive to amiloride (4Hilden S.A. Ghoshroy K.R. Madias N.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1311-F1319PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sabolic I. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1245-F1253PubMed Google Scholar). Independent pharmacological studies have revealed that, of the isoforms known to date, NHE3 is the least sensitive to pharmacological antagonists (1Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 43: 419-430PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this is the antiporter present in renal endosomes. This assumption was recently substantiated by immunolocalization studies using antibodies to NHE3, where this isoform was detected not only on the brush border membrane of renal cells, but also in intracellular vesicles (7Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6 (Abstr. 455): 372Google Scholar). Distinct apical and basolateral early endosomes have been described in epithelial cells, but there is mounting controversy as to whether specialized apical and basolateral recycling endosomes exist or whether they are interconnected in a larger endosomal network (8Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 9Knight A. Hughson E. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Wilson J.M. Colton T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This controversy stems, at least in part, from the lack of unique markers for apical endosomes, which have been poorly characterized. This contrasts with the extensive biochemical and morphological knowledge of endosomes in nonpolarized cells, where sorting, recycling, and late endosomes have been studied in detail (for reviews, see Refs. 12Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 13Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). It has become apparent that, like epithelial cells, nonpolarized cells also possess the targeting machinery to segregate apical and basolateral proteins to distinct microdomains within the cell (15Musch A. Xu H. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When endotubulin, a protein found in apical endosomes of intestinal cells, was expressed heterologously in fibroblasts, it was found to distribute to a subpopulation of early endosomes, which are likely analogous to apical endosomes (11Wilson J.M. Colton T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This suggests that nonpolarized cells can be used as a simplified model system to study the targeting of epithelial proteins suspected of entering apical endosomes. The purpose of the present experiments was to define the properties and subcellular targeting of NHE3 using heterologous expression in nonepithelial cells. For comparison, cells were also transfected with NHE1, which is predominantly targeted to the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells (1Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the activity of the heterologously transfected exchangers in isolation, we used cells that were deficient in endogenous NHE activity (for details, see Refs. 17Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain J. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar and 18Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that, unlike NHE1, which is largely plasmalemmal, NHE3 concentrates in an endomembrane compartment. The nature of this compartment and the functionality of NHE3 therein were assessed using confocal microscopy and fluorescence ratio imaging. The acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF-, FITC-, or TRITC-labeled transferrin (Tfn) and FITC-labeled dextran were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab, Cy3-, and FITC-labeled donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Ab were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). FITC-labeled anti-T-cell antigen (CD25) Ab was from Serotec. FITC-labeled goat anti-human F(ab) fragments and mouse monoclonal anti-HA Ab were bought from Cappel (Durham, NC) and BabCo (Berkeley, CA), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal Ab to α-mannosidase II and calnexin were kind gifts from Drs. K. W. Moremen and M. Farquhar (University of California at San Diego) and D. B. Williams (University of Toronto), respectively. α-Minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (1:1) were purchased from the Ontario Cancer Institute Tissue Culture Service (Toronto, Canada). Fetal bovine serum was acquired from Cansera (Toronto, Canada). Complementary DNA fragments of the full-length rat NHE1 and NHE3, previously engineered to contain a series of unique restriction sites (to facilitate mutagenic manipulations), were subcloned into a modified eukaryotic expression vector, pCMV (for construction details, see Ref. 19Orlowski J. Kandasamy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One copy of an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) peptide (YPYDVPDYA) was appended to the carboxycytoplasmic tail of each protein by polymerase chain reaction methodologies (called pNHE1-HA and pNHE3-HA; Fig.1 A). In addition, a NotI-NotI DNA fragment containing three tandem copies of the HA epitope was inserted in the proper reading frame into a NotI site that was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis at the very carboxyl-terminal end of NHE3–3HA, followed by a TGA stop codon (20Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of cellubrevin (Cbv) from RBL cells was accomplished with the use of primers complementary to its 5′ (CGCGGGAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGTCTACAGGGGTGCCT) and 3′ (CGCGGGGGATCCGAGACACACCACACAAT) ends. The primers were designed to isolate the full coding sequence of Cbv and to generate 5′HindII and 3′ BamHI restriction sites in the resulting product. These sites were then used to place the Cbv cDNA in the CD2Bγ1 expression vector (a pCDM8-derived plasmid containing the CH2 and CH3 domains of the human IgG) to create an in-frame fusion of the COOH terminus of Cbv and these two peptides. The resulting chimeric Cbv-Ig cDNA was then transferred to the CD43/hsfi− vector via HindIII and HpaI sites to create a plasmid suitable for generating stable transfectants. Cd43/hsfi− is a pCDM8-derived plasmid that contains CD43 in the polylinker region, confers resistance to hygromycin B, and has an inactivated SV40 origin of replication. The expression plasmid for a chimera of thetrans-Golgi network protein TGN38 fused to the extracellular domain of the T-cell antigen (TGN38-CD25) was a generous gift of Dr. J. S. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). AP-1 cells are CHO cells devoid of endogenous NHE activity. They were generated by chemical mutagenesis followed by selection using the H+ suicide technique (17Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain J. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), as described by Rotin and Grinstein (18Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and NaHCO3. TRVb1 cells, a CHO cell line stably transfected with human Tfn-R, were a generous gift of Dr. T. E. McGraw (Cornell University Medical School, New York, NY). They were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, NaHCO3, and 100 μg/ml G418. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The NHE1-HA and NHE3-HA constructs were transfected into AP-1 cells. Stable transfectants (AP-1NHE3HA and AP-1NHE1HA) were selected by subjecting the cells to an acid challenge, as described by Pouyssegur et al. (17Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain J. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Clonal lines were acid-challenged on a monthly basis to eliminate revertants and maintain stable functional expression of the exchanger. pCbv-Ig was co-transfected into AP-1 and AP-1NHE3HA cells with the plasmid pcDNA3, which confers resistance to G418. The TGN38-CD25 construct was also co-transfected with pcDNA3 into AP-1NHE3HA cells. Clonal lines (AP-1Cbv-Ig, AP-1NHE3HA/Cbv-Ig, and AP-1NHE3HA/TGN38) were selected in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418. pNHE3HA was co-transfected into TRVb1 cells with the plasmid pMSCVhph, which contains a gene that confers resistance to hygromycin. To obtain stable expression of both TRVb1 and NHE3HA, cells were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml hygromycin and by acid challenge. Because TRVb1 cells probably express endogenous NHE1, the acid challenge was performed in the presence of 1 μm HOE 693, a benzoyl guanidinium compound that at the concentration used selectively inhibits NHE1 but not NHE3 (1Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Soleimani M. Singh G. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 419-430PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were isolated from stably transfected cells grown to 80–90% confluence on 10-cm dishes as described previously (22Garcia-Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Samples containing about 25 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7.5% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Blots were blocked with 0.2% gelatin and exposed to the primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA Ab; 1:10,000 dilution). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary Ab was applied (1:5000 dilution), and immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For fluorescence microscopy, cells expressing the constructs of interest were plated on 18-mm coverslips 48 h prior to immunostaining. To examine the subcellular localization of HA-tagged proteins, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, placed in 100 mmglycine in PBS for 15 min to scavenge any residual fixative, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. The cells were next incubated in PBS with 5% donkey serum for 20 min. Fixation, permeabilization, and subsequent incubations were at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were then incubated for 1 h with the indicated primary Ab diluted in PBS with 5% donkey serum at the following dilutions: HA, 1:1000; mannosidase II, 1:500; calnexin, 1:200. Next, the cells were washed with PBS three times over 15 min and incubated for 1 h with either Cy3-labeled anti-mouse Ab, FITC-labeled anti-rabbit Ab, or both. Finally, cells were mounted with DAKO mounting medium. To compare the distribution of NHE3HA and TGN38, AP-1NHE3HA/TGN38 cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with the anti-HA Ab followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab, as described above. Finally, the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD25 Ab, washed, and mounted. To label lysosomes, AP-1NHE3HA cells were incubated with 30 mg/ml fixable FITC-conjugated dextran for 12 h at 37 °C. The dextran was then chased over a 4-h period. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 h and then permeabilized and stained for HA as described above. For Tfn-R localization experiments, cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and then incubated at 37 °C with the same medium containing 20 μg/ml of either FITC- or TRITC-labeled Tfn for 30 min. The cells were then washed, chased for 15–60 min, fixed, and permeabilized as above. To determine the distribution of Cbv, AP-1NHE3/Cbv-Ig cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C with the same medium containing 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG for 30 min. Cells were next washed and incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C and then fixed and permeabilized as above. The distribution of Cbv was also examined by first fixing and permeabilizing the cells and then labeling with the FITC-conjugated Ab. Comparable results were obtained with both methods. Images were acquired using a Leica laser-confocal microscope with a × 100 plan-apochromat lens (1.4 N.A.). Digitized images were processed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and assembled and labeled in PowerPoint (Microsoft, Seattle, WA). To determine endosomal pH (pHE), cells plated on a 25-mm glass coverslip (Fisher) 48 h prior to use were incubated with the FITC-conjugated F(ab) fragment of goat anti-human Ab or with FITC-labeled Tfn as described above. The coverslip was then placed in a Leiden CoverSlip Dish (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) in a temperature-regulated perfusion chamber (Open Perfusion Micro-Incubator; Medical Systems Corp.) on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135; Zeiss Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a × 63 oil immersion objective and epifluorescence optics. An electronically controlled shutter and filter-wheel (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA) was used to alternately position two excitation filters (490BP10 and 440BP10 nm) in front of a xenon lamp. The fluorescent signals were processed through a 535BP25 nm band-pass filter. The digitized images were captured on a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Princeton, NJ). Data were recorded every 60–120 s by irradiating the cells for 1 s at each wavelength. At the end of each experiment, calibration was obtained by equilibrating the cells in isotonic K+-rich medium buffered to varying pH values between 7.6 and 5.0 in the presence of the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin (5 μm), as described by Garcia-Cabado et al.(22Garcia-Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Metafluor Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp.) was used to control image acquisition, calculate the ratio of the dual excitation images, construct ratio/pH calibration curves, and determine the actual pH. pHc was determined as described previously. Briefly, cells plated on coverslips were loaded with a 2 μg/ml concentration of the acetoxymethyl ester precursor of BCECF at 37 °C for 10 min, washed, and placed in Leiden CoverSlip holders as above. pHc was determined in a fashion identical to that described for endosomes with the exception that a much shorter excitation period (75 ms) and neutral density filters were used to minimize photolysis of the dye and the attendant cytotoxicity. NHE activity was assessed as the rate of Na+-induced recovery of pHcfollowing an acid load imposed by preloading with NH4Cl (for details, see Ref. 22Garcia-Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Where specified, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free medium supplemented with colchicine (25 μm, 45 min), brefeldin A (5 μg/ml, 60 min), wortmannin (10 nm, 45 min), or forskolin (10 μm, 10 min) prior to loading with BCECF or before being fixed and permeabilized to examine the effects of these drugs on the subcellular distribution of NHE3. To facilitate the detection of NHE3 in heterologous expression systems, an immunogenic epitope derived from the influenza virus HA was attached to the carboxyl terminus of the protein, yielding NHE3-HA. The site of attachment was chosen because truncation analyses showed earlier that this region of the antiporter is not essential for NHE3 function (22Garcia-Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To increase the availability and immunogenicity of the protein, a construct was also made expressing three tandem HA repeats (NHE-3HA). For comparison, the ubiquitous NHE1 isoform was tagged with a single HA epitope (NHE1-HA). Schematic representations of these constructs are shown in Fig. 1 A. Such constructs were stably transfected into an antiport-deficient CHO cell line, termed AP-1, and the expression and intactness of the protein were assessed by immunoblotting with anti-HA Ab. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1 B. Immunoreactive bands of the predicted molecular mass (∼100 kDa for NHE1-HA; ∼85 and 88 kDa for NHE3-HA and NHE3–3HA, respectively) were readily detectable in whole-cell extracts. Cells transfected with untagged NHE1 or NHE3 failed to react with the Ab, implying that the immunoreactivity is specific to the HA epitope. The functional activity of the transfected epitope-tagged constructs was assessed fluorimetrically in BCECF-loaded cells (Fig.2). Antiport activity was induced by the addition of Na+ to cells that had been previously acid-loaded by an ammonium prepulse (22Garcia-Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, NHE1-HA cells responded to the addition of Na+ with a vigorous alkalization that restored normal pHc within 1–2 min. Like wild-type NHE1, the epitope-tagged protein was exquisitely sensitive to 1 μmHOE 693, which reduced the rate of H+ extrusion to levels comparable with that observed in the absence of Na+(cf. open circles in Fig. 2, A and B). The epitope-tagged NHE3-HA was similarly functional, inducing a conspicuous alkalization upon the addition of Na+. The rate of H+ extrusion was noticeably lower in the NHE3-HA transfectants than in the NHE1-HA counterparts, despite the presence of comparable amounts of protein (e.g. Fig. 1). This may reflect differences in the intrinsic activity of the exchangers, but it may also be a consequence of differential subcellular localization (see below). Unlike NHE1, NHE3 is virtually insensitive to micromolar doses of HOE 693 (1Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Soleimani M. Singh G. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 419-430PubMed Google Scholar) but maintains strict Na+ dependence. This pharmacological profile was preserved in the epitope-tagged constructs (Fig. 2 C). Other physiological properties were also maintained in NHE3-HA. Specifically, the inhibitory effect of cAMP, induced by the addition of forskolin, was clearly apparent in the HA-tagged antiporter (Fig. 2 D). Similar results were obtained with the triple HA-tagged NHE3, while no inhibition was observed in forskolin-treated NHE1-HA transfectants (not shown). Jointly, these observations indicate that when expressed in a heterologous system, the epitope-tagged forms of NHE1 and NHE3 retain their functional and pharmacological properties. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to define the subcellular distribution of NHE1 and NHE3 in AP-1 cells. As described earlier for the unmodified form of NHE1, the epitope-tagged protein was found predominantly at the surface membrane (Fig.3 A). Transverse (x versus z) reconstructions confirmed the superficial staining and additionally showed some accumulation at or near lamellipodia, consistent with an earlier report (23Grinstein S. Woodside M. Waddell T.K. Downey G.P. Orlowski J. Pouyssegur J. Wong D.C. Foskett J.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5209-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and with the notion that epithelial basolateral proteins expressed in nonepithelial cells concentrate in lamellipodia (24Peranen J. Auvinen P. Virta H. Wepf R. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Only a small fraction of NHE1-HA appeared to be intracellular, possibly reflecting immature protein that can occasionally be detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a lower molecular weight, nonglycosylated species. By contrast, NHE3-HA appeared to be largely intracellular, with only a fraction present at or near the surface membrane (Fig. 3, Cand D). The distribution of NHE3-HA was punctate, with noticeable accumulation in a juxtanuclear location. Identical results were obtained using the triple-tagged form of NHE3, NHE3–3HA (not illustrated). The differential localization of the two isoforms can be attributed neither to the epitope tag nor to varying levels of expression, which are similar for NHE1 and NHE3 (see Fig. 1). To define the site(s) where NHE3-HA accumulates in AP-1 cells, we undertook double-labeling studies using recognized organellar markers. Overexpression of proteins driven by constitutive promoters can lead to defective processing and trapping in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, staining of the reticulum with calnexin showed a diffuse pattern that is distinctly different from that of NHE3-HA (not shown). Instead, the juxtanuclear accumulation observed resembles that reported for the Golgi complex, perinuclear lysosomes, and, in some cells, recycling endosomes. These possibilities were examined, and representative data are presented in Figs.4 and 5. The site of accumulation of NHE3-HA was very near the location of α-mannosidase II, a marker of medial and trans-Golgi cisternae (25Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A versus D). However, the location and morphology of the Golgi cisternae are d"

Information on the sizes and nature of these products is essential for understanding the proteasome's degradative mechanism, the subsequent steps in protein turnover, and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. Using proteasomes from Thermoplasma acidophilum and four unfolded polypeptides as substrates (insulin-like growth factor, lactalbumin, casein, and alkaline phosphatase, whose lengths range from 71 to 471 residues), we demonstrate that the number of cuts made in a polypeptide and the time needed to degrade it increase with length.

The 20 S proteasome is a 700-kDa proteolytic complex that is present in all eukaryotic cells, archaea, and certain bacteria (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

The 20 S particle is a barrel-shaped structure composed of four stacked rings. Each outer ring contains seven related α-subunits, and each of the inner rings seven related β-subunits, which catalyze peptide bond cleavage. The active sites are located within the central chamber of the 20 S particle, into which protein substrates must enter through a narrow openings in the α- and β-rings. Proteasomes cleave peptide bonds by a novel catalytic mechanism, in which the hydroxyl group of the threonine on the N terminus of the β-subunit serves as the active site nucleophile (8Lowe J.

Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the 20 S proteasome degrades proteins by a highly processive mechanism to oligopeptides (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A typical protease makes a single cleavage in a polypeptide substrate and then releases the fragments, which may be cleaved to smaller products in subsequent enzymatic rounds. In contrast, the proteasome appears to make many cleavages in the polypeptide and to digest it to small products without dissociation of the partially degraded substrates. This novel mode of degradation appears highly important for an intracellular proteolytic system, since the release of large protein fragments could interfere with cell function and regulation. However, definitive proof of this mode of degradation requires knowledge of the number of cleavages made in a protein substrate and the sizes of peptides generated. If the proteasome makes repeated cuts processively along the length of the polypeptide, one would predict that the enzyme should make a greater number of cleavages and take more time to digest longer polypeptides than shorter substrates. One goal of the present study was to test these predictions. Knowledge about the size distribution of peptides produced by the proteasome is important for understanding the subsequent steps in the protein degradative pathway and the process of MHC class I antigen presentation. In vivo, most of the peptides generated by the proteasome must be rapidly hydrolyzed to amino acids, which are utilized in synthesis of new proteins or in intermediary metabolism. In mammalian cells, some of these peptides are utilized in antigen presentation, possibly after further proteolytic processing to the final 8–9-residue peptides presented on the cell surface (13Goldberg A.L. Gaczynska M. Grant E. Michalek M. Rock K.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These latter steps are poorly understood, in part because of a lack of precise information on the sizes of the peptides released by the proteasome during protein breakdown. It is widely believed that the proteasome degrades polypeptides according to a “molecular ruler” to yield products of rather uniform size (8Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since the distance between adjacent active sites corresponded to an octapeptide in an extended conformation (8Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

However, evidence for such a molecular ruler is quite limited. In the study by Wenzelet al. (16Wenzel T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W.

The present studies were undertaken to determine the mean size of peptides generated from full-length proteins, to measure the relative amounts of peptides of different sizes, and thus to critically test the molecular ruler model. Most prior studies have focused on peptides ranging from 4 to 44 residues in length, which may be degraded differently from proteins. In contrast, in this study, we have investigated the digestion of proteins of different sizes ranging in length from 70 to 471 residues. We have introduced several new approaches to evaluate the mean number of cuts made in each protein substrate, the mean sizes of the peptides generated by proteasome, and the relative amounts of products of different lengths. Since only unfolded molecules can enter the 20 S particle and be degraded (24Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the present studies utilized denatured polypeptides. Conditions were chosen where the protein substrate was present in large excess, such that the released peptides were not digested further. We have employed 20 S proteasomes from the archaeaThermoplasma acidophilum, because this particle is structurally simpler than the eukaryotic 20 S proteasome. It contains seven identical α- and β-subunits, and thus seven identical active sites, located at equal distances from each other (8Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar), unlike the eukaryotic particle which contains seven different α-subunits and seven different β-subunits, and has three active sites with different specificities (12Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Therefore, the factors determining product size and rate of proteolysis should be easier to elucidate and the data easier to interpret with archaeal particle. The Thermoplasma proteasome was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IGF was a kind gift of Dr. W. Prouty (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), bovine α-lactalbumin and β-casein, alkaline phosphatase from E. coli, Leu-enkephalin amide, substance P, and oxidized A- and B-chains of bovine insulin were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic peptides SIINFEKL, YPHPARIGL, TYQRTRALV, and YSDEDMQTM were kindly provided by Dr. K. Rock (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). All other peptides were from Bachem AG (Switzerland). For use as substrates, IGF and lactalbumin were unfolded by reduction of disulfide bonds and carboxymethylation as described previously (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The IGF, lactalbumin, and casein were exhaustively, reductively methylated (10Akopian T.N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to prevent the extent of the reaction of the undegraded molecule with fluorescamine, and the modified polypeptide purified by HPLC prior to use. To denature alkaline phosphatase, it was oxidized with performic acid (25Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 197-198Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The concentrations of modified IGF, lactalbumin, and casein were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm. Calculations of the extinction coefficient for each protein were based on the contents of Tyr and Trp residues in each molecule (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The concentration of alkaline phosphatase was measured by the Lowry method, because Tyr and Trp are destroyed or modified during performic acid treatment. The protein substrates were incubated with proteasomes at 54 °C in 50 mm Bis-tris propane buffer, pH 7.5. Substrates incubated without proteasomes and proteasomes incubated without substrate served as controls. At different times, aliquots were taken from the reaction mixtures and mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. The concentration of the newly formed amino groups was measured by reaction with fluorescamine at pH 6.8 as described previously (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Another aliquot was run on the C18 HPLC column (Vydac peptide and protein, 0.46 × 25 cm, 10 μm) to separate products from the undegraded protein substrate. The column was equilibrated with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. A stepwise increase in buffer B concentration to 40–50% (depending on the substrate) was used in the region where peptide products were eluted, followed by isocratic elution for 2 min, and a gradient of 10% buffer B/min for 2 min was used in the region where the undegraded protein was eluted. Such a gradient allowed us to decrease the time required for analysis and the volume of pooled peptides. In some experiments (Table II and Fig. 6), the pooled peptides were collected for further analysis. (Precipitation with trichloracetic acid could not be used here because a significant fraction of peptides was found to precipitate together with the undegraded substrate.) The amount of undegraded protein was measured by integration of its HPLC UV absorbance peak at three different wavelengths (214, 230, and 280 nm).Table IIMean size of peptides generated by the proteasomeSubstrateMean sizeTwo rates methodAcid hydrolysis methodSize-exclusion chromatographyAlkaline phosphatase6.5 ± 0.59.3 ± 1.010.2Casein10.6 ± 2.19.0 ± 1.311.2Lactalbumin8.1 ± 0.57.7 ± 1.49.1IGF5.9 ± 0.86.7 ± 0.37.0 Average7.8 ± 1.88.2 ± 1.09.4 Open table in a new tab To obtain kinetic constants, the concentrations of amino groups and the area of the substrate peaks were plotted against the incubation time. The rates of substrate disappearance and of product accumulation were then determined from the slopes of these plots, which were linear under conditions used here. Less than half of the initial amount of the substrate was degraded at the end of incubation. To ensure this linearity, the initial substrate concentrations were at least 2-fold greater than the concentrations at which V maxwas reached (500 μm for IGF, 90 μm for lactalbumin, 25 μm for casein, and 12 μmfor alkaline phosphatase). The number of cuts in a polypeptide was calculated by dividing the rate of product accumulation by the rate of substrate consumption. The mean length of the products (in residues) was obtained by dividing the length of the protein by the number of cuts plus one. The substrates were incubated with proteasomes until 30–50% was degraded. The products were separated from the undegraded substrate by HPLC on the C18column, pooled, lyophilized, and redissolved in water. Free amino groups in the pool (i.e. the amount of peptides) were measured by the reaction with fluorescamine in 0.2 mphosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These peptides were then hydrolyzed completely to amino acids with 6 m HCl in sealed ampoules for 24 h at 108 °C, and the amount of amino acids after hydrolysis was measured by the fluorescamine assay in 0.2 mborate buffer (pH 8.6). A standard mixture of amino acids, treated in the same fashion as the samples, was used for calibration of the amino acid assay. Then, the mean size was determined by dividing the molar amount of amino acids found after acid treatment by the molar amount of peptides before the treatment. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on polyhydroxyethyl aspartamide column (0.46 × 20 cm, Poly LC, Columbia, MD), using a HP1090 chromatographer (Hewlett-Packard). The mobile phase was 0.2 m sodium sulfate, 25% acetonitrile, pH 3.0 (adjusted with phosphoric acid), and the flow rate was 0.125 ml/min. To determine the apparent molecular mass of the peptides eluted, the column was calibrated each time before use with 8–10 standard peptides in the 550–3500-Da range. The pool of proteasome's products (the same as in acid hydrolysis method) containing 5–10 nmol of peptides was dissolved in 50 μl of the mobile phase and loaded onto the column. Fractions (0.5 min) were collected, and the molar amount of peptides in each fraction was measured with the fluorescamine assay as described above. The corresponding fraction of the control mixture, in which the substrate was incubated without proteasome, was also run on the size-exclusion column. No fluorescamine-reactive material was found in the fractions of this run. To ensure rapid hydrolysis and to eliminate possible complications due to substrate folding, three substrates (alkaline phosphatase, IGF, and lactalbumin) were denatured prior to study, as described above. The other substrate studied, casein, had little or no tertiary structure and did not require denaturation to be degraded rapidly by the proteasome. To determine the number of cuts made by the proteasome in these different polypeptides, we measured the rate of disappearance of substrate molecules and the rate of appearance of the new amino groups during the same incubation. Denatured IGF, lactalbumin, casein, and alkaline phosphatase were incubated at 53 °C and pH 7.5 with highly purified recombinant Thermoplasma proteasomes. Initial substrate concentrations were high enough to ensure a constant rate of degradation during the entire incubation period. At different times, aliquots were removed, and one portion was analyzed by HPLC to determine the amount of substrate consumed (by measuring the amount of undegraded substrate by integration of its peak area), another portion was used to determine the amount of peptides produced by assaying them as the number of new primary amino groups generated that react with fluorescamine. As found previously (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the rates of accumulation of peptide products and of the disappearance of the substrates paralleled each other. The ratio of the amount of new products generated to the amount of protein molecules degraded did not change with time, indicating a processive mechanism. Moreover, the products once released by the proteasome did not get cleaved again at later times under these incubation conditions, where there was a large molar excess of the substrate. If the proteasome makes n cuts in a protein molecule and the products generated do not undergo further cleavages, there should always be n-fold more new amino groups than substrate molecules consumed. Therefore, the number of cuts made per protein can be determined by dividing the rate of peptide product accumulation by the rate of substrate disappearance (Fig.1). This value increased with the length of the substrate, ranging from 11 cuts in IGF, which is 70-residues long, to 71 cuts in alkaline phosphatase, which contains 471 residues (Table I). The demonstration that a large number of cuts are made in a single substrate molecule, together with the previous finding that the proteasome does not release the substrate until all these cuts are made (10Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), is clear evidence of a highly processive mechanism for protein degradation (Fig.2).Table IKinetic parameters of protein degradation by the proteasomeSubstrateNo. of residuesProtein molecules degraded/minPeptide bonds cut/minCuts/ moleculeAlkaline phosphatase4710.221671Casein2091.11919Lactalbumin1233.24514IGF705.66111 Open table in a new tab Figure 2The number of cuts made by the 20 S proteasome in a protein depends on its length. The number of cuts was determined by the two rates method (open circles) and by the acid hydrolysis method (closed rectangles) (Fig. 1). The proteins are: 1, IGF; 2, lactalbumin;3, casein; and 4, alkaline phosphatase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This highly processive mechanism suggests that the proteasome should require more time to degrade a longer polypeptide than a short one, provided that it moves along the substrate at a relatively constant rate. These measurements of the rate of disappearance of the different substrates (Table I) allowed us also to determine the time needed to degrade a substrate molecule, because these experiments were performed atV max. The number of protein molecules degraded per min by a 20 S particle was calculated by dividing the rate of substrate disappearance by the molar concentration of the proteasome (Table I). The reciprocal therefore represents the time that the proteasome takes to degrade one substrate molecule, assuming it degrades only one substrate molecule at a time. The time required to degrade each of these polypeptides was a characteristic feature of the substrate. As shown in Fig.3, the time for degradation by the proteasome depended on the polypeptide's length. At 53 °C, the enzyme required 10 s to digest one IGF molecule (70 residues, 11 cuts) and 50 s to degrade one casein molecule (209 residues, about 20 cuts). When casein was modified by fluorescein isothiocyanate, the proteasome still took approximately 1 min to degrade it. Thus, with smaller polypeptides, there was almost a linear relationship between substrate length and duration of the degradative process. In contrast, almost 5 min were required to digest alkaline phosphatase (471 residues, 71 cuts). The disproportionately long time required for degradation of alkaline phosphatase suggests that there are additional rate-limiting steps in the digestive process aside from peptide bond cleavage, such as the unfolding of residual secondary structure or disassembly of substrate aggregates, which may slow substrate entry into the central chamber. However, this preparation of alkaline phosphatase appeared to contain another conformational form, which had a lower affinity for the proteasome but was degraded severalfold faster. It was impossible to measure the time required for degradation of this form because it was insoluble at high concentrations. Therefore, all measurements were done on the slowly degraded form of alkaline phosphatase, which remained soluble atV max. To study additional unfolded proteins as substrates with lengths between casein and alkaline phosphatase we tried to study rhodanese, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-subunit of tryptophan synthase. However, at 53 °C (whereThermoplasma enzymes are quite active), these polypeptides were insoluble. Another polypeptide tested (ovalbumin) remained soluble, but was a poor substrate in vitro even after denaturation. The finding that the number of cuts made in a polypeptide is proportional to its length implies that the length of the peptides generated by the proteasome is similar for the different proteins. We have developed two simple methods to determine the mean size of these peptide products. In the first, which we term the two rates method, the mean size of the products was calculated by dividing the number of amino acids in the protein by the number of bonds cut plus one (Fig. 1). For example, if a protein containing 100 amino acid residues is cut at 9 sites to yield 10 pieces, their average length is 10 residues. The mean size of products found by this approach was similar with the four different substrates. The values obtained ranged from 6 for IGF to 11 for casein with an average length of 8 for the four proteins (TableII). These differences, although small, in the mean sizes of peptides generated from different proteins were found reproducibly (Table II). The standard errors on these values in Table II represent the range of the mean sizes obtained in independent experiments, rather than the variation in length about the mean (see below). To obtain an independent measure of the mean sizes of these peptide products, another approach was developed, which we call the acid hydrolysis method. The peptides generated by the proteasomes were separated from the undigested substrate by HPLC on a reverse-phase column. The amount of peptides produced was measured with fluorescamine, they were then hydrolyzed completely to amino acids by acid treatment, and the amount of amino acids was measured with fluorescamine.

This report describes a noninvasive strategy to measure the luminal pH of the TGN in intact cells. We took advantage of endogenous cellular mechanisms for the specific retrieval of TGN resident proteins, such as TGN38 and furin, that transit briefly to the plasma membrane.

The acidic pH of the TGN reflects active H+ pumping into an organelle with a low intrinsic H+ permeability and a high conductance to monovalent ions. The pH prevailing in the lumen of endomembrane compartments is an important determinant of their function. The concentration of H+ dictates the dissociation and degradation of internalized ligands (1Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modulates the processing, transport, and sorting of secreted proteins (2Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A.

J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Delivery of pH-sensitive probes by pinocytosis or receptor-mediated internalization has facilitated the study of the pH along the endocytic pathway, revealing that the acidity of the lumen increases progressively, from a pH of 6.5 to 6.0 in early and recycling endosomes to 4.5 in lysosomes (5Maxfield F.R. Yamashiro D.J. Intracellular Trafficking of Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1991: 157-182Google Scholar). Conversely, the pH inside subcompartments of the secretory pathways is thought to be highest in the endoplasmic reticulum, becoming more acidic as the secretory products approach the plasma membrane. Secretory granules can attain a pH as low as ≈5.5 (6Anderson R.G. Pathak R.K. Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). While the acidification is generally believed to be generated by vacuolar-type (V) 1The abbreviations used are: V, vacuolar-type; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TGN,trans-Golgi network; TMA, trimethylamine.1The abbreviations used are: V, vacuolar-type; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TGN,trans-Golgi network; TMA, trimethylamine. ATPases, the mechanisms underlying the differential pH of the individual compartments of the secretory pathway are poorly understood. This is due largely to the scarcity of appropriate methods for the determination of pH in the lumen of defined secretory compartmentsin situ. Initial studies used permeant weak bases that partition preferentially in acidic organelles, where they can be fixed and detected by immunogold (6Anderson R.G. Pathak R.K. Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Orci L. Ravazzola M. Anderson R.G. Nature. 1987; 326: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This technique, however, is unable to provide dynamic measurements in living cells, necessary to assess the mechanisms of pH regulation. More recently, a second method was introduced that allows continuous measurement of pH in the secretory pathway. This procedure is based on the microinjection of size-fractionated liposomes (70 nm) that appear to fuse preferentially with the trans-Golgi cisternae (8Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4967-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15542-15548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The usefulness of this method is restricted not only by its technical complexity, but also by the fact that the pH-sensitive fluorophores delivered via liposome fusion are not retained in the trans-Golgi apparatus under physiological conditions, tending to move rapidly along the secretory pathway (8Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4967-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A third approach has been described recently, which exploits the binding and retrograde transport of bacterial toxins to target probes to secretory organelles (10Kim J.H. Khine A.A. Lingwood C.A. Furuya W.F. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Verotoxin was shown to accumulate and remain in the Golgi complex at physiological temperatures for a sufficient amount of time to permit adequate study of the luminal pH. Nevertheless, the precise subcompartment of the Golgi apparatus targeted by the toxin remains undefined and it cannot be ruled out that verotoxin itself may influence pH homeostasis, even though its cytotoxic A subunit was omitted from the complex. Within the secretory pathway, pH regulation is likely to be most important in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where sorting of secretory cargo to different cellular destinations occurs. pH-dependent retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum components has also been shown to occur in the TGN (11Miesenböck G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite its importance, the regulation of the pH in the lumen of the TGN has not been studied, due to the lack of available methods to deliver to this compartment pH-sensitive reporter molecules that are specifically targeted, well retained, and emit a continuous and quantitative signal. The purpose of the experiments described here was to develop a strategy to measure the luminal pH of the TGN in intact, living cells by noninvasive means and to explore the determinants of acidification. We took advantage of endogenous cellular mechanisms for the specific retrieval of TGN resident proteins, such as TGN38 and furin, that transit briefly to the plasma membrane (see Fig. 1 for schematic representation of the strategy). At steady state, over 90% of these proteins is found in the TGN by virtue of a combination of retention and retrieval mechanisms (12Bos K. Wright C. Stanley K.K.

We reasoned that TGN proteins sojourning at the cell surface could be used to ferry fluorescent, pH-sensitive indicators back to the TGN, where they would accumulate in sufficient numbers to provide a reliable signal that could be detected by ratio imaging. This approach enabled us to analyze in some detail the mechanisms underlying the homeostasis of pH within the TGN.

Images were acquired on a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal microscope, using a 63× objective and fluorescein or rhodamine filter combinations. Digital images were assembled and labeled using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.) and Microsoft PowerPoint software. To stain the TGN, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml BODIPY-ceramide for 20 min at 37 °C, washed, chased in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 37 °C, and immediately visualized using a Leica DM-IRB microscope equipped with a Micromax cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ), operated from a Dell computer using Winview software (Princeton Instruments). Recycling endosomes were visualized using the same system, after allowing internalization of Texas Red-labeled transferrin (20 μg/ml) for 30–45 min at 37 °C. Ratio fluorescence imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using a NeoFluar 63×/1.25 numerical aperture objective, as described previously (19Demaurex N. Waddell T. Downey G.P. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fluorescence image pairs at 490 and 440 nm excitation were captured at 120-s intervals using 300-ms exposure and 4 × 4 pixel binning to increase sensitivity. The 490 and 440 nm fluorescence images were corrected for shading to compensate for uneven illumination, the background was subtracted, and a threshold of 5 times the value of the background noise (root mean square) was applied before obtaining a pixel-by-pixel ratio of the two images. Subthreshold pixels were neither displayed nor used for subsequent analysis, to prevent artifacts caused by ratioing near-zero values. The resulting ratio images were displayed on-line, and regions of interest encompassing the TGN structures were defined. The averaged ratio values of the regions of interest were calculated and plotted to follow the kinetics of the pH changes throughout an experimental period. Two independent methods of calibration were used. At the end of each experiment, a calibration curve of fluorescence ratio versus pH was obtained in situby sequential perfusion with KCl-rich medium containing 5 μg/ml nigericin plus 5 μm monensin, buffered at four different pH values, according to Thomas et al. (20Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1982; 18: 2210-2218Crossref Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). This calibration procedure was validated by the null point method (21Eisner D.A. Kenning N.A. O'Neill S.C. Pocock G. Valdeolmillos M. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using solutions containing varying ratios of butyric acid and trimethylamine (TMA), plus 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The concentrations of butyric acid and TMA (in mm) and the calculated null pH were: 40/40 (pH = 6.3), 73/7.3 (pH = 5.8), and 80/0.8 (pH 5.3). Quantification of cell-associated fluorescence was performed using the Metamorph/Metafluor package (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Data were graphed using the Origin software (MicroCal Software Inc., Northampton, MA) and are shown as means ± 1 S.E. As described in the Introduction, the retrograde transport of TGN-resident proteins was harnessed to target fluorescent, pH-sensitive probes to the lumen of the TGN (Fig.1). The probe of choice was fluorescein, which has a high quantum yield and a pK a of ≈6.5, providing optimal sensitivity in the mildly acidic pH range expected for secretory organelles. Our strategy involved binding of fluoresceinated antibodies to the extracellular (luminal) domain of TGN-localized proteins during their transient exposure at the surface membrane. To facilitate delivery of fluoresceinated antibodies to the TGN, we generated chimeric proteins that retain the transmembrane and cytosolic regions of TGN38 or furin, including the determinants of TGN targeting, but replaced the extracellular domain by that of CD25, the α-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (Fig. 1 A). This protein was chosen because of the availability of highly specific, fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies. Such chimeric proteins had been shown earlier to accumulate in the TGN and recycle via the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B) in a manner similar to the endogenous TGN-resident proteins (13Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 15Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deigman E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L.C. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Rajasekaran A.K. Humphrey J.S. Wagner M. Miesenböck G. Le Bivic A. Bonifacino J.S. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Voorhees P. Deignan E. Humphrey J. Marks M.S. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4961-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We therefore anticipated that incubation of live cells expressing the chimeras with anti-CD25 antibodies would result in gradual accumulation of the pH-sensitive moiety, fluorescein, in the TGN (Fig. 1 B). Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected stably with the CD25-TGN38 construct and incubated overnight with the fluorescein-conjugated anti-CD25 antibody at 37 °C. The localization of the internalized antibody was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.2, B, D, andF, the anti-CD25 antibodies accumulated in a juxtanuclear structure, with a minor fraction distributing more peripherally in small vesicular structures. Dual labeling indicated that the site of accumulation of the chimeric proteins is not the endoplasmic reticulum, identified using anti-calnexin antibodies (not illustrated). The juxtanuclear structures containing the CD25 antibody were in the vicinity of, but distinct from recycling endosomes, labeled by a 30–45-min incubation with Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Fig. 2,A and B). Similarly, the CD25-TGN38 chimera was found to localize in a compartment that was closely apposed, but distinguishable from the medial Golgi cisternae, revealed by anti-α-mannosidase II antibodies (cf. Fig. 2, Cand D). Instead, the chimeric protein was found to co-localize precisely with a fluorescent ceramide derivative (Fig. 2,E and F), known to accumulate in the TGN (22Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). That the chimera is located in the TGN and not the Golgi cisternae is also suggested by experiments using brefeldin A. This fungal metabolite is known to promote retrograde fusion of the cisternae with the endoplasmic reticulum, while inducing the collapse of the TGN into a tight tubulovesicular complex (23Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 24Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 H, the fluorescence of the anti-CD25 antibody did not disperse to a reticular pattern but instead coalesced into a juxtanuclear complex, as did the ceramide derivative (Fig. 2 G). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the CD25 antibody is concentrated in the TGN, validating the use of retrograde transport to deliver pH-sensitive probes to this organelle. Fig.3 A demonstrates that the fluorescence of the internalized antibody is sensitive to the surrounding pH. The pH of the lumen was manipulated by addition of the cation/H+ exchange ionophores nigericin and monensin, while bathing the cells in K+-rich media of varying pH. Fluorescence images were captured sequentially with excitation at 490 and 440 nm under each condition, and individual TGN structures were outlined on the ratio image. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, the 490/440 nm fluorescence ratio varies markedly with pH in the range of 5.5 to 7.5. The behavior of the dye in situ was indistinguishable from that observed in vitro (not shown), implying that its fluorescence properties were not affected by the microenvironment of the TGN. If one assumes that in the presence of the ionophores the pH of the TGN becomes identical to that of the extracellular medium (20Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1982; 18: 2210-2218Crossref Scopus (1765) Google Scholar), this approach can be used to provide an absolute calibration of the pH of the TGN in the steady state (Fig.3 B). In 110 cells, the resting pH of the TGN was estimated to be 5.95 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E.; range, ≈5.7–6.4) using the ionophore calibration procedure. Calibration using exchange ionophores rests on the assumption that the monovalent cation activity inside the TGN is comparable to that in the surrounding medium and that the amounts of cations transported during the transitions between pH values affect their concentration negligibly. Departures from these assumptions would produce systematic errors in the calibration, as has been recently shown to occur in measurements of the cytosolic pH (25Boyarsky G. Hanssen C. Clyne L.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the ionic composition of the TGN has not been well defined, we implemented a second calibration procedure, which is independent of the transport of Na+ and K+. This approach uses varying ratios of weak acids and bases to search for a null point where the rates of protonation/deprotonation of the permeant species of the weak electrolytes are identical. For a given combination of acid and base, the null point is strictly a function of the luminal pH of the compartment under investigation (21Eisner D.A. Kenning N.A. O'Neill S.C. Pocock G. Valdeolmillos M. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cells were therefore sequentially perfused with solutions containing varying concentrations of butyrate and TMA, while keeping the osmolarity and the extracellular pH constant (see “Experimental Procedures”). The ratio of fluorescence in the TGN was measured throughout, to detect the null point pH (Fig. 3 B). Acid/base combinations expected to equilibrate at pH of 5.3 and 6.3 induced departures of the ratio in the acidic and alkaline direction, respectively, suggesting that the TGN has an intermediate pH. Accordingly, exposure to a solution with predicted equilibrium at pH of 5.8 had virtually no effect on the fluorescence ratio and thus approximated the null point (Fig.3 B). This value corresponded well to the value obtained by subsequent calibration of the same cells with nigericin/monensin (Fig.3 B). A good correspondence between the two methods was obtained in three separate experiments, thus validating the calibration with ionophores. It was important to ascertain that the results obtained with stably transfected CHO cells were not unique to the clone selected or to the chimeric construct used to target the TGN. To obtain independent measurements of the pH of the TGN, we therefore used a second cell line and compared two different constructs. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either the CD25-TGN38 chimera or with an analogous CD25-furin construct, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Typical results are shown in Fig. 4. The distribution of the chimeras within the cells was more heterogeneous in the transient transfectants than in the stable CHO clones. In addition to juxtanuclear accumulation close to the Golgi cisternae (cf. Fig. 4, A and B), cells showing the highest level of expression displayed also more disperse punctate fluorescence throughout the cell. Delocalization associated with overexpression of TGN resident proteins had been reported earlier (13Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,26Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and likely reflects saturation of the receptors that target the chimeras to the TGN. Despite the occurrence of occasional delocalization, the pH of the juxtanuclear fluorophore could be studied in isolation either by studying preferentially cells with moderate levels of expression, where targeting was specific, and/or by defining “regions of interest” within the cell that encompassed only the site of pericentriolar fluorescence, using the Metafluor software. As in the case of CHO cells, the TGN of HeLa cells was acidic and was dissipated by addition of weak bases (Fig. 4 C). In 38 determinations, the pH of the TGN in HeLa cells averaged 5.91 ± 0.05. Results obtained using the TGN38 and furin chimeras were indistinguishable. In other compartments of the secretory pathway, luminal acidification is due primarily to H+ pumping by ATPases (3Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism appears to be at work in the TGN. As shown in Figs.3 C and 4 D, the steady state acidification of the TGN is dissipated upon addition of concanamycin, a potent and specific inhibitor of V-ATPases (28Woo J.T. Shinohara C. Sakai K. Hasumi K. Endo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using another V-ATPase inhibitor, namely bafilomycin A1 (not illustrated). These agents did not alter the morphology (not shown) or compromise the integrity of the TGN, as indicated by the alkalinization induced by the subsequent addition of ammonium (Fig. 3 C). These findings indicate that maintenance of the acidic pH of the TGN requires continuous H+ pumping, to offset the sizable “leak” that is manifested upon addition of concanamycin. Because the behavior of transfected HeLa and CHO cells was similar and considering the tighter pericentriolar localization of the label in the latter cells, all subsequent experiments were performed with the stably transfected CHO cells. Dissipation of the pH gradient upon addition of concanamycin occurred relatively slowly, requiring over 10 min to reach completion (Fig. 3 C). This could be the result of a limited permeability to H+(equivalents) or of a low counterion conductance. These alternatives could be resolved using the H+-specific ionophor"
https://openalex.org/W2038723412,"Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a human plasma zymogen similar to pancreatic pro-carboxypeptidase B. Cleavage of the zymogen by thrombin/thrombomodulin generates the enzyme, activated TAFI (TAFIa), which retards fibrin clot lysis in vitro and likely modulates fibrinolysis in vivo. In the present work we stably expressed recombinant TAFI in baby hamster kidney cells, purified it to homogeneity from conditioned serum-free medium, and compared it to plasma TAFI (pTAFI) with respect to glycosylation and kinetics of activation by thrombin/thrombomodulin. Although rTAFI is glycosylated somewhat differently than pTAFI, cleavage products with thrombin/thrombomodulin are indistinguishable, and parameters of activation kinetics are very similar with k cat= 0.55 s−1, K m = 0.54 μm, and K d = 6.0 nm for rTAFI and k cat = 0.61 s−1,K m = 0.55 μm, andK d = 6.6 nm for pTAFI. The respective TAFIa species also were prepared and compared with respect to thermal stability and enzymatic properties, including inhibition of fibrinolysis. The half-life of both enzymes at 37 °C is about 10 min, and the decay of enzymatic activity is associated with a quenching (to ∼62% of the initial value at 60 min) of the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme. Stability was highly temperature-dependent, which, according to transition state theory, indicates both high enthalpy and entropy changes associated with inactivation (ΔH o‡ ≅ 45 kcal/mol and ΔS o‡ ≅ 80 cal/mol/K). Both species of TAFIa are stabilized by the competitive inhibitors 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid. rTAFIa and pTAFIa are very similar with respect to kinetics of cleavage of small substrates, susceptibility to inhibitors, and ability to retard both tPA-induced and plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis. These studies provide new insights into the thermal instability of TAFIa, a property which could be a significant regulator of its activity in vivo; in addition, they show that rTAFI and rTAFIa are excellent surrogates for the natural plasma-derived species, a necessary prerequisite for future studies of structure and function by site-specific mutagenesis.

The balance between the activities of the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades is essential to protect the organism from excessive blood loss upon injury as well as to maintain the fluidity of blood within the vasculature. Imbalances lead to a tendency toward either bleeding or thrombosis, the latter of which is manifested as heart attacks and strokes.The coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades consist of a series of zymogen to enzyme conversions, terminating in the proteolytic enzymes thrombin and plasmin, which, respectively, catalyze the deposition and removal of fibrin. However, when in a complex with the endothelial cell-surface cofactor thrombomodulin, the specificity of thrombin is changed from fibrinogen to protein C (1Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), thus changing thrombin to an anticoagulant rather than a procoagulant enzyme.When formed in the context of a fibrin clot, activated protein C was found to be profibrinolytic as well as anticoagulant (2Taylor F.B.

Further investigations in our laboratory led to the isolation of this factor, a 60-kDa glycoprotein present in human plasma at a concentration of approximately 50 nm, which we termed TAFI 1The abbreviations used are: TAFI, thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor; rTAFI, recombinant TAFI; pTAFI, plasma-derived TAFI; TAFIa, activated TAFI; CM, conditioned medium; Hip-Arg, hippuryl-l-arginine; Hip-Lys, hippuryl-l-lysine; HA, hippuric acid; FA-Ala-Lys,N-[3-(2-furylacryloyl)]-l-alanyl-l-lysine; tPA, (recombinant) tissue-type plasminogen activator; PCI, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor; ε-ACA, epsilon-aminocaproic acid; GEMSA, 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PPAck, d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone; dEGRck, 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; pro-pCPB, plasma procarboxypeptidase B; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: TAFI, thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor; rTAFI, recombinant TAFI; pTAFI, plasma-derived TAFI; TAFIa, activated TAFI; CM, conditioned medium; Hip-Arg, hippuryl-l-arginine; Hip-Lys, hippuryl-l-lysine; HA, hippuric acid; FA-Ala-Lys,N-[3-(2-furylacryloyl)]-l-alanyl-l-lysine; tPA, (recombinant) tissue-type plasminogen activator; PCI, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor; ε-ACA, epsilon-aminocaproic acid; GEMSA, 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PPAck, d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone; dEGRck, 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; pro-pCPB, plasma procarboxypeptidase B; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Upon activation of TAFI by cleavage with thrombin, an active enzyme is formed (TAFIa) that possesses carboxypeptidase B-like activity and inhibits fibrinolysis, probably by removal from partially degraded fibrin the C-terminal lysines that contribute to the development of positive feedback in the fibrinolytic cascade (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Although thrombin itself is a weak activator of TAFI (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex activates TAFI with a 1250-fold higher catalytic efficiency than thrombin alone, suggesting that thrombin/thrombomodulin is the physiological activator of TAFI (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).We have shown that TAFIa inhibits tPA-mediated fibrinolysis in vitro half-maximally at a concentration of approximately 1 nm (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This concentration is about 2% the level of the zymogen in plasma, indicating that enough TAFIa could be produced in plasma to have a significant effect on fibrin clot lysis in vivo. In support of this scenario, recent studies utilizing a canine model of thrombolysis indicated that inducible carboxypeptidase activity (probably TAFIa) is increased during thrombosis and thrombolytic therapy (9Redlitz A. Nicolini F.A. Malycky J.L. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); in addition, a significant positive correlation is observed between inducible carboxypeptidase activity and the time required for restoration of blood flow (9Redlitz A. Nicolini F.A. Malycky J.L. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These studies strongly imply that regulation of TAFIa activity may play a significant role in modulating hemostasis and thrombolysis in vivo.The protein that we have termed TAFI has been described previously by other groups. Hendriks et al. (10Hendriks D. Wang W. Scharpe S.S. Lommaert M.P. van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) detected an unstable carboxypeptidase B-like activity in human serum; the enzyme corresponding to this activity was subsequently isolated and named CPU (“unstable” carboxypeptidase (11Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In addition, Eaton et al. (12Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered the zymogen as a contaminant in preparations of α2-antiplasmin and termed it plasma procarboxypeptidase B (pro-pCPB). These investigators also cloned a cDNA corresponding to pro-pCPB, the deduced amino acid sequence of which showed significant homology with pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B (12Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis of TAFI and fragments derived from TAFI showed that TAFI and pro-pCPB are the same protein (7Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).One of the striking features of the enzyme TAFIa is its inherent instability, a property for which it was given the name carboxypeptidase U (11Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively short half-life of the enzyme at body temperature suggests that this inherent instability might be relevant in the down-regulation of the enzyme in vivo. The following studies were undertaken to both investigate the instability of TAFIa and to compare thoroughly the properties of recombinant and plasma-derived TAFI and TAFIa.DISCUSSIONWe have expressed a recombinant form of TAFI (thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor; also known as CPU (11Wang W.

Unlike bacterial expression systems, recombinant proteins expressed in mammalian cells can be secreted in their native conformation and are subjected to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation.In the present study, we found that while the recombinant version of TAFI migrates marginally more slowly on SDS-PAGE than its plasma-derived counterpart, rTAFI is virtually indistinguishable from pTAFI in terms of its ability to be activated by thrombin/thrombomodulin and the stability and enzymatic properties of TAFIa including the ability to inhibit tPA- and plasmin-mediated fibrin clot lysis in vitro.The mobility difference between rTAFI and pTAFI on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) is likely due to differences in the size and/or composition ofN-linked glycans. Inspection of the cDNA sequence for plasma procarboxypeptidase B reveals the presence of four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-22, Asn-51, Asn-63, and Asn-86), all of which are located within the 92-amino acid activation peptide (12Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, there is no apparent difference between the mobility of the M r ∼35,000 TAFIa species derived from rTAFI and pTAFI (Fig. 4). Furthermore, treatment of rTAFI and pTAFI with N-glycosidase F, which specifically removesN-linked glycans, gave rise to terminal products of identical electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5). Three intermediately glycosylated species are present, indicating that all four potentialN-linked sites are utilized in rTAFI and pTAFI.Differences in the size and/or composition of N-linked glycans are frequently observed in the comparison of a recombinant protein and its naturally occurring counterpart (25Fan B.

In some cases such differences have consequences for the functional properties of the recombinant protein. For example, BHK cells secrete a glycoform of ATIII that is not found in plasma and that differs in its affinity for heparin and in its rate of proteinase inhibition, in addition to two other glycoforms that are functionally similar to plasma-derived ATIII (25Fan B.

However, in other cases differences in glycosylation have no apparent effect on the functional behavior of the recombinant protein. Human factor VIII expressed in BHK cells contains differences in the composition of itsN-linked glycans relative to plasma-derived factor VIII (28Hironaka T. Furukawa K. Esmon P.C.

Although we did not observe any functional differences between rTAFI and pTAFI attributable to differences in glycosylation, differences in, for example, the pharmacokinetics of rTAFI and pTAFI or in their binding to as yet undescribed substrates cannot be ruled out.It should be noted that the fully N-deglycosylated TAFI species migrated as doublets, with both members of the doublet in similar proportions in both rTAFI and pTAFI (Fig. 5). These doublets are most likely the result of heterogeneity in usage ofO-linked glycosylation sites. It is unlikely that the doublet is due to N-terminal sequence heterogeneity, since TAFI derived from plasma has been shown to possess a unique N-terminal sequence (7Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar,12Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We found that rTAFI is virtually indistinguishable from pTAFI in terms of its ability to hydrolyze small peptide substrates and to be inhibited by the competitive inhibitors ε-ACA, GEMSA, and PCI (TableIII). These data demonstrate the integrity of the active site of rTAFI and show that, when produced under the conditions reported in this study, rTAFI possesses a specific activity similar to that of its plasma-derived counterpart. Of note is the similarity in theK i for PCI, a small (39 amino acid) inhibitor that has been shown to bind to carboxypeptidase A through regions distinct from those involved in substrate binding. Together with the similar kinetic constants obtained for the activation of rTAFI by thrombin/thrombomodulin (Table II), these data indicate that the overall structure of TAFI is likely to be faithfully represented by the recombinant protein.A striking feature of TAFIa is that its activity is unstable, decaying rapidly at 37 °C both in vitro in the absence of detectable proteolysis and in the serum milieu. In the present study, we found the stability of rTAFIa and pTAFIa to be very similar; although both enzymes were stable at 0 °C, their activities decayed with half-lives of about 10 min at 37 °C, about 40–50 min at 30 °C, and about 120–150 min at 22 °C (Fig. 7). The structural basis for the instability of TAFIa is not clear at present, but a thermodynamic interpretation suggests a highly unfavorable enthalpy change associated with inactivation (which may reflect the requirement to disrupt many noncovalent bonds), offset by a corresponding highly favorable entropy change (which in turn may reflect the adoption of a less ordered structure). Consistent with such changes in structure, we found a marked quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of TAFIa at 37 °C which correlated temporally with the decay of enzymatic activity (Fig. 8). The quenching of the fluorescence signal is presumably attributable to the exposure to the solvent of residues (largely tryptophans) previously buried in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme. It is noteworthy that this presumptive structural change is not detectable by electrophoresis; the mobility of TAFIa species incubated for 60 min at 37 °C on SDS-PAGE is identical to that of TAFIa species incubated at 0 °C for 60 min (data not shown).Whether an endogenous inhibitor of TAFIa exists is not known at present, although data exist that indicate that TAFIa interacts with α2-macroglobulin and pregnancy zone protein (31Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Christensen S. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12937-12943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The consequences of these interactions are not known, although binding of TAFIa to these proteins does not affect its enzymatic activity (31Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Christensen S. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12937-12943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because carboxypeptidase U activity (TAFIa) in serum has a half-life similar to that of purified TAFIa shown here (10Hendriks D. Wang W. Scharpe S.S. Lommaert M.P. van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the presence of a fast-acting endogenous inhibitor in vivo is not indicated. Therefore, the intrinsic instability of TAFIa at 37 °C may be physiologically relevant in the down-regulation of TAFIa in vivo. Furthermore, that the activity of TAFIa is stable at 37 °C in the presence of saturating concentrations of competitive inhibitors suggests that in the clot milieu, TAFIa activity may be maintained as long as there is sufficient substrate available.Although the mechanism by which TAFIa inhibits fibrinolysis has yet to be conclusively determined, it likely involves removal of the C-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin that are required for maximal stimulation of tPA-mediated plasminogen activation (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). However, additional mechanisms for the antifibrinolytic effect of TAFIa may also be possible, since we have recently observed that TAFIa (albeit at higher concentrations) is capable of attenuating plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis (i.e. when plasminogen activation has been bypassed). Although the mechanism underlying this effect is unclear at present, plasmin itself may be the substrate for TAFIa in this instance (21Wang W. Boffa M.B. Walker J. Nesheim M.E. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 82Google Scholar). Based on the data presented in Fig. 9, which show that rTAFIa is capable of inhibiting both tPA- and plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis in a manner identical to pTAFIa, it is clear that rTAFIa and pTAFIa are comparable in their ability to participate in the reactions involved in the antifibrinolytic effect. These reactions may include hydrolyzing C-terminal basic residues in fibrin and plasmin, as well as inactivation of TAFIa by plasmin cleavage at Arg-330.In conclusion, these studies show that although plasma and recombinant TAFI exhibit minor differences in glycosylation, recombinant TAFI and TAFIa are excellent surrogates for the natural species and thus their properties can be used to interpret further differences obtained in structure-function studies utilizing site-directed mutagenesis. The balance between the activities of the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades is essential to protect the organism from excessive blood loss upon injury as well as to maintain the fluidity of blood within the vasculature. Imbalances lead to a tendency toward either bleeding or thrombosis, the latter of which is manifested as heart attacks and strokes. The coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades consist of a series of zymogen to enzyme conversions, terminating in the proteolytic enzymes thrombin and plasmin, which, respectively, catalyze the deposition and removal of fibrin. However, when in a complex with the endothelial cell-surface cofactor thrombomodulin, the specificity of thrombin is changed from fibrinogen to protein C (1Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), thus changing thrombin to an anticoagulant rather than a procoagulant enzyme. When formed in the context of a fibrin clot, activated protein C was found to be profibrinolytic as well as anticoagulant (2Taylor F.B. Lockhart M.S. Thromb. Res. 1985; 37: 639-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Burdick M.D. Schaub R.G. Thromb.

Upon activation of TAFI by cleavage with thrombin, an active enzyme is formed (TAFIa) that possesses carboxypeptidase B-like activity and inhibits fibrinolysis, probably by removal from partially degraded fibrin the C-terminal lysines that contribute to the development of positive feedback in the fibrinolytic cascade (8Bajzar L.

This concentration is about 2% the level of the zymogen in plasma, indicating that enough TAFIa could be produced in plasma to have a significant effect on fibrin clot lysis in vivo.

Both peptides were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and determined to have the following primary structures by Edman microsequencing: IWLTALKFLGKHAAKHLAKQQLSKL-NH2 for lycotoxin I and KIKWFKTMKSIAKFIAKEQMKKHLGGE-OH for lycotoxin II. The predicted secondary structures of the lycotoxins display amphipathic α-helix character typical of antimicrobial pore-forming peptides. Antimicrobial assays showed that both lycotoxins potently inhibit the growth of bacteria (Escherichia coli) and yeast (Candida glabrata) at micromolar concentrations. To verify its hypothesized pore-forming activity, lycotoxin I was synthesized and shown to promote efflux of Ca2+ from synaptosomes, to cause hemolysis of erythrocytes, and to dissipate voltage gradients across muscle membrane. The lycotoxins may play a dual role in spider-prey interaction, functioning both in the prey capture strategy as well as to protect the spider from potentially infectious organisms arising from prey ingestion. Spider venoms may represent a potentially new source of novel antimicrobial agents with important medical implications."
https://openalex.org/W1969561251,"The 26 S proteasome is a multisubunit proteolytic complex responsible for degrading eukaryotic proteins targeted by ubiquitin modification. Substrate recognition by the complex is presumed to be mediated by one or more common receptor(s) with affinity for multiubiquitin chains, especially those internally linked through lysine 48. We have identified previously a candidate for one such receptor from diverse species, designated here as Mcb1 forMultiubiquitin chain-binding protein, based on its ability to bind Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains and its location within the 26 S proteasome complex. Even though Mcb1 is likely not the only receptor in yeast, it is necessary for conferring resistance to amino acid analogs and for degrading a subset of ubiquitin pathway substrates such as ubiquitin-Pro-β-galactosidase (Ub-Pro-β-gal) (van Nocker, S., Sadis, S., Rubin, D.

To further define the role of Mcb1 in substrate recognition by the 26 S proteasome, a structure/function analysis of various deletion and site-directed mutants of yeast andArabidopsis Mcb1 was performed.

Unexpectedly, this domain was not essential for either Ub-Pro-β-gal degradation or conferring resistance to amino acid analogs. The domain responsible for these two activities was mapped to a conserved region near the N terminus. Yeast and Arabidopsis Mcb1 derivatives containing an intact multiubiquitin-binding site but missing the N-terminal region failed to promote Ub-Pro-β-gal degradation and even accentuated the sensitivity of the yeast Δmcb1 strain to amino acid analogs. This hypersensitivity was not caused by a gross defect in 26 S proteasome assembly as mutants missing either the N-terminal domain or the multiubiquitin chain-binding site could still associate with 26 S proteasome and generate a complex indistinguishable in size from that present in wild-type yeast.

The ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway is a major route for the selective degradation of eukaryotic proteins. Through the removal of key regulatory components, the pathway helps control many aspects of cell homeostasis, growth, and development (1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 3Vierstra R.D.

Examples include cell cycle progression, maintenance of chromatin structure, DNA repair, enzymatic regulation, transcription, signal transduction, and programmed cell death. In addition, the ubiquitin pathway participates in cellular housekeeping and the stress response by removing abnormal and denatured proteins. In the ubiquitin pathway, proteins are first enzymatically tagged for breakdown by the covalent attachment of one or more chains of ubiquitin monomers. This process is catalyzed by an enzymatic cascade, involving ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; Mcb1, multiubiquitin chain-binding protein, Ub, ubiquitin; β-gal, β-galactosidase; UFD, ubiquitin fusion degradation; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Temed,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CAN, canavanine; pFP, p-fluorophenylalanine; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; bp, base pair(s). ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s), that couples ATP hydrolysis to ubiquitin ligation (1Ciechanover A.

Attachment is via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and free lysines either in the target or in the preceding ubiquitin in the chain. Within the multiubiquitin chain, Lys48 appears to be the preferred intermolecular linkage site (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 6van Nocker S. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Once assembled, the multiubiquitin chain functions as a recognition signal for degradation of the substrate by the 26 S proteasome, a multisubunit complex specific for multiubiquitinated proteins (10Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). The tagged proteins are broken down into short peptides, while the ubiquitin moieties are released intact for reuse. Specificity within the ubiquitin pathway is achieved by at least three mechanisms. The most important determines which proteins should be ubiquitinated by the E1/E2/E3 cascade of reactions. Here, substrate specificity is primarily regulated by a large family of E2 and E3 isozymes working alone or in combination to recognize key degradation signals within the targets (1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 3Vierstra R.D.

The second regulatory mechanism involves control of the steady-state level of ubiquitin-protein conjugates prior to breakdown. Conjugate levels are affected not only by the rate of ubiquitination but also by the rate of deubiquitination; a reaction catalyzed by a diverse family of ubiquitin-specific proteases that cleaves the junction between ubiquitin and the protein moiety (2Hochstrasser M.

The third mechanism to achieve specificity is the association and breakdown of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome is composed of two subcomplexes, designated the 19 S regulatory complex and the 20 S proteasome (4Larsen C.N. Finley D.

The 20 S proteasome contains the catalytic core of the protease; it exists as a hollow cylinder, created by the assembly of four stacked polypeptide rings, and confines the protease active sites within the lumen (17Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar,18Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar). The 19 S regulatory complex binds to one or both ends of the 20 S particle. It contains ∼15 subunits and confers both ATP and ubiquitin dependence to the holoenzyme complex. The function(s) of most of these subunits are unknown; six belong to the AAA family of ATPases (19Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Presumably, the 19 S complex recognizes appropriate targets through the multiubiquitin chain, unfolds the target moiety, and directs the unfolded polypeptide into the lumen of the 20 S complex for breakdown (4Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). During or after this process, the multiubiquitin chain is disassembled by ubiquitin-specific proteases. Recognition of ubiquitinated substrates by the 26 S proteasome is proposed to be mediated by one or a few common multiubiquitin chain receptors located in the 19 S particle. We recently identified a candidate for one such receptor from diverse species, designated here as Mcb1 for Multiubiquitinchain-binding protein, based on its ability to bind Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains and its presence in the 26 S proteasome (21van Nocker S.

Most of these Mcb1 polypeptides range from 376 to 414 amino acids long, the exception being yeast Mcb1 (268 amino acids), which is missing a portion of the C-terminal end present in the other Mcb1 proteins (21van Nocker S.

Consistent with a role in ubiquitin conjugate recognition, Mcb1 proteins preferentially associate with multiubiquitin chainsversus the ubiquitin monomer in vitro, especially those chains containing three or more ubiquitins (21van Nocker S.

This is based on the observations that yeastMcb1 knockout strains display a mild phenotype. Unlike mutants in other essential ubiquitin components (2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 4Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), Δmcb1 strains are viable, have near-wild-type growth rates, degrade the bulk of short-lived proteins (including an N-terminal end rule substrate) normally, and are not sensitive to UV radiation or heat stress (22van Nocker S.

However, they are more sensitive to amino acid analogs and cold than wild-type yeast (22van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). 2H. Fu and R. D. Vierstra, unpublished results. In addition, Δmcb1 mutants cannot degrade ubiquitin-proline-β-galactosidase (Ub-Pro-β-gal), an artificial substrate that is degraded by a subpathway in the ubiquitin system (ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway) (9Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results suggest that Mcb1 proteins are involved in the recognition and degradation of only a subset of ubiquitin/26 S proteasome substrates. To further define the role of Mcb1 in conjugate recognition and to identify the site(s) of multiubiquitin chain binding, we analyzed here a series of deletion and amino acid substitution mutants of yeast andArabidopsis Mcb1. A stretch of highly conserved hydrophobic residues was found to be critical for recognizing Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains in vitro. However, when the various Mcb1 derivatives were tested for their ability to complement yeast Δmcb1, the multiubiquitin chain recognition motif was found not to be required for conferring resistance to amino acid analogs or for restoring degradation of Ub-Pro-β-gal. Instead, a conserved region near the N terminus was essential for these functions. These data show that a domain near the N terminus, and not the multiubiquitin chain-binding site, is most critical for Mcb1 function in vivo. Yeast Δmcb1 strain (SV1-ΔMCB1; haploid MAT a) was constructed previously using strain DF5 (MAT a /MATα lys2-801/lys2-801 leu2-3, 112/leu2-3, 112 ura3-52/ura3-52 his3-Δ200/his3Δ200 trp1-1/trp1-1) (22van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The congenic MAT a wild-type yeast strain (SV1) used throughout was derived from tetrad dissection during construction of Δmcb1 yeast strain. Synthetic medium consisted of 0.7% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) supplemented with uracil, adenine, 2% glucose, and amino acids as described previously (29Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-210Google Scholar). Tryptophan was omitted from the synthetic medium for selection. Arginine and phenylalanine were omitted from the selection medium supplemented with canavanine and p-fluorophenylalanine, and methionine was omitted from the synthetic medium used for pulse-labeling experiments. Yeast transformation was carried out as described by Gietz et al. (30Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), and cultures were grown at 30 °C. Constructions encoding the yeast andArabidopsis Mcb1 derivatives (see Fig. 2) were made in theEscherichia coli expression vector pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) by PCR strategies. The derived genes were verified as correct by DNA sequence analysis. The 5′-amplification oligonucleotides were designed to add an NdeI site at the native start codon or, for N-terminal-deleted constructions, at the deletion point to create a new start codon. For the C-terminal-deleted constructions, the 3′-amplification oligonucleotides were designed to add an internal stop codon. Introduced restriction sites and stop codons in the various oligonucleotides listed below are underlined and italicized, respectively. Positions of new start and stop codons for the terminal-deleted constructions are indicated in Fig. 2. The PCR products were cloned either directly or through intermediate vectors into pET28a using the NdeI site at the 5′ ends and a 3′ site which was created by the design of the 3′-amplification oligonucleotide (EcoRI, underlined) or derived from intermediate cloning vectors (EcoRI, HindIII, SalI, orNdeI). For wild-type yeast MCB1 (ScMCB1), the coding region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA (isolated from strain S288C) using oligonucleotides GCAGTAACCGCCATATGGTATTGGAAGCTACAG (primer 1) and CTATTTAGAGGAAGAGATCTCAAACCTGG (position 75–103 downstream of stop codon) (31Johnston M. Andrews S. Brinkman R. Cooper J. Ding H. et al.Science. 1994; 265: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was cloned through intermediate vectors pGEMT (Promega, Madison, WI) and pET29 (usingNdeI/NcoI sites; Novagen) into pET28a usingNdeI/EcoRI sites. For genes encoding yeast CΔ1, NΔ1, and NΔ3, the corresponding DNA fragments were generated fromScMCB1 in pET28a by PCR using primer 1 and TTGCGAATTC TCAGTCCATTGATGGGTCTACCC; CAACCATATGGTGTTATCTACGTTTACCGC and GATCGAATTCCTGGAAGAGTGAAGGGAGATG (primer 2, position 56–86 downstream of stop codon); or GGCGCCCATATGGGGTCTGGCGGTGATTCCGAT and primer 2, respectively. The PCR fragments were cloned into pET28a usingNdeI/EcoRI sites. To create yeast NΔ2, a 258-bpNdeI fragment was removed from the 5′ end of theScMCB1 construction in pET28a. Because ScMCB1, CΔ1, and NΔ1 constructions contain an internal NdeI site, preparation of the corresponding coding regions involved partial digestion with NdeI. Arabidopsis MCB1 (AtMCB1) and its deletion mutants were generated by PCR from the AtMCB1 cDNA (21van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For AtMCB1, CTGCTTATCGACCATATGGTTCTCGAGGCG (primer 3) and the KS primer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for PCR amplification. The PCR product, which also contained 160 bp of 3′-untranslated region, was cloned into pET28a using the 5′NdeI site and a 3′ EcoRI site derived from the cDNA vector, pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). ForArabidopsis CΔ1, AtMCB1 in pET28a was digested with BamHI and religated to introduce a premature stop codon. For Arabidopsis CΔ2 and CΔ3, primer 3 and either AGCTAAAGCCAGATCTCAGTCCTCATCAGCC (primer 4) or CGAAGGGCAAGAGCAAGTTCTCAATCGATATTTGGGTCC, respectively, were used for PCR. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned through intermediate vector pGEMT into pET28a using NdeI/SalI andNdeI/NdeI sites, respectively. ForArabidopsis NΔ1, NΔ2, NΔ3, and NΔ4, CAAAGGACATATGGTATTGACTACTCCTACCTCTG, ATTTCGGGGAGGATGATCATATGGAAAAGCCTCAGAAA (primer 5), TTTGGTGTGGACCCACATATGGATCCAGAACTTGCT, or GCGGCCGATGAGGCACATATGAAAGACAAAGATGG, respectively, was used as the 5′-oligonucleotide and the KS primer was used as the 3′-oligonucleotide. Corresponding PCR products were cloned separately into pET28a using the 5′ NdeI site and a 3′HindIII site derived from the cDNA vector. ForArabidopsis I1, primer 5 and primer 4 were used for PCR amplification. The PCR product was cloned through intermediate vector pT7Blue-T (Novagen) into pET28a using the 5′ NdeI site and the 3′ EcoRI site derived from the intermediate pT7Blue-T vector. For Arabidopsis I2 and I3, primer 5 or GAGGGTGCAAGTGGCCATATGTCTGCGGCAGCTGCT was used as the 5′-oligonucleotide and AACTGAATTCTGTTAGGCGGAAGCTGTGTCCC was used as the 3′-oligonucleotide. The PCR products were cloned directly into pET28a using NdeI/EcoRI sites. For all the site-directed mutants (i.e. yeast N5 and G andArabidopsis D5/G, D5, N5/G, N5, D/G, D, and G) (see Fig. 2), the QuickChangeTM mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene) was employed using either ScMCB1 or AtMCB1 present in pET28a. The oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis were designed according to the manufacturer's guidelines to have the noncomplementary nucleotides bracketed by 10–22 complementary nucleotides. All yeast and Arabidopsis Mcb1 proteins were expressed inE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as His6-tagged versions using pET28a. The His6 tag, containing the amino acid sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH, was encoded by a nucleotide sequence 5′ to the NdeI site in the pET28a vector. Induction of protein expression and preparation of bacterial lysates were performed according to manufacturer's protocols (Novagen). Total protein from cell lysates was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were washed for 5 min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5, 25 °C), 0.5 m NaCl), blocked for 2 h in TBS containing 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and washed for 5 min in TBS. The membranes were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature in TBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 3.5 × 105 cpm/ml of Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains labeled with 125I. The membranes were then washed in TBS for 1–2 h and subjected to autoradiography. The Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains were prepared with ZmUbc7 enzyme and were radiolabeled with carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Corp.) using IODO-BEAD (Pierce) as described previously (6van Nocker S. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24766-24773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variousMCB1 derivatives were moved from pET28a vector into a high copy 2μ yeast shuttle vector pRS424 (32Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar) and expressed without the His6 tag under the direction of the yeast ScMCB1promoter. pRS424 was first modified to include the ScMCB1promoter immediately followed by NdeI and EcoRI sites. The ScMCB1 promoter, containing 552 bp upstream of the start codon, was isolated from genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotides TGCATCATTGCGAATACCGAG and CTGTAGCTTCCAATACCATATGGCGGTTACTGC. With the exception of the gene encoding Arabidopsis CΔ2, the variousMCB1 derivatives were moved from pET28a into the modified pRS424 using the 5′ NdeI site and a 3′ EcoRI site. Arabidopsis CΔ2 construction was moved using the 5′ NdeI site and a 3′ SalI (filled in) into the modified pRS424 digested with NdeI and EcoRI (filled in). Wild-type yeast, Δmcb1 harboring an empty pRS424 vector, or Δmcb1 yeast strains expressing various MCB1derivatives were grown in liquid selection medium to late logarithmic phase. Cultures were washed twice with selection medium (arginine and phenylalanine omitted) and resuspended in the same medium toA 600 = 1.0. For qualitative visualization of amino acid analog sensitivity, resuspended cells were spotted in a 10-fold dilution series onto solidified selection medium supplemented with canavanine and p-fluorophenylalanine at 1.5 and 25 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated for 6 days. For quantitative measurement, resuspended cells were plated and grown for 14 days on solidified selection medium with or without amino acid analogs. Survival rate was calculated by dividing the number of colonies formed on selection medium with analogs by the number formed on selection medium without analogs. Yeast cultures were grown in liquid selection medium to late logarithmic phase. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by vortexing with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0; 4 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 14 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm Na4EDTA), with the addition of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 nm pepstatin A just before use. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Immunoblot analyses were performed with rabbit antisera against Arabidopsis or yeast Mcb1 (21van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were grown to exponential phase at 30 °C in synthetic medium containing 2% raffinose, 2% galactose, and amino acids, and pulsed-labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine. The chase was performed in freshly prepared synthetic medium containing 2% raffinose, 2% galactose, amino acids, 1 mg/ml nonlabeled methionine, and 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide. Ub-Pro-β-gal was immunoprecipitated with anti-β-galactosidase antibodies (Promega) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity present in Ub-Pro-β-gal was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The 26 S proteasome was partially purified from wild-type and Δmcb1yeast strains by conventional chromatography as described previously (34Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Hengartner C. Young R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2007202879,"The overexpression of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) by RBL-2H3 cells was used as the basis for an investigation of the effects of PHGPx on the formation of leukotrienes. The rates of production of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and leukotriene B4(LTB4) in cells that overexpressed PHGPx were 8 times lower than those in a control line of cells. The reduction in rates of production of leukotrienes apparently resulted from the increase in the PHGPx activity since control rates of formation of leukotrienes could be achieved in PHGPx-overexpressing cells upon inhibition of PHGPx activity by diethyl malate. The conversion of radioactively labeled arachidonic acid to intermediates in the lipoxygenase pathway, such as 5- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), LTC4, and LTB4, was strongly inhibited in PHGPx-overexpressing cells that had been prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid. PHGPx apparently inactivated the 5-lipoxygenase that catalyzed the conversion of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) since 5-HPETE is a common precursor of 5-HETE, LTC4, and LTB4. The rates of formation of LTC4 and LTB4 in PHGPx-overexpressing cells returned to control rates upon the addition of a small amount of 12-HPETE. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the rapid burst of formation of lipid hydroperoxides induced by A23187 was suppressed in PHGPx-overexpressing cells as compared with the control lines of cells. Subcellular fractionation analysis showed that the amount of PHGPx associated with nuclear fractions from PHGPx-overexpressing cells was 3.5 times higher than that from the control line of cells. These results indicate that PHGPx might be involved in inactivation of 5-lipoxygenase via reductions in levels of the fatty acid hydroperoxides that are required for the full activation of 5-lipoxygenase.

Leukotrienes are important mediators both in host defense mechanisms and in inflammatory disease states since they have potent effects on cell migration, muscle contraction, vascular permeability, and the release of lysosomal enzymes (1William R.

These sequential reactions are catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase that is the primary enzymatic regulator of the biosynthesis of leukotrienes (5Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgern J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). LTA4 is further converted to a variety of leukotrienes, such as LTB4 and LTC4. The nuclear membrane is the site of leukotriene synthesis, and cytosolic phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase are translocated to this site from the cytosol after the activation of cells (6Glover S. de Carvalho M.S.

There is evidence that fatty acid hydroperoxides might also activate 5-lipoxygenase (13Ludwig P. Holzhutter H.-G. Colosimo A. Silvestrini M.C. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. Eur. J.

Samuelsson B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Intracellular 5-HPETE can be reduced to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) by lipid peroxidases such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, the lipid peroxidase responsible for the reduction of 5-HPETE remains to be defined. This reduction seems to be a key reaction in the control of the production of leukotrienes since it can determine the level of 5-HPETE, which is utilized as an activator of 5-lipoxygenase and as a precursor of LTA4.GPx reduces cellular lipid hydroperoxides. Two types of selenium-dependent GPx are widely distributed in various tissues. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cGPx, GPx1) is predominantly present in the cytosol of tissues, and it reduces fatty acid hydroperoxides and H2O2 at the expense of glutathione (16Flohé L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 643-731Google Scholar). Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx, GPx4) is localized in both the cytosol and the membrane fraction (17Roveri A. Maiorino M. Urisini F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 143: 307-313Google Scholar). PHGPx can directly reduce the phospholipid hydroperoxides, fatty acid hydroperoxides (18Urisini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are produced in peroxidized membranes and oxidized lipoproteins. Although direct evidence for the involvement of GPx in the reduction of 5-HPETE, required for the activation of 5-lipoxygenase, is still lacking, it has been shown that impairment of GPx activity by selenium deficiency or glutathione depletion leads to enhanced activity of 5-lipoxygenase in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes, rat basophile leukemia cells (RBL-1) (21Weitzel F. Wendel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6288-6292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), B lymphocytes (22Jakobsson P.-J. Steinhilber D. Odlander B. Radmark O. Claesson H.-E. Samuelsson B. Proc.

These results suggest that glutathione peroxidase might regulate the activity of 5-lipoxygenase in the cellular level. The question now arises as to whether cGPx or PHGPx might be responsible for the regulation of the formation of leukotrienes. We are interested in the possible role of PHGPx in the regulation of leukotriene synthesis since PHGPx is unique as an isozyme of GPx, being able to interact with the nuclear membrane in which the synthesis of leukotrienes occurs.Stable transfectants that overexpress PHGPx provide useful model systems with which to attempt to clarify the ability of PHGPx to modulate leukotriene synthesis. We reported previously the cloning of a cDNA for rat PHGPx (26Imai H. Sumi D. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Sugiyama A. Chiba N. Kuchino Y. Nakagawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the establishment of PHGPx-overexpressing stable transfectants of rat basophile leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells (28Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PHGPx-overexpressing cells exhibit resistance to cell death that is due to oxidative damage. RBL-2H3 cells are a neoplastic cell line from rats. They are derived from basophiles, which are among the cells that have been used most extensively in studies of 5-lipoxygenase. RBL-2H3 cells produce LTC4 and LTB4 predominantly in response to stimulation by calcium ionophores (29Yoshimoto T. Soberman R.J. Lewis R.A. Austen F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8399-8403Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Wong A. Cook M.N. Hwang S.M. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crook S.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4046-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In the present study, the PHGPx-overexpressing RBL-2H3 cells were used to examine the effects of PHGPx on the formation of leukotrienes. We showed that PHGPx significantly suppressed the production of leukotrienes via a reduction in the level of intracellular lipid hydroperoxides, which was due to suppression of the activity of 5-lipoxygenase.DISCUSSIONRBL-2H3 cells have a potent 5-lipoxygenase activity and are popular model cells for the studies of the production of leukotrienes (29Yoshimoto T. Soberman R.J. Lewis R.A. Austen F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8399-8403Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Wong A. Cook M.N. Hwang S.M. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crook S.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4046-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that the overexpression of PHGPx in RBL2H3 cells caused a dramatic suppression of the production of leukotrienes in response to stimulation by A23187 (Fig. 2). The production of individual metabolites of 5-lipoxygenase was examined in PHGPx-overexpressing cells that had been preincubated with [14C]arachidonic acid by reverse-phase HPLC to define the step in the 5-lipoxygenase pathway where inhibition occurs (Fig. 4 A). The rates of production of radioactive 5-HETE, LTC4, and LTB4 in PHGPx-overexpressing cells were much lower than in the control line of cells, whereas the rates of release of [14C]arachidonic acid were unchanged (Fig. 3). No esterification of 5-HETE in phospholipid was also detected in PHGPx-overexpressing cells (data not shown). Suppression of the production of 5-HETE in PHGPx-overexpressing cells indicated that inhibition of the synthesis of leukotrienes was not due to acceleration of the reduction of 5-HPETE to 5-HETE but was, rather, due to the inhibition of the production of 5-HPETE from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. Levels of 5-lipoxygenase did not change in PHGPx-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4 B), an indication that the activity of 5-lipoxygenase was suppressed in such cells.The question remains as to how PHGPx down-regulates the activity of 5-lipoxygenase. The results obtained with PHGPx-overexpressing cells clearly indicate that PHGPx is intimately involved in the suppression of the activity of 5-lipoxygenase. Previous reports suggest that lipid hydroperoxides have dual effects on the activity of 5-lipoxygenase. In studies of enzyme kinetics, a small amount of HPETE activated 5-lipoxygenase (48Zhang Y.-Y. Hamberg M. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and a relatively high concentration (1.75 μm) of HPETE caused inactivation (49Aharony D. Redkar-Brown D.G. Hubbs S.J. Stein R.C. Prostaglandins. 1987; 33: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of the activation and inactivation of 5-lipoxygenase have not been elucidated, it seems likely that the state of the iron in 5-lipoxygenase might modulate the activity of the enzyme. When lipoxygenase is inactive, the enzyme contains a single non-heme iron that is in the ferrous oxidation state (Fe2+). The active form of lipoxygenase contains iron in the ferric oxidation state (Fe3+) (50Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 51Jones G.D. Russell L. Darley-Usmar V.M. Stone D. Wilson M.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7197-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the conversion of iron to the ferric from the ferrous oxidation state is necessary for the activation of lipoxygenase (52De Groot J.J.M.C. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Wever R. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 377: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 53Cheesbrough T.M. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3837-3840Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 54Nelson M.J. Chase D.B. Seitz S.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 55Porter N. Zuraw P.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1985; 512: 1472-1473Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of lipoxygenase might be regulated by a small amount of hydroperoxy lipids, acting as essential activators of the enzyme. In the present study, preincubation of PHGPx-overexpressing cells with 12-HPETE led to increased production of leukotrienes, whereas 12-HPETE did not affect the production of leukotrienes in the control line of cells (Fig. 5). Our results indicate that PHGPx is primarily responsible for the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides and thereby cause the down-regulation of 5-lipoxygenase in RBL-2H3 cells.Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the basal level of intracellular hydroperoxides was significantly reduced in PHGPx-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6). A rapid and transient increase in levels of intracellular hydroperoxides induced by stimulation with A23187 was observed. The increase in fluorescence intensity was probably due to the production of intracellular lipid hydroperoxides, including 5-HPETE produced by 5-lipoxygenase. The increase in the levels of intracellular lipid hydroperoxides induced by A23187 was suppressed by overexpression of PHGPx. This effect by PHGPx was abolished by the addition of a small amount of 12-HPETE, which probably restored the production of LTC4. Thus, small variations in the levels of intracellular hydroperoxides can dramatically modulate the production of leukotrienes, and PHGPx seems to be able to regulate the activity of 5-lipoxygenase by modulating the levels of intracellular lipid hydroperoxides.It is assumed that levels of lipid hydroperoxides are controlled by two kinds of intracellular GPx isozyme. Previous studies suggested that GPx might modulate the activity of 5-lipoxygenase because depletors of glutathione such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or diamide induce the enhanced production of leukotrienes in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (24Hatzelmann A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and B lymphocytes (22Jakobsson P.-J. Steinhilber D. Odlander B. Radmark O. Claesson H.-E. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3521-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Werz O. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether it is cGPx or PHGPx that has such an effect, we examined the effects of an inhibitor of GPx on the production of leukotrienes in the control line of cells and in PHGPx-overexpressing cells (Table II). The production of LTC4 and LTB4 in the control line of cells was not influenced by the treatment with DEM, even though the activity of cGPx, as the predominant GPx in the control line of cells, was inhibited by the depletion of glutathione. By contrast, the production of leukotrienes was significantly increased in the PHGPx-overexpressing cells when PHGPx activity was inhibited by DEM. These results indicate that PHGPx was involved in the inhibition of the activity of 5-lipoxygenase, whereas cGPx did not affect this activity.PHGPx is located in the cytosol and membrane fraction, and cGPx is known to be present predominantly in the cytosol. Godeas et al. (56Godeas C. Tramer F. Micall F. Roveri A. Maiorino M. Nisii C. Sandri G. Panfili E. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1996; 59: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated the specific localization of PHGPx in nuclear and mitochondrial fractions of rat testis. PHGPx has the highest ability to reduce lipid hydroperoxides in membranes of the four known isozymes of GPx (57Ursini F. Bindoli A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1987; 44: 255-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We showed subcellular localization of PHGPx in the control line of cells and PHGPx-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7). Control line of RBL2H3 cells contained the small amounts of PHGPx in the cytosol, whereas the large amounts of PHGPx are localized in the mitochondria and nucleus. In PHGPx-overexpressing cells, the amounts of PHGPx were significantly enhanced in nuclear, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions. The amount of PHGPx in nuclear fractions from PHGPx-overexpressing cells was 3.5 times higher than that from the control line of cells (Fig. 7). The synthesis of leukotrienes occurs at the nuclear membrane where cytosolic phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase have been translocated from the cytosol (6Glover S. de Carvalho M.S. Bayburt T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4939-4944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of PHGPx in the nucleus might be critical for modulation of the trace amounts of lipid hydroperoxide required for the activation of 5-lipoxygenase. Overexpression of PHGPx did not affect the translocation of 5-lipoxygenase and cytosolic phospholipase A2 from the cytosol to the nucleus in RBL-2H3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that inactivation of 5-lipoxygenase was due to high level expression of PHGPx in the nucleus.Metabolites of arachidonic acid seem to play an important physiological role in the signal transduction system that includes activation of NFκB (58Camandola S. Leonarduzzi G. Musso T. Varesio L. Carini R. Scavazza A. Chiarpotto E. Baeuerle P.A. Poli G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) but is also an activator of the transcription factor PPARα (the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) (63Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Thus, metabolites of lipoxygenase have a variety of biological activities in addition to their functions as chemical mediators. The present study suggests that PHGPx might be involved in the regulation of cellular functions and signal transduction through modulation of the production of leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are important mediators both in host defense mechanisms and in inflammatory disease states since they have potent effects on cell migration, muscle contraction, vascular permeability, and the release of lysosomal enzymes (1William R. Henderson Jr., M.D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121: 684-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 2Serhan C.N. Haeggstrom J.Z. Leslie C.C.

Leukotrienes can be formed in mast cells, granulocytes, and monocytes/macrophages in response to extracellular stimulation. The biosynthesis of leukotrienes is initiated by the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids (4Riendeau D. Guay J. Weech P.K. Laliberte F. Yergey J. Li C. Desmaris S. Perrier H.

J., Virbasius, J. V., Chawla, A., and Czech, M. P. (1997)Science 275, 1927–1930). Here we show that dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binds the PH domain of GRP1 with aK d = 0.5 μm, an affinity 2 orders of magnitude greater than dioctanoyl-PtdIns(4,5)P2. Further, the Sec7 domain of GRP1 is found to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange of ARF1 and -5 but not ARF6. Importantly, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but not PtdIns(4,5)P2, markedly enhances the ARF exchange activity of GRP1 in a reaction mixture containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine micelles, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, and a low concentration of sodium cholate. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated ARF nucleotide exchange through GRP1 is selectively blocked by 100 μm inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, which also binds the PH domain of GRP1. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that selective recruitment of GRP1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in membranes activates ARF1 and -5, known regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking.

Significant amounts of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) are present in unstimulated cells, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) are specifically produced upon cell surface receptor activation (6Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A large number of biological processes have been implicated as targets of regulation by this pathway, including membrane ruffling, chemotaxis, secretion, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, cell adhesion, cell growth, and apoptosis as well as the regulation of early endosome structure (7Carpenter C.L.

Recent work in this laboratory identified a potential effector protein, GRP1, containing a PH domain that binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3but not Ptd(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3)P (14Klarlund J. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). GRP1 also contains a 200-amino acid sequence with high similarity to a domain in the yeast Sec7 protein, which is known to be required for transport of polypeptides from the endoplasmatic reticulum to and through Golgi membranes (15Franzusoff A. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A similar Sec7 domain in the mammalian proteins cytohesin-1 and ARNO and in the yeast protein Gea1 were reported to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange on the small GTP-binding protein ARF1 (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 17Meacci E. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc.

ARF proteins in the GTP-bound form promote membrane vesicle trafficking pathways by recruiting coat proteins to membranes, causing membrane budding (19Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 20Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

A potential interaction between PI 3-kinase and ARF mutants had been suggested based on characteristic changes of endosome morphology elicited by wortmannin in various cultured cell lines (12Shpetner H. Joly M. Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations provide a framework for the hypothesis that GRP1 or its homologs may mediate cellular effects of 3′-polyphosphoinositides that require ARF proteins. To map the active regions of GRP1, GST proteins fused to various domains of GRP1 were purified from lysates of bacteria expressing the relevant pGEX5X-3 constructs as described (14Klarlund J. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). For other experiments, GRP1 was cloned into pGEX-4T, and the recombinant protein was purified. The GST-GRP1 fusion protein was cleaved by incubation with 5 μg/ml thrombin in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C. Complete cleavage was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) using Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon) and stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. Recombinant baculovirus encoding ARF1, -5, or -6 (ARF cDNAs kindly provided by Dr. R. Klausner) fused at the C terminus to a 9-amino acid sequence corresponding to the major antigenic determinant of influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus, the cells were harvested 3 days later by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm, and the pellets were stored at −70 °C. A cell pellet corresponding to 50 ml of culture medium was dissolved in 1 ml of assay buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μm GDP. After clarification by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 5 min, 50 μl of a rabbit antiserum that had been produced by immunization with a peptide (YPYDVPDYA) conjugated to hemocyanin was added and incubated overnight on ice. The following day, 75 μl of Protein A conjugated to Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) was added and incubated on an end-over-end mixer for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of assay buffer. An additional 500 μl of Sepharose CL-4B was added as a carrier. Analysis of bound ARF from Sf9 cells labeled with [3H]myristic acid by Western blotting and autoradiography revealed that at least 90% of the ARF molecules was modified by the lipid (22Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For the standard assay, 5 μl of assay buffer containing GRP1, 6 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.), 0.2% cholate, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μmGTPγS, and 0.75 μCi of [35S]GTPγS was added to 5-μl beads containing immunoabsorbed ARF. Approximately 50% of the cholate molecules are incorporated into the micelles under these conditions, based on the rate of diffusion of [3H]cholate through a dialysis membrane in the presence versus absence of phospholipid micelles. 2J. K. Klarlund and M. P. Czech, unpublished observations.After 40 min at room temperature, the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of assay buffer, and 35S was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Synthetic dipalmitoyl 3′-phosphoinositides were from Matreya Inc., and bovine brain PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were from Calbiochem. Binding assays were performed as described (23Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.K. Carraway K.L. Crampton A. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. VanRenterghem B. Ravichandran K.S. Czech M.P. Burakoff S.J. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fused to the PH region of GRP1 (amino acids 239–399) was bound to glutathione immobilized on agarose beads (Sigma). Synthetic 3H-labeled dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (kindly provided by C.-S. Chen (24Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. J . Org . Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) was added, and after 1 h the beads were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The amount of [3H]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 bound to the PH domain was calculated by subtracting the amount of free 3H present in supernatants from GST-GRP1 from the amount of free 3H in supernatants from control GST. The data were fitted to the equation, [bound] = B max × [free]/(K D + [free]), by least squares curve fit. For the competition assays the beads containing the GST fusion proteins were incubated with 2.5 μm3H-labeled dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled lipids. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed with buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and counted in a scintillation counter. The percentage of [3H]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 bound was calculated based on the amount of 3H bound to the beads in the absence of competitor. The total 3H bound to the GST control was less than 0.5% of the total 3H bound to GRP1 PH domain. The data were fitted to the equation, % bound = 100 −n ×L/(K I (app) + L), where n is the percent specific binding, L is the concentration of unlabeled lipid added, andK I (app) is the apparent competitive dissociation constant. The ratios of the apparent dissociation constants accurately reflect the ratios of the true dissociation constants under the present experimental conditions (23Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.K. Carraway K.L. Crampton A. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. VanRenterghem B. Ravichandran K.S. Czech M.P. Burakoff S.J. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To test whether GRP1 functions as an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, hemagglutinin-tagged ARF1, -5, or -6 proteins produced in Sf9 cells were incubated with recombinant GRP1 protein in the presence of [35S]GTPγS for various times prior to determination of ARF-bound label. Fig. 1shows a nearly linear rate of labeled guanine nucleotide binding to these ARF proteins during this time course in the presence or absence of GRP1. A 4–10-fold stimulation of ARF1 binding to [35S]GTPγS was observed in response to GRP1, whereas no effect of GRP1 on ARF6 binding to nucleotide was detected. Up to 10 molecules of [35S]GTPγS could be bound to ARF1 per molecule of GRP1 under our experimental conditions, showing that GRP1 acts catalytically. Guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF5 was also significantly enhanced by GRP1, although to a lesser extent than that for ARF1. Fig. 1 D indicates that GRP1 maximally activates labeled nucleotide binding to ARF1 and -5 when present at 2.5 μm under the conditions of this assay. Because the Sec7 homology domains of the related protein ARNO (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) have been shown to be sufficient for catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange of ARF1, we analyzed the ARF1 exchange activity intrinsic to each of three segments of GRP1, including the Sec7 homology region (Fig. 2). GST fusion proteins of the N terminus and PH regions of GRP1 exhibited no effect on ARF1 binding to labeled nucleotide in our assay. In contrast, a GST fusion protein containing the Sec7 homology domain was as effective as the full-length GRP1 in catalyzing ARF1 exchange activity (Fig. 2). GRP1 was initially identified based on its high affinity binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 through its PH domain (14Klarlund J. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We therefore questioned whether this polyphosphoinositide might regulate the ARF exchange activity of GRP1. Fig. 2 shows that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS to ARF in a dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal stimulation was seen at approximately 1 μm PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and maximal activation was 3–4-fold. Importantly, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 had no effect on the ARF exchange activity catalyzed by the GRP1 Sec7 homology domain, previously shown not to bind the polyphosphoinositide (14Klarlund J. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The data depicted in Fig. 2 suggest the hypothesis that receptor signaling through PI 3-kinases, which generates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, might specifically regulate ARF proteins through GRP1. To further test this concept, the relative binding affinities of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 versusPtdIns(4,5)P2, which is constitutively present in cell membranes, for the PH domain of GRP1 were determined. A GST fusion protein of the PH domain of GRP1 was incubated with various concentrations of synthetic [3H]dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and binding was determined (Fig.3 A). These experiments show high affinity binding of this polyphosphoinositide, with a calculatedK d = 0.5 μm, assuming one binding site per GRP1 molecule. Fig. 3 B reveals that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 competes for [3H]dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to the PH domain of GRP1 with a K I(app) that is 10–20-fold lower than for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Comparison of the competition profiles for these two polyphosphoinositides containing identical fatty acyl side chains (dioctanoyl) showed that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 had a 50–100-fold higher affinity when compared with PtdIns(4,5)P2. PtdIns(3,4)P2 had also a 50-fold lower affinity than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig.3 B). The data depicted in Fig. 3 suggested that high specificity of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated activation of ARF exchange may characterize GRP1 function. We tested the specificity of GRP1-stimulated ARF exchange by these phosphoinositides under conditions of various charge densities in detergent-phosphatidylcholine micelles (Fig. 4). Interestingly, when a relatively high concentration of negative charge is present in the micelles (0.1% cholate), PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4)P2 all stimulated ARF1 exchange activity in the presence of GRP1. In the absence of charge (0.1% CHAPS, no cholate), none of these phosphoinositides were able to enhance the ARF exchange activity of GRP1 (Fig. 4). In contrast, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 selectively stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to ARF1 in the presence of GRP1 when a low level of negative charge (0.05% cholate) was present with the phosphatidylcholine in our assay. Under these conditions PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 had significantly less effect. These experiments establish anin vitro assay system that reveals selective regulation of GRP1-catalyzed ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Previous results (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 25Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and data in Fig. 4 suggest that guanine nucleotide exchange of ARF proteins require an interface of ARF, exchange factor, and negatively charged phospholipid, indicating that recruitment of GRP1 to the phospholipid membrane may be a key element of the regulation of ARF guanine nucleotide exchange. Thus we reasoned that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, the polar head group of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, should compete for binding and recruitment of GRP1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in micelles, thus blocking GRP1-mediated ARF1 exchange. Fig. 5 shows results that are consistent with this prediction. Addition of 100 μm Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to our assay virtually ablated the increased ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity catalyzed by GRP1 in response to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In concert with data in Fig. 4 indicating high binding specificity of the GRP1 PH domain, other polar head groups tested, including Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, and Ins(1,2,5,6)P4, failed to inhibit GRP1-mediated ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange (Fig. 5). The results presented here demonstrate the specific binding and regulation of GRP1-catalyzed ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a product of receptor-regulated PI 3-kinase activity (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). These experiments (Fig. 2) also localize ARF exchange activity to an approximately 200-residue segment of the GRP1 protein that exhibits high sequence similarity to a region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec7 protein (27Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11711-11717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRP1 was found to catalyze nucleotide exchange on ARF1 and -5 but not ARF6 (Fig.1). Interestingly, ARF5 was reported not to be a substrate for cytohesin-1 (17Meacci E. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but a detailed description of the specificities of the various isoforms of GRP1 is still lacking. The identification of GRP1 based on its binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in an expression cDNA library screen suggested a particularly high affinity for this polyphosphoinositide (14Klarlund J. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Our present results confirm this expectation, revealing aK d = 0.5 μm for binding [3H]dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2). Importantly, the PH domain of GRP1 exhibits an apparent affinity for dioctanoyl PtdIns(4,5)P2 that is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3(Fig. 2). This extraordinary specificity for the 3′-polyphosphoinositide is a distinctive characteristic of the GRP1 PH domain among the many PH domains that have been characterized for phosphoinositide binding (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this degree of specificity is consistent with that required of a protein regulated in intact cells by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling, given that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is much more abundant in cell membranes (6Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 provide strong support for the hypothesis that GRP1 functions in intact cells in conjunction with membrane-localized PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generated by receptor-activated PI 3-kinase activity. Particular attention in this study was focused on the relationship between the specificity of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to GRP1 and the specificity of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated activation of GRP1 exchange activity for ARF1 (Figs. 2 and 4). Previous work has emphasized the requirements for ARF myristoylation and phospholipid to obtain optimal nucleotide exchange rates for ARF proteins, suggesting exchange occurs at the membrane surface (26Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the case of ARNO, PtdIns(4,5)P2 was found to be sufficient for its recruitment to membranes as well as activation of ARF exchange (16Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), suggesting specificity of its PH domain for binding this phosphoinositide or a nonspecific effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2to recruit ARNO to membranes based on a charge effect, or both. All three polyphosphoinositides tested were effective in stimulating GRP1-mediated exchange activity when a high charge density was present on micelles in the assay (Fig. 4), indicating that GRP1 can be nonspecifically bound to membranes under these conditions. Selectivity of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in stimulating ARF1 nucleotide exchange by GRP1 over that observed for PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4)P2 was revealed at lower charge density (Fig.4). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that binding of GRP1 to membranes containing ARF may include two components: specific interaction with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 through its PH domain and interactions with acidic phospholipids through one or more clusters of its basic amino acid residues. At concentrations of GRP1 that yield maximal [35S]GTPγS loading of ARF1, no stimulation by PIP3 was observed, consistent with the concept that activation of GRP1 exchange activity results from recruitment to membranes (data not shown). The high activity observed for ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the GRP1 Sec7 domain suggests that ARF1 function may be closely related to the physiological role of GRP1 (Fig. 1). ARF1 has been implicated in vesicle transport related to Golgi membrane function as well as in secretory and exocytosis pathways (19Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 21Schimmoller F. Itin C. Pfeffer S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R235-R237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that several targets of receptor-activated PI 3-kinase signaling involve intracellular membrane-trafficking systems, including mast cell secretion and insulin-sensitive GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation to the plasma membrane in muscle and adipocytes (9Kasuga M.

Thus it is tempting to hypothesize a role for GRP1 in regulating such processes in response to localized synthesis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.

We report herein the expression cloning of a rat cDNA encoding a JIP-1-related nuclear protein from a pancreatic β-cell cDNA library that we named IB1 for Islet-Brain 1. IB1 was isolated by its ability to bind to GTII, a cis-regulatory element of the GLUT2 promoter. The IB1 cDNA encodes a 714-amino acid protein, which differs from JIP-1 by the insertion of 47 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein. The remaining 667 amino acids are 97% identical to JIP-1. The 47-amino acid insertion contains a truncated phosphotyrosine interaction domain and a putative helix-loop-helix motif. Recombinant IB1 (amino acids 1–714 and 280–714) was shown to bind in vitro to GTII. Functionally IB1 transactivated the GLUT2 gene. IB1 was localized within the cytoplasm and the nucleus of insulin-secreting cells or COS-7 cells transfected with an expression vector encoding IB1. Using a heterologous GAL4 system, we localized an activation domain of IB1 within the first 280 amino acids of the protein. These data demonstrate that IB1 is a DNA-binding protein related to JIP-1, which is highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells where it functions as a transactivator of the GLUT2 gene.

In an attempt to identify DNA-binding proteins necessary for proper β-cell-specific expression of genes in the endocrine pancreas, we initiated the characterization of the promoter of the GLUT2 gene. GLUT2, a facilitated glucose transporter isoform, is a membrane protein present in pancreatic β-insulin-secreting cells, the basolateral membrane of intestinal and kidney absorptive cells, in hepatocytes, and in a subset of neurons (1Thorens B.

We and others have shown that a fragment of the GLUT2 promoter displayed glucose responsiveness when transfected into differentiated insulin-producing cells or into hepatocytes (11Waeber G.

Important cis-regulatory sequences were identified within this promoter region, including functionally responsive PDX-1 and cyclic AMP-responsive elements and threecis sequences named GTI, GTII, and GTIII (13Rencurel F.

The minimal promoter region containing GTI, GTII, and GTIII is both sufficient and necessary to confer pancreatic expression to a reporter gene in vitro or in vivo in transgenic mice (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar,16Waeber G. Pedrazzini T. Bonny O. Bonny C. Steinmann M. Nicod P. Haefliger J.-A. Mol. Cell.

Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the expression cloning of a GTII-binding protein from a pancreatic β-cell cDNA library. The gene encodes a cDNA abundantly expressed in the pancreatic islets and in the brain, which was named IB-1 for Islet-Brain 1 (17.Bonny, C., Nicod, P., and Waeber, G. (1997) International Endocrine Society Meeting, June 11–14, 1997, Minneapolis, MN, Abstract OR36–3-117.Google Scholar). A GeneBank™ data base search with the IB1 cDNA revealed that IB1 is a rat homologue of the murine cytoplasmic inhibitor of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; PID, phosphotyrosine interaction domain; HLH, helix-loop-helix motif; CMV, cytomegalovirus; bp, base pair(s); aa, amino acids.-activated pathway termed JIP-1 (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). IB1 differs, however, from JIP-1 by the insertion of a 47-amino acid region in its carboxyl-terminal part. This insertion encodes a phosphotyrosine interactiondomain (PID) and a helix-loop-helix motif (HLH). Furthermore, IB1 is a cytoplasmic and nuclear DNA-binding protein, which functions as transactivator of the GLUT2 gene. An oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was generated from 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA obtained from the differentiated INS-1 insulin-secreting cell line using a cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were cloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the λZap Express expression vector (Stratagene). A total of 2 × 106colonies were screened by the procedure described by Singh et al. (19Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) using as probe concatanated GTII oligonucleotides (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). One GTII-interacting positive clone was obtained from the screening and excised. The resulting cDNA in the pBKS plasmid (pBKS-IB1) was sequenced in both 5′ and 3′ orientations. The transplantable x-ray induced rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line was kindly provided by Asfari et al. (20Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and grown as described. The mouse insulin-producing βTC3 cell line and the kidney-derived COS-7 cell line were cultured as described previously (21Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 22Takaki R. Ono J. Nakamura M. Yokogawa Y. Kumae S. Hiraoka T. Yamaguchi K. Hamaguchi K. Uchida S. In Vitro Cell & Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector encoding IB1 was constructed by inserting the IB1 cDNA in the NheI/XhoI sites of the CMV-driven plasmid PBKS (Stratagene) to generate the pCMV-IB1 vector. Polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to add a Flag epitope (Eastman Kodak Co.) in the pCMV-IB1 construct 3′ of the initiating methionine. The −338 bp of the murine GLUT2 promoter (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar) were cloned 5′ of a luciferase gene (pGL3Basic vector, Promega, Madison, WI). For the GAL4 constructs, the IB1 cDNA was introduced into the pSG147 vector, in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (aa 1–147) of this vector (23Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter construct used in the GAL4 system was obtained by linking five copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding sites (5 × GAL4 DNA-binding sites) 5′ to the minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in the pGL3-TK plasmid (Promega). All constructs were transiently transfected using the cationic reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as described previously (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured according to the protocol of Brasier et al. (24Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1121PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to the method of Dent and Latchmann (25Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 1-26Google Scholar). The SouthWestern experiments were conducted as described (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro translation experiments were performed from the pBKS-IB1 plasmid as template using the coupled transcription-translation kit (TNT) from Promega and according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of [35S]methionine. The RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis from rat tissues or cell lines were conducted exactly as described previously (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). The rat pancreatic islets were isolated by the method of Gotoh et al. (26Gotoh M. Maki T. Satomi T. Porter J. Bonner-Weir S. O'Hara C.J. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1987; 43: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Anti-IB1 antiserum was prepared using a cDNA fragment encoding the first 280 amino acids of the protein. This fragment was inserted into the His-tagged pQE-9 expression vector (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland), expressed, and purified through a Ni2+-containing column following instructions from the manufacturer. Purified material was used to elicit polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. To affinity-purify the antibodies, the Ni2+-column-purified 1–280 aa of the recombinant protein were immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the rabbit antiserum (diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated with this membrane. The membrane was then washed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and the anti-IB1 antibody was eluted by 0.2m Tris-glycine, pH 2.8, followed by neutralization at pH ∼7.5. The preimmune serum was treated in a similar fashion to provide non-immune control. The immunocytochemistry was performed essentially as described previously (16Waeber G. Pedrazzini T. Bonny O. Bonny C. Steinmann M. Nicod P. Haefliger J.-A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sections were incubated for 14 h at 4 °C with the affinity-purified preimmune or immune anti-IB1 serum (dilution 1/200). A DNA binding activity to GTII was shown to be restricted to insulin-secreting cells (INS-1 and βTC3) (14Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). A poly(dT)-primed INS-1 cDNA expression library was constructed and screened by the procedure described by Singh et al. (19Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) using a concatanated GTII oligonucleotide probe. One positive clone was isolated from a primary screen of approximately 2 × 106 phage plaques. The 2,953-bp-long insert encoded a large open reading frame of 714 amino acids and was termed IB1, for Islet-Brain 1, as its expression was primarily restricted to these two tissues, as discussed below (17.Bonny, C., Nicod, P., and Waeber, G. (1997) International Endocrine Society Meeting, June 11–14, 1997, Minneapolis, MN, Abstract OR36–3-117.Google Scholar). A GeneBank™ data base search revealed that IB1 is a rat homologue of the recently identified JIP-1 protein (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). JIP-1 is a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK-activated pathway, which was cloned from a mouse brain cDNA library using a two-hybrid system (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Amino acid and nucleic acid comparison of mouse JIP-1 and rat IB1 showed that the proteins are almost identical (97% identity) with the exception of a 47-amino acid addition in the carboxyl-terminal part of IB1. As depicted in Fig.1, this 47-amino acid insertion contains a putative helix-loop-helix domain as well as a PID. PID domains are an average length of 100–160 amino acids and consist of four conserved blocks (27Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The first block of the putative PID domain of IB1 is contained in the 47-amino acid insertion and therefore is absent from the JIP-1 protein. JIP-1 was shown to be a cytoplasmic protein that caused cytoplasmic retention of JNK and that inhibited the JNK-regulated gene expression (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). As JNK binds in the nuclei to the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2, the sequestration of JNK by JIP-1 in the cytoplasm inhibits the JNK signaling pathway. One may speculate that the insertion of the 47 amino acids in the JIP-1 protein, which creates a HLH and a PID domain, will allow protein-protein interactions, possibly with other members of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway or with transcription factors. By computer analysis using the SOPMA algorithm (Self Optimized Prediction Method of Alignments, CNRS, Lyon, France), two acidic helicoidal structures (aa 31–61 and 114–125) and a proline-rich region (aa 292–366) in the amino-terminal part of IB1 were also predicted, which could act as transactivation domains (29Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Putative nuclear localization signals were also localized at aa 163–190 and 242–270 (30Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). IB1, as JIP-1, was highly expressed in the brain and, to a lower extent, in the kidney (17.Bonny, C., Nicod, P., and Waeber, G. (1997) International Endocrine Society Meeting, June 11–14, 1997, Minneapolis, MN, Abstract OR36–3-117.Google Scholar, 18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In addition, IB1 was also abundantly expressed in several insulin-secreting cell lines (INS-1, RIN5F) as well as in freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets, but not in the liver or in RNA prepared from whole pancreas, since the pancreatic islets represent a small proportion of the organ (Fig. 2,A and B). In pancreatic islets, IB1 expression was not regulated by increasing the glucose concentration in the incubation medium from 2.8 to 30 mm (Fig. 2 B). Affinity-purified antibodies detected a 120-kDa protein in nuclear extracts prepared from βTC3 cells and in crude cellular extracts prepared from freshly isolated pancreatic islets (Fig. 2, Cand D). This 120-kDa protein comigrated with the product obtained by in vitro transcription-translation of the IB1 cDNA in the presence of [35S]methionine (data not shown). We could also detect the IB1 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts obtained from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the CMV-driven IB1 cDNA (Fig. 2 E). To gain further insight into the tissue and cellular localization of IB1 within the pancreas, immunohistochemistry studies were performed on mouse islets and βTC3 cells. Affinity-purified antibodies raised against IB1 detected this factor in the pancreatic islet as well as in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of βTC3 cells (Fig.3, A and C). To confirm the specificity of the anti-IB1 antibodies in immunocytochemistry, a construct was generated that includes a Flag epitope located NH2-terminal to the IB1 protein expressed under the control of a CMV promoter. This construct was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and the translated product was immunodetected with an anti-Flag antibody subsequently visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate staining (Fig. 3 E) or with the anti-IB1 antibody detected using an anti-rabbit Texas Red-labeled antibody (Fig. 3 F). The IB1 protein, in transfected COS-7 cells, was detected with both the anti-Flag and the anti-IB1 antibodies in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of COS-7 cells. The IB1 cDNA was cloned 3′ to a CMV promoter and transiently transfected into COS-7, a cell line that does not express endogenous IB1. Crude cellular extracts prepared from these transfected cells were then analyzed by the SouthWestern technique using the GTII probe. A 120-kDa GTII-binding protein was detected by SouthWestern (Fig. 4), and this size product was similar to the one obtained by in vitro translation of the IB1 cDNA in the presence of [35S]methionine and to the protein detected by anti-IB1 antibodies (Fig. 2). The IB1 cDNA is therefore translated into a 120-kDa product, which is able to bind the GTII probe. Constructs were then generated that include only the amino-terminal part (aa 1–280) or the COOH-terminal part (280–714) of the protein, and bacterially produced recombinant IB1 proteins were obtained from these plasmids. The 280–714-aa protein, but not the 1–280-aa protein, was able to bind to the GTII cis sequence when tested by SouthWestern analysis implying that the carboxyl end of the protein contains the DNA-binding domain of IB1 (data not shown). Transcriptional activation by IB1 was assessed by cotransfection experiments in the insulin-secreting cell line βTC3, an IB1 expression vector (pCMV-IB1), and the proximal region of the GLUT2 promoter (−338 bp) linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Overexpression of IB1 transactivated the GLUT2 promoter 1.6 (±0.1)-fold when compared with a cotransfection with the expression vector lacking the IB1 cDNA (PBKS). This effect was absent with the promoterless reporter construct (pGL3). To avoid possible interference with endogenous IB1 protein interacting with GTII and/or heterodimerization of IB1 with related factors, aa 1–268 and 1–714 of IB1 were fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The GTII-binding sites of the reporter gene were replaced with GAL4-binding sites linked to a minimal thymidine kinase-luciferase gene. As shown in Fig.5, the amino-terminal part of IB1 was sufficient to confer transactivating functions to this heterologous GAL4 system (9.0 ± 0.4 and 7.5 ± 1.2 versuscontrol with the 1–268 and 1–714 GAL4 constructs, respectively). In summary, we describe herein the expression cloning, using acis-regulatory element of the GLUT2 promoter, of a protein preferentially expressed in the brain and the insulin-secreting cells named IB1 (17.Bonny, C., Nicod, P., and Waeber, G. (1997) International Endocrine Society Meeting, June 11–14, 1997, Minneapolis, MN, Abstract OR36–3-117.Google Scholar). The rat IB1 amino acid sequence is 97% identical to the recently described murine JIP-1 cytoplasmic protein (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). JIP-1 and IB1 differ mainly by the presence of a 47-amino acid insertion in the carboxyl-terminal part of IB1, which complements a truncated HLH and PID domain (27Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). JIP-1 was cloned by its ability to bind to JNK, implying the existence of protein-protein interactions, while IB1 was isolated by its ability to bind to a cis-regulatory element of the GLUT2 promoter, implying DNA-protein interactions. This DNA binding activity was not suspected for JIP-1, and several lines of evidence suggest that indeed IB1 is a DNA-binding protein and acts as a transcriptional factor. First, IB1 was cloned based on its ability to bind to the GTII cis element. Second, the SouthWestern experiments could detect IB1 in nuclear extracts of transfected COS-7 cells with the expression vector encoding IB1. Third, immunodetectable nuclear staining was present in pancreatic islets as well as in βTC3 cells. Fourth, Western blot analysis of these cells could also detect IB1 in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Further work will be needed to identify other potential partners of the IB1/JIP-1 proteins, either other transcriptional factors or other members of the JNK signaling pathway. It remains to be elucidated whether IB1/JIP-1 plays a differential functional role in the insulin-secreting cells, in particular in the control of glucose-induced insulin secretion. We are grateful to Myriam Steinmann for excellent technical assistance and to Vincent Mooser, Phil Shaw, Bernard Thorens and Nancy Thompson for critical comments."
https://openalex.org/W2064327928,"An essential initial step in murine fertilization is the binding of acrosome-intact sperm to specificO-linked oligosaccharides on zona pellucida glycoprotein 3. While there is agreement on the primary role ofO-linked glycans in this process, there is a lack of consensus on both the terminal monosaccharide(s) required for a functional sperm binding site and the corresponding protein on the sperm cell surface that recognizes this ligand. Much current debate centers on an essential role for either a terminalN-acetylglucosaminyl or, alternatively, a terminal α-galactosyl residue. To gain insight into the terminal saccharides required to form a functional sperm-binding ligand, dose-response curves were generated for a series of related tri- and tetrasaccharides to evaluate their relative effectiveness to competitively inhibit thein vitro binding of murine sperm to zona pellucida-enclosed eggs. A GlcNAc-capped trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc,was inactive (1–72 μm range). In contrast, a β4-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1, 4GlcNAc) and an α3-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide (Galα1,3Galβ1,4 GlcNAc) inhibited sperm-zona binding with low or moderate affinity (ED50 = 42 μm and 5.3 μm, respectively). The addition of an α3-fucosyl residue to each of these two competitive inhibitors, forming Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3] GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc or Galα1,3Galβ1, 4[Fucα1,3]Glc NAc, resulted in ligands with 85- and 12-fold higher affinities for sperm, respectively (ED50 = 500 and 430 nm). Thus, the presence of a fucosyl residue appears to be obligatory for an oligosaccharide to bind sperm with high affinity. Last, mixing experiments with pairs of competitive inhibitors suggest that murine sperm-zona binding is mediated by two independent oligosaccharide-binding sites on sperm. The first (apparently high affinity) site binds both the α3-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide and the two fucosylated tetrasaccharides. The second (apparently low affinity) site binds a nonfucosylated β-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide. An essential initial step in murine fertilization is the binding of acrosome-intact sperm to specificO-linked oligosaccharides on zona pellucida glycoprotein 3. While there is agreement on the primary role ofO-linked glycans in this process, there is a lack of consensus on both the terminal monosaccharide(s) required for a functional sperm binding site and the corresponding protein on the sperm cell surface that recognizes this ligand. Much current debate centers on an essential role for either a terminalN-acetylglucosaminyl or, alternatively, a terminal α-galactosyl residue. To gain insight into the terminal saccharides required to form a functional sperm-binding ligand, dose-response curves were generated for a series of related tri- and tetrasaccharides to evaluate their relative effectiveness to competitively inhibit thein vitro binding of murine sperm to zona pellucida-enclosed eggs. A GlcNAc-capped trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc,was inactive (1–72 μm range). In contrast, a β4-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1, 4GlcNAc) and an α3-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide (Galα1,3Galβ1,4 GlcNAc) inhibited sperm-zona binding with low or moderate affinity (ED50 = 42 μm and 5.3 μm, respectively). The addition of an α3-fucosyl residue to each of these two competitive inhibitors, forming Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3] GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc or Galα1,3Galβ1, 4[Fucα1,3]Glc NAc, resulted in ligands with 85- and 12-fold higher affinities for sperm, respectively (ED50 = 500 and 430 nm). Thus, the presence of a fucosyl residue appears to be obligatory for an oligosaccharide to bind sperm with high affinity. Last, mixing experiments with pairs of competitive inhibitors suggest that murine sperm-zona binding is mediated by two independent oligosaccharide-binding sites on sperm. The first (apparently high affinity) site binds both the α3-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide and the two fucosylated tetrasaccharides. The second (apparently low affinity) site binds a nonfucosylated β-galactosyl-capped trisaccharide. The initial event in mammalian fertilization is the binding of a sperm to the zona pellucida (ZP), 1The abbreviations used are: ZP, zona pellucida; ZP3, zona pellucida glycoprotein 3; βGN-βGN-GN, GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc; βG-βGN-GN, Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc; αG-βG-GN, Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc; αG-βG-[F]-GN, Galα1,3Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAc; βG-[F]-βGN-GN, Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc; β4GT, β1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38); murine β4GT refers to the α-lactalbumin responsive, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine β4-galactosyltransferase that has been mapped to the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 4; M199M, medium 199 supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA and 30 μg/ml sodium pyruvate; WM-BSA, Whitten's medium plus 3 mg/ml BSA.1The abbreviations used are: ZP, zona pellucida; ZP3, zona pellucida glycoprotein 3; βGN-βGN-GN, GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc; βG-βGN-GN, Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc; αG-βG-GN, Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc; αG-βG-[F]-GN, Galα1,3Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAc; βG-[F]-βGN-GN, Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc; β4GT, β1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38); murine β4GT refers to the α-lactalbumin responsive, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine β4-galactosyltransferase that has been mapped to the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 4; M199M, medium 199 supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA and 30 μg/ml sodium pyruvate; WM-BSA, Whitten's medium plus 3 mg/ml BSA. the extracellular glycoprotein matrix surrounding the egg. In the mouse, capacitated, acrosome-intact sperm initially bind to zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3), one of three glycoproteins comprising the ZP (1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The sperm binding activity of ZP3 is localized to a subset of O-linked oligosaccharides on ZP3 with an estimated molecular mass of about 3.9 kDa (3Florman H.M. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 4Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While there is general agreement that the nonreducing terminal monosaccharides are critical for binding (4Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6778-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Miller D.J. Macek M.B. Shur B.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), there is a lack of agreement on the identity of the terminal monosaccharide(s) required for a functional sperm-binding ligand and the corresponding binding site(s) on the sperm surface. Two different models of murine sperm-ZP binding have been proposed that address the basic requirements for both a functional sperm-binding ligand and for the corresponding sperm surface ZP-binding protein. The first model posits that sperm surface β1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GT) binds its acceptor sugar substrate, an N-acetylglucosaminyl residue (GlcNAc), located at the nonreducing terminus of an O-linked oligosaccharide on ZP3 (5Miller D.J. Macek M.B. Shur B.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 6Lopez L.C. Bayna E.M. Litoff D. Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. Shur B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In support of this model, β4GT has been localized immunocytochemically with a polyclonal antiserum to the sperm plasma membrane that overlies the acrosome (6Lopez L.C. Bayna E.M. Litoff D. Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. Shur B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Biochemical and immunological probes that can potentially interact with cell surface β4GT block the ability of sperm to bind zona-intact eggs in vitro (6Lopez L.C. Bayna E.M. Litoff D. Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. Shur B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activity of ZP3 in a competitive sperm-ZP binding assay was reduced either by enzymatic removal or β4-galactosylation of terminal GlcNAc residues (5Miller D.J. Macek M.B. Shur B.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In conflict with this model are observations from two laboratories that independently report the generation of mice in which the β4GT gene is inactivated by homologous recombination (7Lu Q Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Asano M. Furukawa F. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The null mice survive to term, a significant percentage survive to maturity, and the males are fertile. The second model postulates that a sperm surface protein, sp56, binds nonreducing terminal α-galactosyl residues on ZP3 (4Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6778-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 9Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Renkonen O. Wassarman P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This model is supported by the observation that enzymatic removal of terminal α-galactosyl residues eliminated the inhibitory activity of ZP3 in the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay (4Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6778-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Tetraantennary, α3-galactosyl-capped oligosaccharides have also been shown to inhibit sperm-ZP binding (12Litscher E.S. Juntunen K. Seppo A Pentila L. Niemela R. Renkonen O. Wassarman P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that sp56 binds galactose residues and competitively inhibits murine sperm-zona binding in vitro (10Bookbinder L.H. Cheng A. Bleil J.D. Science. 1995; 269: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Also consistent with this model is the observation that murine α1,3-galactosyltransferase, the candidate enzyme for the addition of terminal α-galactosyl residues on O-linked oligosaccharides on ZP3, is expressed in female but not male germ cells (13Johnston D.S. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. Joziasse D.H. Wright W.W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In potential conflict with this model, however, is the observation that inactivation of the α1,3-galactosyltransferase gene by homologous recombination does not affect the fertility of female mice (14Thall A.D. Maly P. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21437-21440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent evidence indicates that sp56 is located primarily in the acrosomal contents and not on the plasma membrane (15Foster J.A. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Blobel C. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Kim K.-S. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12714-12722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been postulated, however, that dynamic pores in the plasma membrane of acrosome-intact murine sperm may allow sp56 to bind ZP3 (15Foster J.A. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Blobel C. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Kim K.-S. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12714-12722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A determination of whether either or both of these models of sperm-ZP binding are correct has been hampered by the limited amounts of oligosaccharides that can be obtained from murine ZP3 for thorough structural and functional analyses and by the potential structural complexity of these oligosaccharides. To circumvent these limitations, we have used an in vitro sperm-ZP binding assay to generate dose-response curves for a series of tri- and tetrasaccharides with different nonreducing ends that these two current models for sperm-ZP binding predict might compete for ZP-binding sites on sperm. Precedent for this approach is provided by the demonstration that tri- and tetraantennary α- and β-galactosyl-capped oligosaccharides inhibit sperm-ZP binding (12Litscher E.S. Juntunen K. Seppo A Pentila L. Niemela R. Renkonen O. Wassarman P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and by the extensive analysis of potential ligands for the family of cell surface receptors, the selectins, which mediate the binding of lymphocytes to the vascular endothelium (16Sears P. Wong C.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 12086-12093Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that a small oligosaccharide with a nonreducing terminal GlcNAc, which is a substrate for β4GT in an in vitro enzymatic assay, is not a competitive inhibitor of sperm-ZP binding. We also demonstrate that a terminal α3-galactosyl residue is not sufficient for an oligosaccharide to be a high affinity competitive inhibitor of sperm-ZP binding. Rather, an α3-fucosyl residue in the context of the LewisX trisaccharide, Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAc, is required to create a high affinity ligand for a ZP-binding site on murine sperm. Additionally, we present evidence that murine sperm-ZP binding is potentially mediated, in part, by a second, lower affinity site on sperm that preferentially binds a nonfucosylated β-galactosyl-capped oligosaccharide. GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (βGN-βGN-GN) was purchased from Sigma. Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (βG-βGN-GN) was synthesized by incubation of GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (Sigma) with purified bovine colostrum β1,4-galactosyltransferase and UDP-[14C]Gal (0.23 Ci/mol). The product was purified by sequential anion exchange and Bio-Gel P4 gel filtration chromatography and analyzed by 400-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The mass of product was determined by measuring radioactivity. Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (βG-[F]-βGN-GN) was synthesized by incubation of βG-βGN-GN with recombinant human α1,3-fucosyltransferase VI (produced in insect cells) and GDP-[3H]fucose (0.10 Ci/mol). The product was purified and analyzed as described above for βG-βGN-GN. Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc (αG-βG-GN) was synthesized by incubation of Galβ1,4GlcNAc with soluble recombinant bovine α1,3-galactosyltransferase and UDP-[14C]Gal (0.23 Ci/mol), and the product was purified and analyzed as described previously (17Joziasse D.H.

Two additional preparations of αG-βG-GN were purchased from V-Labs (Covington, LA). Galα1,3Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAc (αG-βG-[F]-GN) was synthesized by incubation of αG-βG-GN with purified human milk α1,3-fucosyltransferase and GDP-[3H]fucose (0.10 Ci/mol). The product was purified and characterized as described previously (17Joziasse D.H. Schiphorst W.E.C.M. Koeleman C.A.M. Van den Eijnden D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Products obtained from the enzyme-assisted synthesis of each oligosaccharide were identified using 400-MHz 1H NMR spectra, which were recorded on a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer (Department of Physics, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam) as described (20Hokke C.H. Zervosen A. Elling L. Joziasse D.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Eggs and sperm were collected from CD-1 mice and prepared as described by Bleil and Wassarman (1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Prior to use in the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay, sperm were capacitated by incubation for about 1 h in medium 199 supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA and 30 μg/ml sodium pyruvate (M199-M). ZP were isolated from oocytes in Whitten's medium (21Whitten W.K. Adv. Biosci. 1971; 6: 129-139Google Scholar) plus 3 mg/ml BSA (WM-BSA) and acid-solubilized as described by Bleil and Wassarman (2Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Two-cell embryos were obtained by culturing fertilized eggs from mated females for 18 h in WM-BSA. Micropipettes were fire-pulled from 4-mm internal diameter borosilicate glass tubing. A bore diameter of 228 μm was obtained by inserting a 0.009-inch diameter piano wire (Small Parts Inc.) down the pipette until it stopped; a flat break was made at that point. Pipettes having a tapered length of 3–4 cm were fire-polished, and the bore diameter was remeasured to ensure that the bore diameters were not reduced. This assay was performed essentially as described (1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Briefly, the test oligosaccharide was incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 for 30 min with 30,000 sperm in a total volume of 25 μl of M199-M under oil, and then at least 10 eggs and three two-cell embryos were added in 5 μl of medium. Sperm, eggs, and embryos were incubated for an additional 15 min. Published results demonstrate that the sperm that bind zona-enclosed eggs during this 15-min incubation do not undergo the acrosome reaction (22Florman H.M. Storey B.T. Dev. Biol. 1982; 91: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Sperm-egg and sperm-embryo complexes were then serially transferred through 40-μl drops of media until 2–5 sperm remained bound to the embryos. For each experiment, the cultures were pipetted an equal number of times with the same pipette. Cells were immediately fixed with an equal volume of 1.0% formaldehyde, 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in HEPES (pH 7.4) saline, transferred to a glass slide, and examined by phase contrast microscopy. Bound sperm were enumerated using (× 40; N.A. = 0.70) phase contrast objective. Sperm on the ZP overlying the upper 40% of an egg or a two-cell embryo were counted as the focal plane was moved down through the egg or embryo. This region of the ZP was examined because all sperm on this but not on lower regions could be counted rapidly and accurately. The number of bound sperm/egg was defined by subtracting the average number of sperm remaining on the embryos from the average number of sperm on the eggs. The accuracy of this method of counting sperm on eggs or embryos was verified by two methods. First, for a subset of samples, the number of sperm on the total surface of the ZP surrounding eggs and embryos was also determined. These numbers were consistently 2.5 times greater than when sperm on the upper 40% of the zona were enumerated. Second, selected samples were recounted independently by a second investigator, and similar results were obtained. In the experiments described, 69 ± 6 (mean ± S.E.) sperm bound to the entire surface of the eggs in the absence of any added competitor. Data are expressed as percentage of inhibition of sperm-ZP binding, where numbers of bound sperm in the absence of competitor equaled 0% inhibition. This study identifies small oligosaccharides of defined structure that inhibit the in vitro binding of acrosome intact sperm to the zona pellucida and correlates the structures of these oligosaccharides with their biological activities in the competitive sperm-zona binding assay. Since the primary receptor of murine spermatozoa for the ZP resides on the plasma membrane overlying the acrosome (1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), a prerequisite for this analysis is that the test oligosaccharides themselves do not cause the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction and, thus, lose their cell surface receptors for the ZP. To verify that the oligosaccharides do not trigger the acrosome reaction, 1 × 105 capacitated sperm were incubated for 45 min in a total volume of 50 μl of medium supplemented with 18 μm oligosaccharide or 10 μm concentration of the calcium ionophore (A23187), the positive control for this procedure. Sperm used as negative controls were incubated in medium to which was added the 2.8 μl of vehicle (water: 2 × M199M; 1:1). Sperm were incubated for 45 min with or without oligosaccharides, because in the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay, sperm were incubated with oligosaccharide competitors for a total duration of 45 min. Following the incubation, sperm were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and acrosomes were stained with 1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. A minimum of 200 sperm/sample were analyzed as acrosome-intact or as acrosome-reacted and data were expressed as percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm. To compare the abilities of oligosaccharides to inhibit sperm-ZP binding, each oligosaccharide was titrated against sperm and eggs in the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay. Depending on the oligosaccharide, the concentrations tested ranged from 0.25 to 144 μm. The ED50 and maximal percentage of inhibition for each oligosaccharide were calculated from the corresponding dose-response curve (see “Analysis of Data”). The ED50 is defined as the concentration of an oligosaccharide producing half-maximal inhibition of sperm-ZP binding. Results from the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay are described by the probabilistic model of cell binding of Cozen-Roberts et al. (23Cozen-Roberts C. Lauffenburger O.A. Quinn J.A. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 841-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This model predicts that the probability that a sperm will bind a ZP-enclosed egg is a function of the incubation time of sperm with eggs, the number of unoccupied receptors on the sperm, and the rates of association and dissociation of sperm surface binding sites from specific ligands. In addition, this model predicts that saturation of this receptor with the appropriate free oligosaccharide will inhibit sperm-ZP binding by 100% if a single sperm surface receptor mediates this binding. However, if sperm-ZP binding is mediated by multiple zona-binding sites, each binding a different oligosaccharide, saturation of one of these receptors will reduce sperm-ZP binding by less than 100%. Three experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that different oligosaccharides bind independent ZP-binding sites on sperm. Each experiment consisted of four experimental groups. Sperm were incubated in a saturating concentration of either αG-βG-GN or αG-βG-[F]-GN. The saturating concentration was defined in the dose-response studies as the concentration above which there was no significant increase in percentage of inhibition. Sperm were preincubated in twice the concentration of αG-βG-GN or αG-βG-[F]-GN used in group 1. We anticipated that there would be no significant difference in the results obtained between groups 1 and 2, confirming that for a particular experiment, the concentration of oligosaccharide used in group 1 was at apparent saturation. Sperm were preincubated in a saturating concentration of αG-βG-[F]-GN or a concentration of βG-βGN-GN calculated from the competitive sperm-zona binding assay to reduce sperm-ZP binding by 50%. Sperm were preincubated with the saturating concentration of the oligosaccharide used in group 1 plus the concentration of the second oligosaccharide used in group 3. Last, to establish the numbers of sperm/egg at 0% inhibition, sperm were preincubated in the absence of any oligosaccharide. Two oligosaccharides were defined as binding independent sites on sperm if the percentage of inhibition with the oligosaccharide pair was greater than the percentage of inhibition with each oligosaccharide alone. Dose response curves for individual oligosaccharides in the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay were fit to a rectangular hyperbola, and regression analysis was performed using the program Sigma Plot; the ED50 and percentage of maximal inhibition were calculated from this regression analysis. The ED50 values provided a measure of the relative inhibitory activities of the oligosaccharides in the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the effects of incubating sperm with one or two different oligosaccharides. The latter analysis was conducted using the statistical package, SAS.

Open table in a new tab The presence of the terminal β4-linked Gal residue in βG-βGN-GN is confirmed in the 1H NMR spectrum by the Gal H-1 and H-4 signals at δ 4.468 and δ 3.925, respectively. These values are comparable with those of the Gal residue in the Galβ1,4GlcNAc element (17Joziasse D.H. Schiphorst W.E.C.M. Koeleman C.A.M. Van den Eijnden D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the 1H NMR spectrum of βG-[F]-βGN-GN, the presence of the α3-linked Fuc residue is reflected in the Fuc H-1, H-5, and CH3 structural reporter group signals, which have similar values as those of the Fuc residue in αG-βG-[F]-GN (see Table I). In addition, the α3-linkage of the Fuc residue to the internal GlcNAc-2 is deduced from the upfield shifts of the GlcNAc-2 NAc (Δδ −0.011) and βGal H-1 (Δδ −0.022) signals compared with βG-βGN-GN. Similar upfield shifts are observed when comparing the same signals in αG-βG-GN and αG-βG-[F]-GN. Initially, we validated the competitive sperm-ZP binding assay using acid-solubilized total ZP as the competitor. Preincubation of sperm with one, two, or four solubilized ZP/μl for 30 min inhibited sperm-ZP binding in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). In agreement with Bleil and Wassarman (1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), four ZP/μl inhibited sperm-ZP binding by approximately 90% relative to the negative control in which no solubilized ZP was added. By this criterion, results from our assay are comparable with those from other laboratories. Second, we established in blind trials that incubation of sperm under these assay conditions with a 9 or 72 μmconcentration of each oligosaccharide did not alter either sperm motility or viability. Third, we determined in 33 independent experiments that three different preparations of αG-βG-GN, at 9 μm, reproducibly inhibited 50–60% of sperm-ZP binding. In three additional experiments where the positive control fell outside this range, the data were excluded from the statistical analysis. The data for the positive control are shown as the bar graph to the right of the dose-response curves in Fig.1. Finally, it was demonstrated that incubation of capacitated sperm for 45 min with a 18 μmconcentration of each oligosaccharide did not cause the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction (Table II). In contrast, this concentration of βG-βGN-GN, αG-βG-GN, αG-βG-[F]-GN, and βG-[F]-βGN-GN inhibited sperm-ZP binding (see Fig. 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the competitive sperm-zona binding assay measures the abilities of specific oligosaccharides to inhibit the binding of acrosome-intact murine spermatozoa to the zona pellucida.Table IIThe oligosaccharides tested do not cause murine spermozoa to undergo the acrosome reactionTest substanceAcrosome-reacted sperm (mean ± S.E.)%GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc14.6 ± 2.2Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc11.6 ± 2.7Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc10.5 ± 2.8Galα1,3Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAc12.9 ± 4.3Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc15.1 ± 5.9Vehicle"

Wild type rat BDS1 hepatoma cells as well as as4 hepatoma cells, which express antisense sequences to C/EBPα and ablate its protein production, were utilized to investigate the role of this transcription factor in the glucocorticoid regulation of p21 gene expression. The stimulation of p21 protein levels and promoter activity, as well as inhibition of CDK2-mediated retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, required the expression of C/EBPα. Overexpression of C/EBPα in as4 cells rescued the dexamethasone responsiveness of the p21 promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of the p21 promoter revealed that dexamethasone stimulation of p21 promoter activity required the C/EBP consensus DNA-binding site. Furthermore, in glucocorticoid receptor-defective EDR1 hepatoma cells, dexamethasone failed to stimulate C/EBPα and p21 protein expression and promoter activities.

Treatment with glucocorticoids, one class of steroid hormones, can inhibit both the in vivo and in vitro growth of many different types of normal and transformed cells. Normal hepatocytes and certain hepatoma cell lines are acutely sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of glucocorticoids (1Cook P.W. Weintraub W.H. Swanson K.T. Machen T.E. Firestone G.L. J.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids induce an early G1 block in cell cycle progression suggesting the existence of a unique hormone-regulated G1 restriction point in these transformed cells. Furthermore, the loss of G1 cell cycle control has been implicated in the uncontrolled proliferation of a variety of neoplastically transformed cells (13Cross M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 14Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar). Given that steroid receptors are transcriptional regulators (15Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this G1 cell cycle arrest is likely to be controlled in part by a glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional cascade in which the glucocorticoid receptor directly alters the transcription of a small subset of genes which then regulate the subsequent expression and/or activity of specific sets of downstream proteins. Important final targets of this glucocorticoid growth suppression pathway are likely to be G1-acting components of the cell cycle which define a critical checkpoint in cell cycle progression. However, the molecular basis for the functional relationship between the glucocorticoid control of early events within this signaling cascade and the final cell cycle arrest of hepatoma cells is poorly understood.To investigate the cellular signaling pathways mediating the glucocorticoid growth arrest of epithelial cells, we have isolated glucocorticoid growth suppressible and non-suppressible hepatoma cell proliferation variants derived from the rat Reuber hepatoma (2Cook P.W. Swanson K.T. Edwards C.P. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Peterson J.A. Weiss M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Characterization of these hepatoma cell variants revealed that the anti-proliferative effect of glucocorticoids is a receptor-dependent process that does not affect cell viability, decrease total cell number, or induce an apoptotic response (3Goya L. Edwards C.P. Glennemeier K.A. Firestone G.L. Cancer Lett. 1991; 58: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 4Sanchez I. Goya L. Vallerga A.K. Firestone G.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, glucocorticoids induce an early G1 block in cell cycle progression within one cell doubling time in BDS1 hepatoma cells (4Sanchez I. Goya L. Vallerga A.K. Firestone G.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar). By using this cell system, we have defined some of the earliest transcriptional events associated with the G1arrest of the tumor cell line. Most significantly, the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBPα, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); vc, vector control.1The abbreviations used are: C/EBPα, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); vc, vector control. gene expression is specifically required for the glucocorticoid-mediated G1cell cycle arrest of hepatoma cells. Ablation of C/EBPα protein by expression of antisense sequences precluded glucocorticoids from inducing the G1 cell cycle arrest and overexpression of C/EBPα suppressed hepatoma cell growth in the absence of glucocorticoids (11Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the well established role of the C/EBP family of transcription factors in normal liver function (21Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Diehl A.M. Michaelson P. Yang S.Q. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1625-1637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the glucocorticoid stimulation of C/EBPα gene expression is a rapid response that represents an early and crucial intermediate in the glucocorticoid-stimulated anti-proliferative cascade that governs the cell cycle of liver-derived epithelial tumor cells (11Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).G1-acting cell cycle components may be important downstream targets of the glucocorticoid growth suppression pathway in rat hepatoma cells. For example, C/EBPα, or other steroid responsive transcriptional regulators, may inhibit the transcription of components necessary for cell cycle progression, such as the cyclins or cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), or stimulate expression of cell cycle inhibitors that inactivate specific CDKs (23Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the preceding accompanying paper (57Cha H.H. Cram E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we established that glucocorticoids stimulate p21 waf1/cip1 promoter activity through multiple elements within a glucocorticoid responsive region of promoter. One of the glucocorticoid responsive fragments contains a canonical C/EBP DNA-binding site. Because C/EBPα expression is required for glucocorticoids to induce a G1 cell cycle arrest of hepatoma cells (11Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined if C/EBPα expression is linked to the glucocorticoid stimulation of p21 promoter activity. In this study, by using glucocorticoid responsive rat hepatoma cells in which we ablated C/EBPα expression with antisense sequences for this transcription factor, as4 cells (11Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a glucocorticoid-resistant hepatoma cell line, EDR1 (2Cook P.W. Swanson K.T. Edwards C.P. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the glucocorticoid stimulation of p21 promoter activity and induction of protein levels required the regulated expression of the C/EBPα transcription factor.DISCUSSIONAn intricate network of growth inhibitory and stimulatory signals transduced from the extracellular environment converge on specific sets of cell cycle components which, through their concerted action, either drive cells through critical cell cycle transitions or inhibit cell cycle progression (28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar, 29Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin.

Our results have established that the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated signaling pathway induces a G1 cell cycle arrest of rat hepatoma cells (4Sanchez I. Goya L. Vallerga A.K. Firestone G.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar) with the coordinate transcriptional control of the p21 CDK inhibitor gene. We propose that glucocorticoid receptors activate two distinct types of transcriptional cascades that together target and activate the p21 gene promoter (Fig. 6). In one branch of this pathway, the glucocorticoid receptor is proposed to target the p21 promoter through receptor-transcription factor interactions involving pre-existing promoter-bound proteins. This feature of the pathway is based on the ability of dexamethasone to stimulate p21 transcript expression in the absence of ongoing de novo protein synthesis and on the existence of at least three distinct glucocorticoid responsive subregions of the p21 promoter that contain DNA recognition sequences for members of transcription factor families known to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor (see preceding accompanying paper (57Cha H.H. Cram E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). The p21 promoter does not contain a canonical glucocorticoid response element, suggesting that the glucocorticoid receptor does not act through direct DNA binding (16Wahli W. Martinez E. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr.

Consistent with our results, it is well established that protein-protein interactions of steroid receptors with other transcription factors and accessory factors can effectively regulate gene transcription in the absence of DNA-binding sites for the receptor (15Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 17Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar).We hypothesize that there is a second branch of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway in which the promoter of the p21 CDK inhibitor gene is a direct downstream target of the glucocorticoid responsive C/EBPα transcription factor (Fig. 6). The proposed requirement for the C/EBPα transcription factor in this pathway is based on our observation that antisense ablation of C/EBPα production in as4 hepatoma cells abolished the glucocorticoid stimulation of p21 promoter activity. Moreover, mutation of the C/EBP DNA-binding site eliminated glucocorticoid responsiveness in wild type hepatoma cells, and ectopic expression of C/EBPα rescued the defective glucocorticoid stimulation of p21 promoter activity in as4 hepatoma cells. Although the antisense C/EBPα expressing as4 cells have functional glucocorticoid receptors (11Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dexamethasone was unable to induce p21 promoter activity. This suggests that the glucocorticoid receptor alone is not sufficient to activate the p21 promoter and functionally requires C/EBPα or an additional factor which interacts with C/EBPα. The ability of dexamethasone to induce p21 transcripts in the presence of cycloheximide likely reflects biological redundancy between the two branches of the cellular cascade that target the glucocorticoid responsive region of the p21 gene promoter. The precise interactions between C/EBPα, p21 promoter elements, and promoter bound proteins may be complex because C/EBP family members contain a leucine zipper domain and can selectively interact with a variety of other transcription factors including the glucocorticoid receptor and members of the Ets transcription factor family (20Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, specific transcriptional regulators of the p21 promoter may be utilized by both branches of the glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional cascade, although the molecular details of this signaling mechanism have not been explored.The transcriptional effects of steroid receptors on specific target genes can be enhanced, reduced, or inhibited depending on the availability of other transcription factors and accessory factors that target the promoter (15Horwitz K.B.

We propose that C/EBPα represents a tissue-specific factor that is involved in the glucocorticoid regulation of p21 promoter activity and that its use as a transcriptional regulator of the cell cycle is restricted to a subset of cell types. Consistent with this possibility, our preliminary evidence has shown that different regions of the p21 promoter are glucocorticoid responsive in growth-arrested mammary tumor cells compared with the hepatoma cells.2 In liver-derived cells, C/EBPα plays a unique role in the glucocorticoid-induced cell cycle arrest, whereas in other growth suppressible cells (9Peterson J.A.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as mammary cells, osteosarcoma cells, fibroblasts, and lymphoid-derived cells, glucocorticoid receptors may induce the expression or interact with other tissue-specific transcription factors to affect cell cycle control.The activities of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which drive progression through the cell cycle, are regulated in part by the formation of protein complexes with appropriate cyclin and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor binding partners (30Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). A key consequence of the glucocorticoid growth arrest pathway in hepatoma cells is an elevation in the level of p21, which inhibits the ability of the G1-acting CDKs to phosphorylate the Rb protein, and thereby helps induce the G1 cell cycle arrest. Of the two families of CDK inhibitors, the p21 family (p21, p27, and p57) forms complexes with a wider range of cyclins and CDKs (42Toyoshima H. Hunter T.

The expression of p21 appears to be important in normal liver development because the targeted expression of this gene in hepatocytes of transgenic mice resulted in an aberrant organization of liver tissue, a decreased number of adult hepatocytes, reduced liver growth, and the failure of partial hepatectomy to stimulate liver cell proliferation (44Wu H. Wade M. Krall L. Grisham J. Xiong Y. Van D.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in C/EBPα also have defects in the control of hepatic growth, as well as lung development (45Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have observed that glucocorticoids induce both C/EBPα and p21 protein production in normal liver, suggesting a shared in vivo mechanism of regulation. Thus, consistent with our observations in rat hepatoma cells, which demonstrate a direct functional connection between C/EBPα and expression of p21, these in vivo studies suggest a potential mechanistic link between C/EBPα and p21 in the growth and development of normal liver tissue.Only a few studies have directly assessed the regulation of p21 promoter activity and the function of the many potential transcription factor binding sites in the p21 promoter (46Prowse D.M.

For example, both vitamin D3 and retinoic acid, which act through members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family, directly stimulate p21 transcription through their cognate DNA-binding sites in the p21 gene promoter (52Li X.S.

Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Our results have established that the p21 promoter is regulated by glucocorticoids through two distinct transcriptional mechanisms, one of which utilizes the regulated expression of C/EBPα to induce a G1 block in cell cycle progression of liver epithelial tumor cells (11Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because C/EBPα plays a key role in normal liver and adipocyte function (45Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the glucocorticoid-regulated production of p21 may play a key role in the differentiated functions of normal and transformed cells. We are currently attempting to identify other targets of C/EBPα that may complement the function of glucocorticoid responsive cell cycle components such as p21, thereby mediating or maintaining the growth-arrested and differentiated state of hepatic-derived tissue. Treatment with glucocorticoids, one class of steroid hormones, can inhibit both the in vivo and in vitro growth of many different types of normal and transformed cells. Normal hepatocytes and certain hepatoma cell lines are acutely sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of glucocorticoids (1Cook P.W. Weintraub W.H. Swanson K.T. Machen T.E. Firestone G.L. J.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids induce an early G1 block in cell cycle progression suggesting the existence of a unique hormone-regulated G1 restriction point in these transformed cells. Furthermore, the loss of G1 cell cycle control has been implicated in the uncontrolled proliferation of a variety of neoplastically transformed cells (13Cross M. Dexter T.M.

Important final targets of this glucocorticoid growth suppression pathway are likely to be G1-acting components of the cell cycle which define a critical checkpoint in cell cycle progression. However, the molecular basis for the functional relationship between the glucocorticoid control of early events within this signaling cascade and the final cell cycle arrest of hepatoma cells is poorly understood. To investigate the cellular signaling pathways mediating the glucocorticoid growth arrest of epithelial cells, we have isolated glucocorticoid growth suppressible and non-suppressible hepatoma cell proliferation variants derived from the rat Reuber hepatoma (2Cook P.W.

One possibility is that upon binding of Ku to a suitable DNA end, DNA-PKcs is recruited to form the active kinase, which may then phosphorylate itself and/or other molecules that are required for DNA end rejoining. Alternatively, the DNA-PK complex may act as a scaffold to which other proteins required for DNA repair may be recruited. In addition to its role in DNA repair, DNA-PK may also play a role in the regulation of transcription by both RNA polymerases I and II (14Kuhn A. Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Grummt I.

To determine the role of DNA-PK in these processes, it is essential to understand how the kinase interacts both with DNA and with other protein partners. The interaction of Ku with ends of DNA has been extensively studied. Ku binds with high affinity to free ends of double-stranded DNA (18Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction of Ku with DNA ends have relied in large part on the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Using this assay, Ku forms multiple protein-DNA complexes, the number of which depends on the length of the DNA and the amount of Ku protein (19Stuiver M.H. Coenjaerts F.E.J. van der Vliet P.C. J.

Several observations suggest that the interaction between DNA-PKcs and Ku in the absence of DNA is transient or weak. For example, the DNA-PKcs monomer and the Ku dimer purify separately during chromatography under mild nondenaturing conditions (9Carter T. Vančurová I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell.

Two hybrid screens using either Ku70 or Ku80 as bait have identified the corresponding Ku partner but not DNA-PKcs (29Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Other, similar studies have revealed that the product of the vavproto-oncogene interacts with Ku (30Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); however, the significance of this observation is not known. Here we used an EMSA to show that the interaction of highly purified DNA-PKcs with Ku and DNA is weak or transient and that several polypeptides that partially copurify with DNA-PKcs can stabilize complex formation among DNA-PKcs, Ku, and DNA. Five polypeptides have been identified by protein sequence analysis and/or Western blot as NF45 and NF90, which are the 45- and 90-kDa subunits of a protein previously shown to bind specifically to the interleukin 2 promoter in activated T cells (31Corthesy B.

We provide evidence that NF90 and NF45 interact with DNA-PK in vitro and that NF90, NF45, and the β subunit of eIF-2 are phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro. Our data suggest that NF90 and NF45 interact with DNA-PKcs and Ku to form a supercomplex at the ends of DNA and that this interaction may be important for the function of DNA-PK. Conditions for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were similar to those of Blieret al. (22Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The plasmid vector pGEM 7Zf+ (Promega) was propagated in JM109 and harvested and purified using Qiagen columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA probes of 40, 80, and 102 bp were generated by digestion of plasmid DNA with HaeIII. Oligonucleotides were separated using MonoQ 5/5HR chromatography using a linear gradient of 0.61–0.79 m NaCl in 20 mmTris-HCl (0.15 ml/min, 0.5 mm NaCl/min) for 360 min according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pharmacia FPLC Application File: Restriction DNA Fragments) and purified using a MERmaid DNA purification kit (Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, CA). Also, oligonucleotides corresponding to the 40-bp HaeIII fragments were synthesized and gel purified by the DNA sequence facility, University of Calgary. The sequence of the 40-bp oligonucleotide used was 5′-CCCAATTCGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAATTCACTGG-3′. Synthesized oligonucleotides were combined in equimolar amounts in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA), pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, heated to 95 °C for 10 min and annealed overnight at room temperature. Oligonucleotides were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Easy-tide, NEN Life Science Products) using polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed using Microspin-G50 columns (Pharmacia) or Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon) using TE, pH 8.0, as buffer. DNA binding reactions usually contained purified Ku (5–10 ng) and/or purified DNA-PKcs (15–30 ng) in a buffer consisting of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. Radiolabeled DNA probe (generally about 15 fmol;i.e. 0.3 ng of DNA, 40,000 dpm) was added, and reactions (final volume, 20 μl) were incubated for 10 min at RT. Samples were next subjected to electrophoresis directly or, where indicated, purified protein fractions or chemical cross-linkers were added and samples were incubated for a further 5 min at RT prior to electrophoresis. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce), is a water-soluble cross-linker of spacer length 11.4 Å. BS3 is not cleaved by reducing agents. BS3 was added to 1.2 mm (as per the manufacturer's recommendation of a final concentration of 0.2–5 mm) after preincubation of proteins and DNA. Glutaraldehyde (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; 25% solution, electron microscopy grade) was freshly diluted in water to 2.5% and then added to binding reactions containing protein and DNA probe to a final concentration of 0.06% (v/v). No loading dyes were added to samples prior to electrophoresis. Samples were analyzed on nondenaturing gels (3.9% acrylamide: 0.1% bisacrylamide) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.382 m glycine, pH 8.0, buffer. Gels were prerun for 1 h at 200 V immediately prior to loading, and samples were analyzed after electrophoresis for a further 2 h at 200 V. Gels were dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. In early experiments, EDTA was added to 1 mm in binding reactions and 0.5 mm in gels and running buffer; however, presence or absence of EDTA had no effect on the formation and migration of gel shift complexes. For EMSA experiments using antibodies, total IgG was purified from rabbit preimmune or immune sera as described (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310-311Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent assay as described previously (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were incubated with DNA-PKcs, Ku, and DNA as described, followed by addition of purified IgG. Incubations were continued for a further 15 min at RT prior to electrophoresis as described above. DNA-PKcs and Ku were purified from human placenta over three ion exchange resins followed by chromatography on dsDNA-cellulose as described previously (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using this methodology, DNA-PKcs and Ku fractionated into two pools, referred to as pool A and pool B, respectively (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pool A contained six other predominant polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 90, 75, 52, 50, 45, and 37 kDa. Polypeptides in pool A were further chromatographed on MonoQ FPLC (Pharmacia) in pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.2 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Tween-20 (v/v), and KCl. Proteins were applied to the column in 0.1 m KCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m KCl at 4 mmKCl/min. DNA-PKcs eluted from MonoQ FPLC at approximately 150–200 mm KCl and was further purified over MonoS FPLC as described (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a phenyl superose HR5/5 FPLC column (Pharmacia). DNA-PKcs was applied to the phenyl superose column in Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mNH4SO4, 1 mm DTT) and eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer A to Buffer B (containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) at 0.7% Buffer B/min. The peak of DNA-PKcs protein eluted at approximately 680 mm ammonium sulfate and was homogeneous when analyzed by silver staining of SDS gels. The 90-, 75-, 52-, 50-, 45-, and 37-kDa polypeptides eluted from MonoQ FPLC at approximately 250–300 mm KCl and were combined to form pool C (see Fig. 2). Pool C was dialyzed and applied to MonoS FPLC under exactly the same buffers and conditions as described above for MonoQ chromatography. The 90-, 75-, 52-, 50-, 45-, and 37-kDa polypeptides eluted from MonoS FPLC as a broad peak at approximately 200–300 mm KCl (see Fig. 3). Fractions containing these polypeptides were either used alone or combined as indicated. Ku was purified as described previously (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, concentrated using Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C unless otherwise indicated. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. FPLC steps were performed at either RT or 4 °C with no detectable difference in results. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin were present at 0.2 mm, 10 μg/ml, and 10 μg/ml, respectively, in all buffers and samples up to DEAE. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm) was present in buffers up to and including the FPLC steps.Figure 3SDS-PAGE of fractions from MonoS FPLC. Pool C (from Fig. 2) was dialyzed and applied to MonoS FPLC as described under “Materials and Methods,” and fractions eluting between approximately 110 and 350 mm KCl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. A silver-stained gel representing 5 μl of fractions from 34 to 74 is shown. The positions of molecular mass markers (in kDa) is shown on the left. Approximate molecular masses of the prominent polypeptides are indicated on the right. The poorly resolved 50- and 52-kDa polypeptides indicated by p50/52 are partially separated in fractions 48–52.

Antibodies to DNA-PKcs, NF45, NF90, SV40 TAg, or preimmune serum were added as indicated, and immunoprecipitations were carried out under nondenaturing conditions as described (27Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310-311Google Scholar) except that protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was used. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blot as described. SDS gels and Western blot for analysis of DNA-PKcs were as described (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) except that transfer buffer contained 20% methanol. For all other polypeptides, electrophoretic transfer for Western blot was in 25 mmTris, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol at 100 V for 35 min. Blots were developed was using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DPK1 serum was as described (34Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M.W. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Antisera to NF90 and NF45 were as described (32Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera to eIF-2β and γ were a generous gift from Dr J. Hershey (University of California, Davis). Approximately 10 μg of each of the polypeptides eluting from MonoS FPLC corresponding to fractions 44–64 (see above and Fig. 3) was run on an SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel that had been pre-aged for 24 h and analyzed by electrophoresis under normal conditions. Polypeptides were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad; sequencing grade, 0.2 μm) in 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol (v/v), pH 11; as described (36Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptides were visualized briefly in freshly prepared Coomassie Blue stain and briefly destained in 50% (v/v) methanol 0.05% (v/v) acetic acid. The appropriate bands were excised and sent for protein sequence analysis to either the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI) (p50/52 and p37) or the University of Victoria Sequencing Center (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) (p75 and p45). Phosphorylation reactions were as described previously (27Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). 0.5–1 μg of purified protein was incubated in the presence or absence of purified DNA-PKcs, Ku, and DNA as indicated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Expression and purification of recombinant His-tagged NF90 (rNF90) and NF45 (rNF45) in bacteria was as described previously (32Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, proteins were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested using standard methodologies. As found previously (32Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both rNF45 and rNF90 were insoluble and were resolubilized from the inclusion bodies in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Resolubilized proteins in 8 m urea were diluted with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. The chelation column was washed with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole, and rNF90 and rNF45 were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm imidazole. Purity was estimated at >95% by Coomassie Blue staining. Purified proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The interaction of Ku with DNA has long been studied using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (18Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stuiver M.H. Coenjaerts F.E.J. van der Vliet P.C. J. Exp.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, relatively little is known regarding the interaction of DNA-PKcs with the Ku-DNA complex. Here we describe an EMSA that can be used to detect complexes between highly purified DNA-PKcs, Ku, and DNA. EMSAs were usually carried out using a 40-bp ds deoxyoligonucleotide probe that was either purified afterHaeIII digestion of pGem plasmid DNA or was synthesized chemically and annealed prior to labeling with [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Materials and Methods.” The sequence of this oligonucleotide has no known specific binding sites and therefore is used as a source of free (blunt) dsDNA ends. Under the conditions used in our assay, the purified Ku heterodimer forms two complexes with the 40-bp DNA probe (labeleda and b in Fig. 1,lane 2). Similar protein-DNA complexes have been observed in many previous studies and have been interpreted as being due either to Ku binding to both ends and internal sequences of DNA or to the formation of Ku multimers on the DNA (18Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stuiver M.H. Coenjaerts F.E.J. van der Vliet P.C. J. Exp.

We next used this assay to examine the interaction of highly purified DNA-PKcs with Ku and DNA. The stoichiometry of the interaction between Ku and DNA-PKcs is not known; however, roughly equal amounts of DNA-PKcs monomer (470 kDa) and Ku heterodimer (156 kDa) are required for maximum catalytic activity (11Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16684-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For our studies, we therefore used amounts of purified DNA-PKcs and Ku that gave molar ratios of approximately 1. In the presence of a 1.3-fold molar excess of DNA-PKcs to Ku, the predominant bands seen on EMSA migrated in the same position as the bands formed with Ku alone (Fig. 1, lanes 4–7); however, a faint band of slower mobility was often observed (labeledC in Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). Addition of a 2.5-fold molar excess of DNA-PKcs did not result in increased formation of band C under these conditions (data not shown). Variation of the salt concentration between 50 and 150 mm and inclusion of up to 10 mm DTT in the binding reaction had little or no effect on the formation of complex C under these conditions. Addition of magnesium chloride at 1–5 mm had no significant effect on complex formation (data not shown). At least five different preparations of highly purified DNA-PKcs and Ku were used for EMSA reactions, and in no case was a strong band observed at position C. We therefore explored the possibility that protein cross-linking agents might enhance the formation of a DNA-PKcs-Ku-DNA complex. Recent studies using EMSA to analyze complexes formed between p53 and its cognate DNA binding sequence have used low concentrations of glutaraldehyde to stabilize the protein-DNA complex (37Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used by Tegtmeyer and colleagues (37Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), protein cross-linking was specific for p53 and DNA. We therefore investigated the use of glutaraldehyde on the formation of the DNA-PKcs-Ku-DNA complex. Purified DNA-P"

In these cells, dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, stimulated a rapid and selective increase in expression of the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor mRNA and protein and virtually abolished CDK2 phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Expression of the p27 CDK inhibitor, and other G1-acting cell cycle proteins, remained unaffected. Dexamethasone stimulated p21 promoter activity in a p53-independent manner that required functional glucocorticoid receptors. Transforming growth factor-β, which also induced a G1 cell cycle arrest of the hepatoma cells, failed to elicit this response. Analysis of 5′ deletions of the p21 promoter uncovered a glucocorticoid responsive region between nucleotides −1481 and −1184, which does not contain a canonical glucocorticoid response element but which can confer dexamethasone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Fine mapping of this region uncovered three distinct 50–60-base pair transcriptional elements that likely function as targets of glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Finally, ectopic expression of p21 had no effect on hepatoma cell growth in the absence of glucocorticoids but facilitated the ability of dexamethasone to inhibit cell proliferation. Thus, our results have established a direct transcriptional link between glucocorticoid receptor signaling and the regulated promoter activity of a CDK inhibitor gene that is involved in the cell cycle arrest of hepatoma cells.

As a result of these interactions, glucocorticoids can either inhibit or stimulate the in vivo and in vitro growth of many types of normal and transformed cells.

However, the functional connection between the steroid-regulated transcriptional events and the cell cycle arrest of hepatic-derived cells is poorly understood at a molecular level.

Several of the CDK inhibitors are targets of signaling pathways induced by negative growth regulators. For example, in some transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) growth-inhibited cells, cell cycle progression is blocked in late G1 as a result of the association of p27 with newly formed cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and of an increase in p15 transcript levels (20Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 25Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Other studies have correlated the expression of CDK inhibitors with cell cycle arrest and/or differentiation in many cell types after treatment with extracellular growth regulators, exposure to particular environmental conditions, or by ectopic expression of intracellular modulators of the cell cycle (27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 34Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For example, p21 is under transcriptional control by the p53 tumor suppressor gene, vitamin D3 receptor (35Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), retinoic acid receptor (36Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol.

In specific osteosarcoma and fibroblast cell lines, glucocorticoids increase the level of p21, although the mechanism of transcriptional control of p21 was not characterized in these cell types (43Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 44Ramalingam A. Hirai A. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that the transcriptional regulation of p21 is part of physiologically important proliferative, developmental, and differentiation processes. For example, strong signaling through Raf can lead to a G1 cell cycle arrest by up-regulation of p21 (45Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 46Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Also, the targeted expression of p21 in hepatocytes of transgenic mice resulted in a decreased number of adult hepatocytes, a smaller liver, aberrant liver tissue organization, the failure of partial hepatectomy to stimulate liver regeneration, and an observed inhibition of cyclin D-CDK4 activity with a resulting G1 cell cycle arrest (47Wu H. Wade M. Krall L. Grisham J. Xiong Y. Van D.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 245-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result implicates p21 as an important target in the growth regulation of normal hepatic-derived cells and perhaps their transformed counterparts. We have previously characterized glucocorticoid-sensitive and -resistant hepatoma cell variants generated from Fu5 hepatoma cell populations and have demonstrated that the dexamethasone growth suppression response is a receptor-dependent process that does not affect cell viability (11Cook P.W.

In Fu5-derived BDS1 cells, dexamethasone induces an early G1 block in cell cycle progression (14Sanchez I. Goya L. Vallerga A.K. Firestone G.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar) mediated, in part, by an increased expression of the C/EBPα transcription factor (48Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the importance of p21 in controlling progression through G1 in normal hepatic cell types, and the known transcriptional regulatory pathways operating on the p21 gene, the regulation of p21 may be part of the signal transduction pathway through which glucocorticoids mediate their tissue-specific anti-proliferative effects. In this study, we demonstrate that the glucocorticoid G1 cell cycle arrest of hepatoma cells is accompanied by the selective stimulation in p21 expression and activation of the p21 promoter through multiple transcription factor binding sites, within a defined glucocorticoid-regulated region. The following companion paper (82Cram E.J. Ramos R.A. Wang E.C. Cha H.H. Nishio Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2008-2014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) establishes a functional role for the glucocorticoid-induced expression of the C/EBPα transcription factor in the regulated expression and promoter activity of p21 in hepatoma cells. The transcriptional control of p21 through at least two distinct pathways provides a basis for understanding the anti-proliferative mechanism of glucocorticoids. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 (1:1) medium, fetal bovine serum, calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and trypsin-EDTA were supplied by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Dexamethasone was obtained from Sigma. [3H]Thymidine (84 Ci/mmol), [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (200 mCi/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-p21, anti-p27, anti-CDK2, anti-CDK4, anti-CDK6, anti-cyclin D1, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) donkey anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad. The enhanced chemiluminescence protein detection system and the Multiprime DNA labeling kit were purchased from Amersham Corp. PCR reagents including Taqpolymerase, Taq polymerase buffer, and Perfect Match enzyme were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The chimeric pGRE-CAT reporter plasmid containing six glucocorticoid response elements linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was a generous gift from Dr. Keith R. Yamamoto (Dept. of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco). The chimeric p21 promoter CAT reporter plasmids containing deletions at −2.326 kb, −1.892 kb, −1.481 kb, −1.184 kb, −0.883 kb, −0.585 kb, and −0.291 kb, and the p21-luciferase reporter plasmids were generous gifts from B. Vogelstein (Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore) and have been described previously (41El-Diery W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). Fine mapping deletion constructs were PCR-amplified from the full-length −2.326p21 CAT reporter plasmid and cloned into pBLCAT2 (Promega). All other reagents were of highest available purity. Glucocorticoid-sensitive BDS1 cells and glucocorticoid-resistant EDR3 (receptor-defective) cells are epithelial tumor cells derived from the rat Reuber hepatoma (12Cook P.W. Swanson K.T. Edwards C.P. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 48Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell.

All cell lines were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12/10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cell culture medium was routinely changed every 48 h. Dexamethasone was added to a final concentration of 1 μm as indicated, and TGF-β was added to a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. Triplicate samples of asynchronously growing BDS1 or EDR3 hepatoma cells were treated for the indicated times with dexamethasone, pulse-radiolabeled for 2 h with 3 μCi of [3H]thymidine (84 Ci/mmol), washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed with 300 μl of 0.3n NaOH. Lysates (100 μl) were transferred directly into vials containing a liquid scintillation mixture; radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Hepatoma cells (4 × 104) were plated onto Corning 6-well tissue culture dishes and treated with or without 1 μmdexamethasone or 2 ng/ml TGF-β, and the medium was changed every 24 h. After 48 h, cells were hypotonically lysed in 1 ml of DNA staining solution (0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.05% Triton X-100). Nuclear emitted fluorescence was measured with a Coulter Elite instrument with laser output adjusted to deliver 15 milliwatts at 488 nm. Cell nuclei (104) were analyzed from each sample at a rate of 300–500 nuclei/s. The percentages of cells within the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined by analysis with the Multicycle computer program provided by Phoenix Flow Systems in the Cancer Research Laboratory Microchemical Facility of the University of California, Berkeley. Logarithmically growing BDS1 cells were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone and/or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 8 h. Cells were then lysed, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from hepatoma cells as described previously (14Sanchez I. Goya L. Vallerga A.K. Firestone G.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoretically separated in a 6% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel, transferred onto Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). Membranes were preincubated with 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and subsequently hybridized with cDNA probes [α-32P]dCTP-labeled by random primer extension (Amersham Corp.). For p21 mRNA detection, membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once for 30 min and then once for 1.5 h. The same procedure was then repeated at 50 °C. For detection of GAPDH transcripts, membranes were washed with 2 × SSC twice at room temperature for 10 min followed by two 30-min washes at 60 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membranes were air-dried followed by autoradiographic exposure to x-ray film 1–5 days at −80 °C. p21 transcript expression was detected with a purified 850-base pair (bp) EcoRI fragment 9C from mouse p21 cDNA. GAPDH mRNA was detected with a 560-bpXbaI/HinD III fragment 3A of human cDNA. Hepatoma cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture plates and were treated for either 0, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h with 1 μm dexamethasone. Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and protein concentrations determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 30 μg of protein were mixed with 15 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS resolving gels by electrophoresis. Proteins were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) and blocked overnight at 4 °C with TBS-T, 5% NFDM (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk). Blots were subsequently incubated in TBST at room temperature with 1 mg/ml rabbit p27, CDK6 or CDK4 IgG, 0.4 mg/ml rabbit anti-CDK2 IgG, 1 mg/ml goat anti-p21 IgG, or 1 mg/ml mouse anti-cyclin D1 IgG. Incubation times were 1 h for p27, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6; 2 h for p21; and 12 h for cyclin D1. Membranes were then washed twice with TBST and twice with TBST, 1% NFDM, for 15 min each. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were diluted in TBST, 1% NFDM 1:5000 for CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and 1:2000 for p27, and membranes were incubated with the diluted antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies were diluted in TBST, 1% NFDM 1:1000 for p21, and incubation time was 2 h. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were diluted in TBST, 1% NFDM 1:5000 for cyclin D1, and incubation time was 2 h. Following incubation with secondary antibodies, blots were washed twice with TBST, 1% NFDM, and twice with TBST for 15 min each. Autoradiographic exposures were scanned with a UMAX UC630 scanner, and band intensities were quantified using the NIH image program. Autoradiographs from three independent experiments were scanned per time point. Hepatoma cells were cultured for 0, 6, 12, 24, or 30 h in growth media with or without 1 μm dexamethasone and then rinsed twice with PBS, harvested, and stored as dry pellets at −70 °C. For the immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed for 15 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml NaF, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After centrifugation at 1.4 × 104 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the total protein in each sample was determined by Bradford assay. Samples were diluted to 400 μg of protein/ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. Samples were pre-cleared for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) and 1 μg of rabbit IgG. After a brief centrifugation to remove pre-cleared beads, 0.3 μg of anti-CDK2 antibody was added to each sample and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each sample, and the slurries were incubated on the rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then washed five times with ice-cold IP buffer and twice with ice-cold kinase buffer (50 mmHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 0.1 μg/ml NaF, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). For the kinase assay, each immunoprecipitated sample was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.18 μg of Rb carboxyl-terminal domain protein substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding an equal volume of 2 × loading buffer (10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and bromphenol blue). Reaction products were boiled for 10 min and then electrophoretically fractionated in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor loading and de-stained overnight with 3% glycerol. Subsequently, gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Logarithmically growing hepatoma cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (48Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions were washed twice with sterile PBS and resuspended in electroporation buffer (270 mm sucrose, 7 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2). Cells (400 μl; 1–2 × 107cells/sample) were dispensed into sterile cuvettes. In all transfection experiments, the cells and 14 μg of pBLCAT2 empty vector and 16 μg of p21 promoter-CAT (or p21 promoter-luciferase) reporter construct or 30 μg of expression vector DNA were gently mixed, electrically pulsed five times (400 V square wave pulse for 99 μs) using a BTX 800 Transfector apparatus (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Transfected cells were plated into pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12, 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and propagated at 37 °C. Twenty-four-hour intervals after transfection, cells were re-incubated with fresh medium with or without 1 μm dexamethasone or 2 ng/ml TGF-β and harvested after 48 h. For CAT assays, cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed by alternating between an ethanol/dry ice bath and a 37 °C water bath, 5 min per cycle. Cell lysates were heated at 68 °C for 15 min, centrifuged at 1.4 × 104 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions were recovered. CAT activity in the cell extracts containing 20–50 μg of lysate protein was measured by a quantitative non-chromatographic assay (49Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-448Google Scholar). The enzyme assay was carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mmaqueous chloramphenicol, and 1 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (final reaction volume of 250 μl). The reaction mixture was gently overlaid with 4 ml of Econofluor water immiscible scintillation fluorochrome (NEN Life Science Products). CAT activity was monitored by direct measurement of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The enzyme activity was expressed as a function of 3H-acetylated chloramphenicol produced per μg of protein present in corresponding cell lysates. For each assay procedure, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3–8 h. Mock transfected cells were used to establish basal level activity for both assays. For luciferase assays, cells were harvested by washing twice in PBS and lysed in 1 ml of Promega lysis buffer. Twenty μl of BDS1 cell lysate was added to 12 × 75-mm cuvettes (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and subsequent"

HL was localized by immunohistochemistry to the liver and to the adrenal cortex. In hemizygous (hHLTg +/0) and homozygous (hHLTg +/+) mice, postheparin plasma HL activity increased by 25- and 50-fold and plasma cholesterol levels decreased by 80% and 85%, respectively. In mice fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet to increase endogenous apoB-containing lipoproteins, plasma cholesterol decreased 33% (hHLTg +/0) and 75% (hHLTg +/+). Both apoB-containing remnant lipoproteins and HDL were reduced. To extend this observation, the HL transgene was expressed in human apoB transgenic (huBTg) and apoE-deficient (apoE −/−) mice, both of which have high plasma levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins. (Note that thehuBTg mice that were used in these studies were all hemizygous for the human apoB gene.) In both thehuBTg,hHLTg +/0 mice and theapoE −/−,hHLTg +/0mice, plasma cholesterol decreased by 50%. This decrease was reflected in both the apoB-containing and the HDL fractions. To determine if HL catalytic activity is required for these decreases, we expressed catalytically inactive HL (HL-CAT) in apoE −/−mice. The postheparin plasma HL activities were similar in theapoE −/− and theapoE −/−,HL-CAT +/0mice, reflecting the activity of the endogenous mouse HL and confirming that the HL-CAT was catalytically inactive. However, the postheparin plasma HL activity was 20-fold higher in theapoE −/−,hHLTg +/0mice, indicating expression of the active human HL. Immunoblotting demonstrated high levels of human HL in postheparin plasma of bothapoE −/−,hHLTg +/0and apoE −/−,HL-CAT +/0mice. Plasma cholesterol and apoB-containing lipoprotein levels were ∼60% lower inapoE −/−,HL-CAT +/0mice than in apoE −/− mice. However, the HDL were only minimally reduced. Thus, the catalytic activity of HL is critical for its effects on HDL but not for its effects on apoB-containing lipoproteins. These results provide evidence that HL can act as a ligand to remove apoB-containing lipoproteins from plasma.

A potential role for HL in the processing of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins (very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), IDL, and low density lipoproteins (LDL)) was suggested by significantly increased levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins resulting from the infusion of HL antibodies into rats or cynomolgus monkeys (9Daggy B.P.

These in vitro data and the fact that apoB-containing lipoproteins accumulate in HL-deficient patients indicate that HL also facilitates the clearance of apoB-containing lipoproteins. To establish the mechanisms by which HL contributes to the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins and HDL in vivo, we developed and characterized HL transgenic mice. Because mouse plasma has low levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins and high levels of HDL, we first determined the effects of HL on HDL. To determine the effects of HL on apoB-containing lipoproteins, we induced higher levels of these lipoproteins by diet. We also induced high levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins by breeding HL transgenic mice onto the human apoB transgenic and the apoE-deficient backgrounds (40Nielsen L.B. McCormick S.P.A.

Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). To establish whether the effects of HL resulted from increased catalysis or whether it also can act as a ligand, we expressed a catalytically inactive HL (HL-CAT) on the apoE-deficient background. ICR mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, DE). The transgenes were based on the plivhHL1 construct described by Fan et al. (42Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The HL-CAT cDNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis and introduced an A → G nucleotide transition at position 559 in the human HL cDNA (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D.

Differentiation. 1987; 35: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This resulted in replacement of the catalytic serine by a glycine at amino acid 145 of the human HL enzyme. These constructs were designed for liver-specific expression and contained the following sequences of the human apoE gene: 3 kilobases (kb) of 5′-flanking sequence, the first exon, the first intron, six nucleotides of the second exon, a polylinker site for insertion of the cDNA, the nontranslated portion of the fourth exon, 0.1 kb of 3′-flanking sequence, and the first hepatic control region of the apoE gene locus. Transgenic mice expressing the unmodified human HL (hHLTg) and the mutant (HL-CAT) cDNAs were generated with established techniques (45Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M.E. Yagle M.K. Palmiter R.D.

There were no significant differences in body weight between the nontransgenic and transgenic mice. All mice were fed regular mouse chow (4.5% fat, Purina 5001) unless otherwise specified. All experiments used female mice except for those involvingapoE −/− mice, which used male mice. Littermates served as controls for all lines studied. Human HL was purified from conditioned medium from McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells that had been stably transfected with the HL cDNA (34Ji Z.-S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2 units/ml heparin (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ) in 7% CO2. After a 48-h incubation, 2200 ml of conditioned medium was harvested in the presence of 30% glycerol (v/v) to preserve enzyme activity. The medium was applied to a human antithrombin III antibody affinity column (3.5-ml bed volume) (Sigma) in series with a heparin-Sepharose CL6B affinity column (60-ml bed volume) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The equilibration and wash buffers consisted of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol (v/v), 0.4m NaCl, and 0.1% cholamidopropyldiethyl ammoniopropane sulfonate (w/v). The HL was subsequently eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column with a linear gradient (0.4–2 m) of NaCl. Conductivity measurements of the eluted fractions established the linearity of the gradient. As a control, medium from nontransfected McA-RH7777 cells was subjected to the same purification procedures but was not applied to the antithrombin III antibody affinity column. Fractions (4.3 ml each) were collected into glass tubes containing 10 units of heparin (1000 units/ml) and monitored for both protein elution (by absorbance at 280 nm) and peak HL activity (51Iverius P.-H. Brunzell J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E107-E114PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to eluted HL activity were pooled and dialyzed against four changes of 4 liters of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.2, for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by lyophilization and storage at −70 °C. Two female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 0.5 mg of partially purified human HL antigen three times at 2-week intervals (52Vaitukaitis J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The antiserum was rendered monospecific for human HL by absorption with proteins purified from medium of nontransfected McA-RH7777 cells. Residual antithrombin III antibodies were removed by incubation with agarose-cross-linked bovine plasma antithrombin III (Sigma A8293). The specificity of the human HL antibody was demonstrated in a Western blot assay (Fig. 1). Total RNA was isolated (53Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) from 10 tissues and analyzed by RNase protection with an antisense HL probe as described (42Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A.

Total liver RNA from nontransgenic and HL transgenic mice was analyzed by Northern blot assay (54Meinkoth J. Wahl G. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Nontransgenic and transgenic mouse plasma was collected into EDTA-containing tubes before and 10 min after intravenous injection of heparin (150 units/kg of body weight) and analyzed for protein expression. Western blots of pre- and postheparin plasma were performed with the monospecific anti-human HL antibody described above. Since more than one-half of mouse HL circulates in plasma, we would expect to detect any cross-reactivity with the mouse HL in the mouse preheparin plasma sample (55Peterson J. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of HL in pre- and postheparin plasma was determined with glycerol [1-14C]trioleate as a substrate in the presence of 1 m NaCl as described (51Iverius P.-H. Brunzell J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E107-E114PubMed Google Scholar). Total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined with standard enzymatic assays (cholesterol: Abbott Spectrum, Abbott Park, IL; triglycerides: GPO-PAP kit, Boehringer Mannheim). Plasma was obtained by tail bleeding mice after a 4-h fast. Mouse plasma lipoproteins were fractionated by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR 10/50 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (56Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J.

For these analyses, 60–100 μl of plasma was mixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA to a total volume of 260 μl. The column was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and 60 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Standard enzymatic assays (100-μl aliquots of each fraction) were used to measure cholesterol and triglyceride levels (see above). All determinations were corrected for plasma cholesterol and triglyceride recoveries, which ranged from 70 to 100%. To induce high levels of endogenous apoB-containing lipoproteins, control and HL transgenic mice were placed on a high fat, high cholesterol diet consisting of 15.8% (w/w) fat, 1.25% (w/w) cholesterol, and 0.5% (w/w) sodium cholate for 8 weeks (TD 88051, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) (58Homanics G.E. de Silva H.V.

Fasting plasma total and lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined as described above. After a 4-h fast, nontransgenic and human HL transgenic mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of avertin (20 μl/g of body weight) (59Mortimer B.-C. Umeda Y. Elsegood C.L. Redgrave T.G. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1993; 20: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Through a laparotomy, 100 μl of saline or saline containing 5 units (150 units/kg) of heparin (Elkins-Sinn) was injected into the portal vein with a 30-gauge needle.

A thoracotomy was performed, and the apex of the beating heart was punctured; the left ventricle was cannulated with a 25-gauge angiocatheter (Deseret, Becton Dickinson, Sandy, UT), the inferior vena cava was severed, blood was flushed by infusing phosphate-buffered saline through the angiocatheter, and perfusion fixation was performed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature.

Basal CCT expression in the engineered HeLa cell line was the same as in control HeLa cells lines, and CCT activity and protein were elevated 25-fold following 48 h of induction with doxycycline. Increased CCT expression prevented ET-18-OCH3-induced apoptosis. Acylation of exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine circumvented the requirement for CCT activity by providing an alternate route to phosphatidylcholine, and heightened CCT expression and lysophosphatidylcholine supplementation were equally effective in reversing the cytotoxic effect of ET-18-OCH3. Neither CCT overexpression nor lysophosphatidylcholine supplementation allowed the HeLa cells to proliferate in the presence of ET-18-OCH3, indicating that the cytostatic property of ET-18-OCH3 was independent of its effect on membrane phospholipid synthesis. These data provide compelling genetic evidence to support the conclusion that the interruption of phosphatidylcholine synthesis at the CCT step by ET-18-OCH3 is the primary physiological imbalance that accounts for the cytotoxic action of the drug."

PBR is present in most, if not all, tissues and is particularly abundant in the outer membrane of mitochondria. PBR has been suggested to be required for the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane where steroid biosynthesis takes place (1Papadopoulos V. Nowzari F.B. Krueger K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3682-3687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor also appears to play a key role in modulating mitochondrial electrophysiology, which suggests its implication in the side effects of benzodiazepine pharmacology (for recent review, see Ref. 2Krueger K.E.

Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A similar pentahelix topology has been found at 2.2-Å resolution for a crystallized apolipoprotein (13Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and from gene fusion studies of the cytochrome c terminal oxidase complex ofEscherichia coli (14Cepuri V. Hennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12978-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model for PBR was proposed and studied using molecular dynamics simulations (12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was concluded from this model that the α-helices were too short to cross an entire bilayer membrane but corresponded approximately to one phospholipid layer. The work described here was aimed at determining whether the PBR model was correct or needed to be refined.In view of the paucity of crystallographic data for membrane proteins several techniques have been developed to investigate their topology. Each of these techniques relies on the localization of the hydrophilic loop and tail regions by proteolytic degradation, by antibiotic selection, or by various labeling strategies. In the present report we describe two quite distinct labeling approaches we have adopted to investigate the PBR model. The first made use of c-Myc epitope insertions with subsequent immunodetection; in the various loop regions the epitope was flanked by pentaglycine to improve antibody accessibility, an innovation used successfully for topological studies of bacteriorhodopsin (15Teufel M. Pompejus M. Humbel B. Friedrich K. Fritz H.-J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3399-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the second method, designed to obtain a more refined topological analysis, we mutated the PBR to introduce cysteine residues into various regions that were subsequently visualized by sulfhydryl labeling techniques (16Zhou J. Fazzio R.T. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). From the results obtained we were indeed able to confirm the pentahelical PBR structure; but by taking into consideration other published investigations, we propose a model in which the transmembrane helices are longer than those previously thought to exist.DISCUSSIONHydropathic analysis of the 169 amino acids that constitute the rat (8Sprengel R. Werner P. Seeburg P.H. Mukhin A.G. Santi M.R. Grayson D.R. Guidotti A. Krueger K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20415-20421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine (10Parola A.L.

Caput D. Le Fur G. Loison G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and mouse (9Garnier M. Dimchev A.B. Boujrad N. Price J.M. Musto N.A. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 201-211PubMed Google Scholar) PBR reveals the presence of five hydrophobic regions in each of the receptors. Alignment of the sequences (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar) clearly shows either identical amino acids in these putative transmembrane regions or conservative replacements. The recently described outer membrane sensory protein of the proteobacterium R. sphaeroides has also been shown recently (3Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to have a close structural and functional relationship with the PBR. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the topology of these receptors is identical. There are now several lines of evidence that support the general model proposed by Bernassauet al. (12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), according to which the amino terminus of the PBR points toward the interior of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and five transmembrane regions lead to a highly charged carboxyl terminus exposed to the cell cytoplasm. From extensive site-directed mutagenesis modifications of hPBR and bPBR followed by expression in yeast and binding experiments in intact yeast mitochondria, we recently showed (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar) that Glu-29, Arg-32, and Lys-39 are in a loop in the cell cytoplasm, c1 (Fig. 1) and that they somehow affected Ro5-4864 binding. Furthermore, we postulated that the carboxyl-terminal region was also in the cytoplasm, perhaps close to c1 (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). More direct evidence for the cytoplasmic location of the carboxyl terminus has come from experiments with an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide from this region of the PBR (25Dussossoy D. Carayon P. Feraut D. Belugou S. Combes T. Canat X. Vidal H. Casellas P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although we previously presented PBR models with five transmembrane regions (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we did not exclude other possible structures, notably one in which both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions were located in the cytoplasm (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here support the former model.To establish membrane protein topology various techniques are employed, notably the production of chimeras incorporating a foreign reporter in putative loop regions to establish their location with respect to the membrane and the use of membrane-impenetrable reagents that will chemically modify only exposed residues at specific sites in the protein and, conversely, lipophilic reagents that only react with residues in a membrane environment. In the first set of experiments we inserted c-Myc epitopes into the putative outer and inner loop regions of PBR. Antibodies raised against c-Myc were used as membrane-impenetrable labeling reagents. Various c-Myc-tagged PBR were translocated into the mitochondria of recombinant yeast cells, in a correctly folded form according to binding data with PK11195 and Ro5-4864. After the localization of the epitope in intact or permeabilized mitochondria, it was clear that the results supported the general five-transmembrane structure predicted by the model in Fig. 1. In particular, the amino-terminal region and m1 did indeed appear to be inside the mitochondria. However, the m2 loop could not be detected by this method, and Western blot analysis indicated the absence of this fused receptor in the mitochondria.We subsequently employed cysteine labeling techniques with the polar 5FM and the apolar BM reagents, techniques that can only be used if the target protein is produced at a high level. For this reason, we turned to bPBR and a bPBR-hPBR hybrid, receptors that can be produced in high amounts in yeast mitochondria. After ensuring that a PBR variant lacking Cys in its sequence could not be modified with 5FM or BM, we used this technique to ascertain whether various Cys residues were located in aqueous or apolar environments. Because it has been reported (26Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that hydrophilic reagents are capable of crossing lipid membranes, care must be taken in using them to draw conclusions about receptor topography, unless kinetic aspects are considered. We found that 5FM treatment of intact mitochondria labeled all of the Cys residues predicted to be in three of the domains, c1, c2, and carboxyl terminal, within 4 min, clearly establishing an extramitochondrial, cytoplasmic localization of these regions. This period was therefore chosen for the 5FM experiments because a longer treatment could label intramitochondrial residues. However, the latter residues also reacted within 4 min after we lysed the mitochondria. Significantly, the Cys-135 residue predicted to be in the m2 loop was labeled by 5FM only in the presence of Triton X-100. This result showed this residue to be localized not in an accessible loop region but inside the fifth transmembrane helix. However, the other species contain an Arg at this position, suggesting that the 135 residue lies near the hydrophilic face of the phospholipid and also indicating some flexibility regarding the extent to which the hydrophobic domains are embedded in the membrane. In contrast, residue 130 is clearly situated in the m2 loop region.In the original model (Fig. 1) it was proposed that around 18 amino acids formed each of the five transmembrane regions and that the PBR reached only halfway between the outer and inner surfaces of the outer mitochondrial membrane (12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Cys labeling results with 5FM would indicate, however, that the intramitochondrial residues are in a hydrophilic environment and, therefore, that the transmembrane regions are longer than hydrophobicity analysis would suggest. The exact beginning and end of transmembrane regions are notoriously difficult to establish, as was pointed out recently in an electron-crystallographic refinement of bacteriorhodopsin at 3.5-Å resolution (27Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, several theoretical methods to predict such regions exist. It has been postulated (11von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar) that Arg/Lys patches occur at the cytoplasmic ends of receptors present in plasma membranes, their positive charges serving to anchor the receptor to the negatively charged phospholipids. No Arg/Lys patches occur in the PBR of the four species known at present, and it is uncertain whether such anchors exist. However, an alignment of the sequences (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar) reveals several perfectly conserved Arg or Lys at positions 32, 39, 69, 103, and 166. In addition, by accepting His in the analysis, positions 27, 43, 46, and 162 can be added. All but two of these positive charges (69 and 76/77) are found in or near the putative extramitochondrial regions or in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). Our results show that residue 26, just before the positively charged residue 27, is clearly in the cytoplasm. Arg-103 in c2 also appears to be far from the membrane, the nearby positions 102 and 106 being shown here to be in the cytoplasm. Finally, we found Cys-153 to be located in the fifth transmembrane region of the hPBR, but the bPBR has an Arg at this position which, as in the case of Cys-135 discussed earlier, would again suggest that the residue is at the membrane surface. The adjacent Val-154, important for Ro5-4864 binding, is also near the membrane-cytoplasm interface.It is interesting to note that all four PBR sequences presently available exhibit fully conserved glycines, a residue often involved in structures that terminate α-helices (28Aurora R. Science. 1994; 264: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), near the proposed carboxyl ends of each of the first three putative transmembrane regions; but it must be clearly stated that no evidence exists to show that the transmembrane regions have an α-helical structure. Finally, several of the structural features discussed here are to be seen in theR. sphaeroides protein described by Yeliseev et al. (3Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have obtained experimental data that strongly support the theoretical topographical PBR model shown in Fig. 1 (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but the data lead us to suggest that some refinements should be made to the model. In particular, because the putative intramitochondrial loops are accessible to hydrophilic reagents, the transmembrane domains may be longer by 3–4 residues thereby completely traversing the outer mitochondrial membrane. The peripheral (or mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) 1The abbreviations used are: PBR, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; r, m, b, and hPBR, rat, murine, bovine, and human PBR, respectively; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; 5FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; BM, benzophenone-4-maleimide; c and m, cytoplasmic and intramitochondrial locations, respectively.1The abbreviations used are: PBR, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; r, m, b, and hPBR, rat, murine, bovine, and human PBR, respectively; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; 5FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; BM, benzophenone-4-maleimide; c and m, cytoplasmic and intramitochondrial locations, respectively. possesses a benzodiazepine binding site that is clearly distinct from the modulator site of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid receptor. PBR is present in most, if not all, tissues and is particularly abundant in the outer membrane of mitochondria. PBR has been suggested to be required for the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane where steroid biosynthesis takes place (1Papadopoulos V. Nowzari F.B. Krueger K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3682-3687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor also appears to play a key role in modulating mitochondrial electrophysiology, which suggests its implication in the side effects of benzodiazepine pharmacology (for recent review, see Ref. 2Krueger K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 453-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An outer membrane sensory protein of the proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has recently been shown (3Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was concluded from this model that the α-helices were too short to cross an entire bilayer membrane but corresponded approximately to one phospholipid layer. The work described here was aimed at determining whether the PBR model was correct or needed to be refined. In view of the paucity of crystallographic data for membrane proteins several techniques have been developed to investigate their topology. Each of these techniques relies on the localization of the hydrophilic loop and tail regions by proteolytic degradation, by antibiotic selection, or by various labeling strategies.

From the results obtained we were indeed able to confirm the pentahelical PBR structure; but by taking into consideration other published investigations, we propose a model in which the transmembrane helices are longer than those previously thought to exist.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and mouse (9Garnier M. Dimchev A.B. Boujrad N. Price J.M. Musto N.A. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 201-211PubMed Google Scholar) PBR reveals the presence of five hydrophobic regions in each of the receptors. Alignment of the sequences (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar) clearly shows either identical amino acids in these putative transmembrane regions or conservative replacements. The recently described outer membrane sensory protein of the proteobacterium R. sphaeroides has also been shown recently (3Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to have a close structural and functional relationship with the PBR. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the topology of these receptors is identical. There are now several lines of evidence that support the general model proposed by Bernassauet al. (12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), according to which the amino terminus of the PBR points toward the interior of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and five transmembrane regions lead to a highly charged carboxyl terminus exposed to the cell cytoplasm. From extensive site-directed mutagenesis modifications of hPBR and bPBR followed by expression in yeast and binding experiments in intact yeast mitochondria, we recently showed (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar) that Glu-29, Arg-32, and Lys-39 are in a loop in the cell cytoplasm, c1 (Fig. 1) and that they somehow affected Ro5-4864 binding. Furthermore, we postulated that the carboxyl-terminal region was also in the cytoplasm, perhaps close to c1 (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). More direct evidence for the cytoplasmic location of the carboxyl terminus has come from experiments with an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide from this region of the PBR (25Dussossoy D. Carayon P. Feraut D. Belugou S. Combes T. Canat X. Vidal H. Casellas P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although we previously presented PBR models with five transmembrane regions (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we did not exclude other possible structures, notably one in which both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions were located in the cytoplasm (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here support the former model.To establish membrane protein topology various techniques are employed, notably the production of chimeras incorporating a foreign reporter in putative loop regions to establish their location with respect to the membrane and the use of membrane-impenetrable reagents that will chemically modify only exposed residues at specific sites in the protein and, conversely, lipophilic reagents that only react with residues in a membrane environment. In the first set of experiments we inserted c-Myc epitopes into the putative outer and inner loop regions of PBR. Antibodies raised against c-Myc were used as membrane-impenetrable labeling reagents. Various c-Myc-tagged PBR were translocated into the mitochondria of recombinant yeast cells, in a correctly folded form according to binding data with PK11195 and Ro5-4864. After the localization of the epitope in intact or permeabilized mitochondria, it was clear that the results supported the general five-transmembrane structure predicted by the model in Fig. 1. In particular, the amino-terminal region and m1 did indeed appear to be inside the mitochondria. However, the m2 loop could not be detected by this method, and Western blot analysis indicated the absence of this fused receptor in the mitochondria.We subsequently employed cysteine labeling techniques with the polar 5FM and the apolar BM reagents, techniques that can only be used if the target protein is produced at a high level. For this reason, we turned to bPBR and a bPBR-hPBR hybrid, receptors that can be produced in high amounts in yeast mitochondria. After ensuring that a PBR variant lacking Cys in its sequence could not be modified with 5FM or BM, we used this technique to ascertain whether various Cys residues were located in aqueous or apolar environments. Because it has been reported (26Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that hydrophilic reagents are capable of crossing lipid membranes, care must be taken in using them to draw conclusions about receptor topography, unless kinetic aspects are considered. We found that 5FM treatment of intact mitochondria labeled all of the Cys residues predicted to be in three of the domains, c1, c2, and carboxyl terminal, within 4 min, clearly establishing an extramitochondrial, cytoplasmic localization of these regions. This period was therefore chosen for the 5FM experiments because a longer treatment could label intramitochondrial residues. However, the latter residues also reacted within 4 min after we lysed the mitochondria. Significantly, the Cys-135 residue predicted to be in the m2 loop was labeled by 5FM only in the presence of Triton X-100. This result showed this residue to be localized not in an accessible loop region but inside the fifth transmembrane helix. However, the other species contain an Arg at this position, suggesting that the 135 residue lies near the hydrophilic face of the phospholipid and also indicating some flexibility regarding the extent to which the hydrophobic domains are embedded in the membrane. In contrast, residue 130 is clearly situated in the m2 loop region.In the original model (Fig. 1) it was proposed that around 18 amino acids formed each of the five transmembrane regions and that the PBR reached only halfway between the outer and inner surfaces of the outer mitochondrial membrane (12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Cys labeling results with 5FM would indicate, however, that the intramitochondrial residues are in a hydrophilic environment and, therefore, that the transmembrane regions are longer than hydrophobicity analysis would suggest. The exact beginning and end of transmembrane regions are notoriously difficult to establish, as was pointed out recently in an electron-crystallographic refinement of bacteriorhodopsin at 3.5-Å resolution (27Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, several theoretical methods to predict such regions exist. It has been postulated (11von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar) that Arg/Lys patches occur at the cytoplasmic ends of receptors present in plasma membranes, their positive charges serving to anchor the receptor to the negatively charged phospholipids. No Arg/Lys patches occur in the PBR of the four species known at present, and it is uncertain whether such anchors exist. However, an alignment of the sequences (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar) reveals several perfectly conserved Arg or Lys at positions 32, 39, 69, 103, and 166. In addition, by accepting His in the analysis, positions 27, 43, 46, and 162 can be added. All but two of these positive charges (69 and 76/77) are found in or near the putative extramitochondrial regions or in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). Our results show that residue 26, just before the positively charged residue 27, is clearly in the cytoplasm. Arg-103 in c2 also appears to be far from the membrane, the nearby positions 102 and 106 being shown here to be in the cytoplasm. Finally, we found Cys-153 to be located in the fifth transmembrane region of the hPBR, but the bPBR has an Arg at this position which, as in the case of Cys-135 discussed earlier, would again suggest that the residue is at the membrane surface. The adjacent Val-154, important for Ro5-4864 binding, is also near the membrane-cytoplasm interface.It is interesting to note that all four PBR sequences presently available exhibit fully conserved glycines, a residue often involved in structures that terminate α-helices (28Aurora R. Science. 1994; 264: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), near the proposed carboxyl ends of each of the first three putative transmembrane regions; but it must be clearly stated that no evidence exists to show that the transmembrane regions have an α-helical structure. Finally, several of the structural features discussed here are to be seen in theR. sphaeroides protein described by Yeliseev et al. (3Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have obtained experimental data that strongly support the theoretical topographical PBR model shown in Fig. 1 (6Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bernassau J.M. Reversat J.L. Ferrara P. Caput D. Le Fur G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but the data lead us to suggest that some refinements should be made to the model. In particular, because the putative intramitochondrial loops are accessible to hydrophilic reagents, the transmembrane domains may be longer by 3–4 residues thereby completely traversing the outer mitochondrial membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2054488262,"We have investigated the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors linked to phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the control of glutamate release in cerebrocortical nerve terminals. The activation of these receptors with the agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine enhanced intrasynaptosomal diacylglycerol and facilitated both the depolarization-induced increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and the release of glutamate. However, 5 min after receptor activation, a second stimulation of the pathway with the agonist failed to produce diacylglycerol and to facilitate glutamate release. Interestingly, during the period in which the diacylglycerol response was desensitized, a strong agonist-induced inhibition of Ca2+entry and glutamate release was observed. This change in the presynaptic effects of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine is reversible since 30 min after the first stimulation, the agonist-induced inhibition of release disappeared, whereas both the production of diacylglycerol and the facilitation of glutamate release were recovered. The tonic elevation of the extracellular glutamate concentration from basal levels (0.8 μm) up to 5 μm also produced the switch from facilitation to inhibition in the receptor response. The existence of this activity-dependent switch in the presynaptic control of glutamate release suggests that release facilitation is limited to conditions under which an appropriate clearance of synaptic glutamate exists, probably to prevent the neurotoxic accumulation of glutamate in the synapse.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cerebrocortical nerve terminals, it has been shown, in addition, that although the agonist l-AP4 reduces both the depolarization-induced increase in Ca2+ and forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation, only the reduction in [Ca2+] c is responsible for the decrease in release (24Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to the negative modulation of neurotransmitter release by Group II and III mGluRs, the role of phosphoinositide-linked mGluRs in the control of glutamate release is not clear. In nerve terminals, the activation of these receptors facilitates glutamate release (25Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Nature. 1992; 360: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), an effect likely to be the result of diacylglycerol production (26Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C activation (27Coffey E.T. Herrero I. Sihra T.S. Sánchez-Prieto J. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This facilitation of release is also consistent with the presence of a presynaptic PKC-dependent facilitatory pathway as revealed by synaptic transmission studies in slice preparations (28Malenka R.C. Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1986; 321: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 29Parfitt K.D. Madison D.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 471: 245-268Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, the activation of presynaptic phosphoinositide (PI)-linked mGluRs has shown a reduction of synaptic transmission due to decreased glutamate release (30Manzoni O. Bockaert J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2518-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Gereau IV, R.W. Conn J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6879-6889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have found that PI-coupled mGluRs can mediate not only the facilitation, but also the inhibition of glutamate release depending on the response pathway activated. Under control conditions, the response to a first stimulation with the agonist is the facilitation of glutamate release, an effect likely to be due to diacylglycerol (DAG) production and PKC activation. However, following receptor activation, a reversible desensitization of both DAG production and release facilitation occurs, during which a second stimulation with the agonist inhibits the entry of Ca2+ and the release of glutamate. A complete switch to inhibition can be induced by a small (5 μm) tonic elevation of the extracellular glutamate concentration, suggesting that release facilitation, which may be necessary for synaptic plasticity, is limited to conditions under which an appropriate clearance of synaptic glutamate exists, a property likely important in avoiding the neurotoxic accumulation of glutamate. Cerebral cortices from male Wistar rats (2–3 months old) were isolated and homogenized in medium containing 320 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm TES, pH 7.4. The homogenate was spun for 5 min at 900 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were spun again for 10 min at 17,000 × g. From the pellets thus formed, the white loosely compacted layer containing the majority of synaptosomes was gently resuspended in medium containing 250 mm sucrose and 5 mm TES, pH 7.4 (10 ml/four cortices), and the protein was determined by the biuret method. Pellets containing 1 mg of protein were stored on ice. Synaptosomes remained fully viable when stored as pellets for at least 6 h after preparation, as judged by the extent of KCl- and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced glutamate release. Glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorometry as described previously (32Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Synaptosomal pellets were resuspended (0.67 mg/ml) in incubation medium containing 122 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm TES, pH 7.4, and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 16 μm bovine serum albumin (BSA) to bind any free fatty acids released from synaptosomes during the preincubation (33Herrero I. Castro E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 126: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After preincubation, the synaptosomes were pelleted and resuspended in fresh incubation medium both with and without BSA depending on whether release inhibition or facilitation was under investigation. An aliquot (1 ml) was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1 mm NADP+, 50 units of glutamate dehydrogenase, and 1.33 mm CaCl2 or 200 nm free Ca2+, and the fluorescence of NADPH was followed in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Traces were calibrated by the addition of 2 nmol of glutamate at the end of each assay. Data points were obtained at 2-s intervals and corrected for the Ca2+-independent release. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent release was calculated by subtracting the release obtained during 5 min at 200 nmfree Ca2+ from the release at 1.33 mmCaCl2. Diacylglycerol was estimated as the amount of 32P incorporated from [γ-32P]ATP into phosphatidic acid in the presence of diacylglycerol kinase. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the synaptosomal suspension (0.67 mg/ml) were added to 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v) and rapidly frozen at −80 °C until all samples were collected. After thawing, the phases were separated by centrifugation, and the lower organic phase was collected and evaporated in a water bath at 60 °C. The tubes containing diacylglycerol were incubated in medium (final volume of 100 μl) containing 70 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 35 mmMgCl2, 0.7% Nonidet P-40, 0.14 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 35 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. The reaction, at 30 °C for 1 h, was started by the addition of 60 milliunits of diacylglycerol kinase, 25 μm ATP, and 0.45 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and stopped with 100 μl of a mixture containing 5% perchloric acid, 10 mm ATP, and 1 mm H3PO4. Phosphatidic acid was extracted with 0.7 ml of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v); the solvent was evaporated in a water bath at 60 °C; and radioactivity was estimated after the addition of 1.2 ml of scintillation liquid. 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol was used as a standard. Synaptosomes were resuspended (2 mg/ml) in incubation medium containing 16 μm BSA and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. After this period, 1.33 mm CaCl2, adenosine deaminase (1 unit/mg of protein), and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were added, and the incubation was continued for another 10 min. To test for an increase in cAMP formation, pharmacological agonists were added, and samples were taken 2 min latter. In those experiments in which the ability of agonist to reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels was tested, forskolin at 100 μm was added 10 min prior to the addition of the agonist. Agonists were then added, and 0.5-ml aliquots were taken 1 min later. After acidic extraction and neutralization (34Herrero I. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30554-30560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the cAMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay with a commercially available cAMP kit (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). [Ca2+] c was measured with fura-2. Synaptosomes were resuspended (2 mg/ml) in incubation medium containing 16 μm BSA in the presence of 1.33 mm CaCl2 and 5 μmfura-2/acetoxymethyl ester and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After fura-2 loading, synaptosomes were pelleted and resuspended in fresh incubation medium with or without BSA depending on whether inhibition or facilitation of Ca2+ entry was being studied. An aliquot (1 ml) was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1.33 mm CaCl2, and the fluorescence was monitored at 340 and 510 nm. Data points were collected at 0.5-s intervals. [Ca2+] c was calculated using the equations described by Grynkiewicz et al. (35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes in incubation medium containing BSA (0.67 mg/ml) were preincubated for 50 min and then treated with increasing concentrations (3–33 mm) of KCl for another 10 min. After this time, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was saved for glutamate content, which was analyzed by the addition of 50-μl aliquots to a stirred cuvette containing 1.2 ml of incubation medium, 1 mm NADP+, and 50 units of glutamate dehydrogenase. DHPG, (RS)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine, l-CCG-I, andl-AP4 were from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, United Kingdom). Glutamate dehydrogenase, NADP+, phosphatidylserine, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and arachidonic acid were from Sigma. Staurosporine, adenosine deaminase, and diacylglycerol kinase were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Forskolin was from Calbiochem. Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The depolarization of nerve terminals with the K+ channel blocker 4-AP has been shown to open voltage-gated Ca2+channels and to induce the release of vesicular glutamate (36Tibbs G.R. Barrie A.P. Van-Mieghem F.J.E. McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows that the prior addition of the PI-linked mGluR selective agonist DHPG (10Schoepp D.D. Goldsworthy J. Johnson B.G. Salhoff C.R. Baker S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) to cerebrocortical nerve terminals had no effect on the Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate induced by maximal depolarization with 4-AP at 1 mm. DHPG did, however, enhance the glutamate release induced by a suboptimal 4-AP concentration (50 μm), an effect that was abolished by the mGluR antagonist MCPG (Fig. 1 B) (37Hayashi Y. Sekiyama N. Nakanishi S. Jane D.E. Sunter D.C. Birse E.F. Udvarhelyi P.M. Watkins J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3370-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Bshows that the PKC-preferring inhibitor staurosporine (38Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 135: 397-402Crossref Scopus (2219) Google Scholar) abolished release facilitation, a result consistent with the involvement of protein kinase activity in the facilitatory pathway activated by the mGluR agonist. Further evidence of the involvement of PI hydrolysis and protein kinase C activity in the potentiation of release by mGluRs was obtained from data showing that the addition of the agonist enhanced diacylglycerol formation in the nerve terminal preparation (Fig.2 A, control). However, the change in DAG levels was transient since the response, which was maximal 5 s after agonist addition, then decayed toward basal levels. The DHPG-induced formation of diacylglycerol measured at the peak exhibited an EC50 value of 1.76 ± 0.92 μm (Fig. 2 B) and was abolished not only by MCPG, but also by other mGluR antagonists such as (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (37Hayashi Y. Sekiyama N. Nakanishi S. Jane D.E. Sunter D.C. Birse E.F. Udvarhelyi P.M. Watkins J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3370-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the agonists of the adenylyl cyclase-coupled mGluRs, l-CCG-I (39Hayashi Y. Tanabe Y. Aramori I. Masu M. Shimamoto K. Ohfune Y. Nakanishi S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) andl-AP4, failed to either stimulate DAG production (Fig. 2 C) or potentiate glutamate release (data not shown). The transient production of DAG observed (Fig. 2 A,control) may be explained in part by the metabolism of DAG and also by the PKC-mediated negative feedback control of agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis that has been observed in many neuronal preparations (40Manzoni O.J.J. Finiels-Marlier F. Sassetti I. Bockaert J. LePeuch C. Sladeczek F. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 109: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Catania M.V. Aronica E. Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of receptor desensitization to the decay in DAG formation was estimated in the presence of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, which largely prevented the drop in DAG formation that follows receptor activation (Fig. 2 A, + staurosporine). These results indicate that the activation of PKC is involved in the desensitization of the pathway leading to DAG production. To study the desensitization of the DHPG-sensitive mGluR with respect to further generation of DAG after stimulation, nerve terminals were pre-exposed to 100 μm DHPG for 1 min (first stimulation) and, after washing to remove the agonist, were rechallenged with DHPG (second stimulation), and DAG production was measured at the peak,i.e. 5 s after the addition of the agonist. As shown in Fig. 3 A, 5 min after the first stimulation, DHPG failed to activate the receptor in terms of DAG production. However, a full recovery of the receptor response was observed 30 min after the first stimulation (Fig. 3 A), indicating that agonist-induced desensitization of DAG formation is a reversible process. In experiments parallel to those shown in Fig. 3 A, we determined whether the loss of ability to generate DAG altered the modulatory control of glutamate release by DHPG. It is shown in Fig.3 B that parallel to the loss of DAG production by the agonist, a suppression of the facilitatory effect by DHPG on release was observed and that, at the same time, the agonist became able to inhibit the release induced by maximal depolarization with 4-AP (1 mm) (Fig. 3 B, second set of bars). Interestingly, 30 min after the first stimulation, the ability of the agonist to potentiate the release was recovered, and the inhibitory action was lost (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the desensitization of the DHPG-sensitive mGluR to produce DAG parallels a switch from facilitation to inhibition in the control of glutamate release. The inhibitory effect was further characterized in nerve terminals desensitized to produce DAG. Thus, Fig. 4shows that the strong inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent release by DHPG (Fig.4 A) exhibited an EC50 value of 3.36 ± 0.89 μm (Fig. 4 B) and was abolished by the mGluR antagonist MCPG (Fig. 4 C). In addition, the agonists of the adenylyl cyclase-coupled mGluRs, l-CCG-I andl-AP4, failed to induce release inhibition, a result consistent with the involvement of a PI-coupled mGluR in this action. Although the presence of an inhibitory control of glutamate release byl-AP4-sensitive mGluRs in cerebrocortical nerve terminals has been previously shown (19Vázquez E. Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this inhibitory pathway is developmentally controlled (19Vázquez E. Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) such that the inhibition of release is observed in nerve terminals from young animals (2–3 weeks), but not in the adult animals (2–3 months) used throughout this study. To better understand the mechanism by which DHPG-sensitive mGluRs modulate glutamate release, we determined the [Ca2+] c with the Ca2+indicator fura-2. It is important to note that the Ca2+indicator does not detect the high local [Ca2+] c that triggers glutamate release (42Verhage M. McMahon H.T. Ghijsen W.E.J.M. Boomsma F. Wiegant V. Nicholls D.G. Neuron. 1991; 6: 517-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and therefore that the changes in [Ca2+] c could be greater that the average bulk increase obtained with the indicator. In control synaptosomes (first stimulation), the depolarization of the nerve terminals with 50 μm 4-AP induced a rapid increase in the fura-2 signal (Fig. 5 A). This depolarization-induced increase in [Ca2+] c was potentiated by the prior addition of DHPG and was prevented by staurosporine (Fig. 5 A), indicating the involvement of PKC in the facilitation of Ca2+ entry in nerve terminals. Fig.5 A also shows that DHPG failed to alter the increase in [Ca2+] c caused by maximal stimulation with 1 mm 4-AP. Bar graphs indicating the changes in [Ca2+] c, from basal levels prior to depolarization to the stable plateau after depolarization, are shown in Fig. 5 B, except for the experiment with staurosporine. In Fig. 5 B, it is also shown that in nerve terminals pre-exposed to DHPG, followed by washing and a 5-min lag, DHPG failed to significantly potentiate the fura-2 response induced by submaximal stimulation, but strongly reduced the maximal fura-2 response. The facilitatory and inhibitory actions of DHPG-sensitive mGluRs on release can therefore be explained by an enhancement and a reduction of the increase in [Ca2+] c induced by depolarization, respectively. In another set of experiments, we found that DHPG did not alter the cAMP content under conditions in which basal cAMP levels (10.5 ± 4.2 pmol/mg) were enhanced by the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (65.8 ± 5.8 pmol/mg) and the forskolin-stimulated cAMP content (150.2 ± 5.5 pmol/mg) was reduced by the adenosine A1agonistR(−)-N 6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (33.0 ± 4.6 pmol/mg). These results indicate that changes in cAMP levels are not involved in the modulatory effects of DHPG on both release and Ca2+ entry in nerve terminals. To study the sensitivity of the inhibitory effects of DHPG to staurosporine, the nerve terminals were treated first with 100 μm DHPG for 1 min to induce the switch from facilitation to inhibition and then, after washing by centrifugation and resuspension to remove the agonist, with 1 μmstaurosporine for 15 min (Fig. 6,A and B, DHPG + staurosporine). It is important to note that the treatment with 1 μmstaurosporine for 15 min not only is as effective as 100 nmstaurosporine for 30 min in blocking PKC-dependent responses, but additionally, it shortens the incubation time, allowing us to study the sensitivity of the inhibitory responses to staurosporine before the reversal of the switch occurs. Under these conditions, staurosporine did not alter the inhibitory effects of DHPG either on the release of glutamate (Fig. 6 A) or on [Ca2+] c (Fig. 6 B), indicating that PKC is not involved in these responses. PKC activity is, however, involved in the switch from facilitation to inhibition of PI-coupled mGluRs. Thus, in experiments in which the treatment with DHPG was carried out after the prior inhibition of PKC with staurosporine (Fig. 6 C, staurosporine + DHPG), a second stimulation of the receptor with DHPG 5 min after the first stimulation failed to induce release inhibition. To investigate whether phospholipase C-coupled mGluR activation by a tonic elevation of the [Glu]ext promotes the switch from facilitation to inhibition in glutamate release control, we exposed nerve terminals to increasing concentrations of KCl (3–30 mm) to disrupt the electrical component of the Na+ electrochemical gradient used by glutamate transporters to maintain a low basal [Glu]ext (43Kanner B.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After this treatment, the [Glu]ext at each KCl concentration was determined, as well as release modulation by DHPG. In the absence of added KCl, the basal [Glu]ext was 0.82 ± 0.21 μm, at which the facilitation by DHPG was maximal and inhibition was absent (Fig. 7). The increase in [Glu]ext induced, however, a decrease in release facilitation with the concomitant appearance of release inhibition, so that at 5 μm extracellular glutamate, facilitation was virtually abolished, whereas inhibition was maximal (Fig. 7). The mGluR antagonist MCPG at 2 mm prevented the KCl-induced switch from facilitation to inhibition, indicating the involvement of mGluR activation by increased [Glu]ext in these changes. Fig. 7also shows that the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonistsd(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (both at 100 μm) were without effect on the KCl-induced switch in the mGluR function. The results of this study provide evidence for a dual role in the control of glutamate release by phosphoinositide-linked mGluRs as the agonist DHPG is able to induce either release facilitation or release inhibition depending on the response pathway activated. Release facilitation is the result of agonist-induced production of diacylglycerol and a protein kinase-dependent increase in the entry of Ca2+ into the nerve terminal. In contrast, release inhibition seems to be the result of an activity-dependent receptor switch since it is observed only after a second stimulation with the agonist. In this case, the inhibition of glutamate release parallels a reduction of the entry of Ca2+ into the nerve terminal in which staurosporine-sensitive protein phosphorylation is not involved. In addition to activating the facilitatory pathway, PKC seems to cause a homologous desensitization of DAG production on the basis of two observations: the transient production of DAG in the continuous presence of agonist and the prevention of the decay in DAG levels by the PKC-preferring inhibitor staurosporine. A homologous desensitization of DAG production has been suggested by experiments in nerve terminals in which the prior activation of PKC with phorbol esters abolished subsequent agonist-induced formation of diacylglycerol (26Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibitory action of PKC on agonist-induced hydrolysis of PI has also been shown to occur in other neural preparations (40Manzoni O.J.J. Finiels-Marlier F. Sassetti I. Bockaert J. LePeuch C. Sladeczek F. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 109: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Catania M.V. Aronica E. Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and these effects are generally thought to reflect a negative feedback action of the kinase in the signal transduction pathway. Although the locus for the suppression of DAG responses is not known, one likely possibility is the receptor since PI-linked mGluRs contain consensus phosphorylation sites (2Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 3Abe T. Sugihara H. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizumo N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13361-13368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that PKC phosphorylates PI-linked mGluRs (44Alaluf S. Mulvihill E.R. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The loss of agonist ability to produce DAG and to facilitate glutamate release observed after the prior activation of the receptor does not seem to involve a loss of receptor ability to respond to extracellularly added agonist, but a switch in receptor function. Thus, the receptor is capable of responding to the agonist DHPG in an MCPG-sensitive manner, but in this case, activates a transduction pathway that leads to the inhibition of Ca2+ entry and glutamate release. The selective inhibition by PKC of some signal transduction pathways activated by PI-coupled mGluRs has been found in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with mGluR1 (11Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this study, the activation of PKC with phorbol esters reduced the glutamate response on PI hydrolysis, but did not alter cAMP accumulation or the release of arachidonic acid induced by the agonist. An inhibitory action by presynaptic PI-linked mGluRs has also been observed in studies of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices (30Manzoni O. Bockaert J. Eur. J.

Moreover, the finding in this paper that the DHPG-induced inhibition of glutamate release was not prevented by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine makes the involvement of protein phosphorylation in the inhibitory pathway rather unlikely, while suggesting a mechanism for the inhibition of release-coupled Ca2+ channels in which diffusible second messengers are not involved (20Lester R.A.J. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 741-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Swartz K.J. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4358-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation to the PKC-mediated switch from facilitation to inhibition in receptor function is the parallel activation of both pathways by the agonist. Thus, release facilitation would be the result of a dominant role of the facilitatory pathway over the inhibitory pathway (46Sánchez-Prieto J. Budd D.C. Herrero I. Vázquez E. Nicholls D.G. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas release inhibition would be revealed only after the desensitization of the facilitatory pathway. If this is the case, the inhibition of PKC activity prior to receptor activation would prevent facilitation, but not PKC-independent release inhibition. However, no release inhibition by DHPG was observed in nerve terminals in which PKC activation was prevented by staurosporine prior to the induction of the switch (Fig. 6 C). These results therefore rule out a parallel activation of the facilitatory and inhibitory pathways and support the involvement of PKC activity in the switch from facilitation to inhibition in receptor function (Fig. 8). If phosphorylation by PKC is responsible for the switch from facilitation to inhibition, it is likely that the dephosphorylation of the putative target would be responsible for the recovery of facilitation observed after a 30-min lag. In this regard, we have shown that the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor okadaic acid prevented the slow recovery of agonist-induced production of DAG (26Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, but not 2B, prolongs the period during which release inhibition by DHPG is observed. 2A. Sistiaga and J. Sánchez-Prieto, unpublished results. Isolated nerve terminals under resting conditions maintain an extracellular glutamate concentration of 0.8 ± 0.2 μm, similar to that reported in the mammalian central nervous system (47Benveniste H. Drejer J. Schousboe A. Diemer N.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1369-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar, 48Lerma J. Herranz A.S. Herreras O. Abraira V. Martin del Rı́o R. Brain Res. 1986; 384: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas the glutamate concentration in the cleft peaks in the range 1–5 mm for a very brief period after stimulation (49Clements J.D. Lester R.A.J. Tong G. Jahr C.E. Westbrook G.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1498-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The data given in this paper that the EC50 value for the loss of facilitation is ∼3 μm extracellular glutamate indicate that the switch in the presynaptic control of release has been set up at the very low end of the range changes in extracellular glutamate. Thus, it is expected that release facilitation is going to be very sensitive to changes in the clearance of transmitter and presumably restricted to conditions under which a strict control of [Glu]ext is maintained. Under these latter conditions, release facilitation might contribute to the reinforcement of glutamatergic synapsis during synaptic plasticity (50Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9562) Google Scholar). An increase in the [Glu]ext has also been related to glutamate neurotoxity (51Choi D.V. Rothman S.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). However, a contribution of the release facilitation mechanism to the neurotoxic accumulation of glutamate is rather unlikely due to the [Glu]ext-dependent switch to inhibition. The desensitization of excitatory responses by extracellular glutamate has also been observed in the case of ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (52Trussell L.O. Fischbach D.G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 53Colquhoun D. Jonas P. Sakmann B. J. Physiol.

(Lond.). 1996; 494: 465-477Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to occur at low μm glutamate concentrations. The fact that very low extracellular concentrations of glutamate promote the switch from facilitation to inhibition in release control may also explain the difficulties in observing presynaptic facilitatory receptors in slices preparations if sufficient glutamate is present to cause desensitization despite the convincing evidence for synaptic transmission potentiation by a presynaptic PKC-dependent pathway (28Malenka R.C. Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1986; 321: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 29Parfitt K.D. Madison D.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 471: 245-268Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in these preparations. In addition, these results may also provide an explanation for the inhibition of synaptic transmission by presynaptic PI-linked mGluRs observed in hippocampal slices (14Baskys A. Malenka R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 444: 687-701Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Manzoni O. Bockaert J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2518-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,31Gereau IV, R.W. Conn J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6879-6889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the facilitatory-inhibitory DHPG-sensitive mGluR is not known, as the presynaptic location of the PI-coupled mGluRs cloned has not yet been detected (56Luján R. Nusser Z. Roberts J.D.B. Shigemoto R. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1488-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), although positive results have also been reported for mGluR5 (57Romano C. Sesma M.A. MacDonald C. O'Malley K. van del Pol A. Olney J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 455-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). However, we have recently found that both the facilitatory and inhibitory effects of DHPG remain in mGluR1-deficient mice, 3I. Herrero, A. Sistiaga, F. Conquet, and J. Sánchez-Prieto, unpublished results. indicating that mGluR5 or an unknown DHPG-sensitive receptor is involved in these effects. We thank J.-P. Pin and E.

Using this phosphopeptide conjugate as a substrate, a calyculin A-insensitive, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, and poly-l-lysine-stimulated protein phosphatase activity was detected in the crude extract of rat brain. The protein phosphatase (designated as CaMKII phosphatase) (CaMKIIPase) was purified to near homogeneity from rat brain.

It was not inhibited by 100 nm calyculin A or 10 μmokadaic acid. Mn<sup>2+</sup>, but not Mg<sup>2+</sup>, was absolutely required for activity. CaMKIIPase was potently activated by polycations. Autophosphorylated CaMKII was dephosphorylated by CaMKIIPase, whereas phosphorylase kinase, mixed histones, myelin basic protein, and α-casein (which had been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and phosphorylase<i>a</i> (phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase) were not significantly dephosphorylated. No other proteins than CaMKII in rat brain extract which had been phosphorylated by CaMKII were dephosphorylated. The stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity of autophosphorylated CaMKII was reversed by the action of CaMKIIPase. Thus, CaMKIIPase appears to be a specialized protein phosphatase for the regulation of CaMKII."

The mammalian serine proteinase inhibitors, or serpins, are a superfamily of proteins that regulate proteolytic events in a wide variety of physiological processes including but not limited to blood coagulation, viral and parasite pathogenicity, intracellular proteolysis, and tumor suppression (1Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serpins inhibit their target proteinases by forming a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the active site of the proteinase, which is in most cases resistant to denaturants (2Cohen A.B. Geczy D. James H.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 17: 392-400Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Serpins are composed of three β-sheets surrounded by eight α-helices and a reactive site domain that is highly divergent among serpin family members and exists as a stressed loop with a canonical conformation that confers the optimal conformation for high affinity association with the substrate binding cleft of the cognate proteinase (3Huber R.

Unlike a typical substrate, the serpin has the ability to form a tight complex that may be essential for inactivation of the proteinase (4Loderman H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Boswell D.R. J. Mol.

Most serpins can interact with more than one proteinase in vitro, but the affinity of such interactions must be determined to suggest physiological relevance. Ovalbumin represents the parent prototype of a unique family of serpins whose members include plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), 2The abbreviations used are: PAI-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2; SCCA, squamous cell carcinoma antigen; PI, proteinase inhibitor; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus-1; pERTKR-MCA, Pyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; α1-AT, α1-antitrypsin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. an elastase inhibitor isolated from monocyte-like cells, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), maspin, proteinase inhibitor (PI) 6, PI8, PI9, bomapin, and SCCA2 (10Korpula-Mastalerz R.

Chem. 1997; 273: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PI6, PI8, and PI9 are unique among the mammalian ovalbumin-type serpins in that they contain a cysteine residue in the P1′ position within the reactive site domain, which is also present in the viral serpin CrmA (12Sprecher C.A.

Ovalbumin-type serpins lack a typical cleavable N-terminal signal sequence but have been found to reside intracellularly (13Scott F.L. Coughlin P.B. Bird C. Cerruti L. Hayman J.A. Bird P. J. Biol.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the functions of members of the ovalbumin family of serpins may not be strictly confined to the cytoplasm. It has been demonstrated that individual mammalian ovalbumin-type serpins can inhibit a variety of prototypic serine proteinases by distinctly different mechanisms using a variety of kinetic parameters (19Faller B. Cadene M. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9230-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although most members of the ovalbumin family of serpins exhibit defined proteinase inhibitory activity, the true physiological targets of these serpins have not yet been identified. PI8 is a 45-kDa serpin that contains the sequence Arg336-Asn337-Ser338-Arg339at the P4–P1 positions in the reactive site domain, as well as the sequence Arg339-Cys340-Ser341-Arg342at the P1–P3′ positions, both of which conform to the minimal sequence required for efficient processing by furin, Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg (20Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PI8 was recently demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of the Bacillus subtilis dibasic endoproteinase subtilisin A (21Dahlen J.R. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14874-14882Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of mammalian convertases have been identified that demonstrate a high degree of functional and structural similarity to yeast kexin and bacterial subtilisin, of which furin is the prototype (reviewed in Ref. 22Denault J.-B. Leduc R FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furin is a ubiquitously expressed, membrane-associated, calcium-dependent serine endoproteinase that cleaves a wide variety of precursor proteins in both the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Furin cleaves at the C terminus of Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg motifs and is involved in the proteolytic processing of the von Willebrand factor precursor, pro-factor IX precursor, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, pro-β-nerve growth factor, viral superantigens, and diphtheria toxin (22Denault J.-B. Leduc R FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, several viral coat proteins, including influenza virus hemagglutinin, measles virus fusion protein, and HIV-1 gp160 (22Denault J.-B. Leduc R FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), are cleaved and activated by furin, a process crucial in the establishment of viral infectivity. In the present study, we demonstrate that PI8 inhibits furin in a rapid, tight binding manner that is characteristic of physiological serpin-proteinase interactions. Recombinant human furin was prepared from a vaccinia virus construct (20Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human PI8 was prepared as described (21Dahlen J.R. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14874-14882Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The K m for furin and the fluorogenic substrate Pyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (pERTKR-MCA, Bachem) as well as the catalytically active concentration of furin were determined as described previously (23Jean F. Boudreault A. Basak A. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The K m for furin and pERTKR-MCA was determined to be 3.2 μm. Active site-titrated furin was used to determine the amount of PI8 needed for a 1:1 molar binding stoichiometry for the determination of kinetic constants. Furin (1.25 nm) was mixed with increasing amounts of PI8 in a total volume of 180 μl in 100 mmHEPES (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mmCaCl2. Reactants were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and pERTKR-MCA was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. The enzymatically released 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was then detected at 25 °C using an SLM Instruments SLM-8000 spectrofluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The data were used to plot the enzymatic rate of substrate hydrolysis against the amount of PI8 used in the reaction. Linear regression to the x axis was used to calculate the amount of PI8 required for a 1:1 molar binding stoichiometry with furin. Inhibition progress curves were obtained under pseudo-first order conditions by incubating the reactants in 0.3 ml of the same buffer used for the titration of PI8. Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme to a solution containing the fluorogenic substrate and the appropriate inhibitor concentration. Reactions for each experiment were started within 30 s, and the enzymatic production of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was detected as described earlier. The final concentrations of the reactants were 2 nm furin, 100 μm pERTKR-MCA, and 4, 8, 12, and 16 nm PI8. Spontaneous substrate hydrolysis was measured in separate experiments and determined to be negligible. The reactions were allowed to proceed until steady-state velocity was attained, and the data were fitted to the integrated rate equation for slow binding inhibition (24Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar)A=vst+(vo−vs)1−e−k′tk′+Ao(Eq. 1) by nonlinear regression using UltraFit 3.0 software (Biosoft) to obtain values for the initial velocity (v o), the steady-state velocity (v s), the initial fluorescence (A o), and the apparent first order rate constant (k′) for the establishment of steady-state equilibrium of the proteinase-inhibitor complex. The data obtained from nonlinear regression analysis were then used in various graphical transformations (25Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 26Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Morrison J.F.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5234-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to obtain the inhibition and rate constants for the interactions of PI8 with recombinant human furin. Antibodies against recombinant human PI8 were generated in rabbits (30Dunbar B.S. Schwoebel E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the IgG fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose column chromatography. Furin and PI8 were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction mixtures were subsequently subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 10 mm CAPS (pH 11) buffer containing 10% methanol. The membrane was blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% azide, and complexes were detected by incubating the membranes with rabbit anti-PI8 IgG, followed by incubation with 125I-labeled protein A and autoradiography. Preliminary studies indicated that the interaction between furin and PI8 obeyed slow binding inhibition kinetics, as the amidolytic activity of furin inhibited by PI8 attained steady-state equilibrium and the data were successfully fitted to Equation 1. On average, ten PI8 molecules were required to form a stable inhibitory complex with one molecule of furin, as determined by titration. The kinetic characterization of the inhibition of furin by PI8 was performed using PI8 concentrations ranging from two to eight times the molar concentration of furin. A family of inhibition progress curves representative of the interaction between furin and PI8 at the chosen PI8 concentrations is shown in Fig.1. As expected, steady-state equilibrium was achieved more readily as the concentration of PI8 in the reaction mixture increased. Data obtained from the inhibition progress curves were fitted to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression analysis, and the results indicated that the initial velocity, v o, was inversely proportional to the concentration of PI8 for each set of progress curves. This suggests that the slow onset of the inhibition of furin by PI8 follows the two-step mechanismP⇌k1[I]k−1PI⇌k2(slow)k−2PI′Mechanism 1 where a loose proteinase-inhibitor (PI) complex is rapidly formed, followed by a slow isomerization to the tight PI′ complex (25Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This observation was confirmed by plottingv max/v o against the PI8 concentration, which indicated a linear relationship with a positive slope (data not shown). The K i for the formation of the initial loose complex was calculated from the slope of the line using the relationshipv max/v o =K m [I]/[S]K i + (1 +K m /[S]), and was estimated to be 7.2 ± 1.2 nm (n = 4). In addition, the apparent first order rate constant k′ was found to increase as PI8 concentration increases, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism. The overall second order association rate constantk assoc was determined by plotting log([P]∞ − [P]t) as a function of time, where [P]∞ = v o/k′ and [P]t is the fluorescence measured at various times between 0 and 20 min for individual progress curves (data not shown) (28Tian W.-X. Tsou C.-L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The slope of the lines obtained is equal to −0.43[I]{k assoc/(1 + [S]/K m )}, from whichk assoc was calculated to be 6.5 ± 0.1 × 105m−1 s−1(n = 4). The overall inhibition constantK i ′ was determined from plots of bothvmax/vsand (v o− v s)/v s versus PI8 concentration (data not shown). The slopes of these plots are equal toK m/[S]K i ′, from whichK i ′ was calculated to be 53.8 ± 10.4 pm (n = 4). To determine the rate constant for the reverse isomerization stepk −2 of the furin-PI8 tight complex, a plot ofk′ against vo/vs was generated. This plot was linear (data not shown), and k −2was calculated directly from the slope of the line to be 2.5 ± 0.3 × 10−5 s−1 (n = 4). Using the relationship t½ = 0.693/k −2, a half-life of 7.7 h was estimated for the reverse isomerization of the tight complex to the loose complex. The value of the rate constant for the formation of the tight complex k 2 was determined by fitting a plot of k′ versus PI8 concentration (data not shown) to the hyperbolic equation (24Morrison J.F.

Using this method,k 2 was estimated to be 3.3 ± 0.2 × 10−3 s−1 (n = 4). To verify that the interaction of furin and PI8 occurs by the suggested mechanism and to justify the use of a hyperbola to describe the relationship between k′ and [PI8], a double-reciprocal plot of 1/(k′ − k −2) versus1/[PI8] was generated (Fig. 2) using the values obtained from Equations 1 and 2 that is linear and crosses the positive y axis at a point approximately equal to 1/k 2 for the mechanism suggested earlier (29Shapiro R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5234-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The y intercept of the plot in Fig. 2 was used to determine a value for k 2 of 2.1 ± 0.8 × 10−3 s−1 (n = 4), which is reasonably close to the value of k 2 determined by Equation 2. More importantly, the plot in Fig. 2 justifies the manipulation of data and determination of kinetic constants according to the suggested mechanism. Complex formation between furin and PI8 was visualized by Western blotting using rabbit anti-human PI8 IgG. As shown in Fig. 3, incubation of furin with PI8 resulted in the formation of an SDS-stable complex that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼225 kDa following reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. In the absence of reducing agent, the complex migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (data not shown). Additionally, no complex was observed following incubation of furin with a PI8 preparation that had been previously heat denatured (data not shown). The formation of a tight, SDS-stable complex between furin and PI8 is also consistent with the inhibition mechanism described earlier. In the present study, we have performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the inactivation of human furin by PI8. PI8 inhibited furin via a two-step mechanism characterized by the rapid formation of an initial loose complex followed by a slow isomerization to a tight, stable complex that was visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The apparent molecular mass of the complex was approximately 225 kDa, which is significantly higher that the predicted mass of ∼140 kDa. Although the reason for the anomalously high molecular mass of the complex is unknown and will require further investigation, the aberrant migration may arise either from aggregation of furin-PI8 complexes or incomplete denaturation of the complex by SDS. It is unlikely, however, that this apparently higher molecular mass occurs as a result of an alternative binding stoichiometry, because furin has only one catalytic center and PI8 has only one reactive site loop to facilitate the interaction. A second immunoreactive species migrating at approximately 42 kDa was seen in lane 2 of Fig. 3, which most likely represents PI8 cleaved as a result of the interaction with furin. The overall inhibition constant for the inactivation of furin by PI8 was 53.8 pm, indicating that PI8 is a potent inhibitor of this proteinase. The initial loose complex of furin and PI8 had aK i of 7.2 nm, which is similar to theK i values of 8 and 6.6 nm for the inhibition of plasmin and chymotrypsin by α2-antiplasmin, respectively (26Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The furin-PI8 loose complex is converted to the tight complex at a rate of 3.3 × 10−3s−1, which is comparable with the rates reported for chymotrypsin-α2-antiplasmin and plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complexes (26Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, thek assoc for furin and PI8 was determined to be 6.5 × 105m−1s−1, which was lower than the rate of inhibition of subtilisin A by PI8 (1.2 × 106m−1 s−1) (21Dahlen J.R. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14874-14882Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but exceeded the rates of inhibition of plasma kallikrein by C1-inhibitor (6.9 × 104m−1 s−1) (32Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar) and human thrombin and coagulation factor Xa by PI8 (1.0 × 105m−1 s−1 and 7.5 × 104m−1s−1, respectively) (21Dahlen J.R. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14874-14882Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as well as the rate of inhibition of granzyme B by CrmA (2.9 × 105m−1 s−1) (33Quan L.T. Caputo A. Bleackley R.C. Pickup D.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10377-10379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These comparisons indicate that the kinetic constants for the inhibition of furin by PI8 are of physiological significance. Furthermore, PI8 is the only ovalbumin-type serpin, as well as the only naturally occurring intracellular human serpin not associated with a disease state, demonstrated to be a significant inhibitor of furin. Previously, only peptide chloromethylketones and an α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) variant have been described as significant inhibitors of furin. α1-AT Portland is an engineered variant of α1-AT Pittsburgh (34Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) that carries an additional Ala355 → Arg mutation in its reactive site domain to provide the minimal consensus sequence for efficient recognition and processing by furin (35Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI8 contains the sequence Arg336-Asn337-Ser338-Arg339at the P4–P1 positions in the reactive site domain that, based upon sequence alignment, is presumably recognized by the substrate binding cleft of furin in this interaction. Interestingly, PI8 contains a second sequence Arg339-Cys340-Ser341-Arg342at the P1–P3′ positions in the reactive site domain, which also may be involved in the interaction of PI8 with furin or another mammalian convertase. The precise sequence in the PI8 reactive site domain involved in the interaction between furin and PI8 is presently unknown. In order for PI8 to inhibit furin in vivo, PI8 must presumably enter the secretory pathway. The ovalbumin-type serpins PAI-2, SCCA, and maspin each lack a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence, but all can be found extracellularly. PAI-2 contains two hydrophobic regions proximal to the N terminus, designated as H1 and H2, that are involved in its secretion through facultative polypeptide translocation. H2 is also homologous to the uncleaved secretion signal in ovalbumin (17Belin D. Wohlwend A. Schleuning W.D. Kruithof E.K.O. Vassali J.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PAI-2 constructs carrying a deleted H1 or H2 region transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated decreased glycosylation and secretion, whereas mutants displaying increased hydrophobicity in the H1 or H2 regions exhibited increased glycosylation and secretion. PI8 shares 62 and 65% amino acid sequence identity with the H1 and H2regions in PAI-2, respectively (Fig. 4). However, if amino acid mismatches are allowed to be resolved by the presence of a hydrophobic amino acid in the PI8 sequence, as shown by an asterisk in Fig. 4, PI8 shares 69 and 100% identity with the H1 and H2 regions of PAI-2, respectively. These hydrophobic regions near the N terminus in PI8 may permit secretion of PI8 in a manner analogous to PAI-2 and, ultimately, the interaction of furin and PI8. Potential PI8 secretion may also be regulated at the level of transcription. In the case of PAI-2, both the cytosolic and secreted forms are encoded by a single mRNA as seen by Northern blot analysis (17Belin D. Wohlwend A. Schleuning W.D. Kruithof E.K.O. Vassali J.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, a Northern blot of poly(A)+ mRNA from a wide variety of human tissues revealed two PI8 transcripts of 3.8 and 1.4 kilobases (12Sprecher C.A. Morgenstern K.A. Mathewes S. Dahlen J.R. Schrader S.K. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29854-29861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this connection, yeast invertase and human gelsolin are two proteins that each have cytoplasmic and secreted forms. The cytoplasmic and secreted forms of invertase are encoded by two mRNA forms transcribed from a single gene through the use of different transcriptional initiation sites, where the transcript for the cytoplasmic form initiates within the invertase signal sequence (36Carlson M. Taussig R. Kustu S. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic and secreted forms of gelsolin are also encoded by two mRNA forms transcribed from a single gene through the alternative use of two promoters. The 5′ region of the mRNA coding for cytosolic gelsolin is derived from two exons that encode an untranslated sequence and translation starts at an internal exon common to both mRNAs, whereas the 5′ end of the mRNA coding for secreted gelsolin is derived from a single unique exon that encodes an N-terminal signal sequence (37Kwiatkowski D.J. Mehl R. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the two distinct PI8 mRNA species may serve a purpose analogous to those of invertase and gelsolin. The mammalian processing endoproteinase furin is actively involved in normal cellular processes and has also been linked to pathological situations. In this regard, furin is involved in the cleavage and activation of diphtheria toxin, a process that is important for cytotoxicity, and is also a processor and activator of the coat proteins of such viruses as influenza virus, measles virus, and HIV-1, a process essential for virus infectivity. The interaction of furin with PI8 results in the rapid formation of a tight complex with a relatively long half-life. Because PI8 contains two hydrophobic regions proximal to the N terminus nearly identical to the internal secretion signals in PAI-2, as well as two forms of PI8 mRNA, also seen with yeast invertase and human gelsolin, it is not unreasonable to suggest that a fraction of the PI8 synthesized may be secreted and interact with furin under normal conditions or in response to specific stimuli. Therefore, PI8 may regulate the activity of furin and, in turn, such events as pro-protein processing and virus infectivity by its secretion, either through facultative polypeptide translocation facilitated by hydrophobic interactions or by alternative transcriptional initiation to produce mRNA encoding PI8 that contains a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence."

Access to useful quantities of the mammalian enzymes has not yet been achieved; therefore, jack bean mannosidase, a readily available enzyme, has become the model system. However, the relevance of this enzyme has not been demonstrated, nor is anything known about the active site structure of this, or any other, mannosidase. Hydrolysis by this enzyme occurs with net retention of sugar anomeric configuration; thus, a double displacement mechanism involving a mannosyl-enzyme intermediate is presumably involved. Two new mechanism-based inhibitors, 5-fluoro-α-d-mannosyl fluoride and 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride, which function by the steady state trapping of such an intermediate, have been synthesized and tested. Both show high affinity for jack bean α-mannosidase (K i ′ = 71 and 86 μm, respectively), and the latter has been used to label the active site nucleophile. The labeled peptide present in a peptic digest of this trapped glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was identified by neutral loss scans on an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Comparative liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric analysis of peptic digests of labeled and unlabeled enzyme samples confirmed the unique presence of this peptide of m/z 1180.5 in the labeled sample. The label was cleaved from the peptide by treatment with ammonia, and the resultant unlabeled peptide was purified and sequenced by Edman degradation. The peptide identified contained only one candidate for the catalytic nucleophile, an aspartic acid. This residue was contained within the sequence Gly-Trp-Gln-Ile-Asp-Pro-Phe-Gly-His-Ser, which showed excellent sequence similarity with regions in mammalian lysosomal and Golgi α-mannosidase sequences. These mammalian α-mannosidases belong to family 38 (or class II α-mannosidases) in which the Asp in the above sequence is totally conserved. This finding therefore assigns jack bean α-mannosidase to family 38, validating it as a model for other pharmaceutically interesting enzymes and thereby identifying the catalytic nucleophile within this family.

This finding therefore assigns jack bean α-mannosidase to family 38, validating it as a model for other pharmaceutically interesting enzymes and thereby identifying the catalytic nucleophile within this family. There has been widespread interest in mannosidases in recent years, largely due to their role in a multitude of biological systems and, as a result, their potential as therapeutic targets. In particular, mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II is involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis and is currently an important therapeutic target for the development of anti-cancer agents (1Goss P.E. Baker M.A. Carver J.P. Dennis J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian lysosomal α-mannosidase has significant sequence similarity to the Golgi class II enzyme and is responsible for glycoprotein degradation (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 3Liao Y.-F. Lai A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The absence of this enzyme causes the genetic lysosomal storage disease α-mannosidosis in humans and cattle (4Daniel P.F. Winchester B. Warren C.D.

These mannosidases have been categorized as class II mannosidases, based on sequence alignment, and clearly belong to family 38 in Henrissat's glycosidase classification (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 7Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Class I α(1,2)-mannosidases have little similarity in sequence or substrate/inhibitor specificity to the class II enzymes and are classified as family 47 (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 7Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 10Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). While a number of these enzymes have been cloned and sequenced, relatively little success has been attained in their high level expression. This has severely limited structural and mechanistic studies on this important enzyme class, significantly slowing the search for potential therapeutic agents based upon their inhibition. In their absence, a suitable model enzyme is necessary, and the jack bean enzyme has been assumed to suit that role, although this choice has not been validated.Jack bean α-mannosidase, although a commercially available enzyme, has not been characterized structurally, nor has its primary sequence been determined. Like the lysosomal enzyme, it hydrolyzes α(1,2), α(1,3), and α(1,6) linkages between mannose residues but also has a broad aglycone specificity (19Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1010-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In common with class II α-mannosidases, the jack bean enzyme is a retaining enzyme (14Howard S. Braun C. McCarter J.D. Moremen K.W. Liao Y.-F. Withers S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), releasing α-d-mannose as first formed product. As such, it is presumed to follow a double-displacement mechanism in which a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed and hydrolyzed via oxocarbenium ion-like transition states (11McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 12Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 15Davies G.

Formation of this intermediate is assisted by general acid catalysis from a carboxylic acid located in the active site. This same residue serves as the general base catalyst for the second, deglycosylation, step. A second active site carboxylic acid serves as the nucleophile that forms the covalent intermediate. The jack bean enzyme, like other class II mannosidases, is inhibited by swainsonine and mannostatin (17Ogawa S. Yu Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Elbein A.D. Szumilo T. Sanford B.A. Sharpless K.B. Adams C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and accepts aryl-mannoside substrates. In contrast, the class I α(1, 2)-mannosidases are inverting enzymes and possess none of these other characteristics (10Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Lipari F. Gour-Salin B.J. Herscovics A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since only two families of α-mannosidases have been established to date, families 38 and 47, of which the former is retaining, it is quite possible that the jack bean enzyme, being a retaining enzyme, may well also be a member of family 38. However, sequence information will be necessary to confirm this prediction.The nucleophilic and acid/base active site residues have not been labeled or identified in any α-mannosidase, nor has any crystal structure been obtained. Jack bean α-mannosidase was therefore chosen for use in the development of new methodology aimed at labeling and identifying catalytically important residues in this enzyme class. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glycosyl fluorides have proved to be valuable reagents for identifying the active site nucleophiles in a range of retaining β-glycosidases (20Withers S.G.

However, the labeling of retaining α-glycosidases with these compounds has been unsuccessful, leading to the development of 5-fluoroglycosyl fluorides to solve this problem (23McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 241-242Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6889-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These fluorosugars behave as mechanism-based inactivators. The good fluoride leaving group at C-1 serves to accelerate the first step of the double displacement reaction, whereas the C-5 or C-2 fluorine slows both steps via inductive destabilization of the carbocationic transition states and results in the trapping of a 5-fluoro- or 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosyl-enzyme intermediate. 5-Fluoro-α-d-glucosyl fluoride and 5-fluoro-β-l-idosyl fluoride have been used to label and identify Asp-214 as the active site nucleophile in α-glucosidase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (24McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6889-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we describe the application of a new label, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride (5FguloF) 1The abbreviations used are: 5FguloF, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride; 5FmanF, 5-fluoro-α-d-mannosyl fluoride; DNPM, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: 5FguloF, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride; 5FmanF, 5-fluoro-α-d-mannosyl fluoride; DNPM, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. to label the active site nucleophile in jack bean α-mannosidase. The identification of the catalytic nucleophile is then made possible by proteolytic digestion of the labeled enzyme followed by HPLC separation of the resultant peptides and localization of the labeled peptide using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to detect specific fragmentations associated with the glycosylated active site peptide (22Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Tull D. Miao S. Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 224: 509-514Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar).CONCLUSION5FGuloF is an effective time-dependent inactivator of jack bean α-mannosidase, forming a relatively short lived (t½ = 72 s) 5-fluorogulosyl-enzyme intermediate. It therefore ultimately functions as a very slow substrate. 5FManF also acts as a slow substrate with a submillimolarK m value but with a much faster turnover rate. The 5-fluorogulosyl-enzyme intermediate formed using 5FgulF was sufficiently stable to allow direct observation of the labeled enzyme by electrospray mass spectrometry and subsequent identification of the active site nucleophile by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic digests coupled with Edman degradation. Inspection of the amino acid sequence surrounding the catalytic nucleophile showed excellent similarity with a series of class II Golgi and lysosomal α-mannosidases and suggests that the jack bean enzyme is closely related to this class of α-mannosidases. Further, the identification of the catalytic nucleophile as the aspartic acid within the sequence IDPFGH thereby identifies this as a key residue within family 38, a group of enzymes of considerable pharmaceutical interest. This result therefore opens the possibility of facile generation of inactive mutants of these medically important enzymes for use in “knockout” studies as well as providing information on the active site that is of value in understanding the mutations resulting in mannosidosis. There has been widespread interest in mannosidases in recent years, largely due to their role in a multitude of biological systems and, as a result, their potential as therapeutic targets. In particular, mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II is involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis and is currently an important therapeutic target for the development of anti-cancer agents (1Goss P.E.

Jack bean α-mannosidase, although a commercially available enzyme, has not been characterized structurally, nor has its primary sequence been determined. Like the lysosomal enzyme, it hydrolyzes α(1,2), α(1,3), and α(1,6) linkages between mannose residues but also has a broad aglycone specificity (19Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1010-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In common with class II α-mannosidases, the jack bean enzyme is a retaining enzyme (14Howard S. Braun C. McCarter J.D. Moremen K.W. Liao Y.-F. Withers S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), releasing α-d-mannose as first formed product. As such, it is presumed to follow a double-displacement mechanism in which a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed and hydrolyzed via oxocarbenium ion-like transition states (11McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 12Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 15Davies G.

Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12559-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of this intermediate is assisted by general acid catalysis from a carboxylic acid located in the active site. This same residue serves as the general base catalyst for the second, deglycosylation, step. A second active site carboxylic acid serves as the nucleophile that forms the covalent intermediate. The jack bean enzyme, like other class II mannosidases, is inhibited by swainsonine and mannostatin (17Ogawa S. Yu Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Elbein A.D. Szumilo T. Sanford B.A. Sharpless K.B. Adams C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and accepts aryl-mannoside substrates. In contrast, the class I α(1, 2)-mannosidases are inverting enzymes and possess none of these other characteristics (10Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Lipari F. Gour-Salin B.J. Herscovics A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since only two families of α-mannosidases have been established to date, families 38 and 47, of which the former is retaining, it is quite possible that the jack bean enzyme, being a retaining enzyme, may well also be a member of family 38. However, sequence information will be necessary to confirm this prediction. The nucleophilic and acid/base active site residues have not been labeled or identified in any α-mannosidase, nor has any crystal structure been obtained. Jack bean α-mannosidase was therefore chosen for use in the development of new methodology aimed at labeling and identifying catalytically important residues in this enzyme class. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glycosyl fluorides have proved to be valuable reagents for identifying the active site nucleophiles in a range of retaining β-glycosidases (20Withers S.G. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5887-5889Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol.

However, the labeling of retaining α-glycosidases with these compounds has been unsuccessful, leading to the development of 5-fluoroglycosyl fluorides to solve this problem (23McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 241-242Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6889-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These fluorosugars behave as mechanism-based inactivators. The good fluoride leaving group at C-1 serves to accelerate the first step of the double displacement reaction, whereas the C-5 or C-2 fluorine slows both steps via inductive destabilization of the carbocationic transition states and results in the trapping of a 5-fluoro- or 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosyl-enzyme intermediate. 5-Fluoro-α-d-glucosyl fluoride and 5-fluoro-β-l-idosyl fluoride have been used to label and identify Asp-214 as the active site nucleophile in α-glucosidase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (24McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6889-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we describe the application of a new label, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride (5FguloF) 1The abbreviations used are: 5FguloF, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride; 5FmanF, 5-fluoro-α-d-mannosyl fluoride; DNPM, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: 5FguloF, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride; 5FmanF, 5-fluoro-α-d-mannosyl fluoride; DNPM, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. to label the active site nucleophile in jack bean α-mannosidase. The identification of the catalytic nucleophile is then made possible by proteolytic digestion of the labeled enzyme followed by HPLC separation of the resultant peptides and localization of the labeled peptide using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to detect specific fragmentations associated with the glycosylated active site peptide (22Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Tull D. Miao S. Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 224: 509-514Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CONCLUSION5FGuloF is an effective time-dependent inactivator of jack bean α-mannosidase, forming a relatively short lived (t½ = 72 s) 5-fluorogulosyl-enzyme intermediate. It therefore ultimately functions as a very slow substrate. 5FManF also acts as a slow substrate with a submillimolarK m value but with a much faster turnover rate. The 5-fluorogulosyl-enzyme intermediate formed using 5FgulF was sufficiently stable to allow direct observation of the labeled enzyme by electrospray mass spectrometry and subsequent identification of the active site nucleophile by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic digests coupled with Edman degradation. Inspection of the amino acid sequence surrounding the catalytic nucleophile showed excellent similarity with a series of class II Golgi and lysosomal α-mannosidases and suggests that the jack bean enzyme is closely related to this class of α-mannosidases. Further, the identification of the catalytic nucleophile as the aspartic acid within the sequence IDPFGH thereby identifies this as a key residue within family 38, a group of enzymes of considerable pharmaceutical interest. This result therefore opens the possibility of facile generation of inactive mutants of these medically important enzymes for use in “knockout” studies as well as providing information on the active site that is of value in understanding the mutations resulting in mannosidosis. 5FGuloF is an effective time-dependent inactivator of jack bean α-mannosidase, forming a relatively short lived (t½ = 72 s) 5-fluorogulosyl-enzyme intermediate.

Binding at 37 °C was rapidly reversible and completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody, LJ-Ib10, previously shown to be directed against the α-thrombin interaction site on glycoprotein (GP) Ibα. By 2–5 min, however, binding was no longer fully reversible and was only partially inhibited by the anti-GP Ibα antibody. Results were similar at room temperature (22–25 °C), whereas the initial characteristics of α-thrombin interaction with platelets were preserved for at least 20 min at 4 °C. Equilibrium binding isotherms obtained at the latter temperature were compatible with a two-site model, but the component ascribed to GP Ibα, completely inhibited by LJ-Ib10, had “moderate” affinity (k d on the order of 10−8m) and relatively high capacity, rather than “high” affinity (k d on the order of 10−10m) and low capacity as currently thought. The parameters of α-thrombin binding to intact GP Ibα on platelets at 4 °C corresponded closely to those measured with isolated GP Ibα fragments regardless of temperature. Blocking the α-thrombin-GP Ibα interaction caused partial inhibition of ATP release and prevented the association with platelets of measurable proteolytic activity. These results support the concept that GP Ibα contributes to the thrombogenic potential of α-thrombin.

Platelet deposition at sites of vascular injury is thought to be enhanced by α-thrombin during normal hemostasis as well as pathological arterial thrombosis (1Fuster V. Badimon L. Badimon J.J.

There is evidence that α-thrombin-induced platelet activation is initiated by coupling of the agonist to specific receptors (4Tollefsen D.M. Feagler J.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is also known that α-thrombin cleaves GP V (15Phillips D.R. Poh-Agin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Mosher D.F. Vaheri A. Choate J.J. Gahmberg C.G. Blood. 1979; 53: 437-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but with no apparent relation to platelet activation (17White II, G.C. Knupp C.L. Thromb. Res. 1997; 38: 641-648Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Bienz D. Schnippering W. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1986; 68: 720-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The agonist activity of α-thrombin depends on proteolysis, a fact explained with the identification of a seven-transmembrane domain receptor stimulated by a tethered ligand sequence exposed as the new amino terminus of the molecule after cleavage of an internal Arg-Ser bond (19Vu T.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). This protease-activated receptor, PAR1, exemplifies an effector mechanism common to a family of related proteins exhibiting distinct specificities as substrates for different proteases (20Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Because the function of PAR1 seemed to explain many of α-thrombin effects on platelets, it was surprising that deletion of the homologous mouse gene, albeit lethal in many homozygous embryos, failed to result in decreased thrombogenic potential in the animals born alive (21Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese R.V.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 381: 516-519Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The subsequent demonstration on platelets of PAR3, another member of the family with specificity similar to PAR1 (22Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), provided a reasonable solution to the puzzle and reinforced the concept that a protease-activated receptor pathway is crucially involved in mediating responses to α-thrombin. Yet the participation of GP Ibα in these processes remains a possibility that must be addressed conclusively. There are apparent contradictions in the reported characteristics of α-thrombin binding to platelets. Only few hundred high affinity sites have been ascribed to GP Ibα (6Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A. Fenton II, J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23776-23783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the latter is present in greater number on the membrane (23Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. Blood. 1983; 61: 99-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a specific anti-GP Ibα antibody has been shown to block the interaction of approximately 5,000 α-thrombin molecules with platelets, abolishing higher affinity sites but also decreasing markedly the moderate affinity ones (10De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A. Fenton II, J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23776-23783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the apparent k d of the highest affinity sites on platelets, 0.25–1.3 nm (10De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A. Fenton II, J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23776-23783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is substantially lower than that reported for α-thrombin interaction with the isolated amino-terminal domain of GP Ibα, approximately 20 nm(24Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. De Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9571-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Platelet binding parameters have been typically deduced from experiments with relatively long incubation times, in contrast with the rapidity of platelet responses to α-thrombin stimulation (25Gear A.R.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1982; 100: 866-886PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gear A.R.L. Burke D.J. Blood. 1982; 60: 1231-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Carty D.J. Spielberg F. Gear A.R.L. Blood. 1986; 67: 1738-1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and may reflect events not relevant for activation. Indeed, the results presented here indicate that GP Ibα accounts for most of the initial α-thrombin binding to platelets but apparently with the same “moderate” affinity assigned to the corresponding isolated functional domain (24Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. De Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9571-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Different conclusions in this regard may be explained by time- and temperature-dependent deviations from equilibrium conditions. The fully reversible α-thrombin interaction with GP Ibα supports the association with platelets of a proteolytically active enzyme that may contribute to activation. Purified human α-thrombin with specific clotting activity between 2,180 and 2,800 NIH units/mg (28Fenton II, J.W. Fasco M.J. Stackrow A.B. J. Biol.

Fenton II, Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research, New York Department of Health, Albany) was radiolabeled with 125I (Amersham Corp.) using IODO-GEN (Pierce) (29Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled ligand, with specific radioactivity between 5 and 7 mCi/mg, was characterized and stored as described (10De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A. Fenton II, J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23776-23783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was used within 2 weeks of iodination. Blood was drawn from normal volunteers, who had denied ingestion of drugs known to interfere with platelet function for at least 1 week and given their informed consent to these experimental studies according to the declaration of Helsinki, and was collected into one-sixth final volume of citric acid/citrate/dextrose, pH 4.5, containing 25 nmprostaglandin E1 (Sigma). Platelets were washed free of plasma constituents using the albumin density gradient method (30Walsh P.N. Mills D.C.B. White J.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1977; 36: 281-298Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with modifications previously described (31Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The epitope of LJ-Ib10 lies between residues 238 and 290 of the amino-terminal domain of GP Ibα. This monoclonal antibody inhibits α-thrombin binding to platelets (10De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A. Fenton II, J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

The rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-TR1–160, binds to one or more epitopes within the 160 amino-terminal residues of PAR1 and abolishes platelet activation induced by low doses of α-thrombin and by the SFLL peptide ligand (35Bahou W.F.

Purified IgG and divalent F(ab′)2 fragments, prepared as reported (36Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R.

Binding was measured according to a procedure described previously in detail (6Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol.

Washed platelets were kept at the temperature selected for any given experiment for 15 min before use. Binding as a function of ligand concentration was measured by adding platelets (2.8 × 108/ml, final count) to a mixture composed of a constant concentration (0.1 nm) of 125I-labeled α-thrombin and increasing concentrations (0.1–1000 nm) of nonlabeled α-thrombin. Each experimental mixture had a total volume of 125 μl. After incubation, platelet-bound and free α-thrombin were separated by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose layer at 12,000 × g for 4 min. Binding isotherms, each consisting of 20 experimental points, were analyzed using the COLD option of the computer-assisted program LIGAND, calculating nonsaturable binding as a fitted parameter (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar, 38Munson P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 542-576Google Scholar). A concentration of 1 nm125I-α-thrombin was employed in time course and dissociation assays. In the latter, a 1,000-fold excess of nonlabeled α-thrombin was added to platelets after incubation with the labeled ligand. The extracytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα was purified from fresh platelet concentrates as reported (39Vicente V. Kostel P.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18473-18479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycoprotein was immobilized onto Sepharose CL 4B beads (Sigma) bearing covalently bound anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibody, LJ-P3 (33Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J.

The binding of125I-labeled α-thrombin was evaluated by mixing 20 μl of bead suspension (corresponding to 3 μl of packed beads) with 65 μl of binding buffer, or other appropriate reagent, and 40 μl of the desired ligand concentration. After incubation at the desired temperature, the radiolabeled ligand bound to the beads was separated from free ligand by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 4 min through a 20% sucrose layer. Binding isotherms were analyzed with the computer-assisted program LIGAND (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar, 38Munson P.J.

Nature. 1996; 193: 167-168Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were stimulated with increasing concentrations of α-thrombin (0.01–100 nm) at a desired temperature, until recombinant hirudin (Iketon, Milan, Italy) was added at the final concentration of 200 NIH units/ml to neutralize the proteolytic activity. Platelets were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice in Tris buffer, incubated for 15 min at 22–25 °C with the specific antibodies or, in control experiments, with mouse IgG-labeled with the same fluorochromes (43Michelson A.D.

Fluorescence intensity was measured on an arbitrary scale, and platelets were considered positive for a given marker when their level of fluorescence was at least twice that of background or control platelets. The release of ATP from the dense granules of platelets was measured by the luciferin-luciferase assay (44Machin S.J. Preston E. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1988; 41: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended in calcium-free Tyrode buffer (31Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) at a count of 2 × 108/ml, and 0.4 ml were mixed with 150 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragment of the anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibody, LJ-Ib10, or the rabbit polyclonal anti-TR1–160 antibody. In control experiments, the same F(ab′)2 fragment concentration of the anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibody, LJ-Ib1, and of preimmune rabbit IgG was used as control. The mixtures were placed in a glass cuvette and stirred at 1,200 revolutions per min (rpm) with a Teflon-coated magnetic bar for 5 min at 37 °C in a lumiaggregometer (Chrono-log Corp.). At the end of the incubation, 50 μl of luciferin-luciferase (Chrono-lume reagent, Chrono-log Corp.) was added, and platelet release was induced by the addition of α-thrombin at final concentration between 0.5 and 3 nm. Luminescence was recorded to monitor ATP release, measured by comparing peak height with that generated by known standard amounts of ATP. Washed platelets at a count of 2.8 × 108/ml, treated with control buffer or test antibodies, were mixed with 3 nm α-thrombin and binding buffer to a volume of 0.6 ml. After incubation for 1 min at 37 °C, platelets were sedimented by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose layer at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant containing free α-thrombin was removed, the sucrose layer was discarded, and the platelet pellet was resuspended with 600 μl of binding buffer. The chromogenic substrate S-2238 (Kabi) (45Blomback M. Blomback B. Olsson P. Svendsen L. Thromb. Res. 1974; 5: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was added into the supernatant as well as the resuspended platelets at the concentration of 0.4 mm, and the incubation was continued for 5 min at 37 °C. The hydrolysis reaction was then stopped with 4% acetic acid, and the release of p-nitroaniline was measured at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-65) after removing the platelets by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 2 min. The binding of 125I-α-thrombin to washed platelets reached a maximum in 5 min at 37 °C but required 10 min and was about 30% lower at 4 °C (Fig.1). Concurrent addition of 1000-fold excess of nonlabeled α-thrombin inhibited the binding of labeled ligand by greater than 90% at either temperature (not shown). In contrast, addition of nonlabeled ligand 20 min after125I-α-thrombin, when binding of the latter was maximum, resulted in 80–95% dissociation of bound ligand at 4 °C but only about 50–60% at room temperature (22–25 °C) and 25–30% at 37 °C (Fig. 2). At the latter temperature, dissociation was approximately 70% when nonlabeled ligand was added 1 min after 125I-α-thrombin, 60% when it was added after 2 min, and 45% when it was added after 10 min (Fig. 2). The dissociation of bound ligand at 4 °C was not only greater in extent but occurred more rapidly than at higher temperatures, being almost maximal in 1 min as opposed to 5 min (Fig. 2).Figure 2Dissociation of bound α-thrombin from platelets. a–c, washed platelets were mixed with 1 nm125I-labeled α-thrombin, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. After 20 min at either 4 °C (a), 22–25 °C (room temperature; (b) or 37 °C (c), 1 μm nonlabeled α-thrombin (filled circles) or the same volume of binding buffer (open circles) was added, and the incubation was continued. All indicated concentrations were in the final mixture. Bound125I-α-thrombin was calculated (see legend to Fig. 1) immediately before and at selected time intervals after addition of the nonlabeled ligand.

The same antibody inhibited the maximum binding to glycocalicin, the isolated extracytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα, by at least 90% at all temperatures tested (Fig. 3). In the latter case, the degree of inhibition was equivalent to that produced by a 1000-fold excess of nonlabeled ligand added concurrently with 125I-α-thrombin (not shown). At 37 °C, the time of incubation between 125I-α-thrombin and platelets influenced the inhibitory effect of LJ-Ib10 on the interaction. Inhibition was essentially complete, i.e. equivalent to that caused by a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, during the first 2 min of incubation, when binding reached approximately 50% of maximum (Fig. 4). With continuing incubation, however, the inhibitory effect of the antibody progressively decreased as compared with that seen with excess unlabeled ligand (Fig. 4). Altogether, the results shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 are compatible with the hypothesis that α-thrombin binding to GP Ibα on platelets becomes progressively less reversible as a consequence of changes related to activation, as they occur better at 37 °C than at lower temperatures. The fact that α-thrombin binding to isolated glycocalicin was inhibited by the antibody LJ-Ib10 in identical manner at all the temperatures tested is in agreement with such a concept.Figure 4Time course of α-thrombin binding to platelets at 37 °C in the presence of the anti-GP Ibα antibody LJ-Ib10. Washed platelets (2.8 × 108/ml final count) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 10 min at 37 °C, with either binding buffer (circles), or 150 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragment of the anti-GP Ibα antibody LJ-Ib10 (squares), or 1 μm nonlabeled α-thrombin (triangles). A constant concentration (1 nm) of 125I-labeled α-thrombin was then added to all the samples, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. All indicated concentrations were in the final mixture. At selected time points (indicated on the abscissa), bound α-thrombin was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Upper panel,results obtained in the 1st min after addition of labeled ligand.Lower panel, results obtained between 1 and 30 min after addition of labeled ligand. Similar findings were observed in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The following experiments were performed to evaluate the time course of platelet stimulation by α-thrombin and correlate the membrane expression of an activation marker, P-selectin, with changes in the accessibility of GP Ibα to antibody probes. Greater than 50% of platelets incubated with α-thrombin concentrations as low as 0.1 nm for 20 min at 37 °C exhibited increased P-selectin membrane expression, and greater than 80% was positive when the agonist concentration was in the range of 1–10 nm; in contrast, at 4 °C there was no significant change relative to nonstimulated platelets even with concentrations as high as 100 nm (Fig. 5). The number of platelets displaying surface expression of P-selectin increased rapidly after stimulation with α-thrombin, reaching a maximum in 20–40 s at 37 °C (Fig. 5). Exposure of platelets to α-thrombin at 4 °C had no significant effect on the binding of an anti-GP Ibα antibody, whereas progressively lower binding as a function of agonist concentration was seen at 37 °C (Fig. 6). Identical results were observed whether or not 2 mm Ca2+and/or 1 mm Mg2+ was present in the incubation mixtures (data not shown). The observed changes in anti-GP Ibα antibody binding started after a time interval approximately 10-fold longer (Fig. 6) than required for increase in P-selectin surface expression (Fig. 5) following α-thrombin stimulation. The concentration-dependent binding of α-thrombin to platelets was different at 4 °C as compared with 37 °C (Fig. 7). Scatchard-type analysis of data generated at 37 °C, performed for comparative purposes even though binding was not at equilibrium (see above), resulted in a plot with downward concavity in the range of ligand concentrations between 0.1 and 3.5 nm and upward concavity at higher concentrations. The data generated at 4 °C, on the other hand, yielded an upward concave Scatchard plot (Fig. 7). The results obtained at 4 °C could be represent by a two-site model, with fitted nonsaturable binding in good agreement with experimentally determined values on the order of 2 × 10−2 (TableI). In contrast to the results with platelets, the binding of 125I-labeled α-thrombin to immobilized glycocalicin was the same at 4 and 37 °C, yielding a linear Scatchard plot indicative of a single class of binding sites (Fig. 7) with a k d of 4 ± 1 × 10−8m (mean ± S.E. of four experiments at each temperature). The latter corresponded closely to thek d of the lower affinity sites detected on platelets at 4 °C (Table I). Binding isotherms generated at 4 °C in the presence of the antibody LJ-Ib10 (Fig. 8) revealed selective and complete inhibition of the lower affinity sites but no effect on the higher affinity ones (Table I). Of note, the function blocking anti-PAR1 rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-TR1–160, did not interfere with α-thrombin binding to platelets at 4 °C (Table I).Table IParameters of α-thrombin binding to plateletsHigher affinityLower affinityNonsaturablekdBmaxkdBmaxN110−10 msites/platelet10−8 msites/platelet10−2Control (range of 3 assays)1.10 ± 0.63–2.70 ± 1.6180 ± 13–211 ± 1034.08 ± 0.23–9.22 ± 0.135055 ± 2151–9436 ± 52701.24 ± 0.41–2.03 ± 0.22LJ-Ib10 (range of 2 assays)2.73 ± 1.21–6.70 ± 2.5182 ± 20–237 ± 107001.50 ± 0.19–2.15 ± 0.10Anti-TR1–160 (1 assay)7.44 ± 3.0186 ± 66.80 ± 2.294195 ± 13630.97 ±"

However, the full-length cDNA sequence for the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 cloned from rat has not been reported.In the current study, we have examined the expression pattern of VEGF receptor mRNA in different rat tissues. By isolating and characterizing the full-length cDNA sequences for VEGFR-2/Flk-1 from rat retina, we have found two forms of the receptor: a long form that is similar to the previously reported sequences for mouse and human, and a short form that has part of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain deleted from the carboxyl terminus. Both forms of the receptor were expressed in mammalian cells and responded to VEGF with a rapid mobilization of calcium.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed two variant cDNA clones for VEGFR-2/Flk-1 from a rat retina cDNA library. They code for two distinct forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1, which represents the first report of the variant for the VEGFR-2/Flk-1. The long form, RRFlk-L, encodes the prototypic form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 that includes a hydrophobic leader sequence following the initiator methionine; the extracellular domain containing seven Ig-like domains (the fourth of which does not contain cysteine residues); a transmembrane region; an intracellular kinase domain that is interrupted into an NH2-terminal half and a COOH-terminal half by a kinase insert domain; and a carboxyl-terminal region (Fig.3 A). The short form, RRFlk-S, encodes a truncated form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1, which is identical to the long form, except for a deletion of the COOH-terminal half of the kinase domain and carboxyl region in the intracellular portion.The cDNA encoding RRFlk-S was found in two of three independent RRFlk clones, so the corresponding mRNA is neither an a artifact of cloning nor likely to be rare. The expression of the short form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 (RRFlk-S) in rat retina was confirmed by RT-PCR with a pair of primers spanning the deletion site, followed by Southern blot with the probe corresponding to the kinase insert domain (Fig. 4). Additional evidence also came from Northern blot analysis when we increased the amount of poly(A+) RNA up to 5 μg loaded on the gel, which shows two bands at ∼6 and ∼4 kb corresponding to mRNAs encoding the long and short forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1, respectively, in rat lung and retina (Fig. 1 A). The short form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 is expressed at a very low level, because it was difficult to detect the ∼4-kb band from any tissue examined in the same condition when 1 μg of poly(A+) RNA was loaded on the gel (data not shown). The RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S are probably alternatively spliced variants of a single gene, because the 3′-terminal tail of RRFlk-S (nucleotides 3223–4016) is found to be exactly identical to the extreme 3′-untranslated region of RRFlk-L (nucleotides 5099–5898). However, the splice site cannot be determined without the genomic structure data of VEGFR-2/Flk-1.The identification of splice variants among the tyrosine kinase receptors has been increasing at a phenomenal rate. Splice variants have been identified for the Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinase Cek9 (34Soans C. Holash J.A. Pavlova Y. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 10705-10709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar) reported the existence of a cDNA encoding a truncated form of VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1 lacking the seventh immunoglobulin-like domain, the transmembrane sequences, and the entire cytoplasmic domain in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It was hypothesized that this variant might encode a soluble form of VEGF receptor that acts as a specific antagonist of VEGF. However, it is interesting to note that in the short form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is truncated, indicating that alternative RNA splicing may play an important role in the generation of functionally divergent receptor activities.In situ hybridization studies show that VEGFR-2/Flk-1 mRNA is highly expressed by cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina (Figs. 5 and 6). This is consistent with a prior report that Flk-1 transcripts were expressed in a row of cells within the inner nuclear layer of retina in adult mice (42Yang K. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our in situhybridization studies also show that VEGFR-2/Flk-1 transcripts are expressed in choroid of the retina (Figs. 5 and 6). Since the RRFlk-L shares all of the sequence information that RRFlk-S has, it is difficult to precisely distinguish the difference in location between these two forms of the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 transcript in the retina. To localize mRNA expression of the two forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 in the retina, we used two different antisense RNA probes for in situ hybridization; one is specific to both RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S, and the other is specific only to RRFlk-L. Comparison of the in situ hybridization results (Figs. 5 and 6) with two different probes suggests that RRFlk-S appears to be expressed by the cells in the border between the inner nuclear layer and inner plexiform layer of retina, where RRFlk-L is less expressed. However, this does not exclude the possibility that RRFlk-S is also expressed in the inner nuclear layer and choroid where RRFlk-L is expressed.To functionally characterize the cDNA encoding for VEGFR-2/Flk-1 isolated from rat retina, we subcloned the full-length coding sequences for both RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S into the expression vector pcDNA3 and transiently expressed them in HK 293 cells. The in vitrotranscription and translation (Fig. 7) clearly indicated the presence of translatable, functional coding sequences. The Northern blot analysis after 48 h of transfection (Fig. 8) indicated that both of RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S mRNA were well expressed. It has been reported that VEGF induces a rapid Ca2+ entry into cultured endothelial cells from bovine aorta, human umbilical vein, and bovine adrenal cortex (43Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). The measurement of cytoplasmic calcium has been considered the most sensitive assay currently available for detecting VEGF activity (44Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been used in several studies including the biological activation of VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1 (7de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar) and hypoxia-induced VEGF gene expression (45Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We used a similar technique to examine the functional response of the expressed VEGF receptors. The addition of VEGF to the HK 293 cells induced a 6–7-fold increase in intracellular calcium in HK 293 cells transfected with either RRFlk-L/pcDNA3 or RRFlk-S/pcDNA3 (Fig. 9, A andB). Mock transfection of HK 293 cells with pcDNA3 did not respond to VEGF (Fig. 9 C). These findings show that VEGF can induce a specific functional response of both long and short forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 encoded by cDNAs isolated from rat retina. They also indicate that VEGF is a ligand for both receptors and that the COOH-terminal half of the kinase domain and carboxyl region of the VEGF receptor-2/Flk-1 (amino acids 992–1343) are not required for this biological response. Further studies will therefore be required to determine if there is a functional difference between the two receptor variants.The Northern blot data indicates that the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 is expressed in the retina of normal adult rat at a relatively high level compared with other tissues examined (Fig. 1). In situ hybridization in adult rat retina shows that VEGFR-2/Flk-1 is expressed in the cells of inner nuclear layer and choroid (Figs. 5 and 6). In situhybridization in mouse retina (42Yang K. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has detected the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 expression in the neural retina during mouse embryogenesis and in the retinal Muller glial cell of adult mouse. The Muller cells are radially aligned and span most of the thickness of the retina and play an important role in maintaining the extracellular homeostasis of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules. The ligand for VEGFR-2/Flk-1, VEGF, is likewise expressed in Muller glial cells (17Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) at a relatively high level in the retina and has been proposed to play a role in vascular permeability and angiogenesis (44Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar). Since VEGFR-2/Flk-1 expression appears not to be restricted to retinal endothelial cells, it is tempting to speculate that the high level of expression for VEGF and VEGFR-2/Flk-1 in the retina might reflect an alternative function for this ligand and receptor. Since VEGF is secreted by the retina under normal conditions, VEGFR-2/Flk-1 on Muller cells may function as a specific uptake mechanism and regulator of the extracellular concentration of this potent signaling protein.

Although several studies have shown that VEGF is expressed and regulated in retinal cells, very little is known about the expression, regulation, and signal transduction mechanisms of the VEGF receptors in neural retina. The cDNAs for the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 have been cloned and characterized from humans (9Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys.

However, the full-length cDNA sequence for the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 cloned from rat has not been reported. In the current study, we have examined the expression pattern of VEGF receptor mRNA in different rat tissues. By isolating and characterizing the full-length cDNA sequences for VEGFR-2/Flk-1 from rat retina, we have found two forms of the receptor: a long form that is similar to the previously reported sequences for mouse and human, and a short form that has part of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain deleted from the carboxyl terminus. Both forms of the receptor were expressed in mammalian cells and responded to VEGF with a rapid mobilization of calcium. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed two variant cDNA clones for VEGFR-2/Flk-1 from a rat retina cDNA library. They code for two distinct forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1, which represents the first report of the variant for the VEGFR-2/Flk-1. The long form, RRFlk-L, encodes the prototypic form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 that includes a hydrophobic leader sequence following the initiator methionine; the extracellular domain containing seven Ig-like domains (the fourth of which does not contain cysteine residues); a transmembrane region; an intracellular kinase domain that is interrupted into an NH2-terminal half and a COOH-terminal half by a kinase insert domain; and a carboxyl-terminal region (Fig.3 A). The short form, RRFlk-S, encodes a truncated form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1, which is identical to the long form, except for a deletion of the COOH-terminal half of the kinase domain and carboxyl region in the intracellular portion.The cDNA encoding RRFlk-S was found in two of three independent RRFlk clones, so the corresponding mRNA is neither an a artifact of cloning nor likely to be rare. The expression of the short form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 (RRFlk-S) in rat retina was confirmed by RT-PCR with a pair of primers spanning the deletion site, followed by Southern blot with the probe corresponding to the kinase insert domain (Fig. 4). Additional evidence also came from Northern blot analysis when we increased the amount of poly(A+) RNA up to 5 μg loaded on the gel, which shows two bands at ∼6 and ∼4 kb corresponding to mRNAs encoding the long and short forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1, respectively, in rat lung and retina (Fig. 1 A). The short form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 is expressed at a very low level, because it was difficult to detect the ∼4-kb band from any tissue examined in the same condition when 1 μg of poly(A+) RNA was loaded on the gel (data not shown). The RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S are probably alternatively spliced variants of a single gene, because the 3′-terminal tail of RRFlk-S (nucleotides 3223–4016) is found to be exactly identical to the extreme 3′-untranslated region of RRFlk-L (nucleotides 5099–5898). However, the splice site cannot be determined without the genomic structure data of VEGFR-2/Flk-1.The identification of splice variants among the tyrosine kinase receptors has been increasing at a phenomenal rate. Splice variants have been identified for the Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinase Cek9 (34Soans C. Holash J.A. Pavlova Y. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell.

The addition of VEGF to the HK 293 cells induced a 6–7-fold increase in intracellular calcium in HK 293 cells transfected with either RRFlk-L/pcDNA3 or RRFlk-S/pcDNA3 (Fig. 9, A andB).

However, the splice site cannot be determined without the genomic structure data of VEGFR-2/Flk-1. The identification of splice variants among the tyrosine kinase receptors has been increasing at a phenomenal rate. Splice variants have been identified for the Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinase Cek9 (34Soans C. Holash J.A. Pavlova Y. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 10705-10709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar) reported the existence of a cDNA encoding a truncated form of VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1 lacking the seventh immunoglobulin-like domain, the transmembrane sequences, and the entire cytoplasmic domain in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It was hypothesized that this variant might encode a soluble form of VEGF receptor that acts as a specific antagonist of VEGF. However, it is interesting to note that in the short form of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is truncated, indicating that alternative RNA splicing may play an important role in the generation of functionally divergent receptor activities. In situ hybridization studies show that VEGFR-2/Flk-1 mRNA is highly expressed by cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina (Figs. 5 and 6). This is consistent with a prior report that Flk-1 transcripts were expressed in a row of cells within the inner nuclear layer of retina in adult mice (42Yang K. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our in situhybridization studies also show that VEGFR-2/Flk-1 transcripts are expressed in choroid of the retina (Figs. 5 and 6). Since the RRFlk-L shares all of the sequence information that RRFlk-S has, it is difficult to precisely distinguish the difference in location between these two forms of the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 transcript in the retina. To localize mRNA expression of the two forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 in the retina, we used two different antisense RNA probes for in situ hybridization; one is specific to both RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S, and the other is specific only to RRFlk-L. Comparison of the in situ hybridization results (Figs. 5 and 6) with two different probes suggests that RRFlk-S appears to be expressed by the cells in the border between the inner nuclear layer and inner plexiform layer of retina, where RRFlk-L is less expressed. However, this does not exclude the possibility that RRFlk-S is also expressed in the inner nuclear layer and choroid where RRFlk-L is expressed. To functionally characterize the cDNA encoding for VEGFR-2/Flk-1 isolated from rat retina, we subcloned the full-length coding sequences for both RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S into the expression vector pcDNA3 and transiently expressed them in HK 293 cells. The in vitrotranscription and translation (Fig. 7) clearly indicated the presence of translatable, functional coding sequences. The Northern blot analysis after 48 h of transfection (Fig. 8) indicated that both of RRFlk-L and RRFlk-S mRNA were well expressed. It has been reported that VEGF induces a rapid Ca2+ entry into cultured endothelial cells from bovine aorta, human umbilical vein, and bovine adrenal cortex (43Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). The measurement of cytoplasmic calcium has been considered the most sensitive assay currently available for detecting VEGF activity (44Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been used in several studies including the biological activation of VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1 (7de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar) and hypoxia-induced VEGF gene expression (45Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We used a similar technique to examine the functional response of the expressed VEGF receptors. The addition of VEGF to the HK 293 cells induced a 6–7-fold increase in intracellular calcium in HK 293 cells transfected with either RRFlk-L/pcDNA3 or RRFlk-S/pcDNA3 (Fig. 9, A andB). Mock transfection of HK 293 cells with pcDNA3 did not respond to VEGF (Fig. 9 C). These findings show that VEGF can induce a specific functional response of both long and short forms of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 encoded by cDNAs isolated from rat retina. They also indicate that VEGF is a ligand for both receptors and that the COOH-terminal half of the kinase domain and carboxyl region of the VEGF receptor-2/Flk-1 (amino acids 992–1343) are not required for this biological response. Further studies will therefore be required to determine if there is a functional difference between the two receptor variants. The Northern blot data indicates that the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 is expressed in the retina of normal adult rat at a relatively high level compared with other tissues examined (Fig. 1). In situ hybridization in adult rat retina shows that VEGFR-2/Flk-1 is expressed in the cells of inner nuclear layer and choroid (Figs. 5 and 6). In situhybridization in mouse retina (42Yang K. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has detected the VEGFR-2/Flk-1 expression in the neural retina during mouse embryogenesis and in the retinal Muller glial cell of adult mouse. The Muller cells are radially aligned and span most of the thickness of the retina and play an important role in maintaining the extracellular homeostasis of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules. The ligand for VEGFR-2/Flk-1, VEGF, is likewise expressed in Muller glial cells (17Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) at a relatively high level in the retina and has been proposed to play a role in vascular permeability and angiogenesis (44Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar). Since VEGFR-2/Flk-1 expression appears not to be restricted to retinal endothelial cells, it is tempting to speculate that the high level of expression for VEGF and VEGFR-2/Flk-1 in the retina might reflect an alternative function for this ligand and receptor. Since VEGF is secreted by the retina under normal conditions, VEGFR-2/Flk-1 on Muller cells may function as a specific uptake mechanism and regulator of the extracellular concentration of this potent signaling protein.

First, ligand-mimicking autoantibodies to the TSHR arise commonly and are the direct cause of hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease (1Adams D.D. Purves H.D. Proc. Univ. Otago Sch. Med. 1956; 34: 11-12Google Scholar, 2Kriss J.P. Pleshakov V. Chien J.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1964; 24: 1005-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Second, intramolecular cleavage of some, but not all, TSHR on the cell surface generates two subunits (A and B) that remain linked by disulfide bonds (3Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, subunit formation has recently been found to occur by cleavage at two separate sites, with the loss of a TSHR segment (C peptide) (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because of the pathophysiological importance of the TSHR, there is presently much interest in characterizing its cleavage sites. A TSHR segment involved in cleavage at the second, downstream site has recently been identified using a chimeric receptor approach (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Site 2 is unrelated to the presence of a specific amino acid motif. Rather, cleavage is abrogated by the transposition into the TSHR of an N-linked glycosylation motif from the homologous region of the closely related, but noncleaving, luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LH/CGR) (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to Site 2, the upstream cleavage site (Site 1) has been much more difficult to localize. Relative to the non-cleaving LH/CGR, the TSHR contains a 50-amino acid “insertion” (TSHR residues 317–366) (7Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) that can be deleted without loss of ligand binding or receptor function (8Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Observations that deletion of TSHR residues 317–366 did not prevent cleavage into A and B subunits and did not alter the size of the A subunit suggested a cleavage site closely upstream of residue 317 (9Russo D. Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2135-2138PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutation of a series of RK-rich motifs in this region failed to abrogate cleavage (10Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32209-32213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent discovery of two TSHR cleavage sites (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), together with the estimated size of the deglycosylated A subunit polypeptide backbone (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K.

Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that, contrary to the previous evidence, cleavage Site 1 did lie within the unique 50-amino acid region. However, extensive mutagenesis within this region failed to prevent cleavage at this site (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We now report fortuitous observations on the effect of trypsin on the TSHR that support and extend the original concept of a cleavage site closely upstream of residue 317. Extensive mutagenesis studies in this region now explain the previous paradoxical data. Thus, cleavage at Site 1 does not involve a specific amino acid motif. Instead, cleavage depends on the presence of the more downstream 50 amino acid insertion. TSHR-10,000 are a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line in which overexpression of the human TSHR (∼2 × 106 receptors/cell) was attained by transgenome amplification using a dihydrofolate reductase minigene (12Chazenbalk G.D.

These cells, as well as CHO cells expressing TSHR mutants (unamplified transgenomes), were propagated in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml). All of the following mutations were introduced into a TSHR unable to cleave at Site 2 (GQE367–369NET) (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as follows. (i) For RK312–313QQ (previously termed CS3)(10), theMluI-EcoRV fragment was substituted for the same fragment in TSHR-GQE367–369NET. (ii) The “D4” mutation involved the substitution of the D4 segment (amino acid residues 298–308) of the TSHR with the homologous region of the LH/CGR. For this, the MluI-EcoRV fragment from TSH-LHR-D4 (13Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar) was used to replace the same fragment in TSHR-GQE367–369NET. (iii) The “D5” mutation from TSHR-LHR-D5, involving the substitution of TSHR residues 309–316 with those of the LH/CGR (13Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar), was introduced into TSHR-GQE367–369NET by the same approach as for D4. (iv) An RK313–314QQ replacement in TSH-LHR-D5-GQE367–369NET (iii, above) was generated by PCR using overlapping primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). (v) Four receptor mutants involved alanine substitutions in the TSHR region between residues 305–316 (AAAA305–308, AAAA309–312, AAAA310–313, and AAAA314–316), and (vi) deletion of amino acid residues 317–366 were also introduced into TSHR-GQE367–369NET by PCR using the same approach. The nucleotide sequences of the PCR fragments were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). Plasmids were stably transfected with Superfect (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) into CHO cells cultured as described above. Selection was with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Surviving clones (>100/100-mm diameter culture dish) were pooled and propagated for further study. TSHR-10,000 cells near confluence in 60-mm diameter culture dishes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pre-incubated (0.5 h, twice) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-high glucose, 4500 mg/l, methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 5% heat-inactivated FCS. The cells were then pulsed (1 h at 37 C) in 2 ml of fresh medium supplemented with 0.2 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Wilmington DE). After aspiration of the medium and rinsing the cells once with PBS, chase was performed for 14–16 h (overnight) in standard, non-selective medium with 10% FCS. Cells were treated for the indicated times at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma) in Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer, with or without the addition of trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml, Sigma), exactly as described by Van Sande et al.

Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl (buffer A) and processed as described previously in detail (12Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A.

Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) A10 or A11 (identical epitopes, kind gifts of Dr. Paul Banga, Kings College, London, UK), was used at a final dilution of 1:1000. Samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) with 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 50 °C) and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were included in parallel lanes. We precalibrated these markers against more accurate unstained markers to obtain the molecular weights indicated in the text. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography on Biomax MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). TSHR-10,000 cells in 100-mm diameter dishes were treated for 2 min with trypsin in the presence or absence of trypsin inhibitor, as described above. Cells were then scraped and processed as described previously (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Samples dissolved in Laemmli buffer with 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using prestained molecular weight markers are described above. Proteins were transferred to ProBlott membranes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), which were processed as described previously (17Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin.

Where indicated, prior to the addition of Laemmli buffer, the protein A·IgG·TSHR complex (immunoprecipitations), the 10,000 × g crude membrane fraction (immunoblots), or concanavalin A-enriched TSHR-261, TSHR-289, and TSHR-309 ectodomain variants (18Chazenbalk G.D.

Biolabs, Beverly MA). N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H digestions were as described previously (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, as described above. Confluent 100-mm diameter dishes of TSHR-expressing cells were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 C with ∼5 μCi 125I-TSH followed by cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (1 mm; Sigma) and processing as described previously in detail (5Chazenbalk G.D.

After the addition of Laemmli buffer containing 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 50 °C), the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. The availability of a CHO cell line (TSHR-10,000) expressing very large numbers of TSHR (∼2 million receptors/cell) (12Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) made it feasible to study the effect of trypsin on the structure of the mature TSHR expressed on the surface of precursor-labeled intact cells. In control cells unaffected by trypsin (trypsin + trypsin inhibitor) (Fig. 1), immunoprecipitation revealed two forms of single subunit (uncleaved) TSHR, previously characterized as having complex (∼115 kDa) and high mannose (∼100 kDa) carbohydrate, respectively (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, the A (broad ∼62 kDa) and B (∼42 kDa) subunits were also evident in the TSHR that had undergone intramolecular cleavage. Light trypsinization of cell monolayers prior to solubilization for immunoprecipitation produced three striking effects. First, this treatment completely abolished the single chain TSHR with mature, complex carbohydrate (Fig.1). The lack of effect on the single chain receptor with immature, high mannose carbohydrate is consistent with trypsin having access to only single chain receptors on the surface of intact cells. Second, trypsin markedly intensified bands migrating at ∼ 50 kDa. The origin of bands of this size, which were observed previously (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), has been enigmatic, and it has been suggested that they represent separate proteins co-purifying with the TSHR (11Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Their reciprocal relationship with the single chain receptor, as well as their detection with a mAb to the extreme N terminus of the A subunit, establishes the ∼50-kDa bands to be smaller than normal A subunits, truncated at their C termini, largely derived from cell surface, single chain receptor. Immunoblotting with the same monoclonal antibody (extreme N-terminal epitope) provided a “steady state” glimpse of the TSHR and its subunits in particulate fractions from these cells. By this detection method, as observed previously (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the major form of TSHR identified in control (trypsin + trypsin inhibitor) cells is the mature A subunit with complex carbohydrate (endoglycosidase H-resistant and endoglycosidase F-sensitive) (Fig. 2). Only a small amount of single chain receptor (with high mannose glycan) is evident. Also in contrast to the immunoprecipitation studies, the B subunit is not detected because it is released by reductionbefore immunodetection. Consistent with the immunoprecipitation experiments, light trypsinization ofintact cells prior to homogenization reduced most of the very broad ∼50–62-kDa A subunit band to a focused band at ∼50 kDa. Most important from the point of view of understanding TSHR subunit structure, the trypsin-induced reduction in A subunit size was much greater for the glycosylated A subunit (up to 12 kDa) than for the enzymatically deglycosylated A subunit (1–2 kDa) (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the small polypeptide fragment deleted by trypsin at the C terminus of the A subunit contains a glycan moiety. Incidentally, although not relevant to this deduction, a lesser amount of A subunit polypeptide of larger size (∼40 kDa) was also evident (Fig. 2). The consistency of this observation in numerous experiments (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) speaks against incomplete deglycosylation and suggests, instead, a “big” A subunit, perhaps formed by intramolecular cleavage only at the downstream site (Site 2). Confirmation of a glycan moiety on the 1–2-kDa tryptic fragment released by trypsin from the A subunit was obtained in125I-TSH cross-linking studies to receptors on the surface of intact cells in monolayer. As reported previously (4Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TSH bound to both single chain TSHR and to the A subunit of the cleaved TSHR (∼75 kDa receptor-ligand adduct). However, after light trypsinization (with the cells remaining in monolayer), TSH subsequently bound to receptors with two forms of the A subunit differing in size by ∼8 kDa (∼75-kDa versus ∼ 67-kDa receptor-ligand adducts) (Fig.3 A). Again, after enzymatic deglycosylation, this large difference in A subunit size was greatly reduced (Fig. 3 B). Examination of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites on the human TSHR reveals that Asn-302, the sixth and last such site, is the only possible contributor to the N-linked glycan moiety removed by trypsin from the C terminus of the TSHR A subunit (Fig.4). The next, upstream glycan (Asn-198) would produce a polypeptide backbone of only 20 kDa, far smaller than that observed experimentally (see Fig. 2). Incidentally, the presence of both normal and small A subunits after trypsinization (Fig. 3 A) was consistently observed in these cross-linking experiments and contrasted with the far lower proportion of normal size A subunit on immunoblotting (see Fig. 2). An explanation for this phenomenon that we favor is that the 2–3-h TSH binding period prior to covalent cross-linking permits trafficking to the cell surface of intracellular TSHR left unscathed by the effect of trypsin only on cell surface receptors. Information on the precise size of the TSHR A subunit polypeptide chain backbone would be vital in designing further mutagenesis experiments to localize TSHR cleavage Site 1. Our previous focus on residues downstream of residue 317 (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was based on observations by us (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and others (11Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 895: 3765-3769Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that the A subunit polypeptide backbone was ∼35 kDa in size relative to standard molecular mass markers. In light of the experiments described above and because extensive mutagenesis downstream of residue 317 had previously failed to abrogate cleavage at Site 1, we reevaluated the size of the deglycosylated A subunit polypeptide relative to a series of TSHR ectodomain variants, truncated at their C termini (Fig.5) (18Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These ectodomain variants provide ideal molecular mass markers because they contain amino acid residues identical to the TSHR A subunit with the exception of a 6 histidine residue tail. After endoglycosidase F digestion, immunoblotting indicated that the TSHR A subunit was clearly larger that TSHR-261-6H and appeared to be intermediate in size to TSHR-309-6H and TSHR-289-6H (Fig. 5). Thus, even if the 6H residue tail retards migration disproportionately to its size (e.g. 2 kDa), cleavage Site 1 is unlikely to be further downstream than TSHR residue 325. Information that the TSHR A subunit included residue Asn-302, together with evidence that the A subunit polypeptide backbone was smaller than previously thought, as well as the inability of mutagenesis downstream of residue 317 to prevent cleavage at Site 1, prompted us to perform further mutagenesis in the region between residues 302 and 316. To use a “readout” of loss of cleavage by TSH cross-linking to TSHR on the surface of intact cells, all mutations (Fig. 6) were performed on a background of a TSHR unable to cleave at Site 2 (GQE367–369NET) (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Prior to appreciating the presence of two cleavage sites in the TSHR, we had observed TSHR cleavage after RK312–313QQ substitution in the wild-type TSHR (10Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32209-32213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, first reexamined the effect of mutagenesis of this potential cleavage site in combination with the GQE367–369NET mutation (TSHR-RK312–313QQ-NET). Cleavage at Site 1 was not abolished. Thus, both single chain and two-subunit forms of the TSHR were detected by 125I-TSH cross-linking (Fig.7). We next broadly targeted the region between residues 298 and 316 using receptors TSH-LHR-D4-NET and TSH-LHR-D5-NET that involve replacement of every amino acid, except two (Ser-305 and Gln-307), with the homologous residues of the non-cleaving LH/CGR (Fig. 6). Cleavage at Site 1 was unaltered (Fig. 7). Because of the presence of an RK motif in the LH/CGR in TSH-LHR-D5-NET, we replaced these residues (TSH-LHR-D5-RK313,314QQ-NET), again without affecting cleavage at Site 1. For “insurance,” we substituted Ala residues for all TSHR residues between 305 and 316, including the two residues not previously altered (Ser-305 and Gln-307). None of the mutations prevented TSHR cleavage at Site 1. Finally, having mutated every single TSHR residue between 298 and 362 (present study and Ref. 6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was apparent that cleavage at Site 1 did not involve amino acid specificity at the site itself. We, therefore, hypothesized that the mechanism of cleavage at Site 1 was likely to involve a separate region in the TSHR. One potential region was the 50-amino acid segment unique to the TSHR (residues 317–366). Support for this concept was our previous abrogation of Site 1 cleavage by replacing, on a GQE367–369NET background, the entire TSHR “D” domain (residues 261–362) (20Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with the corresponding region of the LH/CGR (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The corresponding LH/CGR D domain lacks most of the 50-amino acid TSHR “insertion”. Previously, we had deleted the entire 50-amino acid insertion in TSHR without abrogating receptor cleavage into two subunits (4Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, this deletion had been performed in the wild-type TSHR prior to our discovery of two cleavage sites. Therefore, in the present study, we deleted residues 317–366 in a receptor unable to cleave at Site 2 (TSHR-Δ50-NET). Cleavage at Site 1 was largely abolished (Fig. 7), confirming our hypothesis. Intramolecular cleavage of the TSHR has been very difficult to study. First, it has only recently been learned that there are two, not one, cleavage sites in the formation of the A and B subunits (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This information was essential for mutagenesis studies to define the individual cleavage sites. Second, it is now evident that neither cleavage at Site 1 nor cleavage at Site 2 depends on the presence of a specific amino acid motif. Thus, we now show that every amino acid residue in the region of Site 1, including the RK-rich region at residues 310–313, can be altered without preventing cleavage. Similarly, in the case of Site 2, we previously observed that cleavage was unaffected by amino acid substitutions, but was only abolished by the transposition of a glycan motif present at the same site in the LH/CGR, but not in the TSHR. The nonspecificity of the amino acids at both cleavage Sites 1 and 2 suggests that external factors are involved in the cleavage mechanism. For Site 2, we hypothesize that a proteolytic enzyme, possibly a metalloprotease (21Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A. Hai M.-T. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with “relaxed” specificity (22Black R.A. Durie F.H. Otten-Evans C. Miller R. Slack J.L. Lynch D.H. Castner B. Mohler K.M. Gerhart M. Johnson R.S. Itoh Y. Okada Y. Nagase H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), may be equally adept at cleaving the TSHR and the LH/CGR, but is prevented from doing so in the case of the LH/CGR by steric hindrance from the glycan moiety. Whether or not the proteases responsible for TSHR cleavage in CHO cells have the same specificity as the proteases causing TSHR cleavage in thyrocytes is an important question that will be answered when the respective proteases are identified and compared. However, in our view, there are unlikely to be great differences because of the very similar TSHR subunit structure observed in the recombinant TSHR in CHO cells and the TSHR in a well differentiated rat thyroid cell line (3Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The novel feature about cleavage at Site 1 (present report) is the involvement of the 50 amino acid segment that is present only in the TSHR and not in the other, non-cleaving glycoprotein hormone receptors. This 50-residue segment does not play a role in cleavage at Site 2 because deletion of this entire segment, which leads to non-cleavage at Site 1, does not abrogate TSHR cleavage (4Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After deletion of residues 317–366, intramolecular cleavage of the holoreceptor can only be abrogated when cleavage at Site 2 is prevented. The mechanism by which the TSHR 50 residue insertion contributes to cleavage at Site 1 will be of interest in future studies. We suggest two hypotheses. First, this segment may contain a binding site for a presently unidentified protease. Second, the segment may, itself, contain intrinsic proteolytic activity for an adjacent region (Site 1) in the TSHR. It should be noted that the boundaries of the TSHR 50 amino acid insertion (residues 317–366) (7Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) are inexact because of low homology in adjacent regions between the TSHR and LH/CGR. Evidence that TSHR cleavage Site 1 (present study) and Site 2 (6Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) coincide relatively closely to residues 317–366, together with the previous observation that TSHR residues 317–366 can be deleted without loss of receptor function (8Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), supports the definition of these boundaries and suggests that these residues largely correspond to a C peptide that must be excised and released during TSHR intramolecular cleavage at two sites. Purification of the putative C peptide for determination of its amino acid composition and N terminus residues is an important, but presently unfeasible, goal. Thus, TSHR intramolecular cleavage cannot be studied in systems conducive to high level TSHR expression (prokaryotic or insect cells), but is only evident in mammalian cells. The mammalian cell TSHR has never been purified. Moreover, the C peptide is no longer present in such receptors after cleavage. Prohibitively small quantities of C peptide are released into relatively large volumes of culture medium. In summary, novel information on the process of TSHR intramolecular cleavage provides new insight into the subunit structure of the TSHR. The data open the way to future studies on the functional importance of TSHR cleavage, as well as the potential role of the unusual TSHR subunit structure in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease.

Basal levels of SSAT activity and steady-state mRNA in the transgenic fibroblasts were about ∼20- and ∼40-fold higher than in nontransgenic fibroblasts. Consistent with activated polyamine catabolism, there was an overaccumulation of putrescine andN 1-acetylspermidine and a decrease in spermidine and spermine pools. Treatment with the polyamine analogueN 1 ,N 11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) increased SSAT activity in the transgenic fibroblasts ∼380-fold, whereas mRNA increased only ∼3-fold, indicating post-mRNA regulation. SSAT activity in the nontransgenic fibroblasts increased ∼200-fold. By Western blot, enzyme protein was found to increase ∼46 times higher in the treated transgenic fibroblasts than non-transgenic fibroblasts: a value comparable to 36-fold differential in enzyme activity. With DENSPM treatment, spermidine pools were more rapidly depleted in the transgenic fibroblasts than in nontransgenic fibroblasts. Similarly, transgenic fibroblasts were much more sensitive to DENSPM-induced growth inhibition. This was not diminished by co-treatment with an inhibitor of polyamine oxidase, suggesting that growth inhibition was due to polyamine depletion per se as opposed to oxidative stress. Since the two fibroblasts were genetically identical except for the transgene, the various metabolic and growth response differences are directly attributable to overexpression of SSAT.

Deregulated polyamine biosynthesis as indicated by overexpressed ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; DENSPM,N 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine; SSAT, spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; DENSPM,N 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine; SSAT, spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. activity is a well recognized characteristic of animal and human cancers. In at least one tumor type, the genetic basis for this has been attributed to a point mutation leading to stabilization of the enzyme protein (1Tamori A. Nishiguchi S. Kuroki T. Koh N. Kobayashi K. Yano Y. Otani S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3500-3503PubMed Google Scholar). Although several groups have reported that ODC may play a causative role in the process of cell transformation in cultured systems (2Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Hölttä E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 3Moshier J.A. Dosescu J. Skunca M. Luk G.D. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2618-2622PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2313-2316PubMed Google Scholar), that function appears to be attenuated in vivo. Transgenic mice that systemically overexpress native ODC by at least 20-fold fail to show an increased incidence of tumors in any of their tissues (5Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler P.A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar). More likely, the enzyme interacts with other genes to fulfill a facilitating role in tumorigenesis not unlike that seen with oncogene cooperativity, a phenomenon that has been previously demonstrated between ODC andras (6Hibshoosh H. Johnson M. Weistein I.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). This potential is clearly indicated in mouse skin carcinogenesis models where induction of ODC activity represents an early response to tumor promoters (7O'Brien T.G. Simsiman R.C. Boutwell R.K. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 1662-1670PubMed Google Scholar) and is known to be critical to tumor formation (8Takigawa M. Verman A.K. Simsiman R.C. Boutwell R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Weeks C.F. Hermann A.L. Nelson F.R. Slaga T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6028-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this regard, O'Brien's group (10O'Brien T.G. Megosh L.C. Gilliard G. Soler A.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2630-2637PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that transgenic mice that overexpress a stabilized form of ODC in the skin are much more susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, their findings strongly suggest that among the various components affected by tumor promoter such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, induction of ODC alone is sufficient to activate cells to expand clonally and form tumors. As an alternative to transgenic studies examining the biological consequences of increased polyamine biosynthetic activity, we have attempted to genetically alter whole animal polyamine pools by generating a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses the polyamine catabolic enzyme, spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). Together with polyamine oxidase, SSAT catalyzes the back-conversion of spermine to spermidine and the latter to putrescine, a function that is presumed to lower polyamine pools by facilitating their catabolism and excretion (12Seiler N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Consistent with this expectation, transgenic mice overexpressing the SSAT gene displayed significantly altered tissue polyamine pools characterized by decreases in spermidine and/or spermine and by an overaccumulation of putrescine andN 1-acetylspermidine (11Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). They also displayed a distinctive phenotype, which, ironically, closely resembled that of animals which overexpress a stabilized form of ODC in their skin (5Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler P.A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar). In both transgenics, hair development is interrupted, giving rise to follicular cysts in the dermis, permanent hair loss, and excessive wrinkling of the skin (5Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler P.A. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the common polyamine disturbance is elevated putrescine pools. Although we have reported on the polyamine pool and enzyme changes in transgenic SSAT mice (11Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), interpretation of these studies is complicated by the uptake of dietary polyamines, tissue redistribution of polyamines, and an inability to clearly link SSAT overexpression and/or induction to cell growth. Thus, we have isolated fetal fibroblasts from transgenic animals and their nontransgenic littermates for study in vitro. As described here, they appear to be unique among cultured systems in their ability to stably overexpress SSAT. Previous attempts to constitutively overexpress the enzyme in mammalian cells have been relatively unsuccessful, due apparently to poor translation of the SSAT message in the absence of elevated levels of intracellular polyamines (13Parry L. Lopez-Ballester J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J.M. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gene has been transiently expressed in COS cells leading to an accumulation of putrescine andN 1-acetylspermidine, a decrease in spermidine and spermine pools, and enhanced biosynthetic enzyme activities (15Vargiu C. Persson L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, due to the transient nature of the effect, the relationship of increased SSAT gene expression to cell growth was not clearly resolved. Human SSAT cDNA has been also been expressed in Escherichia coli using an inducible system leading to the conversion of the spermidine pool toN 1-acetylspermidine and a reduction in bacterial growth rate (16Ignatenko N.A. Fish J.L. Shassetz L.R. Woolridge D.P. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Again, this represents an inducible system. Most of what is known regarding the biological and metabolic consequences of SSAT overexpression is based on studies with polyamine analogues such asN 1 ,N 11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM), which potently induce the enzyme (17Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Pakala R. Bergeron R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11744-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Such analogues however, impact on a variety of other systems including the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes and transport, as well as a somewhat paradoxical inhibition of the SSAT enzyme itself (20Libby P.R. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284 (1991): 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although a large number of studies suggest that depletion of polyamines and growth inhibition by polyamine analogues are closely related to induction of SSAT (17Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar,21Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1089PubMed Google Scholar, 22Casero Jr., R.A. Mank A.R. Xiao L. Smith J. Bergeron R. Celano P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5359-5363PubMed Google Scholar), this correlation is complicated by the pleiotropic drug action of analogues and by the comparison of paired cell lines having different genetic backgrounds. Since, as will be reported here, fibroblasts from nontransgenic and transgenic fetuses differentially express and induce SSAT and since they are genetically identical except for SSAT gene copy number, these cells would seem to offer a meaningful system for further studying the biological significance of the enzyme and the cellular consequences of its overexpression. Our present findings with these cells clearly indicate that stable overexpression of SSAT is capable of profoundly altering polyamine pools despite activation of various homeostatic responses. High levels of enzyme also sensitize cells to the antiproliferative activity of DENSPM.

Organs (liver, heart, etc.) and other viscera were removed and used for the detection of transgenecity. The remainder of the carcass was minced with scissors and incubated in trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin, 1.1 mm EDTA, 1% chicken serum; Life Technologies, Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was neutralized with 5 ml of growth medium. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 150 × g and the supernatant fractions discarded. Cells were transferred into gelatin-coated tissue plates. The cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/T-75 flask in 15 ml of medium and incubated for 24 h before any treatments. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted using a Coulter model ZM electronic cell counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Only early passage cells were used for the experiments. In our experience, none of the antibodies available at the time of these experiments satisfactorily recognized mouse-derived SSAT protein (either in tissues or cells). New polyclonal antibodies were generated against full-length SSAT and the C-terminal region of recombinant human SSAT. Primers 5′a (5′-ACA AGG ATC CAA ATG GCT AAA TTC GTG ATC GCG CCA-3′), 5′b (5′-ACA AGG ATC CTG ATG AGT GAT TAT AGA GGC-3′), and 3′a (5′-ACA AGT CGA CCT CCT CTG TTG CCA TTT TTA GCA A-3′) were used for amplification of full-length human SSAT (primers 5′a and 3′a) and C-terminal region of SSAT coding for amino acids 97–171 (primers 5′b and 3′a) by polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned in pGEM-T vector, and the correct sequences were verified by sequencing with the Pharmacia ALFexpress sequencing system (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The full-length SSAT cDNA was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia Biotech) and pQE-32 vectors (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). BamHI-SalI-digested C-terminal sequence was cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-5X-1. The N-terminally His6-tagged full-length SSAT protein was expressed from SSAT-pQE vector in E. coli strain M15 (Qiagen). The cells were grown in the presence of 20 mmputrescine. The expressed protein was purified from bacterial cells by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Purified His5-SSAT was used for raising antibodies in rabbits (50 μg of protein per immunization at 4-week intervals). The full-length SSAT and the C-terminal portion of SSAT were expressed from pGEX-5X-1 vector inE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) by growing the cells in the presence of 20 mm putrescine. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech) affinity chromatography. GST-full-length SSAT and GST-C-terminal SSAT were immobilized onto HiTrap NHS-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech) columns (1 ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These matrices were used for purification of antibodies specific for full-length SSAT and the C-terminal portion of SSAT, respectively. The antibody raised against full-length SSAT was initially used for immunoprecipitation of the samples before Western blot analysis, and C-terminal antibody was used for the detection of SSAT in Western blots. However, because the C-terminal antibody readily recognized SSAT in Western blots without a prior immunoprecipitation and because quantitation of the signals was more reliable without the immunoprecipitation, the subsequent samples were analyzed using only the C-terminal antibody. Western blotting was carried out essentially as described previously (24Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Brown P.J. Haddox M.K. Porter C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14436-14444Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using the C-terminal antibody in dilution of 1:200. Total RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation as described elsewhere (24Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Brown P.J. Haddox M.K. Porter C.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14436-14444Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human SSAT cDNA probe (25Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Pegg A.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used in Northern blot analyses. The ODC and SSAT activities were assayed as described previously (19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Polyamines, their acetylated derivatives, and DENSPM were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography as described by Kramer et al. (26Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Basal SSAT activity in transgenic fibroblasts was ∼20 times higher than that seen in the nontransgenic cells (TableI), whereas steady-state mRNA was 40 times higher as seen in Northern blots for the two cell types (Fig.1). Transgenic fibroblasts displayed characteristic signs of activation of polyamine catabolism, including a modest decrease spermidine and spermine pools and elevated putrescine and N 1-acetylspermidine pools. In addition, large amounts of exogenous polyamines were seen in the media indicating that the higher levels of SSAT activity facilitated polyamine excretion out of the cell (18Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Pakala R. Bergeron R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11744-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Putrescine andN 1-acetylspermidine were 2- and 10-fold higher, respectively, in the media of untreated transgenic fibroblast cultures versus that from nontransgenic cultures (data not shown). An increased rate of biosynthetic flux in the transgenic fibroblasts due to elevated ODC activity (Table I) probably also contributes to this process. These various polyamine disturbances seemed to be unrelated to cell growth since the two fibroblast types grew very similarly with doubling times of ∼48 h, respectively (Fig.2).Table ICell growth, SSAT activity, and polyamine pools in primary fetal fibroblasts from nontransgenic and transgenic mice exposed to DENSPM or spermine for 48 hCell type and treatment (48 h)Relative cell growthODC activitySSAT activityPut1-aPut, putrescine; Ac-Spd,N 1-acetylspermidine; Spd, spermidine; Spm, spermine.AcSpdSpdSpmDENSPM%nmol/h/mgpmol/min/mgpmol/106 cellsNontransgenic1001.64111504833502080+ 10 μmDENSPM910.2721237492782228150+ 10 μmSpm92ND1-bND, not determined.10<10<106162594Transgenic1004.24200182043228301634+ 10 μmDENSPM390.0176990479776539085+ 10 μmSpm80ND18442439044030521-a Put, putrescine; Ac-Spd,N 1-acetylspermidine; Spd, spermidine; Spm, spermine.1-b ND, not determined.

As indicated in Table I, DENSPM dramatically enhanced SSAT activity in both nontransgenic and transgenic cells by 200- and 380-fold, respectively. More impressively, the actual level of induced SSAT activity in transgenic fibroblasts at 48 h was ∼77,000 pmol/min/mg as compared with ∼2,100 in the nontransgenic cells. Despite this large difference in activity, all polyamine pools were almost totally depleted in both cell types by 48 h (Table I). Analogue down-regulation of ODC undoubtedly contributed to this effect. The finding that DENSPM-treated transgenic fibroblasts contained lessN 1-acetylspermidine than untreated cells is attributable to the lack of available spermidine to acetylate. A time-course analysis of analogue-induced growth inhibition (at 3 or 10 μm DENSPM) illustrates the much greater sensitivity of the transgenic fibroblasts relative to the remarkably resistant normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2), a phenomenon that is investigated in greater detail below. In comparison with the analogue, the natural polyamine spermine only marginally induced SSAT activity, a finding consistent with earlier evidence that DENSPM but not SPM is capable of markedly stabilizing the enzyme protein (28Libby P.R Henderson M. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6226-6231PubMed Google Scholar, 29Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Balana-Founce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Spermidine pools were markedly reduced ∼80% in both transgenic and non-transgenic fibroblasts (Table I). This is probably attributable in part to analogue down-regulation of ODC (and presumably SAMDC) activity. Spermine pools were, not surprisingly, somewhat elevated due to uptake of the exogenous polyamine. Fig. 1 shows the SSAT mRNA levels and activities in untreated and DENSPM-treated cells at 48 h. As described above, steady-state levels of the message were 40 times higher in transgenic than nontransgenic fibroblasts, resulting in a 18-fold difference in basal enzyme activities. Exposure to the analogue elevated mRNA levels only ∼3-fold in both cell types, It is noteworthy that in DENSPM-treated nontransgenic fibroblasts, SSAT activity was more than 10 times higher than that in untreated transgenic cells, whereas the message level was less than one tenth that of the untreated transgenic cells (Fig. 1). This supports the view that even high levels of SSAT message are very poorly translated in the absence of analogue or excess polyamines (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J.M. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The amount of SSAT protein was also analyzed. In our experience, previous antibody preparations raised against human SSAT protein reacted poorly with the mouse enzyme in Western blots, a problem that is unexpected since the mouse and human deduced sequences differ in only six amino acids (33Fogel-Petrovic M. Kramer D.L. Ganis B. Casero R.A. Porter C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The antibody produced and used here seems to be unique in its ability to sensitively recognize both human and mouse SSAT protein. Fig. 3 shows a Western blot analysis from nontransgenic and transgenic cells exposed to DENSPM for 48 h. The SSAT protein was barely detectable in nontreated samples but was strikingly increased in both nontransgenic and especially in the transgenic cells exposed to the analogue. The amount of SSAT protein was 46 times higher in the analogue-treated transgenicversus nontransgenic cells, which is reasonably close to the corresponding ratio of the enzyme activities (36-fold as shown in TableI). Because polyamine pools were found to be totally depleted at 48 h by 10 μmDENSPM (Table I), we examined the temporal development of this effect at a slightly lower analogue concentration, 3 μm. As shown in Fig. 4 A, SSAT activity rose rapidly in the transgenic fibroblasts to a maximum of 630-fold at 24 h, while, by contrast, enzyme activity increased steadily and much more slowly in the nontransgenic fibroblasts to reach a maximum of only ∼70-fold at 48 h. In Fig. 4 B, it can be seen that nearly 90% of spermidine was lost in just 6 h in the analogue-treated transgenic cells and near-total polyamine depletion was achieved by 24 h. Comparable depletion of polyamines in the nontransgenic cells required a treatment of 48 h (Fig.4 B). Cellular uptake of DENSPM appeared to be initially faster in transgenic cells, due presumably to the more rapid loss of the polyamines. After 48 h, analogue levels were comparable in both cell types (Fig. 4 B, inset), a finding that is consistent with the similarity in polyamine depletion at that same time. The antiproliferative effect exerted by DENSPM in nontransgenic and transgenic cells were studied over a concentration range of 1–100 μm. As shown in Fig. 5, the transgenic cells appeared to be strikingly more sensitive to the antiproliferative action of the analogue than the nontransgenic cells. In fact, 60% inhibition of cell growth was achieved at 3 μm concentration of DENSPM, whereas growth of the nontransgenic cells was largely unaffected even in the presence of 100 μm analogue. The residual growth of DENSPM-exposed transgenic cells is probably attributable to the fact that the cells were initially seeded in the absence of drug and allowed to attach for 24 h, during which time some cell growth apparently occurred. The time course (Fig. 2) indicated very little transgenic cell growth took place after DENSPM addition. It is also remarkable that normal diploid fibroblasts appeared to be fully resistant to the analogue at concentrations that profoundly affected the growth of tumor cells (17Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

Seiler N. Casara P. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) on DENSPM cell growth inhibition. As indicated in TableII, exposure of the transgenic cells to the inhibitor resulted, as expected, in a marked decrease in putrescine and a substantial increase inN 1-acetylspermidine pool. In addition to the intracellular changes, the inhibitor also markedly enhanced the excretion of N 1-acetylspermidine into medium (results not shown). These changes appeared to be associated with a modest growth inhibitory effect, which was not seen in nontransgenic cells (Table II). The use of MDL 72527 in combination with DENSPM failed to decrease growth inhibition in both transgenic and nontransgenic fibroblasts and, in fact, seemed to increase it slightly (Table II).Table IICell growth and polyamine pools in primary fetal fibroblasts from nontransgenic and transgenic mice exposed to DENSPM and/or the polyamine oxidase inhibitor MDL 72527 for 72 hCell type and treatment (72 h)Relative cell growthPutAc-SpdSpdSpmDENSPM%pmol/10 6 cellsNontransgenic None1001823637761616 50 μm MDL 725271061787428201990 10 μm DENSPM962460761146956 72527 + DENSPM882054261184972Transgenic None100179024031421128 50 μm MDL 725278471297226141472 10 μmDENSPM24<1058<10<106970 72527 + DENSPM165551<10<107706a Put, putrescine; Ac-Spd,N 1-acetylspermidine; Spd, spermidine; Spm, spermine.

Previous studies investigating the relationship of SSAT to changes in polyamine metabolism and cell growth have been based on the use of analogues having multiple sites of action and genetically dissimilar cell lines. Typically, this involved comparing analogue effects in paired cell lines, which induced very different levels of SSAT activity (17Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shappell N.W. Miller J.T.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5359-5363PubMed Google Scholar). The present approach minimizes this problem by comparing the effects of SSAT induction in cells that differ only in the number of SSAT gene copies which they contain (11Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Relative to nontransgenic fibroblasts, the transgenic cells showed large increases in putrescine pools, an accumulation of the SSAT productN 1-acetylspermidine, and modest decreases in spermidine and/or spermine pools: findings that are all consistent with activated polyamine catabolism and similar to those seen in certain tissues of the whole animal. Since these events were achieved in the absence of exogenous polyamines contributed in whole animals by diet or tissue redistribution and since the two fibroblasts are genetically identical except for SSAT gene copy number, the findings clearly indicate the metabolic potential of SSAT to reduce higher polyamine pools via the back-conversion pathway. The catabolic events described above were greatly exaggerated by treatment with DENSPM. This lead to a striking induction of SSAT enzyme activity and a severe depletion of polyamine pools, both of which occurred more rapidly in transgenic than nontransgenic fibroblasts. It is interesting that, although the induction of SSAT activity by DENSPM in transgenic fibroblasts was ∼36-fold higher than that seen in non-transgenic fibroblasts (Table I), both were eventually depleted of intracellular polyamines. Although additional homeostatic responses are undoubtedly also involved in preserving pool sizes (27Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar), the findings support the view that some minimal induction of SSAT may be sufficient to totally deplete polyamine pools and that enzyme induction above that level mainly affects the rapidity by which this occurs. This could explain the previous observation that certain analogues induce 20–100 times more activity than others, yet have similar effects on cell growth (19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bernacki R.J. Oberman E.J. Seweryniak K.E. Atwood A. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Clin.

J. 1990; 270: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the magnitude of the enzyme response to DENSPM far exceeds that of the available SSAT mRNA, indicating that a significant portion of enzyme induction occurs at levels downstream to mRNA accumulation. Natural polyamines have been shown to enhance the translational efficiency of SSAT mRNA (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Vujcic S. Miller J.M. Porter C.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas analogues increase both translational efficiency and the stability of the enzyme protein (28Libby P.R Henderson M. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6226-6231PubMed Google Scholar, 29Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Balana-Founce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings are supported by the observation that spermine was much less effective than DENSPM at inducing SSAT activity in transgenic fibroblasts (Table I). On the other hand, steady-state levels of SSAT mRNA were higher in the transgenic fibroblasts relative to the nontransgenic cells (i.e 40-fold) than was basal SSAT activity (i.e. 18-fold), again indicating the need for elevated polyamine pools to maximally translate the message. It appears that relatively low SSAT overexpression as seen under basal conditions has little impact on cell growth since presumably compensatory homeostatic responses tend to minimize polyamine pool effects (27Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Fölsch U.R. Löser C. Falk Symposium on Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar). During DENSPM treatment, however, transgenic fibroblasts were distinctly more sensitive to growth inhibition than their nontransgenic counterparts (Figs. 2 and 5). In fact, transgenic cells showed growth inhibition at an analogue concentration that was about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that required to achieve a similar level of growth inhibition in nontransgenic cells. The difference between the two fibroblasts is obvious, and although the finding is similar to previous observations obtained using paired tumor cell lines of diverse genotypes (17Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

Xiao L. Smith J. Bergeron R. Celano P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5359-5363PubMed Google Scholar), the interpretation is, as described above, less complicated. Interestingly, the transgenic animals from which these fibroblasts were derived also showed an enhanced sensitivity to DENSPM.2 The basis for the remarkable resistance of nontransgenic cells to DENSPM growth inhibition is currently being investigated. The downstream event(s) responsible for enhanced growth sensitivity to DENSPM appears to be related to the very rapid depletion of polyamine pools resulting from the analogue-induced burst in SSAT activity. As has been previously shown, this occurs mainly via the excretion or degradation of acetylated polyamines, both of which are facilitated by the induced SSAT (18Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Pakala R. Bergeron R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11744-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Although depletion of pools eventually occurs in the non-transgenic fibroblasts, the rapidity of the event in the transgenic cells may preclude activation of adaptive responses able to minimize the impact on cell growth. Thus, without having time to compensate for the rapid polyamine depletion, the transgenic fibroblast may be shocked into growth inhibition and/or cytotoxicity. It is also possible that the massive induction of SSAT may lead to the inappropriate acetylation of alternative substrates such as histones (36Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and/or rapid depletion of acetyl-coenzyme A, the acetyl donor in the SSAT reaction. At least one group has suggested that cytotoxicity associated with SSAT induction in breast carcinoma cell lines involves polyamine oxidase (37Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero R.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1996; 37: 27Google Scholar), the enzyme that oxidizes acetylated polyamines as part of the back-conversion pathway. The hydrogen peroxide resulting from this reaction could lead to oxidative stress and apoptosis in cells. Our present experiments using an inhibitor of polyamine oxidase MDL-72527 (34Bey P. Bolkenius F.N. Seiler N. Casara P. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) during DENSPM treatment (Table II) tend to exclude this possibility. Rather than decreasing the antiproliferative activity of the analogue, the inhibitor actually increased it in transgenic fibroblasts and had no effect in nontransgenic fibroblasts. In addition to clearly indicating the metabolic consequences of SSAT overexpression in cultured cells, the present results provide some of the most compelling evidence to date for the role of SSAT induction in DENSPM-mediated growth inhibition. Although the present results suggest that antiproliferative activity is mediated via polyamine depletion as opposed to oxidative stress, this relationship may be very cell-type dependent.

https://openalex.org/W2025533401,"Eps15 is a phosphorylation substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase. In vivo, it is largely found in complex with AP-2, the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor protein complex. Although AP-2 is uniformly distributed across the surface of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, Eps15 is preferentially found in the rims of endocytic clathrin-coated pits (1). This observation suggests that Eps15 may disengage from AP-2 during coat formation. Here we use two new anti-Eps15 antibodies to show that, contrary to our own earlier suggestion, coated vesicles isolated from brain do not contain detectable amounts of Eps15. Furthermore, when AP-2 complexes that are saturated with Eps15 are used for in vitro assembly of clathrin-AP-2 coats, normal structures are formed that contain the expected amounts of clathrin and AP-2, but the amount of Eps15 present is dramatically lower than that of AP-2. We propose that during coated pit formation, addition of clathrin to the growing edge at the rim of the pit releases Eps15 from AP-2. Eps15 is a phosphorylation substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase. In vivo, it is largely found in complex with AP-2, the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor protein complex. Although AP-2 is uniformly distributed across the surface of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, Eps15 is preferentially found in the rims of endocytic clathrin-coated pits (1).

Here we use two new anti-Eps15 antibodies to show that, contrary to our own earlier suggestion, coated vesicles isolated from brain do not contain detectable amounts of Eps15.

We propose that during coated pit formation, addition of clathrin to the growing edge at the rim of the pit releases Eps15 from AP-2. During the past decade, several groups have extensively studied the protein components and the mechanism responsible for the formation of clathrin-coated pits. Clathrin and its tetrameric adaptors AP-1 and AP-2 are among the best characterized structural elements of the coat (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr.

The interaction involves a short segment located in the hinge region of the β chain of AP-2 (5Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

Eps15-AP-2 complexes are found both in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

In solution, the interaction between Eps15 and AP-2 involves a short segment toward the C terminus of Eps15 and the C-terminal ear domain of the α chain of AP-2 (7Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Most of the Eps15 in the cell is bound to AP-2, whereas ∼80% of AP-2 is free (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound Eps15/AP-2 complexes are mainly found within clathrin-coated pits (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), usually at the rims and growing edges of coated pits (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The formation of coated pits at the plasma membrane requires AP-2 complexes and clathrin to be recruited to the membrane and a poorly understood nucleation event that initiates clathrin coat assembly. After nucleation, new clathrin and AP-2 complexes presumably add to the free edges of the pit, so that an AP-2 complex that is added to the pit early on will move progressively deeper into the pit. How is it, then, that Eps15 is concentrated at the edges of pits, regardless of the state of completion of the pit? We previously examined whether Eps15 is present in coated vesicles (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and found a band of the approximately correct molecular weight in gels of purified bovine brain vesicle preparations. However, this band was not conclusively identified as Eps15, and in the absence of purified Eps15 quantitation was impossible. We recently used recombinant Eps15 to generate polyclonal anti-Eps15 antibodies (11Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; (in press): 273Google Scholar). Here we readdress the question of the quantity of Eps15 present in complete vesicles. We estimate that less than 1 in 1000 AP-2 complexes in vesicles carry Eps15. To further examine how Eps15 behaves during the process of coat formation, we made 1:1 complexes between recombinant Eps15 and purified AP-2 and determined their ability to incorporate into clathrin coats assembled in vitro. We found that the coats formed by Eps15-AP-2 complexes are indistinguishable from coats formed in the absence of Eps15 but that the AP-2 complexes present in the coats are significantly depleted in Eps15. We suggest that assembly of clathrin into the coat results in the disengagement of Eps15 from AP-2. Clathrin-coated vesicles were isolated from calf brains, and clathrin and AP-2 were purified using previously described procedures (12Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H.

Recombinant Eps15 was made inEscherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitriloacetic acid chromatography (11Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; (in press): 273Google Scholar). Stock solutions of clathrin (3 mg/ml), Eps15 (1 mg/ml), and AP-2 (0.7 mg/ml) were used as starting materials for the experiments described here. Protein amounts were estimated by BCA or by SDS-PAGE 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and Coomassie Blue staining using purified clathrin and bovine serum albumin as standards. Polyclonal antibodies specific for the N-terminal 538 amino acids or for the C-terminal 368 residues of Eps15 were generated using the corresponding glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as antigens. The monoclonal antibody specific for the β1/β2 subunits of AP-2 was 6A (15Clairmont K.B. Boll W. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Prior to gel filtration, the samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against coat preassembly buffer (33 mm MES, 8 mm Hepes, 167 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.67 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 0.08% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) or against coat assembly buffer (100 mm MES, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 6.6). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatants (250 μl) were applied to a preparative grade Superose 6 gel filtration column (H10/30, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with coat preassembly or with coat assembly buffer. The samples were eluted at a flow of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and processed for SDS-6% PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis. The in vitro assembly of coats was performed as described earlier (12Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using 1 mg/ml clathrin and 0.25 mg/ml AP-2, in the absence or the presence of 0.3–0.6 mg/ml Eps15. After overnight dialysis at 4 °C against coat assembly buffer, the samples were subjected to a low speed centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 10 min; Eppendorf centrifuge) followed by a high speed centrifugation step (60,000 rpm for 12 min; TLA 100.4 rotor Beckman). The pellets were resuspended into the same starting volume with coat assembly buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining or for negative staining. Assembly of coats was confirmed by direct electron microscopic observation of samples negatively stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate (5Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Images were obtained at a primary magnification of 50,000. Electron microscopic observations of cell sections indicate that, regardless of coat size, the Eps15 present in a coated pit is concentrated at the rim (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The question of how much Eps15 is present in a coated vesicle was left open, however. A band with a molecular weight appropriate for Eps15 was observed on a Western blot, but no purified Eps15 standards were available to allow firm identification or quantitation of the signal. Because recombinant Eps15 is now available (6Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 7Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman O.B. Baulida J. Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Keen J.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; (in press): 273Google Scholar), we combined Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis to estimate the content of Eps15 in coated vesicles by comparison with known amounts of Eps15. The results, depicted in Fig.1, indicate a content of less than 3 ng of Eps15 for ∼20 μg of clathrin in the coated vesicle sample (lane 9). The amount of Eps15 was estimated by comparison with the signal elicited by Western blot in the Eps15 standard (lane 8). The amount of AP-2 in the same coated vesicle sample (lane 9) is ∼3–5 μg. Because the proportion of AP-2 complexes in the cytoplasm that carry Eps15 is ∼10%, it appears that the AP-2 complexes recruited into the vesicle have either been selected to lack Eps15 or have lost Eps15 as part of the assembly process. The ratio of AP-2 complexes to Eps15 is ∼1,000:1 in the coated vesicle sample, and because each coated vesicle contains an average of ∼30 AP-2 complexes, only one vesicle in 30 contains an Eps15 molecule. To determine whether the association between Eps15 and AP-2 s is perturbed by the assembly process, we first made Eps15-saturated AP-2. Recombinant Eps15 at 0.3 mg/ml was mixed with purified bovine brain AP-2 complexes at 0.25 mg/ml and assayed by gel filtration. After mixing, the AP-2 complexes quantitatively co-elute with Eps15 (Eps15 + AP-2, Fig.2 A); Eps15 is in excess over AP-2 by Coomassie Blue stain. Thus, all of the AP-2 complexes in this preparation are bound to Eps15 under the initial coat preassembly buffer conditions. The AP-2-Eps15 complexes elute at the same fractions as free Eps15 (Eps15; Fig. 2 A), indicating that the Stokes radius of the complex is not significantly different from that of Eps15 itself (16Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E. Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Eps15 forms parallel dimers and anti-parallel tetramers of ∼31 nm in length (11Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; (in press): 273Google Scholar), and so this result is not surprising. Presumably this result indicates that the globular AP-2 complexes (∼60-nm diameter) (17Heuser J.E. Keen J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) do not bind at the extreme ends of the molecule. As a control, we also examined whether clathrin could affect the interaction between Eps15 and AP-2 or associate directly with Eps15 in the same coat preassembly buffer. No perturbation of the Eps15-AP-2 interaction was seen under buffer conditions that prevent coat assembly, and no shift in the elution profile of Eps15 was detected in response to the presence of clathrin (clathrin + Eps15 andclathrin + Eps15 + AP-2, Fig. 2 A). We next examined whether the Eps15-AP-2 complex is stable when they are transferred to a solution that facilitates in vitro coat formation (12Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As expected (18Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4437-4441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the AP-2 complexes aggregate under coat assembly conditions in the absence of clathrin, and therefore the amount of material available for gel filtration analysis is reduced. We therefore analyzed the fractions from the gel filtration experiment by Western blot. The gel filtration experiment in Fig.2 B shows no apparent perturbation of the AP-2-Eps15 complex. We next asked whether the Eps15-saturated AP-2 complexes can participate in the formation of clathrin coats. Under the saturating conditions used above, the presence of Eps15 does not interfere with the efficiency of coat formation. Negative stain electron microscopy (Fig.3) shows that the normal barrel-shaped geometry of the clathrin-AP-2 coats was maintained in the presence of Eps15. Eps15 also had no effect on the efficiency of coat formation as estimated by counting the number of coats present in four random fields in the absence of Eps15 (91 ± 11 coats/field) or in the presence of Eps15 (86 ± 1 coats/field). We isolated the coats by high speed centrifugation and determined the relative amounts of Eps15, clathrin, and AP-2 by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The amount of AP-2 in the pellet is unaffected by the presence of excess Eps15 (compare lane 8 with lanes 10 and 12in Fig. 4), but the ratio of Eps15 to AP-2 is very low, far from the stoichiometric ratio expected if Eps15-saturated AP-2 complexes are incorporated into coats without perturbation. Doubling the amount of Eps15 present in the coat-forming reaction may slightly increase the ratio of Eps15 to AP-2 in the pellet, but the ratio is clearly still far from 1:1. We propose, therefore, that the assembly of a clathrin coat interferes with the interaction between Eps15 and AP-2, such that the majority of AP-2 complexes loose their associated Eps15s. Glycerol gradient rate zonal centrifugation analysis confirms that the clathrin coats formed under these conditions have very little Eps15 compared with the amount of AP-2 present in the fractions containing the coats (not shown).Figure 4Displacement of Eps15 from AP-2 upon in vitro formation of clathrin-AP-2 coats. Samples of clathrin, Eps15, and AP-2, either alone or in combination, were transferred from precoat to coat assembly buffer by overnight dialysis. Clathrin coats were assembled, and after removal of aggregated material by low speed centrifugation, the coats were separated from nonassembled material by high speed centrifugation. Aliquots of the resulting supernatants (S) and pellets (P) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Clathrin at 1 mg/ml and AP-2 at 0.25 mg/ml were used in all experiments. Saturating amounts of Eps15 were 0.3 mg/ml (lanes 5, 6, 9, and10) and at 0.6 mg/ml (lanes 11 and12), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown that the interaction between AP-2 complexes and clathrin is severely disrupted by the coat assembly process. Several interpretations of this observation are possible. For example, it is possible that the coat forming process selects only AP-2 complexes that are free of Eps15 and that this selection drives the dissociation of AP-2 and Eps15. However, such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the electron microscopic observations that show Eps15 located at the rims of growing coated pits (1Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that AP-2-Eps15 complexes can bind at the rim of a coated pit, captured (for example) by AP-AP or AP-transmembrane protein cytosolic tail interactions and that clathrin binding then displaces Eps15 from the AP-2 complex. This displacement could be the result of an allosteric change in AP-2 due to clathrin binding (14Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could be due to steric or competitive interactions between clathrin and Eps15 on AP-2 upon binding to each other that results in the disruption of the contact between AP-2 and Eps15. Eps15 and clathrin bind to sites in AP-2 that are very close to each other (17Heuser J.E. Keen J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar): the α ear, the binding site for Eps15 (7Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman O.B. Baulida J. Carpenter G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Eps15, at 31 nm in length (11Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; (in press): 273Google Scholar), could easily span this distance, and the terminal domain of clathrin is ∼7 nm in diameter (19Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is known, however, that clathrin induces a conformational change in the AP-2 complex upon binding and co-assembly to form the coat (14Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); this conformational change may also be involved in the release of Eps15 from the AP complexes at the growing face of the vesicle."

Protozoan parasites rely on preformed purine nucleosides or bases for the biosynthesis of purine ribonucleotides, since they do not contain de novo purine biosynthetic pathways (1Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press, London1995: 89-117Google Scholar, 2Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol.

Parasites and host cells have several common steps in purine salvage pathways, but unique intermediate steps are determined by the response of the parasite to the purine composition of the host's cells or bloodstream. Protozoan parasites have evolved pathways to utilize any purine nucleoside or base in the environment (1Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press, London1995: 89-117Google Scholar). Intracellular hemoparasites, exemplified by the American trypanosomes, have different purine nucleosides or bases available than the extracellular hemoprotozoan parasites, such as the African trypanosomes. In addition, the various life-cycle stages of the African trypanosomes are exposed to diverse environments, which vary from the mouth and midgut of tsetse flies to the extracellular bloodstream of livestock, wildlife, and humans (4Hoare C.A. Mulligan H.W. The African Trypanosomiases. George Allen and UNWIN, London1970: 24-59Google Scholar, 5Vickerman K. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Warren K.S. Immunology and Molecular Biology of Parasitic Infections. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1993: 170-212Google Scholar). The purine salvage pathway can be divided into stages: 1) the biosynthesis of IMP from free nucleosides or bases, and 2) the conversion of IMP to adenylate and guanylate nucleotides (1Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry of Parasitic Organisms and Its Molecular Foundations. Academic Press, London1995: 89-117Google Scholar). The biosynthetic enzymes of the purine salvage pathway are purine nucleoside kinases, hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate transferases, and the purineN-ribohydrolases and/or phosphorylases. N-Ribohydrolases found in both African and American trypanosomes are potential chemotherapeutic targets, since noN-ribohydrolase activity or encoding genes have been identified in mammals (6Gopaul D.N.

Schramm V.L. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recent research has focused on the IAG-nucleoside hydrolase fromT. b. brucei, a hemoprotozoan parasite of livestock (7Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Studies of the T. b. brucei enzyme have established that IAG-nucleoside hydrolase has different substrate and inhibitor specificity, kinetic mechanism, and transition state structure than IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata (7Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reported in this paper is the nucleotide sequence of the iagnh open reading frame, the predicted amino acid sequence, genetic distribution among several parasitic organisms, the relative level of expression of the iagnh mRNA in different life-cycle stages ofT. b. brucei, and a comparison of the kinetic parameters of the purine nucleoside substrates for the native and recombinant IAG-nucleoside hydrolase. The overexpression of IAG-nucleoside hydrolase in E. coli and the purification of the recombinant enzyme provide sufficient protein for structural and transition state studies. The different bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei, ILTat1.1, a pleomorphic strain (17Miller E.N. Turner M.J. Parasitology. 1981; 82: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); T. b. gambiense, IL3250; Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, IL3953; Trypanosoma congolense, IL1180; Trypanosoma vivax, IL2160; were grown and isolated as described (18Vickerman K. Fallis A.M. Ecology and Physiology of Parasites. University of Toronto Press, Toronto1971: 58-91Crossref Google Scholar). Procyclic T. b. brucei, ILTat1.1 (tsetse fly midgut stage), were cultured in vitro and isolated as described (19Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). The trypanosomes were used immediately, or stored frozen as cell pellets at −70 °C. Theileria parva (piroplasm form) DNA was a generous gift from Dr. ole-MoiYoi, International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya (20ole-MoiYoi O.K. Sugimoto C. Conrad P.A. Macklin M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6193-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A continuous spectrophotometric assay for IAG-nucleoside hydrolase was performed, at the appropriate wavelength, with inosine, guanosine, adenosine, orp-nitrophenylriboside as substrate, in 50 mmphosphate, pH 7.2 (7Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Native IAG-nucleoside hydrolase was isolated from the long slender bloodstream form of T. b. brucei and purified to near homogeneity (7Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The IAG-nucleoside hydrolase was dialyzed extensively against 1 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, lyophilized, treated with CNBr and the fragments isolated using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, eluting with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The amino acid sequences were obtained for the N-terminal region and CNBr fragments using automated Edman gas-phase sequencing. The protein fragmentation, sequencing, and mass analysis were provided by the Laboratory of Macromolecular Analysis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Total parasitic RNA was isolated by the modified guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 22Puissant C. Houdebine L. Biotechniques. 1991; 8: 148-149Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA by oligo(dT) chromatography and genomic DNA was isolated by the SDS-proteinase K-phenol method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phage DNA was isolated by the Lambdasorb™ phage adsorbent (Promega) protocol. Plasmid DNA was purified from overnight bacterial culture, by the Wizard™ miniprep (Promega) DNA purification system. A genomic DNA library fromT. b. brucei clone ILTat 1.1 (long slender actively dividing bloodstream form) was constructed in the cloning vector λgt11. Genomic DNA was sheared by sonication to 2–8-kilobase pair DNA fragments, which were purified on an agarose gel and converted to blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase. The fragments were ligated both toEcoRI adaptors and to λgt11 vector dephosphorylated arms, followed by packaging into phage heads and plating on E. coli Y1090 cells (24Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 49-78Google Scholar). Clones and subclones were sequenced using the fmol™ DNA sequencing system (Promega). Two cDNA fragments encoding the 5′ and 3′ halves of the full-length cDNA of the iagnh gene were generated by PCR amplification of total single-stranded cDNA from actively dividing long slender bloodstream form of ILTat 1.1 (25Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990Google Scholar). The 5′-region was cloned by PCR amplification using the synthetic sense primer (5′-TAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′) for the mini-exon-derived sequence (common to all African trypanosome mRNAs) and the codon-based antisense primer (5′-TC(ACGT)AC(AGT)AT(AG)TT(ACGT)A(AG)(AG)AA(ACGT)GG-3′) for the internal CNBr amino acid fragment, PFLNIVE, of IAG-nucleoside hydrolase. The 3′ region was cloned using the degenerate sense primer (5′-CC(ACGT)TT(CT)(CT)T(ACGT)AA(CT)AT(ACT)GT(ACGT)GA-3′) designed from the CNBr fragment and the antisense degenerate primer based on the oligo(dT) primer 5′-CCT20-3′. The above PCR products generated (550 and 850 bp, respectively) were used as 32P-labeled probes to isolate a 3.5-kilobase pair λgt11 clone (24Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 49-78Google Scholar) containing the iagnh open reading frame (ORF) with the ATG initiation codon located 300 bp downstream of the 5′ end. This clone was used as the template in PCR amplification to generate the full-length iagnh sequence. Primers 5′-GGGCCATGGCGAAAACAGTGATCCTCG-3′ and 5′-CCCCTGCAGTCA GTAAACGCGTGTGGAAGC-3′, based on the nucleotide sequence of the 5′- and 3′-regions, were designed to incorporate the underlined unique NcoI and PstI sites and to create the ATG initiation and the TCA termination codons (in bold), respectively. The double-stranded DNA was purified from agarose gel using the Geneclean™ system (BIO101, Inc.) and cloned into the pMOS-T vector and used to transform E. coli JM109. A modified pET-28a(+) expression vector was constructed by excising theBamHI-HindIII cloning site sequence and replacing it with a linker containing 5′-BamHI-PstI-HindIII-3′ sites, thus introducing a unique PstI site in the expression vector. Theiagnh ORF was excised from the pMOS-T expression vector withNcoI and PstI and subcloned into the modified pET-28a expression plasmid vector. Both DNA strands were sequenced using overlapping primers. The modified pET-28a expression vector, containing the iagnh ORF, was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells made competent using the CaCl2method (26Hanahan G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 109-135Google Scholar). A filter blot containing pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-separated chromosomes from T. b. brucei isolate TREU927/4 was a generous gift of Dr. Sara Melville and Vanessa Leech (Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Briefly, chromosomes were separated on an agarose gel by PFGE as described (27Turner C.M.R. Melville S.E. Tait A. Parasitology Today. 1997; 13: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Following staining of the gel with ethidium bromide to visualize the chromosome bands under UV light, chromosomal DNA was transferred onto a nylon filter using standard methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), after nicking the DNA by soaking the gel in 0.25 m HCl for 15 min. The filter was prehybridized, hybridized with 32P-labeled iagnhprobe, and washed under the conditions described for Southern blots. An overnight culture was generated by inoculating 50 ml of 2 × YT (tryptic soy broth 16 g/liter; yeast extract, 10 g/liter; NaCl, 5.0 g/liter) containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin monosulfate (kanamycin A), with a loop of liquid culture E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, containing the iagnh ORF in modified pET-28a, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. The next morning, 5 ml of this overnight culture was added to 300 ml of Terrific Broth (tryptic soy broth 12 g/liter; yeast extract, 24 g/liter; glycerol, 4.0 ml/liter, containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin A) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the cells reached an A 600 between 1 and 2. The cells were then transferred to 15 liters of Terrific Broth, containing 30 μg/ml of kanamycin A, grown in a 16-liter New Brunswick Fermentor, with agitation at 37 °C. Upon reaching A 600∼ 4, the medium was cooled to 20 °C and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, dissolved in 50% ethanol, was added to the medium to give a final concentration of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were incubated with stirring and aeration overnight at 20 °C. The following morning, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgCl2(Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline), and stored at −20 °C. Purification of the recombinant IAG-nucleoside hydrolase (rIAG-nucleoside hydrolase) was based on the previous published scheme (7Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with two additional chromatography steps to obtain highly purified protein. Superdex 75 molecular sieve, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, with 0.3 m KCl, as elution buffer, and/or a “mixed dye” binding column consisting of 2.5 ml each of Reactive Brown (Sigma R-2757), Green 5 (R-2257), Green 19 (R-2882), Red 120 (R-0503); Yellow 3 (R-3757), and Yellow 86 (R-2382), using 10 mm MES, pH 6.5 as elution buffer, was utilized. The rIAG nucleoside hydrolase does not bind to the dyes, and contaminating proteins are retained. The purity of the protein was estimated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. The enzyme was flash-frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at −70 °C. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA (∼1 μg) was performed as described (28Pelle R. Murphy N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2783-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of purified genomic DNA (2 μg) digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases was performed as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two 32P-labeled probes from either theiagnh ORF (iagnh probe) or the 663-bp 5′ fragment of the ORF for the iunh gene (iunh probe) were generated by random priming (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled probe based on the β-tubulin gene (β-tubulin probe) was used as an internal control to determine the amount of mRNA transferred to the nylon filters (30Pelle R. Murphy N.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from T. b. brucei (ILTat 1.1) was digested with restriction endonucleases, which cleave internally and/or externally to the iagnh ORF, and hybridized with the iagnhprobe (Fig. 1, panel B). Endonucleases with one cleavage site within the iagnh ORF yielded two unequal size hybridization bands. A time-dependent cleavage using RsaI did not produce a pattern expected for tandemly repeated genes (data not shown). All endonucleases (except NcoI) that have no restriction sites in the iagnh locus produced a single hybridizing fragment. NcoI, which does not contain a restriction site in the iagnh locus, cleaved the genomic DNA to generate two distinct hybridization bands on a highly resolving long range separation gel (data not shown). The chromosomal localization of the iagnh gene was determined by Southern blot hybridization of PFGE-separated chromosomes of T. b. brucei isolate TREU927/4 (27Turner C.M.R. Melville S.E. Tait A. Parasitology Today. 1997; 13: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using theiagnh probe. The ethidium bromide-stained gel showed the chromosomal band profile (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 1). The autoradiograph showed that the iagnh probe hybridized to two bands with the larger-sized band containing chromosomes III, IV, V, and VI and the smaller-sized band containing chromosomes III and IV. The iagnh probe hybridization signal to the III, IV chromosome band was of the same intensity as that to the III, IV, V, VI chromosome band.Three control probes were used: a cDNA probe containing the T. b. brucei cyclophilin A homologue (cyclophilin probe), 2R. Pelle and N. B. Murphy, manuscript in preparation. which hybridized to the compression zone (lane 3), and a cysteine protease probe (lane 2) (31Mottram J.C. North M.J. Barry J.D. Coombs G.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (lane 4) (32Michels P.A.M. Poliszczak A. Osinga K.A. Misset O. Van Beeumen J. Wierenga R.K. Borst P. Opperdoes F.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which hybridized to the band containing chromosome VI and the band containing chromosome III, IV, V, and VI, as expected (27Turner C.M.R. Melville S.E. Tait A. Parasitology Today. 1997; 13: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The PstI-digested genomic DNA from several protozoan parasites was probed with the iagnh probe at 55 °C and washed under medium stringency conditions (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C) and showed strong hybridization signals with T. brucei gambiense and rhodesiense, T. evansi,T. vivax, T. congolense, and T. cruziDNA and a faint signal with Th. parva and C. fasciculata DNA (Fig. 1 panel C). There were only weak hybridization bands observed against genomic DNA from T. vivax, T. congolense, or T. b. brucei using the IU-nucleoside hydrolase probe (data not shown). The full-length cDNA for IAG-nucleoside hydrolase contains an ORF of 981 bases, a 5′ mini-exon 186 bases upstream to the ATG start codon, and a poly(A) tail extending 90 bases downstream from the TGA stop codon (Fig. 2). The coding region is 53% GC, which is consistent with the average coding region GC content of 51.6% from 31 previously reported T. brucei genes (33Alonso G. Guevara P. Ramires J.L. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1996; 87: 517-523Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A BlastX search of the amino acid sequence, deduced from the iagnh ORF (Fig.3), revealed homology to only two ORF, one that encodes the IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata (32% amino acid identity) and one that encodes the YEIK E. coli hypothetical 33.7-kDa protein in thenfo-fruA intergenic region (33% amino acid identity) (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar, 35Gish W. States D.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Regions of significant amino acid sequence similarity include the N-terminal 20 amino acids and the region from amino acids 158–196. The N-terminal motifXKXXXILDXDXXXDD of the IAG- and IU nucleoside hydrolases are conserved, as is a Presidue at amino acid 26. Another conserved motif (amino acid 182–196) is AEXNIXXDPXAAXXV. The N-terminally processed IAG-nucleoside hydrolase contains 326 amino acids compared with 314 amino acids from the N-terminally processed IU-nucleoside hydrolase of C. fasciculata (6Gopaul D.N. Meyer S.L. Degano M. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5963-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The additional 12 amino acids in the IAG-nucleoside hydrolase are located around positions 5, 170, and 260 relative to the similar proteins. The mRNAs from the actively dividing long slender and intermediate bloodstream forms, non-dividing short stumpy bloodstream form, and the procyclic tsetse midgut form life-cycle stages ofT. b. brucei were hybridized with the iagnh probe(Fig. 4, panel A). The relative amount of mRNA loaded in each lane was determined by hybridization to the same blot of a β-tubulin (Fig. 4, panel B). The iagnh mRNA was expressed equally in the actively dividing long slender and intermediate bloodstream forms and was slightly less expressed in the procyclic culture form. The non-dividing short stumpy bloodstream form showed a decrease in the levels of expression of the iagnh mRNA. However, the levels of stable mRNA expressed between the life-cycle stages is similar to that observed for β-tubulin. E. coli (BL21(DE3)) transformed with the modified pET-28a-IAG-nucleoside hydrolase construct (Fig. 5) expressed over 10% of the soluble protein as IAG-nucleoside hydrolase (Fig.6, panels A and B). About 200 mg of >97% homogeneous protein was obtained from 150 g (wet weight) of E. coli (TableI and Fig. 6, panel C). The protein eluted at a V e/V o corresponding to a M r of 72,000 by Superdex 200 Gel chromatography, while SDS-PAGE showed a single band of aM r of 35,000, consistent with the native protein being a dimer of M r 35,000 subunits. The calculated molecular weight, based on the predicted amino acid sequence from the cDNA, was 35,735 for the rIAG-nucleoside hydrolase. This is within experimental error of the observed molecular weight for the rIAG-nucleoside hydrolase determined by mass spectrometry,M r = 35,737. The observed molecular weight of the native IAG-nucleoside hydrolase, as determined by mass spectrometry, is 35,759, which is 22 atomic mass units different from the rIAG-nucleoside hydrolase. A single codon change introduced by the PCR cloning could account for the difference, so kinetic analysis was conducted to ensure that the recombinant and native IAG-nucleoside hydrolase have identical kinetic properties.Figure 6SDS-PAGE of IAG-nucleoside hydrolase.Panel A: 12.5% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue R250. Approximately 10 μg of protein from total cell lysate of uninduced (in triplicate, lanes 1–3) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced (in triplicate, lanes 4–6) bacterial cultures were loaded in each lane.

https://openalex.org/W1991586169,"DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme in DNA replication in Escherichia coli. It mediates the introduction of negative supercoils near oriC, removal of positive supercoils ahead of the growing DNA fork, and separation of the two daughter duplexes. In the course of purifying DNA gyrase fromE. coli KL16, we found an 18-kDa protein that inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase, and we coined it DNA gyrase inhibitory protein (GyrI). Its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of 16 residues was determined to be identical to that of a putative gene product (a polypeptide of 157 amino acids) encoded byyeeB (EMBL accession no. U00009) and sbmC(Baquero, M. R., Bouzon, M., Varea, J., and Moreno, F. (1995)Mol. Microbiol. 18, 301–311) of E. coli. Assuming the identity of the gene (gyrI) encoding GyrI with the previously reported genes yeeB and sbmC, we cloned the gene after amplification by polymerase chain reaction and purified the 18-kDa protein from an E. coli strain overexpressing it. The purified 18-kDa protein was confirmed to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase in vitro. In vivo, both overexpression and antisense expression of the gyrI gene induced filamentous growth of cells and suppressed cell proliferation. GyrI protein is the first identified chromosomally nucleoid-encoded regulatory factor of DNA gyrase in E. coli. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme in DNA replication in Escherichia coli.

GyrI protein is the first identified chromosomally nucleoid-encoded regulatory factor of DNA gyrase in E. coli. DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase in Escherichia coli, has the ability to cut a double-stranded DNA, pass an uncut portion of the duplex between the cut ends, and reseal the cut. It can introduce negative supercoils into covalently closed circular DNA and cause catenation and decatenation of two different DNA duplexes,in vitro (1Menzel R. Gellert M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 39-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been established that the enzyme is essential for chromosomal replication in vivo (2Wang J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Moreover, there have been reports on the involvement of DNA gyrase in transcription from certain operons, DNA repair, and recombination inE. coli (2Wang J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).DNA gyrase is composed of two subunits, A (GyrA) and B (GyrB), which are assembled in A2B2 complexes, the active form (3Gellert M.

Biol. 1990; 211: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The active complex has been purified from E. coli (6Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5960-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and reconstituted from the purified GyrA and GyrB (7Higgins N.P. Peebles C.L. Sugino A. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GyrA has an active center for the reactions of introducing and resealing the cuts of double-stranded DNA, whereas GyrB powers the reaction by catalyzing ATP hydrolysis.DNA gyrase is a target of two distinct classes of inhibitors, coumarins (10Drlica K. Coughlin S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 44: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and quinolones (10Drlica K. Coughlin S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 44: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Coumarins bind to GyrB and are competitive inhibitors with respect to ATP (11Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, quinolones bind DNA gyrase when the enzyme is complexed with DNA and trap the enzyme in an abortive ternary complex, which, upon treatment with a denaturant, releases cleaved DNA with GyrA covalently attached to the 5′-phosphoryl ends generated at the cut site.There have been several reports on regulating DNA gyrase activity inE. coli. LetD (13Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoded on F factor inhibits DNA gyrase activity via the induction of synthesis of heat shock proteins (14Kaneko T. Mizushima T. Ohtsuka Y. Kurokawa K. Kataoka K. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 593-600PubMed Google Scholar). Another regulatory factor, cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor (15Gomez-Gomez J.M. Baquero F. Blazquez J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3331-3334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), participates in regulation of the growth phase-dependent transcription of gyrA (15Gomez-Gomez J.M. Baquero F. Blazquez J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3331-3334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we discovered an 18-kDa protein, termed DNA gyrase inhibitory protein (GyrI), which could inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase in E. coli KL16. We describe here the purification and characterization of GyrI and phenotypic analyses of recombinant strains overproducing GyrI or expressing antisensegyrI gene to decipher importance of GyrI in the regulation of DNA gyrase activity in vivo.DISCUSSIONWe purified from E. coli KL16 the 18-kDa protein that inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase and coined it DNA gyrase inhibitory protein (GyrI). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and molecular mass of GyrI inferred that the gene encoding GyrI might be identical to the previously reported genes ofyeeB (EMBL accession no. U00009) and sbmC (34Baquero M.R. Bouzon M. Varea J. Moreno F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The yeeB gene had been identified as an open reading frame in the sbcB region, although its function had not been described. The sbmC gene had been reported to decrease the sensitivity to microcin B17 when overexpressed. Microcin B17, a peptide antibiotic of 43 amino acids, is generated by cleavage of a precursor of 69 amino acids encoded by mcbA on plasmids (35Davagnino J. Herrero M. Furlong D. Moreno F. Kolter R. Proteins. 1986; 1: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and appeared to trap an abortive cleavable DNA·DNA gyrase complex (36Vizan J.L. Hernandez-Chico C. del Castillo I. Morneo F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a mode of action similar to that of quinolones. The yeeB andsbmC gene was located at 44 min on the E. colichromosome map. However, there have been no reports on the inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase of the gene products of yeeB andsbmC.To investigate the identity of gene encoding GyrI with yeeBand sbmC, we cloned the coding region based on the reported sequence and purified the 18-kDa gene product from the transformant overexpressing it. In vitro assay of DNA gyrase supercoiling activity indicated that the purified 18-kDa protein indeed inhibited the activity. Furthermore, we confirmed that GyrI protein is not intercalated into DNA and does not inhibit the activity of other DNA-processing enzymes (e.g. DNA polymerase) (data not shown). We tentatively named the gene coding for the 18-kDa protein asgyrI to indicate clearly the biological function of the gene product.It was reported that factor LetD regulates the activity of DNA gyrase (13Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LetD encoded by the F factor functions to kill the host E. coli (37Miki T. Yoshioka K. Horiuchi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 605-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Miki T. Chang Z.-T. Horiuchi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 627-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Ogura T. Hiraga S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4784-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The killing effect of LetD is suppressed by a mutation in gyrA or by overexpression of gyrA, suggesting that one target of LetD protein in cells is DNA gyrase (13Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has been attributed to the following mechanism. Expression of LetD protein leads to synthesis of ς 32, which induces DnaK and GroEL proteins, thus inhibiting DNA gyrase activity (15Gomez-Gomez J.M. Baquero F. Blazquez J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3331-3334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mizushima T. Ohtsuka Y. Mori H. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 297-302PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to LetD, GyrI is the first identified regulatory factor for DNA gyrase which directly inhibits the activity in vitro and is encoded on the chromosome of E. coli.To assess the in vivo importance of the function of GyrI, we examined the morphological phenotype of cells with perturbed expression of gyrI using overexpression of gyrI itself or antisense gyrI. Overexpression of gyrI and expression of antisense gyrI suppressed proliferation of the host cells and decreased the number of the viable cells. Microscopic examination revealed that some population of the cells overexpressing sense or antisense gyrI grew filamentously and had nucleoids with abnormal morphology as described above. The abnormal shapes of cells and nucleoids were similar to those observed in bacterial cells treated with quinolones (41Piddock L.J.V. Wise R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1987; 20: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that the abnormality might be caused by perturbation of DNA gyrase activity in the cells expressing sense or antisense gyrI. Thus, it is conceivable that GyrI is involved in regulation of DNA gyrase in vivo.The promoter activity of gyrA, the gene coding for the subunit A of DNA gyrase, increases in the mid-exponential phase to peak in the late exponential growth phase and thereafter decreases to the level of that in the mid-exponential phase (14Kaneko T. Mizushima T. Ohtsuka Y. Kurokawa K. Kataoka K. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 593-600PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, transcription of gyrI is expressed mainly from the late growth phase to the stationary phase, as assessed by using the reporter system. By dot-blot assay with the anti-GyrI antibody, it was shown that GyrI was synthesized in a pattern similar to that of transcription of gyrI during cell growth. There was found at the 5′ region (−36 to −31) of gyrI a consensus sequence (TATACT) for recognition by transcription factor ς38, which specifically functions for gene expression in the late growth phase (42Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To confirm involvement of ς38 in transcription of gyrI, further studies will be needed. The concerted regulation of expression of the genes (gyrA and gyrB) encoding DNA gyrase subunits and the gene encoding the regulatory factor (gyrI) of DNA gyrase might be critical for DNA replication and cell proliferation.This study demonstrated that disturbance (reduction or amplification) of GyrI levels resulted in suppression of bacterial cell proliferation.gyrI/GyrI might be novel and promising targets for development of new antibacterial agents.

The concerted regulation of expression of the genes (gyrA and gyrB) encoding DNA gyrase subunits and the gene encoding the regulatory factor (gyrI) of DNA gyrase might be critical for DNA replication and cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2095185893,"Improper control of expression of ATP binding cassette transporter-encoding genes is an important contributor to acquisition of multidrug resistance in human tumor cells. In this study, we have analyzed the function of the promoter region of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae YOR1 gene, which encodes an ATP binding cassette transporter protein that is required for multidrug tolerance in S. cerevisiae. Deletion analysis of aYOR1-lacZ fusion gene defines three important transcriptional regulatory elements. Two of these elements serve to positively regulate expression of YOR1, and the third element is a negative regulatory site. One positive element corresponds to a Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element, a site required for transcriptional control by the homologous zinc finger transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p in other promoters. The second positive element is located between nucleotides −535 and −299 and is referred to as UASYOR1 (where UAS is upstream activation sequence). Interestingly, function of UASYOR1 is inhibited by the downstream negative regulatory site. Promoter fusions constructed between UASYOR1 and the PDR5 promoter, another gene under Pdr1p/Pdr3p control, are active, whereas analogous promoter fusions constructed with the CYC1 promoter are not. This suggests the possibility that UASYOR1 has promoter-specific sequence requirements that are satisfied by another Pdr1p/Pdr3p-regulated gene but not by a heterologous promoter.

Mammalian tumor cells can acquire the ability to detoxify several unrelated cytotoxic agents through alteration of a small number of genetic loci. This phenomenon, termed multidrug resistance, often involves the increased expression of an ATP binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; UAS, upstream activation sequence; bp, base pair; PDRE, Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. transporter protein known as MDR1 (reviewed in Ref. 1Gottesman M.M.

Recently, overexpression of a second ABC transporter protein has been shown to also confer a multidrug-resistant phenotype on cells. This membrane transporter protein was designated the multidrug resistance protein (Mrp) (2Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U.

Control of the levels of expression of these mammalian ABC transporters is a critical determinant in the relative drug tolerance of an animal cell. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also contains loci that can be altered to give rise to multiple or pleiotropic drug resistance (reviewed in Ref. 5Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Dominant mutations in the Cys6 zinc finger transcription factors PDR1 and PDR3 result in elevated resistance to a broad array of toxic agents including cycloheximide and oligomycin (6Balzi E. Chen W.

Cells containing a Δpdr5 allele are cycloheximide-hypersensitive but display no oligomycin sensitivity, indicating the presence of a second Pdr1p/3p target gene required to provide oligomycin resistance. This oligomycin resistance gene,YOR1, was subsequently cloned on the basis of its ability to strongly elevate tolerance to this compound when present on a high copy plasmid (11Katzmann D.J.

YOR1 is transcriptionally regulated by Pdr1p and Pdr3p and inspection of theYOR1 promoter region indicated the presence of a potential Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) centered 215 bp upstream of the transcription start site (11Katzmann D.J.

These PDREs have been defined previously by analysis of similar elements in the promoters of PDR3(14Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell.

Northern blot and lacZ gene fusion analysis showed that YOR1retained significant expression in a Δpdr1,3 strain (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This is a marked difference from the behavior of the Pdr1p/Pdr3p-regulated PDR5 gene which is essentially inactive in a Δpdr1,pdr3 mutant background, explaining the cycloheximide-hypersensitive phenotype of this strain (10Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It was anticipated that YOR1 expression would also strongly depend on PDR1/PDR3 since a Δpdr1,3 strain is extremely oligomycin-sensitive (10Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahé Y.

To explore the nature of the differences between the co-regulatedPDR5 and YOR1 promoters, we have carried out an analysis of the transcriptional control elements of YOR1. Deletion mutagenesis of a YOR1-lacZ gene fusion defined three regions important for normal regulation of YOR1expression, two positively acting cis-elements and one negative regulatory site. One of the positive elements corresponds to the PDRE, confirming the role of this site in YOR1transcriptional control. The second positive element is located upstream of the PDRE and is normally repressed by the action of the negative regulatory region. The activities of these other two elements appear to be independent of PDR1 and PDR3. These data are consistent with the YOR1 promoter receiving multiple regulatory inputs from PDR1/PDR3 and other as yet unknown factors. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The previously described strains used in these studies are SEY6210 (MATα;leu2-3,-112; ura3-52; his3-Δ200;trp1-Δ901; lys2-801 suc2-Δ9; Mel−), PB4 (SEY6210; pdr1-Δ2::hisG; pdr3-Δ1::hisG) (10Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and DKY7 (SEY6210;yor1-1::hisG) (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). TCH5 (SEY6210,yor1-Δ1::hisG) was used for the RNase mapping experiments. Standard SD and YPD media (20Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) were used for normal yeast growth and determination of drug resistance. Drug resistance was assayed by spot testing on plates containing different drug concentrations (21Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (22Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). A YOR1-specific oligonucleotide was synthesized that corresponds to nucleotides +49 to +75 in the YOR1 gene. This oligonucleotide was labeled at its 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was then annealed to 50 μg of total RNA isolated using a rapid procedure (23Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) from strains of interest. Annealing was allowed to proceed for 45 min at 65 °C, then incubated for an additional 45 min at 45 °C, followed by reverse transcriptase extension of the RNA-DNA complexes. Primer extension was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped by phenol extraction, and the nucleic acids were precipitated. Primer extension reactions were electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel in parallel with dideoxy sequencing reactions performed on a YOR1 template using the same oligonucleotide primer. The wild-type YOR1-lacZ plasmid pSM109-4 has been previously described (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, pSM109-4 corresponds to a YOR1-lacZ gene fusion containing 1066 bp upstream of the transcription start site and 213 bp of coding sequence from YOR1. This same YOR1 DNA fragment was cloned into pBluescript KS II+ as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment to form pTH40. 5′ deletions were generated by digesting pTH40 withEcoRI, treating this DNA with the bidirectional exonucleaseBal31, forming blunt ends with Klenow enzyme and deoxyribonucleotides, and then ligating an EcoRI linker to the resulting blunt-ended fragments. The ligation reaction was then cleaved with EcoRI/BamHI and cloned into similarly digested pSEYC102 (24Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garret J. Geller B.C. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of each deletion mutant was sequenced to precisely determine the 5′ end point. An oligonucleotide (CCG GAA TTC GAA TAT GTC GAT TAC CGT GGG GGA T) was used to introduce an EcoRI site upstream of theYOR1 ATG in a PCR reaction, resulting in the plasmid pTH70. 3′ promoter deletions were generated in the same fashion as the 5′ deletion mutants, except pTH40 was cut initially with BamHI. These 3′ deletions were cloned as EcoRI fragments intoYOR1 5′ deletion mutant constructs resulting in internal promoter deletions. A clustered point mutation was introduced into the YOR1 PDRE by PCR mutagenesis as described (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTH40 was PCR-amplified using the YOR1 primer (GGC TCT CTA CTA AAT GCT TGC G) and the T7 primer. A separate PCR reaction was performed on pTH40 using the mutagenic primer (ATT TCC GGC TAT gTC gAC GGA ACC ACG CGT TAT C) and the T3 primer. The mutant base pairs are indicated by lowercase letters. PCR products from these reactions were purified, combined, and re-amplified with the T3 and T7 primers. The product from this reaction was digested with Eco47III andBglII and cloned into Eco47III/BglII cut pTH40. Resulting plasmids were sequenced to verify that the clustered point mutation had been introduced into the PDRE and that no other mutations had been introduced. The promoter fusion plasmids were constructed using either theCYC1-lacZ vector pCBS1 (25Harshman K.D. Moye-Rowley W.S. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or the PDR5-lacZvector pPBΔ112 (10Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These plasmids contained versions of each promoter that replaced the normal upstream activation sequences with a unique EcoRI site. YOR1 promoter fragments were inserted as EcoRI fragments in their normal orientation relative to the heterologous promoters. To detect the chimeric YOR1-lacZ transcripts with no interference from the chromosomal YOR1 gene, a strain was constructed that lacked the region of YOR1 around the transcription start site. This was accomplished by preparing aXhoI/HindIII subclone of YOR1 in pBluescript. An internal BglII fragment extending from −109 to +1129 was then replaced with the BamHI/BglIIhisG-URA3-hisG fragment from pNKY51 to produce pTH140. ASacI/KpnI fragment of pTH140 was used to transform SEY6210 cells to URA3+. Appropriate integration was confirmed by Southern blotting (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting transformant was then treated with 5-fluoroorotic acid and used as host for theYOR1-lacZ fusion plasmids. This Ura− cell was designated TCH5. Total RNA was prepared from TCH5 transformants by hot phenol extraction (23Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). A YOR1-specific probe was generated by T7 transcription of BglII-linearized pTH40, and thePDC1 probe was produced by T3 transcription of aBamHI/SalI PDC1 subclone in pRS426 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PDC1-containing plasmid was cleaved withBglII prior to in vitro transcription. RNase protection was carried out as described by the manufacturer (Ambion). DNase I footprint analysis was performed as described (28Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The vector pOTS-Nco12 (29Shatzman A. Rosenberg M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) expressing a Myc-epitope tagged version of the N-terminal 248 amino acids of Pdr1p was used to produce protein for these experiments. This plasmid was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding the Myc epitope into the NcoI site of a pOTS-Nco12 derivative expressing the N-terminal 248 residues of Pdr1p (provided by Laurence Lambert). Previously, we localized the YOR1 transcription start site using an RNase protection assay (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This assay provided an approximation of the site for transcription initiation accomplished by comparing the protected RNA species with an end-labeled set of DNA fragments. To locate precisely the YOR1 transcription start site, primer extension analysis was carried out. Total RNA was isolated from a wild-type strain transformed with the vector pRS315 or with pRS315 containing a dominant, gain-of-function allele ofPDR1 designated PDR1–6. This gain-of-functionPDR1 allele produced both elevated cycloheximide and oligomycin tolerance in addition to increasing expression ofPDR5 and YOR1 (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A 25-nucleotide YOR1-specific primer was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed to the RNA samples. This oligonucleotide was also used for dideoxy sequencing of a YOR1 template to generate a size standard for the primer extension products. The reverse transcription reaction products and the sequencing reactions were electrophoresed in parallel on a DNA sequencing gel (Fig.1). These analyses generated two major products, sized 74 and 70 nucleotides. The 74-nucleotide extension product mapped to 185 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG codon in the YOR1 open reading frame and was designated as the transcription start site. This transcription start site agreed with separate primer extension analysis using a 25-base pair oligonucleotide spanning the YOR1 ATG (data not shown). As predicted from previous Northern blot and RNase protection analysis (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar),YOR1 mRNA levels were elevated in the presence ofPDR1–6. Having accurately located the start site forYOR1 transcription, we next carried out deletion analysis of the promoter region. Low copy plasmids carrying the YOR1-lacZ fusion with progressively larger 5′ promoter deletions were transformed into a wild-type strain or an isogenic Δpdr1,3 strain.YOR1-lacZ-dependent β-galactosidase activities were determined for each construct (Fig.2). A YOR1-lacZ construct with a 5′ end point 1065 bp upstream of transcription start generated 15 units/A 600of β-galactosidase activity in a wild-type strain and 5 units/A 600 in a Δpdr1,3 strain as described before (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Additional 5′ truncations had no significant effect on YOR1-lacZ activity until the region between −222 and −129 was removed. The −129 5′ deletion pTH42 produced only 6 units/A 600 of β-galactosidase activity in a wild-type strain, and this reduced activity was not further diminished in a Δpdr1,3 strain. Further reduction in the extent ofYOR1 5′-noncoding sequence progressively reduced β-galactosidase expression. These data suggest that the DNA region from −222 to −129 contains the major PDRE and is consistent with our previous identification of a candidate PDRE centered at position −215 (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This candidateYOR1 PDRE is identical in sequence with the site 2 PDRE present in the PDR5 promoter, which we demonstrated to function as a positive regulatory site for PDR5transcription (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These data support the view that the PDRE at position −215 is required for Pdr1p/Pdr3p control of YOR1gene expression and that this element may represent the only PDRE present in the promoter. Internal deletions in the YOR1 promoter were constructed to identify cis-acting elements that might have been missed in the 5′ deletion analysis. Each internal deletion mutant was assayed in both the wild-type andΔpdr1,pdr3 strains (Fig.3). An unexpected result from this analysis arose when the behavior of an internal deletion mutant lacking the −115 to −50 region of theYOR1 promoter was analyzed. This mutant YOR1-lacZgene fusion produced 65 units/A 600 in wild-type cells, and this elevated activity was only mildly affected by loss ofPDR1 and PDR3 (reduced to 42 units/A 600). A more extensive internal deletion mutation, lacking −190 to −50, also produced this same enhanced expression phenotype, with 57 units/A 600 in wild-type cells and 45 units/A 600 in theΔpdr1,pdr3 strain. Further elimination of YOR1promoter sequence (−299 to −50) caused a reduction in the expression of the resulting YOR1-lacZ construct but still produced a construct that was significantly more active than the wild-type, especially in the Δpdr1/pdr3 background. The most extensive internal deletion mutant assayed (−535 to −50) essentially eliminated YOR1 expression. The finding that deletion of the −115 to −50 region served to elevate expression of YOR1-dependent β-galactosidase activity was consistent with the belief that loss of this segment ofYOR1 enhanced gene transcription. Since the deleted region mapped close to the YOR1 mRNA start site, one possible concern was that the increase in fusion gene expression came about from a change in mRNA form, influencing fusion gene translation rather than amount of YOR1-lacZ mRNA. To evaluate this possibility, we analyzed the 5′ ends of the the YOR1-lacZtranscripts produced in these deletion mutants. Each fusion gene was transformed into a strain lacking the 5′ end of the endogenousYOR1 locus and the transcription start sites produced by each fusion gene analyzed by RNase mapping (Fig.4). RNase mapping confirmed that the level of YOR1-lacZ mRNA was increased in each promoter derivative that exhibited elevated β-galactosidase activity. Two differences were seen between the pattern of 5′ mRNA ends produced by the promoter mutants lacking the −115 to −50 region and the wild-type YOR1 promoter. First, the mutant promoters gave rise to a new transcription start site located upstream of the normal +1 start site. Second, a transcription start site (approximately +14) that is used less frequently than the +1 site in the wild-type YOR1 promoter was utilized as the major site for transcription initiation when the −115 to −50 segment was deleted. This analysis suggests that the region between −115 and −50 may play a role both in selection of the transcription start site that is utilized during YOR1 gene transcription and acts to negatively regulate YOR1 mRNA production. It should be noted that we cannot exclude that the appearance of these shorter mRNA species might be the result of degradation of a larger transcript. These data suggest the presence of a positive regulatory site in theYOR1 upstream region between −535 and −299. This control element was designated UASYOR1. Function of UASYOR1 is negatively regulated by an element located between −115 to −50. To define better the negative regulatory site, two internal deletion mutants were prepared that removed smaller segments of the −115 to −50 interval. Each of these mutantYOR1 promoters (−86 to −50 and −115 to −86) had the effect of elevating expression of the resulting construct by approximately 2-fold relative to the wild-type promoter in both genetic backgrounds. Neither of these internal deletion mutants was able to elevate YOR1-dependent β-galactosidase activity to the same extent as the derivative lacking the −115 to −50 region, suggesting the presence of multiple negative regulatory elements within this region. The internal deletion series also provided confirmation for the ability of the PDRE located at position −215 to serve as the major, if not sole, mediator of Pdr1p/Pdr3p regulation. The expression levels of internal deletion mutants that lacked this element were not significantly different when introduced into the wild-type or theΔpdr1,pdr3 strain. Two internal deletion mutants (+27 to +185 and −115 to +185) contain the PDRE but showed no differential expression when assayed in wild-type and the Δpdr1,pdr3strain. This lack of response to PDR1 and/or PDR3was likely due to the highly defective nature of these derivatives as the expression levels supported by these two mutant promoters represented only 5–13% that of the wild-type YOR1-lacZfusion, respectively. The results of the 5′ and internal deletion analysis of the YOR1 promoter strongly suggested that the PDRE located at −215 was likely to serve as a site for positive control of gene expression by Pdr1p (and likely Pdr3p). To test this idea directly, we produced Pdr1p in bacteria and assayed the ability of this recombinant protein to bind to the YOR1PDRE. Protein extracts were prepared from E. coli cells carrying the empty expression vector or the same vector expressing an N-terminal fragment of Pdr1p that contains the zinc finger DNA binding domain. This Pdr1p fragment has previously been found to recognize the PDREs in the PDR5 promoter (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were incubated with radiolabeled DNA templates prepared from the wild-typeYOR1 promoter or from a mutant YOR1 promoter that lacks the PDRE. This mutant PDRE was constructed by changing 2 base pairs that have previously been found to be essential for function of a PDRE in the PDR5 promoter (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahé Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The results of this DNase I protection experiment are shown in Fig.5. Bacterially expressed Pdr1p was able to protect the YOR1 DNA region from −226 to −208 from DNase I cleavage. No protection was seen if protein was omitted or if an equal amount of protein extract prepared from cells containing the empty expression vector was used. The mutant YOR1 promoter with the 2-base pair substitution mutation in the PDRE was not bound by Pdr1p. This finding indicates that Pdr1p can bind in vitro to theYOR1 PDRE and that this binding can be blocked by an alteration in the PDRE. To confirm that the PDRE is the in vivo target of Pdr1p action, we analyzed the function of theYOR1 promoter containing the 2-base pair substitution inS. cerevisiae cells. To assess the contribution of the PDRE to YOR1promoter function, the mutant PDRE was introduced into the context of the YOR1-lacZ fusion gene present in pSM109-4. Both the wild-type and mutant PDRE-containing YOR1-lacZ fusion genes were transformed into Δpdr1,pdr3 cells along with a low copy plasmid vector or this same vector plasmid carrying wild-typePDR1 or the dominant PDR1–6 allele.YOR1-dependent β-galactosidase activities were then determined for each transformant (Fig.6). The YOR1-lacZ fusion gene exhibited a strong increase in β-galactosidase levels in the presence of the PDR1–6allele. The 2-base pair mutation in the PDRE completely blocked the ability of the fusion gene to respond to the PDR1–6 allele. The mutant PDRE also reduced the ability of the presence of the wild-type PDR1 gene to enhance YOR1-lacZexpression. The levels of YOR1-dependent β-galactosidase activity were similar, irrespective of the presence of the PDRE in the Δpdr1,pdr3 cells carrying the low copy vector. These data provide a strong argument that the PDR"

M3S contains four changes: a hydrophilic substitution of L29S, two hydrophobic substitutions of S52I and Y56F, and a deletion of the N-terminal seven amino acids that is disordered in the structure of wild-type TNF-α. Compared with wild-type TNF-α, it exhibits 11- and 71-fold lower binding affinities for the human TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 receptors, respectively, and in vitro cytotoxic effect andin vivo systemic toxicity of M3S are 20 and 10 times lower, respectively. However, in a transplanted solid tumor mouse model, M3S suppresses tumor growth more efficiently than wild-type TNF-α. M3S is highly resistant to proteolysis by trypsin, and it exhibits increased thermal stability and a prolonged half-life in vivo. The L29S mutation causes substantial restructuring of the loop containing residues 29–36 into a rigid segment as a consequence of induced formation of intra- and intersubunit interactions, explaining the altered receptor binding affinity and thermal stability. A mass spectrometric analysis identified major proteolytic cleavage sites located on this loop, and thus the increased resistance of M3S to the proteolysis is consistent with the increased rigidity of the loop. The S52I and Y56F mutations do not induce a noticeable conformational change. The side chain of Phe56 projects into a hydrophobic cavity, while Ile52 is exposed to the bulk solvent. Ile52 should be involved in hydrophobic interactions with the receptors, since a mutant containing the same mutations as in M3S except for the L29S mutation exhibits an increased receptor binding affinity. The low systemic toxicity of M3S appears to be the effect of the reduced and selective binding affinities for the TNF receptors, and the superior tumor-suppression of M3S appears to be the effect of its weak but longer antitumoral activity in vivo compared with wild-type TNF-α. It is also expected that the 1.8-Å resolution structure will serve as an accurate model for explaining the structure-function relationship of wild-type TNF-α and many TNF-α mutants reported previously and for the design of new TNF-α mutants.

It exerts direct cytotoxic effects on a wide range of human and murine tumor cell lines in vivo and in vitro. TNF-β (lymphotoxin) is a lymphocyte-secreted cytokine with a 32% identity in primary sequence to TNF-α (2Eck M.J. Ultsch M. Rinderknecht E. de Vos A.M. Sprang S.R. J. Biol.

Diverse activities of TNF are mediated by binding to each of the two receptors, TNF-R55 (55 kDa) and TNF-R75 (75 kDa), on the cell surface. The K d values of TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 for the two TNFs are approximately 0.5 and 0.1 nm, respectively (4Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D.

TNF is also known to exhibit receptor-independent cytotoxic activity by an ion channel formation at acidic pH. Under low pH that disfavors receptor binding, the TNF trimer inserted in the cell membrane resulted in the ion depletion of the cells, most likely through the hole in the middle of the trimeric structure (20Baldwin R.L.

In contrast, a human TNF-R75 selective mutant (D143F) did not show lower proinflammatory activities (30Babara J.A.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W.

The hypothesis that the preferential binding of TNF-α to TNF-R55 is related to the low systemic toxicity, however, was disputed in other studies. The R32W and S86T double TNF-α mutant, which binds to TNF-R55 much more preferentially over TNF-R75 developed serious systemic toxicity in a previous experiment in which healthy, anesthetized baboons were infused with the TNF-α double mutant (31Van Zee K.J.

TNF-R55-deficient mice sensitized with d-galactosamine were tolerant of endotoxic shock and insensitive to the TNF toxicities (40Brünger A.T. X-PLOR (Version 3.0) Manual.

Thus, the role of TNF-R55 in the systemic toxicity needs to be investigated further.Recently, we have found that a human TNF-α mutant containing substitutions of S52I and Y56F, plus a deletion of the N-terminal seven residues, referred to as M3, exhibits increased binding affinities for the two TNF receptors and increased in vitro cytotoxicity (32Shin N.-K. Lee I. Jang S.-G. Shin H.-C. Proc. BPERC Int. Symp. 1994; 94: 43-50Google Scholar). When the L29S mutation was added, this TNF-α mutant, referred to as M3S hereafter, showed a lower and preferential binding affinity for TNF-R55 and substantially reduced systemic toxicity in mice while inhibiting efficiently the growth of tumors transplanted on mice. M3S displays increased thermal stability, resistance to the trypsin proteolysis, and a longer half-life in vivo compared with wtTNF-α. In addition, when combined with paclitaxel, M3S was found to potentiate the antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel through the enhancement of apoptosis (33Seong J. Milross C.G. Hunter N.R. Shin H.C. Milas L. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the design was recently reported of a TNF-β mutant that exhibits low systemic toxicity but higher antitumor activity than wtTNF-α and wtTNF-β (34Taniyama M. Morita T. Yamagishi Y.

Although the structures of TNF-α mutants are important for understanding their biological activities, the three-dimensional structure of only one TNF-α mutant (A84V) is reported.

Diverse activities of TNF are mediated by binding to each of the two receptors, TNF-R55 (55 kDa) and TNF-R75 (75 kDa), on the cell surface. The K d values of TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 for the two TNFs are approximately 0.5 and 0.1 nm, respectively (4Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D.

Indeed, in the crystal structure of TNF-β complexed with TNF-R55, these regions interact with the receptor (15Banner D.W. D'Aracy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H.

In particular, signaling cascades emanating from TNF-R55, which contains death domain, lead cells to apoptosis (6Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol.

TNF is also known to exhibit receptor-independent cytotoxic activity by an ion channel formation at acidic pH. Under low pH that disfavors receptor binding, the TNF trimer inserted in the cell membrane resulted in the ion depletion of the cells, most likely through the hole in the middle of the trimeric structure (20Baldwin R.L.

Reductions by up to 170-fold were observed for these mutants in TNF-α's priming of human neutrophils for superoxide production and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, platelet-activating factor synthesis, and adhesion to endothelium (30Babara J.A.J.

In contrast, a human TNF-R75 selective mutant (D143F) did not show lower proinflammatory activities (30Babara J.A.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and another TNF-R75-selective double mutant (D143N and A145R) did not exert cytotoxic responses in human KYM-1 cells (27Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis that the preferential binding of TNF-α to TNF-R55 is related to the low systemic toxicity, however, was disputed in other studies. The R32W and S86T double TNF-α mutant, which binds to TNF-R55 much more preferentially over TNF-R75 developed serious systemic toxicity in a previous experiment in which healthy, anesthetized baboons were infused with the TNF-α double mutant (31Van Zee K.J. Stackpole S.A. Montegut W.J. Rogy M.A. Calvano S.E. Hsu K.C. Chao M. Meschter C.L. Loetscher H. Stuber D. Ettlin V. Wipf B. Lesslauer W. Lowry S.F. Moldawer L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TNF-R55-deficient mice sensitized with d-galactosamine were tolerant of endotoxic shock and insensitive to the TNF toxicities (40Brünger A.T. X-PLOR (Version 3.0) Manual.

Huston H.N. Wong D.E. Wong D.Y. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1987; 69: 129-138Google Scholar). Thus, the role of TNF-R55 in the systemic toxicity needs to be investigated further. Recently, we have found that a human TNF-α mutant containing substitutions of S52I and Y56F, plus a deletion of the N-terminal seven residues, referred to as M3, exhibits increased binding affinities for the two TNF receptors and increased in vitro cytotoxicity (32Shin N.-K. Lee I. Jang S.-G. Shin H.-C. Proc. BPERC Int. Symp. 1994; 94: 43-50Google Scholar). When the L29S mutation was added, this TNF-α mutant, referred to as M3S hereafter, showed a lower and preferential binding affinity for TNF-R55 and substantially reduced systemic toxicity in mice while inhibiting efficiently the growth of tumors transplanted on mice. M3S displays increased thermal stability, resistance to the trypsin proteolysis, and a longer half-life in vivo compared with wtTNF-α. In addition, when combined with paclitaxel, M3S was found to potentiate the antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel through the enhancement of apoptosis (33Seong J. Milross C.G. Hunter N.R. Shin H.C. Milas L. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the design was recently reported of a TNF-β mutant that exhibits low systemic toxicity but higher antitumor activity than wtTNF-α and wtTNF-β (34Taniyama M. Morita T. Yamagishi Y. Kato A. Bando C. Okawa N. Kaji A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although the structures of TNF-α mutants are important for understanding their biological activities, the three-dimensional structure of only one TNF-α mutant (A84V) is reported. Here, we report the 1.8- and 2.15-Å crystal structures of M3S in two different crystal packings and discuss the mutational influences on the structure and biological activity of TNF-α.

Recently, we have shown that RA activates TGases as reflected by stimulated GTP binding, increased membrane association, and stimulated phosphoinositide lipid turnover. This prompted us to search for cellular proteins that bind TGases in a RA-stimulated manner. In this report, we show that the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF-5A), a protein that is essential for cell viability, perhaps through effects on protein synthesis and/or RNA export, associates with the TGasein vivo. The interaction between eIF-5A and TGase is specific for the GDP-bound form of the TGase and is not detected when the TGase is pre-loaded with GTPγS. The TGase-eIF-5A interaction also is promoted by Ca2+, Mg2+, and RA treatment of HeLa cells. In the presence of retinoic acid, millimolar levels of Ca2+ are no longer required for the TGase-eIF-5A interaction. Nocodazole treatment, which blocks the cell cycle at mitosis (M phase), strongly inhibits the interaction between eIF-5A and cytosolic TGase. The interaction between TGase and eIF-5A and its sensitivity to the nucleotide-occupied state of the TGase provides a potentially interesting connection between RA signaling and protein synthesis and/or RNA trafficking activities.

Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). It was then realized that these enzymes are regulated by GTP and in fact can undergo a GTP-binding/GTPase cycle like classical G proteins (2Fraij B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More recently, it also has been appreciated that these enzymes are capable of ATP hydrolysis at a site distinct from the GTP-binding site (5Lai T.-S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31191-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The TGases appear to be widely distributed within the cell, mainly present in the cytosol (6Mian S. El Alaoui S. Lowry J. Gentile V. Davis P.J.A. Griffin M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Fesus L. Zsuzsa S. Uray I. J. Cell. Biochem.

Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and in the nucleus (9Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). They have been implicated in a variety of fundamentally important cellular functions, including cell adhesion, wound healing, and cellular differentiation and apoptosis (10Chung S.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol.

Piacentini M. Fesus L. Davies P.J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the TGases play a role as signaling transducers in some of these biological responses (again reminiscent of classical G proteins), with one particular example being the mediation of α1-adrenergic receptor regulation of phosphoinositide lipid turnover through the ability of the GTP-bound TGase to stimulate phospholipase C-δ1 (14Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).Our laboratory has been interested in further probing the possible importance of the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of TGases in their biological function. Recently, we found that retinoic acid (RA) treatment of HeLa cells under conditions that give rise to cellular differentiation and apoptosis strongly stimulated the GTP binding activity of the TGases (15Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This was accompanied by an increased association of TGase with the plasma membrane and a concomitant stimulation of phospholipase C activity. These RA-stimulated effects could not be attributed to changes in the expression of the TGase, which caused us to propose that exposure of cells to RA may result in the expression of specific regulatory factors for the TGase,e.g. lipid-modifying enzymes and/or other proteins capable of imparting posttranslational modifications such as protein kinases.In the present study, we set out to extend this work and identify possible regulatory factors as well as other potential target/effector molecules for the TGase. In particular, we followed up on an observation that an ∼18-kDa protein appeared to be co-purifying with TGase from rabbit liver preparations. We have identified this protein as the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF-5A), which was originally suspected to play an important role in protein synthesis but more recently has also been suggested to participate in nuclear (RNA) export (16Bevec D. Jaksche H. Oft M. Wöhl T. Himmelspach M. Pacher A. Schebsta M. Koettnitz K. Dobrovinck M. Csouga R. Lottspeich F. Hauber J. Science. 1996; 271: 1858-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We show here that eIF-5A is a specific cellular binding partner for a particular form of the TGase and that this interaction is stimulated by RA, thus suggesting an interesting and potential link between protein synthesis and/or RNA trafficking and RA regulation of cellular activities.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONVarious lines of evidence have suggested that GTP-binding protein/transglutaminases (TGases) may represent a new family of transducer molecules that upon binding GTP can stimulate target/effector activities such as phosphoinositide lipid turnover (8Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar,20Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We recently reported that a number of biochemical activities of TGases are stimulated by RA including GTP binding (and the resultant GTP hydrolytic activity), transglutaminase activity, plasma membrane-association and phosphoinositide lipid turnover (15Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms underlying these RA-stimulated activities are not known, although they cannot be attributed to simple changes in the levels of TGase expression (15Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a means to gain further insight into the interplay between RA and TGases, as well as into the function of TGases, we have set out to identify potential regulators and other binding partners or targets for these GTP-binding proteins.Based on an earlier observation that an ∼18-kDa protein appeared to co-purify with TGases from rabbit liver, 2U. S. Singh, unpublished results. we obtained sufficient amounts of the 18-kDa protein for microsequence analysis and determined that it was the eukaryotic initiation factor-5A (eIF-5A). At present, little is known regarding the cellular functions of eIF-5A. It has been suggested to participate in some aspect of protein synthesis at the ribosomal subunit-joining step and/or at a later stage of 80 S ribosomal initiation complex formation (21Adams S. Safer B. Anderson W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9083-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, eIF-5A also has been suggested to play a role in RNA export, based on its interaction with the HIV-1 protein, Rev (16Bevec D. Jaksche H. Oft M. Wöhl T. Himmelspach M. Pacher A. Schebsta M. Koettnitz K. Dobrovinck M. Csouga R. Lottspeich F. Hauber J. Science. 1996; 271: 1858-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The eIF-5A protein is unique in that it is the only cellular protein known to contain the unusual amino acid hypusine; a number of lines of evidence indicate that hypusine and eIF-5A are essential for eukaryotic cell viability (22Park M.H. Joe Y.A. Kang K.R. Lee Y.G. Wolff E.C. Amino Acids (Vienna). 1996; 10: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Likewise, there are a number of indications for an important involvement of TGases in cell cycle progression and cell growth regulation (6Mian S. El Alaoui S. Lowry J. Gentile V. Davis P.J.A.

Griffin M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2935-2942PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a TGase-eIF-5A interaction would have interesting implications, particularly regarding the possible connection of RNA metabolism to growth regulation (27Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).We first set out to determine whether we could obtain biochemical evidence that eIF-5A is in fact a binding partner for TGase. To do this, we expressed the TGase in insect cells as a GST fusion protein to use this as an affinity reagent for identifying eIF-5A as a possible target. The results presented in Fig. 1(top panel) show that when the GST-TGase protein was incubated with lysates from HeLa cells, the endogenous eIF-5A (as detected by Western blotting with an anti-eIF-5A antibody) was co-precipitated with GST-TGase upon the addition of glutathione-agarose. This interaction appeared to be specific for the GDP-bound form of the GTP-binding protein, since we could not detect an interaction with eIF-5A when the GST-TGase was preloaded with GTPγS. The GST-TGase-eIF-5A interaction also required both Ca2+and Mg2+ (Fig. 1, lower panel; also see below).We next examined whether the TGase-eIF-5A interaction occurred in intact cells. Using an anti-eIF-5A polyclonal antibody that can immunoprecipitate eIF-5A from cells (Fig.2, top panel), we found that TGase was specifically co-precipitated with eIF-5A (Fig. 2,middle panel, lanes 3 and 4) but not with nonimmune IgG (Fig. 2, middle panel, lanes 1and 2) as indicated by Western blotting with an anti-TGase antibody. The TGase that co-precipitates with eIF-5A can also be photoaffinity labeled with [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 2,lower panel, lanes 3 and 4).Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of TGase with a polyclonal antibody against eIF-5A. An aliquot (100 μl) of the cytosolic fraction was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody (eIF-5A-S) raised against human eIF-5A (lanes 3 and4 are duplicates) or with a control antibody (rabbit IgG) (lanes 1 and 2 are duplicates) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with the eIF-5A antibody, and visualized with ECL (top panel), or the immunoprecipitated proteins were first labeled with [α-32P]GTP, electrophoresed, and visualized by autoradiography (bottom panel). The blot was then stripped (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h at 70 °C, reprobed with monoclonal antibody (CUB 7402) raised against guinea pig liver transglutaminase, and visualized with ECL (Amersham) (middle panel). In these experiments, the autorads and blots were exposed overnight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of the eIF-5A-associated TGase to bind GTP indicates that it belongs to an activated pool of the endogenous TGase. Previously, we had shown that in HeLa cells most of the TGase was inactive and not capable of binding [α-32P]GTP (15Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, as alluded to earlier, RA, which causes the cells to differentiate and undergo apoptosis (13Gentile V. Thomazy V. Piacentini M. Fesus L. Davies P.J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), strongly stimulated the GTP binding activity of the cellular TGase (15Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since this did not appear to be due to a change in the expression of the TGase, we proposed that RA treatment of cells increased the expression of a lipid-modifying enzyme and/or possibly another regulatory factor (e.g. a protein kinase) that modified the TGase, thus creating an activated pool of protein that was capable of GTP binding activity and an increased ability to associate with the plasma membrane. Given this suggestion, we therefore reasoned that if it was the activated pool of TGase that associates with eIF-5A, then RA treatment of cells should stimulate the formation of a TGase·eIF-5A complex. The results presented in Fig.3 show that this in fact is the case. Specifically, following RA treatment of HeLa cells, TGase was detected in co-immunoprecipitates with eIF-5A even after only a very brief exposure (∼2 min) of the blot and under conditions where in the absence of RA, little detectable TGase was present in the eIF-5A precipitates. Fig. 3 (right panel) also shows that RA treatment strongly increased the amount of [α-32P]GTP binding activity (corresponding to the TGase) that co-immunoprecipitated with eIF-5A.Figure 3Effect of retinoic acid on the association between eIF-5A and TGase. The cytosolic fraction (100 μl) isolated from the RA-treated and -untreated HeLa cells was immunoprecipitated with eIF-5A antibody or control antibody as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates were suspended in the reaction buffer for photoaffinity labeling and used for GTP binding by UV irradiation. The proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography (right panel) or by Western blotting with the anti-TGase antibody (left panel). In these experiments, the autorads and blots were exposed for 2 min. Lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6 represent immunoprecipitates using control antibody incubated with the cytosolic fractions prepared from the control and RA-treated HeLa cells.Lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8represent the immunoprecipitates using eIF-5A antibody incubated with control and RA-treated HeLa cell cytosolic fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have been able to further probe the connection between RA-promoted activation of TGase and its interaction with eIF-5A by taking advantage of a recent finding that nocodazole treatment of HeLa cells (under conditions that cause the cells to accumulate in M phase) (28Kung A.L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9553-9557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) inhibits the ability of membrane-associated TGase to bind GTP and thus uncouples the ability of the RA-regulated TGase to associate with plasma membranes from its ability to become activated (data not shown). It is interesting that nocodazole treatment also strongly inhibits the association of the cytosolic TGase with eIF-5A. The results presented in Fig. 4 clearly show that the co-precipitation of TGase with eIF-5A does not occur in HeLa cells that have been pretreated with nocodazole, either when monitoring this interaction by Western blotting with the specific anti-TGase antibody (upper panel) or by photoaffinity labeling with [α-32P]GTP (lower panel). A similar inhibitory effect by nocodazole was also obtained with RA-treated HeLa cells (data not shown)Figure 4Effects of nocodazole on the association between eIF-5A and TGase. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-eIF-5A polyclonal antibody (lanes 3 and 4) or IgG control antibody (lanes 1 and 2) was performed by using aliquots (100 μl) of the cytosolic fractions from control and nocodazole-treated HeLa cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 2. The proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with the TGase monoclonal antibody, and visualized by ECL (top panel) or were photolabeled with [α-32P]GTP (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results presented in Fig. 5 show that the effects of both RA and nocodazole treatment are directed at eIF-5A as well as at the membrane-bound pool of TGase. Given that Ca2+ appeared to serve as a necessary cofactor for TGase-eIF-5A interactions (see Fig. 1), we performed an experiment to determine whether treatment with RA or nocodazole influenced the ability of Ca2+ to stimulate these interactions. Specifically, lysates were prepared from control HeLa cells and from RA-treated cells or nocodazole-treated cells and then incubated with the recombinant GST-TGase in the presence of different levels of CaCl2. The GST-TGase·eIF-5A complexes were precipitated with glutathione-agarose and Western blotted with the anti-eIF-5A polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, the GST-TGase-eIF-5A interaction was maximal when lysates from control cells were incubated with 1 mm CaCl2, whereas in RA-treated cells GST-TGase-eIF-5A interactions were clearly detected even in the absence of added CaCl2. These results suggest that RA treatment has a direct effect on eIF-5A, such that it is able to associate with the TGase even at low (micromolar) levels of Ca2+. It should be noted that nocodazole treatment completely eliminated the interaction between GST-TGase and eIF-5A. Because nocodazole did not decrease the levels of eIF-5A detected in these lysates by Western blotting (data not shown), these findings suggest that the nocodazole effects on TGase-eIF-5A interactions are directed at eIF-5A, such that it cannot bind to the TGase even in the presence of millimolar levels of Ca2+. Thus, like RA, nocodazole exhibits regulatory effects on both partners of the TGase-eIF-5A binding interaction.Figure 5Effects of retinoic acid, Ca2+, and nocodazole on the interactions between eIF-5A and GST-TGase.The binding of eIF-5A to GST-TGase was assayed in control HeLa cells, RA-treated HeLa cells, and nocodazole-treated HeLa cells as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and at the indicated levels of CaCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results when taken together with previous findings are consistent with the following model (Fig. 6). Treatment of HeLa cells with RA promotes the formation of an activated pool of the TGase, which has an increased affinity for the plasma membrane and the capability to undergo GTP/GDP exchange. That portion of the membrane-associated TGase that binds GTP can then stimulate the activity of a phospholipase C enzyme (15Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); recent work would suggest that this is the phospholipase-δ1 isoform (14Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The TGase-promoted stimulation of phospholipase C activity gives rise to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ which has been suggested to stimulate the enzymatic tranglutaminase activity of the TGase (29Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). If Ca2+ binding to the TGase has some type of regulatory affect on the tranglutaminase active site, such an effect might account for the ability of Ca2+ to promote TGase-eIF-5A interactions. The involvement of the transglutaminase active site in binding eIF-5A also might explain an earlier observation that the unique hypusine residue of eIF-5A serves as substrate for transglutaminase reactions, i.e. it can be cross-linked to the γ-carboxamide group of glutamine side chains (30Beninati S. Nicholini L. Jakus J. Passeggio A. Abbruzzese A. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within this scheme, RA could promote TGase-eIF-5A interactions both by initiating a cascade of events that results in the membrane association of TGase and a resultant stimulation of phospholipase C activity and increase in intracellular Ca2+, and by having an as yet undetermined effect on the eIF-5A molecule (perhaps by influencing some type of posttranslational modification), such that eIF-5A can bind the TGase at micromolar levels of Ca2+. Nocodazole treatment by inhibiting the activation of membrane-associated TGase, as well as by exerting a regulatory effect on eIF-5A, inhibits TGase-eIF-5A interactions.Figure 6Schematic representation of the interaction between eIF-5A and TGase. Previous studies have shown that RA treatment of cells results in the conversion of the cytosolic GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase (TG) pool from an inactive fraction to an activated fraction (i.e. a pool of TG capable of undergoing GTP-GDP exchange and/or binding GTP). RA treatment also increases the association of TG with the plasma membranes. Normally this is the activated pool of TG but in nocodazole (NC)-treated cells, the membrane-associated TG is inactive (incapable of GTP-GDP exchange). The activated membrane-associated pool of TG elicits a GTP-dependent stimulation of phospholipase C activity, giving rise to an increase in intracellular Ca2+. This Ca2+ signal may increase the binding affinity of the GDP-bound (activated/nucleotide exchangeable) cytosolic pool of TG for eIF-5A. RA treatment reduces the requirement for millimolar levels of Ca2+ for the TG-eIF-5A interaction, whereas NC treatment inhibits this interaction even in the presence of millimolar Ca2+. It is further proposed that GTP binding weakens the binding affinity of TG for eIF-5A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Clearly, a critical question concerns how the TGase-eIF-5A interaction influences the normal functions of these proteins. We have not found any affect on the various measurable TGase activities; however, as alluded to earlier, an interesting possibility is that TGases influence the cellular localization of eIF-5A. When the TGase is in a GDP-bound state (following GTP hydrolysis (31Kyung N.L. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), it is able to bind eIF-5A and maintain eIF-5A in the cytoplasm. However, upon GTP-GDP exchange, the eIF-5A is released perhaps allowing the molecule to bind to some other cytosolic (target) protein involved in protein synthesis and/or to return to the nucleus to participate in some aspect of RNA trafficking. Thus, the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of the TGase could serve as a timing device to regulate changes in the cellular localization of eIF-5A that are important for either protein synthesis or RNA trafficking between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The fact that nocodazole treatment perturbs both the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of membrane-associated TGase, and the ability of eIF-5A to associate with the TGase, further suggests that eIF-5A activity might be coupled to the cell cycle. Taken together, these results would suggest that other factors that influence cell-cycle progression may also exert regulatory effects on TGase-eIF-5A interactions. Future studies will be directed toward testing the different possibilities raised above and determining the identity of additional cellular factors that mediate the regulation of TGase activities by RA as well as additional binding partners for eIF-5A.

Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). It was then realized that these enzymes are regulated by GTP and in fact can undergo a GTP-binding/GTPase cycle like classical G proteins (2Fraij B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lee K.N.

More recently, it also has been appreciated that these enzymes are capable of ATP hydrolysis at a site distinct from the GTP-binding site (5Lai T.-S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A.

https://openalex.org/W1980763428,"We have characterized the regulation of spermidine transport in yeast and identified some of the genes involved in its control. Disruption of the SPE2 gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, which catalyzes an essential step in polyamine biosynthesis, upregulated the initial velocity of spermidine uptake in wild-type cells as well as in the polyamine transport-deficient pcp1 mutants. Exogenous spermidine rapidly inactivated spermidine transport with a half-life of approximately 10-15 min via a process that did not require de novo protein synthesis but was accelerated by cycloheximide addition. Conversely, reactivation of spermidine influx upon polyamine deprivation required active protein synthesis. The stability of polyamine carrier activity was increased 2-fold in polyamine-depleted spe2 deletion mutants, indicating that endogenous polyamines also contribute to the down-regulation of spermidine transport. Ligand-mediated repression of spermidine transport was delayed in end3 and end4 mutants that are deficient in the initial steps of the endocytic pathway, and spermidine uptake activity was increased 4- to 5-fold in end3 mutants relative to parental cells, although the stability of the transport system was similar in both strains. Disruption of the NPR1 gene, which encodes a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase essential for the reactivation of several nitrogen permeases, resulted in a 3-fold decrease in spermidine transport in NH4(+)-rich media but did not prevent its down-regulation by spermidine. The defect in spermidine transport was more pronounced in NH4(+)- than proline-grown npr1 cells, suggesting that NPR1 protects against nitrogen catabolite repression of polyamine uptake activity. These results suggest that (a) the polyamine carrier is an unstable protein subject to down-regulation by spermidine via a process involving ligand inactivation followed by endocytosis and that (b) NPR1 expression fully prevents nitrogen catabolite repression of polyamine transport, unlike the role predicted for that gene by the inactivation/reactivation model proposed for other nitrogen permeases."
https://openalex.org/W2029486329,"The broad spectrum protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) has been implicated in muscle regeneration <i>in vivo</i> as well as in myogenic proliferation and differentiation <i>in vitro</i>. These processes are known to be modulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and serum. We therefore investigated the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of uPA expression by these two stimuli in proliferating and differentiating myoblasts. The expression of uPA mRNA and the activity of the uPA gene product were induced by FGF-2 and serum in proliferating myoblasts. uPA induction occurred at the level of transcription and required the uPA-PEA3/AP1 enhancer element, since deletion of this site in the full promoter abrogated induction by FGF-2 and serum. Using L6E9 skeletal myoblasts, devoid of endogenous FGF receptors, which have been engineered to express either FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) or FGF receptor-4 (FGFR4), we have demonstrated that both receptors, known to be expressed in skeletal muscle cell precursors, were able to mediate uPA induction by FGF-2, whereas serum stimulation was FGF receptor-independent. The induction of uPA by FGF-2 and serum in FGFR1- and in FGFR4-expressing myoblasts required the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, since treatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 kinase, PD98059, blocked uPA promoter induction. Although FGF-2 and serum induced uPA in proliferating myoblasts, their actions on cell-cell contact-induced differentiating myoblasts differed dramatically. FGF-2, but not serum, repressed uPA expression in differentiation-committed myoblasts, and these effects were also shown to occur at the level of uPA transcription. Altogether, these results indicate a dual regulation of the uPA gene by FGF-2 and serum, which ensures uPA expression throughout the whole myogenic process in different myoblastic lineages. The effects of FGF-2 and serum on uPA expression may contribute to the proteolytic activity required during myoblast migration and fusion, as well as in muscle regeneration."

The Asp-314 → Ala mutant totally abolished NO formation activity and markedly increased the rate of H2O2 formation by 20-fold compared with the wild type when l-Arg was used as the substrate.

The oxidative domain has an active site with a cytochrome P450 (P450)-like thiol-coordinated heme iron complex. The heme distal site of the oxidative domain should be one of the substrate binding site(s) and a site for molecular oxygen binding. The heme distal site must also play an important role in the activation of molecular oxygen before its reaction with the substrate. For P450s, it has been suggested that conserved Asp/Glu and neighboring Thr residues at the heme distal site are very important for the activation of molecular oxygen (9Raag R. Martinis S.A.

Therefore, it was considered worthy to mutate Asp-314 and Thr-315 of neuronal NOS (nNOS) to study their effects on kinetic parameters associated with activation of O2. In this study, we present data obtained for the Asp-314 → Ala and Thr-315 → Ala mutants of nNOS including rates for NO formation, O2 consumption, H2O2 formation, NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c reduction. On the basis of this work, we propose that Asp-314 and perhaps Thr-315 are crucially involved in the activation of molecular oxygen during the catalytic turnover of nNOS. The cDNA for rat nNOS was a kind gift of Dr. S. H. Snyder. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the wild type and mutant nNOS proteins in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and subsequent purification of expressed nNOS proteins was carried out as described previously (13Shimizu T.

The purified enzymes were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 10 μm H4B, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The CO-reduced complexes of both mutants gave optical absorption bands at 450 nm, suggesting that the denatured form, P420, did not result from the mutations. The concentrations of nNOS were determined optically from the CO-reduced − reduced difference spectrum using Δε444–467 nm = 55 mm−1cm−1 as determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method (17Klatt P. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified wild type and mutant proteins were more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis. All three enzymes showed a similar dimer formation pattern in low temperature SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conducted in the presence of l-Arg and H4B as described previously (18Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mutations did not alter the dimer-monomer equilibrium of the enzyme. The Soret spectral changes of the mutants caused by adding dithiothreitol were the same as those of the wild type, suggesting that the H4B binding site(s) was retained in the mutants (19Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The heme content of both purified mutants estimated from reduced-CO − reduced difference spectra using the Δε calculated for the wild type agreed well with those calculated using the pyridine hemochromogen assay, indicating that the mutations did not result in heme loss and that a 1:1 heme:protein ratio is retained by the mutants. Oligonucleotide-directed dual amber long and accurate PCR kits for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). H4B was purchased from Schicks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose were products of Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma and Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). The rate of NO formation was determined from the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, monitored at 401 nm using a methemoglobin minus oxyhemoglobin extinction coefficient of 38 mm−1 cm−1 (2$$Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidation rate was determined spectrophotometrically as an absorbance decrease at 340 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Unless otherwise indicated, assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mmHepes-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.1 mm NADPH, 5 μm each of FAD and FMN, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm H4B, 5 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.05–0.2 nmol of NOS in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm l-Arg or NHA. Catalase and superoxide dismutase were added to avoid reactions between NO and active oxygen species such as O·̄2 and H2O2 that may also be constantly formed during the catalysis (16Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schmidt H.H.H. Hofman H. Schindler U. Schutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of these enzymes, the same activities were obtained, although the linearities of the assays were shorter. Cytochrome c reductase activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 550 nm using a Δεred-ox = 21 mm−1 cm−1. The H2O2 generation rate was measured by the formation of ferric thiocyanate under similar conditions as described above without catalase and superoxide dismutase present. The O2 consumption rate was determined with a Clark-type oxygen electrode under the same conditions as the H2O2generation assay. Absorption spectra were measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 μmH4B, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol with a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Fig. 2 shows optical absorption spectra of the wild type (A), the Asp-314 → Ala mutant (B), and the Thr-315 → Ala mutant (C). The ferric complex of the wild type had a Soret absorption peak at around 400 nm, which was shifted to 395 nm on addition of l-Arg as reported previously (15Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for the ferric Asp-314 → Ala and Thr-315 → Ala mutants, the Soret peaks were observed at 440 and 395 nm, respectively, and were not altered on addition ofl-Arg. The addition of l-Arg to imidazole-induced low spin complexes of wild type NOS changes the spin state to high spin, reflecting substrate binding to the active site (21Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The addition of excess l-Arg clearly changed the spin state from imidazole-bound low spin (with a 427-nm absorption peak) to high spin (with a 395-nm absorption peak) for the Thr-315 → Ala mutant (not shown). The absorption peak observed at 455 nm for the Asp-314 → Ala mutant CO-reduced complex in the absence ofl-Arg was shifted to 450 nm on the addition ofl-Arg (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that this mutant does have l-Arg binding affinity. Thus, it is evident that neither mutation causes a loss of substrate binding affinity under these conditions. The CO-reduced complexes of both mutants in the presence of l-Arg showed typical P450-type absorption peaks at 450 nm, the same as the wild type, suggesting that the heme active sites of the both mutants are well preserved in the ferrous form. Table I summarizes the various parameters obtained for the wild type and mutant enzymes. The NO formation rate, 72.1 μmol/min/μmol NOS heme (450 nmol/min/mg NOS protein), obtained for the wild type is comparable to the value previously reported (1$$Google Scholar, 2$$Google Scholar, 3Masters B.S.S.

In the presence of l-Arg, the NADPH oxidation and O2 consumption rates obtained for the wild type are essentially coupled to the rate of NO formation, considering that oxidation of 1.5 mol of NADPH and consumption of 2 mol of O2 generates 1 mol of NO.Table ICatalytic activities of the wild type and mutant nNOSsNO formationNADPH oxidationO2consumptionH2O2 formationCytochromec reductionWild type −l-Arg25.9 ± 0.73,980 ± 71 + l-Arg72.1 ± 0.797.9 ± 5.8157 ± 9.81.7 ± 0.1 + NHA81.7 ± 3.673.3 ± 5.2109 ± 123.7 ± 1.6Asp-314 → Ala −l-Arg95.9 ± 8.94,427 ± 170 + l-Arg<0.133.9 ± 4.063.6 ± 4.826.7 ± 1.9 + NHA<0.129.2 ± 1.448.8 ± 1.863.7 ± 4.6Thr-315 → Ala −l-Arg54.9 ± 6.55,503 ± 70 + l-Arg89.0 ± 2.7153 ± 7.7200 ± 6.917.9 ± 0.6 + NHA104 ± 8.5106 ± 5.2135 ± 1420.9 ± 3.9 Open table in a new tab More H2O2 was generated with the mutants both in the absence and presence of the substrate compared with the wild type (Table I). In the P450cam system, mutations at the first layer of residues above the heme generate more H2O2 than those at the second and third layers with uncoupled substrates (22Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450, Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 83-124Crossref Google Scholar). Uncoupling occurs when mutations are introduced so as to alter water distribution in the P450camactive site and/or the stability of the oxygenated heme intermediate. Altered polarity at the heme pocket caused by mutation of nNOS Asp-314 and Thr-315 residues would favor charge separation at the iron, promoting the release of H2O2 or O·̄2. Thus, it is suggested that Asp-314 and Thr-315 must be located close to the heme. The Asp-314 → Ala mutant abolished the NO formation capability but increased the rate of H2O2 formation by 20-fold compared with the wild type in the presence of l-Arg. The NADPH oxidation rate and O2 consumption rate observed with the Asp-314 → Ala mutant in the presence of l-Arg were lower than observed with the wild type by 35 and 41%, respectively. Note that this mutant retained its cytochrome c reductase activity, indicating that the structure of the reductase domain is well preserved. The kinetic values obtained for the Asp-314 → Ala mutant are reminiscent of Thr-252 mutants of P450cam. This residue of P450cam is located at the heme distal site and is suggested to be important in the activation of molecular oxygen (9Raag R. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 26: 8165-8174Google Scholar, 10Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Kohga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Thr-252 → Ala mutation of P450cam abolished monooxygenase activity and markedly increased the H2O2 formation rate. The O2consumption rate obtained for this mutant of P450cam was 48% that of the wild type value, whereas the NADH oxidation rate was comparable to that of the P450cam wild type. Similarly, kinetic values obtained for the Asp-314 → Ala mutant of nNOS also appear to correspond with kinetic parameters obtained for the Thr-268 → Ala mutant of cytochrome P450BM3 (23Yeom H. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Fulco A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14733-14740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the results obtained for the Asp-314 → Ala mutant of nNOS differ from the kinetic parameters obtained for the Asp-251 → Ala and Asp-251 → Asn mutants of P450cam (or the Glu-318 → Ala mutant of P450d) in that the monooxidation activity, O2consumption, and NADH oxidation rates with the P450cammutants were extremely low, less than 1% that of the wild type values; therefore no marked increase in the rate of H2O2 formation was detected (24Gerber N.C.

In the P450 reaction cycle, protonation of dioxygen is required before the O–O bond can be cleaved and the active oxygen species responsible for the monooxidation reaction can be generated (9Raag R.

The distal-site threonine is thought to stabilize the oxygen-bound intermediate through the formation of a hydrogen bond to the iron-bound oxygen. H2O2 formation by the Thr mutants of P450cam and P450BM3 could be caused by breakdown of a putative iron-peroxo complex before the formation of the high-valent iron-oxo species, since the loss of the Thr hydroxyl group reduces the stability of the oxygen-bound intermediate (9Raag R.

An extra bound water molecule in the Thr mutants of P450camand P450BM3 may be responsible for uncoupling catalysis by supplying a proton and aiding the release of water and H2O2. Therefore, we conjecture that for nNOS, the carboxylate proton of Asp-314 or a neighboring water proton stabilizes the oxygen-bound intermediate in a similar fashion to Thr-252 of P450cam and Thr-268 of P450BM3, although this would require a low pK a for nNOS Asp-314. To examine whether or not Asp-314 is involved in the second reaction from NHA to NO, the same catalytic parameters were obtained for NHA as the substrate (Table I). For wild type nNOS, the NO formation rate with NHA was similar to the NADPH oxidation rate, implying that most of the reaction from NHA to NO is of the P450-type. For the Asp-314 → Ala mutant, the tendency of the catalytic values with NHA was similar to that with l-Arg (Table I). Thus, it is suggested the Asp-314 is also involved in the second reaction from NHA to NO. The rates of NO formation, NADPH oxidation, and O2consumption obtained for the Thr-315 → Ala mutant withl-Arg were 23–56% higher than the wild type. The Thr-315 → Ala mutation increased the formation of H2O2 by 11-fold compared with wild type in the presence of l-Arg. These results differ from the observations made for the Thr-252 → Ala mutants of P450cam and P450BM3, which exhibited low monooxidation activities, less than 15% those of the wild type values, and NADH oxidation and O2 consumption rates 25–48% those of the wild type values (10Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Kohga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Martinis A.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14733-14740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The NO formation rate with NHA for the Thr-315 → Ala mutant of nNOS was 17% higher than withl-Arg (Table I) but was similar to the NADPH oxidation rate. Thus, the role of Thr-315 of nNOS may be different from that of Thr-252 of P450cam (10Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Kohga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Soc. 1989; 111: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). H2O2produced by the Thr-315 → Ala mutant of nNOS may in part be used to facilitate the second reaction with NHA and generate extra NO, since NO is known to be generated from NHA and H2O2 with nNOS even in the absence of NADPH (27Pufahl R.A. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A hydrogen atom of a water molecule near Ala-315 in the Thr-315 → Ala mutant of nNOS may also directly serve as a hydrogen bond donor in the acid-base catalysis required for O–O bond scission (12Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 8742-8743Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

Otherwise, the Thr-315 → Ala mutation may alter the conformation and/or orientation of the substrate to allow easier access to active oxygen for more efficient catalysis to occur in the active site. During the review process, an x-ray crystallographic study of the truncated oxidative domain (residues 115–498, equivalent to residues 337–720 of nNOS) of inducible NOS (iNOS) was published (34Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 257: 424-431Google Scholar). It was claimed that l-Arg itself works as a proton donor to cleave the O–O bond of molecular oxygen for the reaction l-Arg to NHA because only one polar amino acid, Glu-371, exists in the active-site cavity, and this is in contact with l-Arg. However, the structure of half (residues 1–336) the oxidative domain at the N-terminal site of the nNOS was not yet determined. These missing residues are expected to contain sites very important in catalysis, such as for H4B binding, l-Arg binding, dimer formation, etc. (35Rodrı̀guez-Crespo I. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M.

Deletion of the N-terminal residues of iNOS (residues 1–114) or endothelial NOS (residues 1–105, residues 1–336 of nNOS) resulted in a change in the heme-iron spin state from high spin to low spin (35Rodrı̀guez-Crespo I.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This suggests that the N-terminal part of NOS is located close to the heme distal site in the native enzyme such that the N-terminal deletion induced an open space above the heme for a ligand such as a water molecule to coordinate to the heme iron, switching the spin state. In fact, the x-ray crystal structure shows that the heme of the truncated iNOS oxidative domain is orientated to face the vacant space and is exposed in places (34Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 257: 424-431Google Scholar). In P450s, amino acids in contact with the substrate differ from those contributing to O–O scission; for NOS, the same situation also appears likely (9Raag R. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Poulos T.L.

In summary, the results of this study suggest that Asp-314 is crucially involved in the stabilization of an oxygen-bound intermediate in nNOS catalysis and that Thr-315 is located close to the heme. Since the nNOS reaction is composed of two stepwise monooxidations, further studies to clarify how the Asp-314/Thr-315 residues contribute to these two steps remains to be carried out."
https://openalex.org/W2046723510,"The major structure of the low sulfated irregular region of porcine intestinal heparin was investigated by characterizing the hexasaccharide fraction prepared by extensive digestion of the highly sulfated region with Flavobacterium heparinase and subsequent size fractionation by gel chromatography. Structures of a tetrasaccharide, a pentasaccharide, and eight hexasaccharide components in this fraction, which accounted for approximately 19% (w/w) of the starting heparin representing the major oligosaccharide fraction derived from the irregular region, were determined by chemical and enzymatic analyses as well as 1H NMR spectroscopy. Five compounds including one penta- and four hexasaccharides had hitherto unreported structures. The structure of the pentasaccharide with a glucuronic acid at the reducing terminus was assumed to be derived from the reducing terminus of a heparin glycosaminoglycan chain and may represent the reducing terminus exposed by a tissue endo-β-glucuronidase involved in the intracellular post-synthetic fragmentation of macromolecular heparin. Eight out of the 10 isolated oligosaccharides shared the trisaccharide sequence, -4IdceAα1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1-, and its reverse sequence, -4GlcAβ1–4GlcNAcα1–4IdceAα1-, was not found. The latter has not been reported to date for heparin/heparan sulfate, indicating the substrate specificity of the d-glucuronyl C-5 epimerase. Furthermore, seven hexasaccharides shared the common trisulfated hexasaccharide core sequence ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4IdceAα1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4GlcN(N-sulfate) which contained the above trisaccharide sequence (ΔHexA, IdceA, GlcN, and GlcA represent 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid, l-iduronic acid, d-glucosamine, andd-glucuronic acid, respectively) and additional sulfate groups. The specificity of the heparinase used for preparation of the oligosaccharides indicates the occurrence of the common pentasulfated octasaccharide core sequence, -4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4IdceAα1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1-, where the central hexasaccharide is flanked by GlcN(N-sulfate) and HexA(2-sulfate) on the nonreducing and reducing sides, respectively. The revealed common sequence constituted a low sulfated trisaccharide representing the irregular region sandwiched by highly sulfated regions and should reflect the control mechanism of heparin biosynthesis. The major structure of the low sulfated irregular region of porcine intestinal heparin was investigated by characterizing the hexasaccharide fraction prepared by extensive digestion of the highly sulfated region with Flavobacterium heparinase and subsequent size fractionation by gel chromatography. Structures of a tetrasaccharide, a pentasaccharide, and eight hexasaccharide components in this fraction, which accounted for approximately 19% (w/w) of the starting heparin representing the major oligosaccharide fraction derived from the irregular region, were determined by chemical and enzymatic analyses as well as 1H NMR spectroscopy. Five compounds including one penta- and four hexasaccharides had hitherto unreported structures. The structure of the pentasaccharide with a glucuronic acid at the reducing terminus was assumed to be derived from the reducing terminus of a heparin glycosaminoglycan chain and may represent the reducing terminus exposed by a tissue endo-β-glucuronidase involved in the intracellular post-synthetic fragmentation of macromolecular heparin. Eight out of the 10 isolated oligosaccharides shared the trisaccharide sequence, -4IdceAα1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1-, and its reverse sequence, -4GlcAβ1–4GlcNAcα1–4IdceAα1-, was not found. The latter has not been reported to date for heparin/heparan sulfate, indicating the substrate specificity of the d-glucuronyl C-5 epimerase. Furthermore, seven hexasaccharides shared the common trisulfated hexasaccharide core sequence ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4IdceAα1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4GlcN(N-sulfate) which contained the above trisaccharide sequence (ΔHexA, IdceA, GlcN, and GlcA represent 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid, l-iduronic acid, d-glucosamine, andd-glucuronic acid, respectively) and additional sulfate groups. The specificity of the heparinase used for preparation of the oligosaccharides indicates the occurrence of the common pentasulfated octasaccharide core sequence, -4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4IdceAα1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1-, where the central hexasaccharide is flanked by GlcN(N-sulfate) and HexA(2-sulfate) on the nonreducing and reducing sides, respectively. The revealed common sequence constituted a low sulfated trisaccharide representing the irregular region sandwiched by highly sulfated regions and should reflect the control mechanism of heparin biosynthesis. Heparin is a highly sulfated co-polymer of glucosamine and uronic acid residues that are alternatively 1→4-linked. Most of the heparin molecule is accounted for by the major trisulfated disaccharide repeating unit, →4IdceA(2-sulfate)α1→4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1→. This repeating sequence forms highly sulfated regions and represents at least 75% heparin from porcine intestine (1Perlin A.S. Mackie D.M. Dietrich C.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1971; 18: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Undersulfation and substantial structural variability are observed in the rest of the region which is called the irregular region and distributed along the chain flanked by the fully sulfated region composed of the trisulfated disaccharide units, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the heparin polysaccharide chain (for reviews see Refs. 2Rodén L.

Heparin exhibits a wide range of biological activities such as inhibition of blood coagulation (5Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 275-294Google Scholar), modulation of cellular proliferation (6Clowes A. Karnovsky M. Nature. 1977; 265: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 7Thornton S.C.

These activities result from the ability of heparin to interact with various proteins causing their activation, deactivation, or stabilization. Interactions between heparin and proteins generally depend on the presence of sulfate groups. Some proteins such as lipoprotein lipase (13Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin (14Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and platelet factor 4 (15Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) bind to the highly sulfated region consisting exclusively of the trisulfated disaccharide unit in a seemingly nonspecific fashion. Still, many other proteins are thought to require specific sequences for binding, and the precise requirement for individual sulfate groups may vary from one protein to another. However, it should be noted that heparin is oversulfated and contains not only the essential sulfate groups but also additional nonessential ones for protein binding. The contribution of the irregular region to the biological activities of heparin is not well understood mainly because of the difficulty in analyzing the variably sulfated structure. However, it is well known that the antithrombin-binding minimum pentasaccharide sequence GlcN(6S) 1The abbreviations used are: 6S, 6-O-sulfate; NS, 2-N-sulfate; 2S, 2-O-sulfate; 3S, 3-O-sulfate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HexA, hexuronic acid; ΔHexA, 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid;MALDI TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.α1–4GlcAβ1–4GlcN(NS,3S)α1–4IdceA(2S)α1–4GlcN(NS,6S) (16Lindahl U.

Hence, it is conceivable that the low sulfated irregular region is involved in some other active domains as well. Biosynthetic reactions required to generate heparin sequences include the formation of an initial, simple polysaccharide structure, →4GlcAβ1→4GlcNAcα1→, that is subsequently modified throughN-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc units, C-5 epimerization of GlcA to IdceA units, and O-sulfation at C-2 of IdceA and C-6 of GlcN units (for review see Ref. 4Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar). The undersulfated region of the final product heparin is thought to have escaped such modifications. However, the mechanism by which certain residues are selected for modification is not understood, partly because of a lack of sequence information on relatively large fragments although certain rules about the sequential arrangement of various disaccharide units have been noted (4Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar). In this study we isolated and systematically characterized 10 oligosaccharide structures from the undersulfated region of porcine intestinal heparin after extensive digestion with heparinase, which acts only on the highly sulfated repeating region, to investigate the variability and/or regularity, if any, of the low sulfated region. A majority of these oligosaccharides were revealed to share a common trisulfated hexasaccharide core sequence. Stage 14 heparin was purchased from American Diagnostica, New York, and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as reported (18Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) and purified heparitinases I (EC 4.2.2.8) and II (no EC number) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo. Δ4,5-Glycuronate-2-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.-), abbreviated as Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase, was purified fromFlavobacterium heparinum (19McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J.

A peptide (Arg-Gly)15 was custom-synthesized by Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka. Each isolated oligosaccharide (0.5–1.0 nmol) was digested using 1–5 mIU of heparinase, heparitinase I and/or II, or Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase as described previously (18Sugahara K. Yamada S.

Successive enzymatic digestion of a given oligosaccharide with Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase and then heparitinase I or II was also carried out as reported (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC as reported (18Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrasaccharides obtained by deamination of the hexasaccharides in fractions 6-26 and 6-27 were tested for their sensitivities to α-iduronidase and β-glucuronidase to determine the isomer type of the uronic acid residue exposed at the nonreducing termini. Each heparin hexasaccharide (2.0 nmol) was treated at room temperature with HNO2 at pH 1.5 for 30 min (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and the resultant di- and/or tetrasaccharides were reduced under alkaline conditions using [3H]sodium borohydride (0.50 mCi) as reported (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each resultant [3H]tetrasaccharide (2.6 pmol) corresponding to approximately 2.9 × 103 dpm was digested using 17.7 mIU α-iduronidase or 48.9 mIU β-glucuronidase as reported (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides for NMR analysis were fully sodiated using a Dowex 50-X8 (Na+ form) column (7 × 18 mm) and then repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization. 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of hexasaccharides were measured on a Varian VXR-500 at a probe temperature of 26 °C as reported (26Yamada S.

Chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured indirectly relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in2H2O (28Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (797) Google Scholar). MALDI TOF mass spectra of a sulfated heparin oligosaccharide were recorded on a Konpact MALDI 1 (Shimadzu/Kratos) linear instrument in the positive ion mode at Toray Research Center, Kanagawa, Japan. Ultraviolet MALDI experiments were carried out using an N2 laser (Laser Science, Newton, MA; 337-nm wavelength, 3-ns pulse width). The ions were accelerated to 20 keV energy. Caffeic acid was used as a matrix at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 1:1 water/MeCN mixture. A synthetic peptide (Arg-Gly)15 was used as a complexing agent to shield the negatively charged groups of a sulfated oligosaccharide according to Juhasz and Biemann (29Juhasz P. Biemann K. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 270: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Aqueous solutions of a heparin oligosaccharide (10 pmol/μl) and the peptide (10 pmol/μl) were mixed in advance and then diluted with an equimolar proportion of the matrix solution. Of this sample/matrix solution, 0.5–1.0 μl was placed on the probe surface and dried under a stream of air. Uronic acid was determined by the carbazole method (30Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). Unsaturated uronic acid was spectrophotometrically quantified based upon an average millimolar absorption coefficient of 5.5 at 232 nm (31Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acids and amino sugars were quantified after acid hydrolysis in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 20 h or 3 m HCl at 100 °C for 16 h, respectively, using a Beckman 6300E amino acid analyzer (32Sugahara K. Okamoto H. Nakamura M. Shibamoto S. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Capillary electrophoresis was carried out to examine the purity of each isolated fraction in a Waters capillary ion analyzer as reported (33Sugahara K. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purified stage 14 heparin from porcine intestine was exhaustively digested with heparinase and fractionated into fractions 1–8 by gel filtration on a column of Bio-Gel P-10 (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fraction 8 contained disaccha-rides, and the major fraction 7, which contained tetrasaccha-rides, was characterized previously (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study fraction 6 was characterized. Fractions 6, 7, and 8 represented approximately 19, 24, and 32% (w/w) of the starting heparin, respectively. Amino sugar and uronic acid analyses showed that fraction 6 contained hexasaccharides. Fraction 6 was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column into fractions 6-1 to -37, as indicated in Fig.1. Twelve fractions, 6-1, -6, -17, -22, -23, -25, -26, -27, -30, -31, -32, and -34, were further purified by rechromatography. They altogether accounted for 61 mol% (as ΔHexA) of the oligosaccharides obtained from fraction 6. These individual fractions gave a single peak on HPLC but were 98, 91, 81, 57, 75, 95, 66, 89, 82, 80, 93, and 99% pure, respectively, when examined by capillary electrophoresis (results not shown). Characterization of fractions 6-1 and 6-6, which turned out to contain dermatan sulfate-derived oligosaccharides, will be described elsewhere. In this article, analyses of the other fractions are described. Disaccharide compositions of the isolated oligosaccharides were determined by digestion with heparitinases I and/or II, followed by HPLC analysis on an amine-bound silica column. Substrate specificities of the three heparin lyases are shown in Fig.2. Most of the fractions except for fractions 6-32 and 6-34 were degraded into disaccharides by the enzymes, although fractions 6-32 and 6-34 were degraded into approximately 1 mol each of a di- and a tetrasaccharide unit. The results are summarized in Table I. Recoveries of the oligosaccharides in Table I were calculated taking the absorbance of the parent oligosaccharide in each fraction as 100%. Excess or insufficient recoveries of the products were observed in some cases partly due to the products derived from possible impurities and partly due to the use of the average millimolar absorption coefficient of 5.5 at 232 nm obtained from unsaturated disaccharides (31Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for quantification of oligosaccharides. Millimolar absorption coefficients of individual oligosaccharides deviate from the average value to various degrees. As representative chromatograms, those obtained with fractions 6-23 and -27 are shown in Fig.3. Fractions 6-23 and -27 yielded ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) in a molar ratio of 1.0:1.4 and ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S), and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) in a molar ratio of 0.9:1.0:1.1, respectively, upon heparitinase I digestion. A sequential arrangement of the resultant disaccharide units in each parent oligosaccharide was determined based upon the results of enzymatic digestions using heparitinases I, II, and Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase (Table I) and 500-MHz 1H NMR analysis.Table IEnzymatic analysis of the isolated oligosaccharidesFractionYield1-anmol/100 mg of heparin.Heparitinase I digestHeparitinase II digest2-Sulfatase/Heparitinase II digest6–1786ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (63%) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (62%)ND1-bND, not determined.ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (62%) and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (67%)6–2277ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (56%) and a trisulfated tetrasaccharide (49%)NDND6–22S–142ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (91%) and a disulfated tetrasaccharide (83%)ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (220%) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc (66%)ND6–23284ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (88%) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (121%)NDΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (64%) and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (107%)6–2565ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (72%) and a trisulfated tetrasaccharide (83%)ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc (82%), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (82%), and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS) (82%)ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc (86%), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (86%) and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (86%)6–26142ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (53%), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (67%) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (67%)NDΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (53%), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (53%), and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (94%)6–27273ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (92%), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (104%), and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (109%)NDΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S) (69%) and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (179%)6–30186ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (118%) and a tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide (102%)ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc (123%), ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (100%), and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (138%)ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc (112%) and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (183%)6–31121ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (155%) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (92%)NDΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (227%)6–32122ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (107%) and a trisulfated tetrasaccharide (69%)ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (127%) and a trisulfated tetrasaccharide (73%)ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (136%) and a trisulfated tetrasaccharide (77%)6–34264ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (158%) and a tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide (110%)ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (147%) and a tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide (119%)ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) (129%) and a tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide (127%)1-a nmol/100 mg of heparin.1-b ND, not determined.

Although some fractions were still mixtures as revealed by capillary electrophoresis, it was possible to extract sequence information about the major compound in these fractions by taking advantage of1H NMR spectroscopy. Since peak heights of resonances reflect molar ratios of the components, signals for the major compound in the mixtures could be easily distinguished from those of the minor impurities. The internal uronic acid residues of each isolated oligosaccharide were unambiguously identified based upon the chemical shifts of the anomeric proton signals and the coupling constantsJ 1,2. Anomeric proton signals of an αIdceA and a βGlcA residue in heparin/heparan sulfate oligosaccharides are observed around δ 5.2–5.0 and 4.7–4.5, respectively (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H.

J. 1985; 229: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The coupling constants J 1,2 of αIdceA and βGlcA in heparin/heparan sulfate oligosaccharides are approximately 3.0 and 8.0 Hz, respectively (22Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J.

When fraction 6-25 was digested with heparitinase II, it yielded equimolar amounts of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc, ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S), and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS) (Table I). Upon successive digestion with Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase and then heparitinase II, it yielded equimolar amounts of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc, ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S), and ΔHexA-GlcN(NS) (Table I). These results indicated that the disaccharide unit on the nonreducing terminus was ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS). When digested with heparitinase I, fraction 6-25 gave rise to equimolar amounts of ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) and a component that eluted near the elution position of a trisulfated tetrasaccharide (Table I), indicating that ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S) was derived from the reducing end. Therefore, the compound in fraction 6-25 is a pentasulfated hexasaccharide with a sequence of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS)-HexA(2S)-GlcNAc-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S). In the spectrum of fraction 6-25, six individual saccharide residues were readily identified. Two internal uronic acid residues were determined as IdceA-4 and GlcA-2 based on the chemical shifts of the anomeric proton signals, at δ 5.192 and 4.574, respectively, as well as the coupling constantsJ 1,2 of 2.0 and 8.0Hz, respectively. The chemical shifts of H-1 and H-2 of the IdceA residue of the compound in fraction 6-25 were shifted downfield by approximately 0.2 and 0.6 ppm, respectively, when compared with those of the nonsulfated IdceA residue of the oligosaccharides isolated from bovine kidney heparan sulfate or porcine intestinal heparin (22Yamada S.

Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the proton chemical shifts of the GlcA residue of the compound in this fraction were very similar to those of the nonsulfated GlcA residue. These results indicated the 2-sulfation of IdceA-4 and the nonsulfation of GlcA-2 of this compound. Based upon these NMR data and the sequential arrangement of the disaccharide units determined by enzymatic analysis, the structure of the major compound in fraction 6-25 has been determined as the following.ΔHexA(2S)α1–4GlcN(NS)α1–4IdceA(2S)α1–4GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4GlcN(NS,6S)Structure 1.

Searching to clarify mechanism(s) of hyposialylation, we observed two sulfated secreted glycoproteins (molecular mass ∼47 and ∼40 kDa) (P47 and P40), which were differentially sulfated and/or differentially secreted in the culture supernatants of CEMLAI/NP cells when compared with parental CEM cells. A hybridoma clone (7H1) resulting from the fusion between CEMLAI/NP and human embryonic fibroblasts MRC5 cells produced very large amounts of P47 that was purified using Jacalin lectin (specific for O-glycans) and microsequenced. Cloning of P47 was achieved using a CEMLAI/NP cDNA library screened with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. A single open reading frame encoding a protein of 323 amino acids was deduced from the longest isolated recombinant (1.4 kilobase). P47 is a secreted sulfated protein. It carries an NH2-terminal RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) triplet, a striking α-helical leucine zipper composed of six heptads, and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain.

In addition, a hinge region with numerous condensed potential sites forO-glycan side chains, which are also the most likely sulfation sites, is located between the RGD and leucine zipper domains.

Although the level of hyposialylation might be very important in HIV-1-infected T cells and seems to mostly affect O-glycans (10Perrin C. Giordanengo V. Bannwarth S. Blaive B. Lefebvre J.-C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the activity of Galβ1-3GalNAcα-2,3-sialyltransferases types I and II (hST3Gal I and hST3Gal II), which are the two principal sialyltransferases that act onO-glycan cores, appears to be conserved (11Giordanengo V.

Among other pathways examined to explain the mechanism(s) of hyposialylation, secretion of two O-glycosylated and sulfated proteins (P47 and P40) has been observed in culture supernatants of latently HIV-1-infected CEMLAI/NP cells (6Lefebvre J.C.

Here, we report molecular cloning and initial characterization of the P47 protein, which we propose to name LSLCL (lymphocytic secreted long form of C-type lectin). CEM, MOLT-4, HUT 78, Jurkat, SUP-T1, Raji, Daudi, HL-60, THP-1, U-937, and MRC5 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 or basal medium Eagle (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Whittaker M.A. Bioproducts), supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). CEMLAI/NP are CEM cells infected by HIV-1 LAI strain. They harbor HIV-1 provirus but are latently infected and virus-nonproducing (6Lefebvre J.C. Giordanengo V. Doglio A. Cagnon L. Breittmayer J.P. Peyron J.F. Lesimple J. Virology. 1994; 199: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 7H1 clone was obtained as follows 2J. Lesimple, S. Bannwarth, V. Giordanengo, and J.C. Lefebvre, manuscript in preparation.: hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine-sensitive CEMLAI/NP cells were first selected as cells resistant to 8-azaguanine (15 μg/ml) after mutational treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate. Using polyethylene glycol, resistant cells were fused with human embryonic fibroblasts MRC5. Hybrid clones were selected as hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine-resistant cells. Rabbits were immunized with the oligopeptide ARGAEREWEGGWGGAQEE (Arga), coupled to KLH protein (Neosystem Laboratoire, Strasbourg, France). The sequence of the peptide was determined by NH2-terminal microsequencing of purified P47 as described below. A rabbit serum (Argara) was shown to precipitate two proteins (P47 and P40) from lysates and culture supernatants of secreting cells. Cells (4 × 106/ml) were washed and incubated for 18 h in SO42−-free RPMI 1640 medium containing SO42− (ICN Biomedicals) (500 μCi/ml) and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were sedimented, and culture supernatants added with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm, final concentration) (Sigma), aprotinin (10 mg/ml) (Sigma), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml) (Boehringer Mannheim). Supernatants were then mixed with 10 μl of immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) previously coated with 2 μg of the various biotinylated lectins, PNA (peanut agglutinin from Arachis hypogaea), Jacalin (fromArtocarpus integrifolia), or GNA (from Galanthus nivalis), all purchased from EY Laboratories. 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) precoated with 10 μl of rabbit serum were added for immunoprecipitations. After 2 h of agitation, precipitates were collected by brief centrifugation. The pellets were washed three times in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, and the antiprotease mixture as described above, and washed once with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. They were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (2% SDS, 1.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 3 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide). After intensification with Amplify (Amersham), the gels were vacuum dried and exposed to XAR5 Kodak films. The culture of 7H1 cells was amplified up to one liter of cell suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Then the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 without fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C for two days. After centrifugation of cells, supernatants were added with the mix of antiproteases as described above and with streptavidin-immobilized beads (1 ml/liter) precoated with biotinylated Jacalin. After 2 h of agitation, precipitates were collected by brief centrifugation. The pellets were washed 3 times in lysis-buffer and once with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. They were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (2% SDS, 1.7 m2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 3 min, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide). For NH2-terminal sequencing, proteins were transferred to Problott membranes (Applied Biosystems). The peptides were detected by staining with 0.003% amido black, then the P47 band was carefully excised and treated on an Applied Biosystems model 470A sequencer. Internal sequences were obtained from peptides separated by high performance chromatography following cleavage of purified P47 with trypsin. A CEMLAI/NP cell line cDNA library was constructed using pcDNA3 vector plasmid and a cDNA synthesis kit (both from Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT) (NotI) primer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 4 × 106 colonies of Escherichia coli DH5α transfected with this library were isolated and screened by using the oligonucleotide probe 5′-GAGTGGGAGGGIGGITGGGGIGGIGCICAGGAGGAG-3′, where inosine were incorporated to limit degeneracy. The sequence of this probe was based on the peptide sequence EWEGGWGGAQEE established by NH2-terminal sequencing of P47. This probe was 5′-end radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (CLONTECH) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals). Membrane prehybridization was carried out at 60 °C for 3 h in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 × SSC, 7% SDS, 10 × Denhardt's solution, and 1% salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was achieved overnight at 60 °C. Then membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 2% SDS solution for 20 min at 20 °C, once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS solution for 20 min at 20 °C, and once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS solution for 30 min at 48 °C, and thereafter exposed to XAR5 Kodak film for 1 day at −70 °C. Several types of recombinants were selected and sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar), using an ABI PRISMTM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase, FS (Perkin Elmer), and an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin Elmer). Analysis was started on each strand using SP6 and T7 primers (Invitrogen) and extended with successive overlapping primers (20-base oligonucleotides) that were synthesized using an Applied Biosystem 381A DNA synthesizer. Sequences were analyzed using MacDNASIS (Hitachi Software). Total RNA were extracted according to the guanidine isothiocyanate technique, described by Davis et al. (13Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Davis L.G. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 130-135Crossref Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA were selected from 200 μg of total RNA by incubating with 100 mg oligo(dT) cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 5 ml of TL buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS at room temperature with gentle shaking for at least 30 min. The beads were collected and washed twice with TL buffer and twice with the same buffer containing 0.15 m LiCl. The beads were then deposited on a Spin-X column (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for extensive washings with TL buffer containing 0.15 m LiCl, and thereafter the poly(A)+ RNA were eluted with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS) and precipitated with 2.5 vol of ethanol. For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were electrophoresed on denaturing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham) with a 20 × SSC transfer buffer. Premade Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues (CLONTECH) were also used. The P47 probe was a α-32P random labeled fragment of 1.4 kb that was excised from the longest recombinant in pcDNA3 vector, isolated from the cDNA CEMLAI/NP library as described above. Prehybridizations and hybridizations were performed at 42 °C as described above. Hybridized membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 2% SDS solution for 20 min at 20 °C, once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS solution for 20 min at 20 °C, and once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS solution for 30 min at 58–60 °C. Membranes were exposed overnight to XAR5 Kodak film at −70 °C. The detection of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and/or β-actin-encoding mRNA were used as internal controls. Data base searches for nucleotides and amino acids sequences alignments were achieved using the BLAST program of the National Center for Biotech. Protein sequence analysis, motif search, and hydrophobicity were established with MacDNASIS programs. Since the alterations of sialylation that we have observed on HIV-1-infected CEM cells were principally involvingO-glycans attached to the two major lymphocytic surface glycoproteins CD45 (6Lefebvre J.C. Giordanengo V. Doglio A. Cagnon L. Breittmayer J.P. Peyron J.F. Lesimple J. Virology. 1994; 199: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and CD43 (7Lefebvre J.C. Giordanengo V. Limouse M. Doglio A. Cucchiarini M. Monpoux F. Mariani R. Peyron J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we verified the presence of possible O-glycosylated proteins in the culture supernatants by using the lectins PNA, specific for the O-glycan core 1 nonsialylated disaccharides Galβ1-3GalNAc (14Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8518-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Jacalin, specific for sialylated and nonsialylated O-glycans (15Hortin G.L. Trimpe B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, an 35SO42−metabolic incorporation assay was used to display secreted glycoproteins. Jacalin only was able to precipitate a protein doublet (molecular mass, 47 and 40 kDa) (P47, P40) from supernatants of parental CEM cells culture (Fig. 1,lane 2), whereas this was achieved by both Jacalin or PNA from supernatants of HIV-1-infected CEMLAI/NP cells culture (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). This fact could be explained by hyposialylation status of CEMLAI/NP cells that affects multiple O-glycosylated proteins, whereas parental cells are normally sialylated. The following has to be pointed out: (i) the nonreactivity of the lectin GNA (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and9) that preferentially binds terminal mannose (16Kaku H. Goldstein I.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); (ii) a weak upward of the CEM doublet (Fig. 1, lane 2) probably due to the more numerous sialic acid molecules beared by the P40 and P47 proteins of these cells as confirmed by the nonreactivity of the lectin PNA (Fig. 1, lane 1); and (iii) a much more pronounced doublet P40-P47 from CEMLAI/NP cells when compared with parental CEM doublet although equal quantities of total protein were deposited in each lane of the gel. This interesting result was further confirmed on several occasions and was also observed when culture supernatants from CEMBCL cells (virus-producing CEM cells infected by HIV-1 strain BCL) (6Lefebvre J.C. Giordanengo V. Doglio A. Cagnon L. Breittmayer J.P. Peyron J.F. Lesimple J. Virology. 1994; 199: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were compared with supernatants from parental CEM cells culture (not shown). This is currently being investigated in terms of increased activity of sulfotransferases and/or secretion regulation. To obtain a sufficient material to allow sequencing of these proteins, hybrid cells were raised by fusion between CEMLAI/NP cells and embryonic human fibroblasts MRC5 by using polyethylene glycol as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2 It was found that the clone 7H1 secreted very large amounts of P47 (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5) that was then purified using Jacalin lectin and then microsequenced. Thus, the sequences of an NH2-terminal and two internal peptides were obtained (Fig. 2,underlined sequences). Thereafter, the cloning of P47 was achieved by screening a CEMLAI/NP cDNA library constructed in pcDNA3 vector using a degenerate oligonucleotide based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. The longest isolated recombinant (1.4 kb) yielded a single open reading frame of 972 nucleotides encoding a protein of 323 amino acids (Fig. 2). Apart from an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region of 21 residues located just upstream from the known microsequenced NH2-terminal part of P47 (Figs. 2 and3), no other potential hydrophobic transmembrane domain was found (Fig. 3). Thus this region very likely corresponded to the signal peptide of preprotein P47, which was purified from culture supernatants, and then appeared as a secreted protein with a Gly21↓Ala22 signal peptidase cleavage site. As shown on Fig. 2, several other domains were identified on P47: (i) a glutamic acid-rich NH2-terminal domain localized between amino acids 22 and 90 with a stretch of 6 successive identical residues (Glu84–89); (ii) an RGD triplet (Arg61-Gly-Asp63) in the middle of the glutamic acid-rich domain; (iii) a leucine zipper consisting of six heptads, spanning Val108-Ala149; and (iv) a C-terminal C-type lectin domain that is known as a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (17Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) spanning Gly176-Phe323 and including most of the amino acids conserved for this type of functional domain, in particular the six cysteines (Fig. 2, closed arrows) found in the long form CRDs (18Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, a (Thr-Pro-Ser)-rich domain with 13 Thr/Pro/Ser out of 14 residues was found between amino acids 91 and 104 (Fig.2).Figure 3Hydrophobicity of LSLCL (P47).Hydropathy was calculated using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (37Kyte J.

The structure of P47 could thus be related to that of collectins, which are secreted proteins containing a CRD connected to a collagen-like α-helix suitable to form coiled coils (17Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of P47, spanning Ala22-Ala90, is rich in glutamic acid (30% of residues) and has a predicted pI of 3.95. This is reminiscent of the secretory eosinophil major basic protein, which also contains a C-terminal C-type lectin and a glutamic acid-rich NH2-terminal part with a pI of 3.9 (20Barker R.L. Gleich G.J. Pease L.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that is sequestered into secretory granules before release. At the time we were cloning P47, there was no significant similarity to any other protein accessible from data banks. The best alignments were found to be 29.2% with tetranectin-like protein (21Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and 24.8% with tetranectin (22Clemensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), provided by the restricted CRD sequence Cys177-Arg228 of P47 (Fig. 4). Tetranectin is a plasminogen kringle 4-binding protein with a CRD joined to an α-helical coiled coil structure (23Wewer U.M. Albrechtsen R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 253-262PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nielsen B.B. Karstrup J.S. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). During preparation of this manuscript, Hiraoka et al. (25Hiraoka A. Sugimura A. Seki T. Nagasawa T. Ohta N. Shimonishi M. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using a differential technique with subtractive probe, published the cloning of SCGF, a protein that very closely matched P47. However, SCGF and P47 appear to be different because SCGF cDNA lacks 234 nucleotides encoding a peptide of 76 amino acids located in the CRD found on P47. In particular, the Cys204 of P47 is absent from SCGF (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, these authors did not mention any of the protein domains (RGD, leucine zipper, O-glycan sites, or CRD) that are present on SCGF and P47 (Fig. 2). Sulfation of P47 was not likely to occur on tyrosine residues. Indeed, tyrosyl protein sulfotransferase is known to recognize tyrosines in exposed protein domains containing acidic amino acids (26Hortin G. Folz R. Gordon J.I. Strauss A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 26: 326-333Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that were not found in the surroundings of the 6 Tyr residues present on P47 (Fig. 2, open arrows). P47 did not show any potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). This fact correlated well with the nonreactivity of P47 with the lectin GNA (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the (Thr-Pro-Ser)-rich domain is particularly suited forO-glycans attachment (28Yoshida A. Suzuki M. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16884-16888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and could explain the binding of P47 with the lectins Jacalin and PNA (Fig. 1). In this context, and since sulfation of P47 did not implicate tyrosine residues norN-glycan, the O-glycans remained the most probable or even the sole possible sulfation sites, as it has been demonstrated on other proteins such as the cell surface mucin of mammary adenocarcinoma cells (29Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Cell Biochem. 1989; 40: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), gpMEL-14 (LECAM-1) (30Imai Y. Singer M.S. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and leukosialin (CD43) (31Wilson A.P. Rider C.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1777-1783PubMed Google Scholar, 32Giordanengo V. Limouse M. Peyron J.F. Lefebvre J.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of P47, calculated on the basis of its amino acid sequence subtracted the signal peptide, was 33,532 Da. We conclude that O-glycan side chains added with sulfate residues account for approximately 13,500 Da in the mature secreted form of P47, which thus could be regarded as a mucin-like protein. It was tempting to compare P47 to a bifunctional molecule with an RGD domain located in the very hydrophilic NH2-terminal portion and known to interact with integrins (33Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3891) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain well known to bind glycoconjugates (17Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), separated from each other by a neck region consisting of an extendedO-glycosylated hinge domain and a leucine zipper. In this context it seemed interesting to select, among numerous proteins harboring a CRD, the two proteins tetranectin (22Clemensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and low affinity receptor for IgE (CD23) (34Conrad D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 623-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) for alignment with P47. Indeed, these molecules showed a neck leucine-rich region, upstream of their CRD, suitable for coiled coil associations. As shown on Fig.5, there are several conserved amino acids, especially the six cysteines and surrounding residues in CRD, but also numerous aliphatic amino acids in the portion corresponding to the leucine zipper of P47 that is aligned with the leucine zipper of CD23 as well as with the E2 α-helix that governs the coiled coil formation of tetranectin (24Nielsen B.B. Karstrup J.S. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed a single band at approximately 1.42 kb (Fig. 6, A and C), even when a better resolution was obtained with mRNA deposits in 1-cm large wells (Fig. 6 B). Among the various cell lines tested, all T and B lymphoblastoid (CEM, MOLT-4, HUT 78, Jurkat, SUP-T1, Raji, Daudi) cells highly expressed P47, whereas monocytoid U-937 and THP-1 expressed very faintly, and embryonic fibroblasts MRC5 did not (Fig. 6 A). Tissue-specific expression was analyzed using commercially prepared Northern blots. A very weak band was seen in most tissues (Fig. 6 C, lanes 7–14). Lymphoid tissues, notably bone marrow, appeared to better express P47 (Fig.6 C, lanes 1–6). Since the sequence studied in this report is likely of lymphoblast/lymphocyte origin, it is quite possible that the weak Northern signals seen in essentially all tested tissues is the result of contaminating blood that it is difficult to entirely remove during preparation of tissues. The transcription rate of P47 appeared to be identical in both HIV-1-infected CEMLAI/NP and parental CEM cells, as confirmed on several occasions (Fig. 6 A and B). This result is important to consider while compared with the apparent differential expression of P47 when examined after35SO42− incorporation (Fig.1). This phenomenon is currently being investigated in terms of increased activity of sulfotransferases and/or secretion regulation. Several discrepancies were noted between P47 (this study) and SCGF (25Hiraoka A. Sugimura A. Seki T. Nagasawa T. Ohta N. Shimonishi M. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas expression of SCGF was found in fibroblasts, P47 was not detected in similar cells (Fig. 6 A). On the contrary, SCGF mRNAs were not detected in MOLT-4 cells, although we did find P47 in these cells (Fig. 6 A). We showed two closely migrating sulfated proteins with a molecular mass of 47 and 40 kDa that were precipitated from culture supernatants by lectins (Fig. 1). The 40-kDa species is very likely a derivative of P47, since the two species were precipitated by rabbit serum Argara raised against an NH2-terminal peptide of P47 (not shown). Although a single mRNA species (1.42 kb) was seen after probing with a full-length cDNA corresponding to P47 (Fig. 6), it is tempting to think that P40 could correspond to SCGF. However, SCGF was claimed to have a molecular mass of 29 kDa according to (i) calculation from its amino acid sequence and (ii) partial purification of SCGF monomer by chromatography as an elution peak of 29 kDa (25Hiraoka A. Sugimura A. Seki T. Nagasawa T. Ohta N. Shimonishi M. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that SCGF contains the same Thr/Pro/Ser-rich domain as P47 and that it is very likely O-glycosylated, thus leading SCGF to a molecular mass >29,000 Da. In addition, it is difficult to consider SCGF as a spliced form of P47. Indeed, it can be deduced from comparison of gene structures of C-type CRDs (35Bezouska K. Crichlow G.V. Rose J.M. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the most probable exon that might be removed from P47 to generate SCGF could correspond to the internal peptide Glu221-Phe262 and not to the differential peptide Ala198-Gln275 present on P47 only. Therefore, P40 is very likely a processed form of P47, and there is no obvious explanation for differential transcription of LSLCL (P47) and SCGF. SCGF has been shown to exhibit burst promoting activities when associated with growth factors such as erythropoietin or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (25Hiraoka A. Sugimura A. Seki T. Nagasawa T. Ohta N. Shimonishi M. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The RGD domain present on P47 and SCGF might explain such properties, since this type of motif is known to interact with integrins that activate signal transduction pathways coordinated with responses to growth factors (36Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). However, Hiraoka et al. (25Hiraoka A. Sugimura A. Seki T. Nagasawa T. Ohta N. Shimonishi M. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) claimed the activities of SCGF to be accounted for by a protein purified from culture supernatants as an elution peak of 29 kDa. They have cloned SCGF using a differential technique with subtractive probe and claimed this protein to be the active species of 29 kDa. However, analogy between P47 and SCGF is sufficient to allow similar molecular masses that might be of 40–47 kDa rather than 29 kDa. In additon, the various functional domains (C-type lectin, leucine zipper, and RGD) are reminiscent of collectins that are known as anti-infectious agents (17Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) rather than of growth factors. Hiraoka et al. (25Hiraoka A. Sugimura A. Seki T. Nagasawa T. Ohta N. Shimonishi M. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7577-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) conclude their paper as follows: “It is presently unclear, however, whether KPB-M15-CM contains another SCGF-like factor.” We think that cloning of SCGF might be fortuitous and that the growth factor activity of culture supernatants from KPB-M15 cells remains to be determined. Since P47 is composed of several domains that allow for prediction of various interactions, counterparts of this complex molecule remain to be identified to understand its exact role(s).

Comparison of reaction profiles by observing changes in the absorbance of the cofactor after stopped-flow mixing, revealed that a slow reaction, in which approximately one-third of the wild-type enzyme is converted to an unreactive complex during catalysis, does not occur with the H167N mutant enzyme.

This reaction is attributed to a substrate-induced conformational change, a proposal that is supported by differential scanning calorimetry. Glutamate decarboxylase is a member of a large family of pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviation used is: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate.-dependent enzymes which catalyze a wide variety of different reactions on their amino acid substrates (1Sandmeier E. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1944; 221: 997-1002Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme from Escherichia coli is the most studied of the amino acid decarboxylases, its three-dimensional structure has not been solved. However, sequence comparisons show that it is homologous to ornithine decarboxylase fromLactobacillus 30a, the three-dimensional structure of which (2Momany C. Ghosh R. Hackert M.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Momany C. Ernst S. Ghosh R. Chang N.-L. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1955; 252: 643-655Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) shows two histidine residues, His-223 and His-354, close to and on either side of the coenzyme (2Momany C. Ghosh R. Hackert M.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Momany C. Ernst S. Ghosh R. Chang N.-L. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1955; 252: 643-655Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These histidines are conserved in the sequences of most, if not all, of the PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases (2Momany C. Ghosh R. Hackert M.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There is no doubt that His-275 ofE. coli glutamate decarboxylase aligns with His-354 of ornithine decarboxylase since, in both enzymes as in other amino acid decarboxylases, it immediately precedes the lysine residue that forms an imine with the coenzyme (Fig. 1). In ornithine decarboxylase, the imidazole ring of His-354 contributes to binding the 5′-phosphate of the cofactor and is considered unlikely to participate in catalysis unless it is displaced by a substrate-induced conformational change (2Momany C. Ghosh R. Hackert M.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Momany C. Ernst S. Ghosh R. Chang N.-L. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1955; 252: 643-655Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Alignment of His-167 of glutamate decarboxylase is less clear because sequence similarity between the two enzymes is weak in this region (Fig. 1). However, the presence, in ornithine decarboxylase, of the imidazole ring of His-223 just below the imine of the cofactor on the re face, suggests that this arrangement may be a common feature of the amino acid decarboxylases. His-167 in glutamate decarboxylase is the only histidine residue that can reasonably occupy this position unless there are major differences between the folds of the two proteins. Several stages in the catalytic mechanism of amino acid decarboxylation involve proton transfers for which histidine residues might be responsible (Scheme ins;1821s1}1). The formation of an external aldimine (III) requires multiple proton transfers and, after decarboxylation to give the quinonoid intermediate (IV), the carboxyl group is replaced by a proton. Further proton transfers, analogous to those occurring in external aldimine formation, are required for liberation of the product 4-aminobutyrate. An additional protonation occurs in a side reaction where a proton is added to C4′ of the cofactor rather than Cα of the substrate to give an external aldimine of pyridoxamine phosphate with succinic semialdehyde. This reaction, which occurs only once in 3 × 105 turnovers in E. coli glutamate decarboxylase (4Almazov V.P. Morozov Iu.V. Savin F.A. Sukhareva B.S. J. Mol. Biol. U.S.S.R. 1985; 2: 359-370Google Scholar), is a feature of most amino acid decarboxylases (5Sukhareva B.S. Braunstein A.E. Mol. Biol. (Engl. Transl.). 1971; 5: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar, 6O'Leary M.H. Baughn R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7168-7173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Minelli A. Charteris A.T.

In some of these enzymes this abortive transamination is kinetically more prominent and is almost certainly metabolically important because it inactivates the enzyme by leaving the cofactor as pyridoxamine phosphate. Considerable attention has been given to the stereochemistry of amino acid decarboxylation and subsequent protonation. Decarboxylation requires the carboxyl group to be orthogonal to the plane comprising the cofactor pyridinium ring and the imine double bond (10Dunathan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The proton which replaces the carboxyl group at Cα arrives from the same direction in which the carboxyl group has left (11Yamada H. O'Leary M.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Retention of configuration has also been observed in all other amino acid decarboxylases in which the question has been investigated (12Stevenson D.E. Akhtar M. Gani D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7660-7666Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Stevenson D.E. Akhtar M. Gani D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7631-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14No Z.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7648-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) indicates that, in methionine decarboxylase, a histidine residue protonates at Cα, whereas a lysine residue protonates at C4′ and it has been argued that lysine and histidine perform the corresponding protonations in glutamate decarboxylase (16Tilley K. Akhtar M. Gani D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3079-3087Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have examined the effect of mutations at His-167 and at His-275 on the kinetic and structural properties of the enzyme. 4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase was prepared as described (17De Biase D. Barra D. Bossa F. Pucci P. John R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20056-20061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D2O was from Sigma, Vent polymerase was from New England Biolabs. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, the agarose gel DNA extraction kit, and Gabase were from Boehringer. The T7 sequencing kit, DEAE-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-25 were from Pharmacia. [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Ingredients for bacterial growth were from Difco. Oligonucleotides were from Genenco. Other chemicals were from BDH. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension polymerase chain reactions (18Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Snisky J.J. White T.J. Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Snisky J.J.

External primers annealing over the N- and C-terminal sequences were those used in the construction of the expression plasmid containing thegadB gene (19De Biase D. Tramonti A. John R.A. Bossa F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 8: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers for H167N were 5′-GCTGGAATAAATTCGCCC-3′ and its complementary sequence. Those for H275N and H275Q were 5′-GCTTCAGGCCAGAAATTCG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCAGGCAATAAATTCG-3′ and their complementary sequences, respectively. Plasmid pQgadB was used as template. The products of polymerase chain reactions (25 cycles), carried out with 2.5 units of Vent polymerase with denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 45 °C (H167N) or 48 °C (H275N and H275Q) for 1 min, and extension at 74 °C for 2 min, were used as templates with the external primers to generate the complete coding sequence of glutamate decarboxylase. Fragments (NcoI/EcoRV for H167N and EcoRV/HindIII for H275N and H275Q) were subcloned into pQgadB. The newly inserted parts of the expression constructs, pQgadH167N, pQgadH275N, and pQgadH275Q, were sequenced and the plasmids were used to transform E. coli JM109 carrying the plasmid pREP4. Expression, purification, and assay of mutant forms of glutamate decarboxylase were as described for the wild-type enzyme (19De Biase D. Tramonti A. John R.A. Bossa F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 8: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) except where stated. N-(5′-Phosphopyridoxyl)glutamate was prepared by treating 0.5 m sodium glutamate and 0.5 mmPLP (pH 4.5) with sodium cyanoborohydride (10 mm). Apo-forms of wild-type and mutant forms of glutamate decarboxylase (10 mg/ml in 0.1 m piperazine-HCl, pH 4.5, containing 0.1m dithiothreitol) were reconstituted with a 5-fold molar excess of N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)glutamate for 1 h (25 °C). Samples were concentrated, separated on Sephadex G-25, and the proteins dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.6) containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Thermal unfolding of degassed samples (1.5–2.0 mg/ml) was analyzed under nitrogen pressure on a MicroCal MC-2D differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). Results were corrected for instrumental baseline and normalized for protein concentration. No reversibility was observed in a second heating cycle. Enzyme samples were brought into 99.5% D2O by repeated concentration and dilution. The enzyme (0.8 μm) was mixed with glutamate (14.25 mm). DCl was added to maintain constant pD of 4.6 (reading on pH meter = 4.2). At the end of the reaction (2 h) the solution was neutralized by adding solid Tris, lyophilized, and redissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O. NMR spectra were determined using a Bruker AMX 360 spectrometer. The stereochemistry of the deuterated 4-aminobutyrate was determined by repeating the NMR analysis after an overnight incubation in the presence of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (0.36 mg/ml). Stopped-flow experiments were performed on a SF-1 stopped-flow spectophotometer (Hi-Tech, Salisbury, United Kingdom). Product formation during the period from 0.2 to 7 s was measured using a quenched flow apparatus (8Grant P.L. Basford J.M. John R.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Eccleston J.F. Messerschmidt R.G. Yates D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Reactions lasting longer than 7 s were stopped manually. Curve fitting and statistical analyses were performed using the data manipulation software Scientist (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT). Absorption spectra were measured with a Hewlett-Packard model 8452 diode-array spectophotometer. CD spectra were recorded as the average of 3 scans on a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter equipped with a DP 520 processor at 25 °C using a 2-mm quartz cell. 4-Aminobutyrate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (8Grant P.L. Basford J.M. John R.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or using a commercial preparation containing 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (19De Biase D. Tramonti A. John R.A. Bossa F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 8: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The far UV CD spectra of the H167N and H275Q mutants were identical with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2) indicating that these mutations had not introduced major changes in the global structure of the enzyme. The H275N mutant precipitated too rapidly at low concentrations to permit Far UV CD analysis. Yields of the H167N mutant enzyme after the standard purification, which does not include added PLP, were as high as those of the wild-type enzyme. This form, like the wild-type enzyme, was stable for many months at 4 °C and for several hours at room temperature. Its absorption and CD spectra (Fig. 2) were almost identical with those of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that one molecule of cofactor was bound per monomer. The specific activity (126 μmol min−1 mg−1) was approximately half that of the wild-type enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetry of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3) showed that the transition temperature of the apoenzyme reconstituted with the covalent substrate-cofactor adduct,N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)glutamate, was 8 °C higher than that of the native holo-enzyme (51 °C) suggesting that binding of glutamate at the active site stabilizes the structure considerably. When the same experiment was carried out on the H167N enzyme, the holoenzyme was found to be 4 °C more stable than the wild-type enzyme but the mutant was not further stabilized when the cofactor was replaced by N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)glutamate (Fig. 3).Figure 3Differential scanning calorimetry of wild-type and H167N mutant glutamate decarboxylase.

The samples were scanned at a heating rate of 60 °C/h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purification of the H275N enzyme according to the standard protocol resulted in a yield of enzyme protein 63% of that normally achieved with the wild-type enzyme. The absorption spectrum showed that this form contained no cofactor. Inclusion of PLP (0.1 mm) in solutions used for dialysis gave an enzyme preparation that clearly bound the cofactor but with an absorption spectrum (Fig. 2 a) which showed more 340 nm chromophore than is present in the wild-type enzyme. The instability of this form of the enzyme prevented measurement of its kinetic properties. The H275Q mutant was more stable, although, after the standard purification, its absorption spectrum (Fig. 2 a) showed that its coenzyme content was lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Treatment with 0.1 m NaOH to release the PLP showed it to contain 0.5 mol of cofactor per mol of subunit. Its specific activity was 80 units/mg (35% that of the wild-type enzyme). Thus, per mole of cofactor, the specific activity of this mutant is 70% that of the wild-type enzyme. Glutamate decarboxylase undergoes a sharp, pH-dependent, transition in which a 420-nm absorbing form, presumed to be the protonated internal aldimine, is converted to a 340-nm form. The transition involves uptake of multiple protons and lasts several seconds, demonstrating that a slow, protonation-dependent reaction is involved as well as the protonation itself (21Shukuya R. Schwert G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1653-1657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Leary M.H. Brummund W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3737-3745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The midpoint of the transition (pH 5.5) is within the range expected for protonation of a histidine imidazole. Comparison of absorption spectra of the wild-type enzyme at different pH values with those of the H167N and H275Q mutants showed that both mutants behaved as the wild-type, demonstrating that neither His-167 nor His-275 is responsible for the pH-dependent transition. In ornithine decarboxylase, His-223 which we hypothesize to be equivalent to His-167 in glutamate decarboxylase, occupies a position on the re face of the cofactor. Lys-355 in ornithine decarboxylase is on the siface and the equivalent residue in glutamate decarboxylase is Lys-276. In the aminotransferases from the same family, the proton transfers occur on the si face and are mediated by the equivalent of Lys-276 (23Julin D.A. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is known that decarboxylation of glutamate occurs with retention of configuration (11Yamada H. O'Leary M.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but it is not known from which side the carboxyl group leaves. Quantum mechanical calculations (4Almazov V.P. Morozov Iu.V. Savin F.A. Sukhareva B.S. J. Mol. Biol. U.S.S.R. 1985; 2: 359-370Google Scholar) confirm that the Cα-COO− bond has two positions of maximal lability, each perpendicular to the coenzyme ring as predicted by Dunathan (10Dunathan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but pointing in opposite directions. It is possible therefore that the carboxyl group leaves from the re face and that protonation of Cα is mediated from this face by His-167. To test this possibility, the 4-aminobutyrate produced by wild-type and H167N glutamate decarboxylase in D2O was analyzed by NMR. In both cases the signal from protons at C4 was halved, indicating that the 4-aminobutyrate produced by each form of the enzyme was monodeuterated at C4 (equivalent to Cα of glutamate). When the products were treated in D2O with 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, which labilizes the pro-S proton at C4 of 4-aminobutyrate exclusively (24Bouclier M. Jung M.J. Lippert B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the signal from C4 protons was lost in each case. This indicated incorporation of a second deuterium at C4. Significant differences between the H167N mutant and the wild-type enzyme were observed when changes in the absorption of the cofactor were measured after stopped-flow mixing with glutamate. The reaction with the most readily interpreted kinetic behavior was that of the H167N mutant. Changes in absorbance were largest at 322 nm. A large increase, complete within the mixing time (2 ms), was followed by a smaller increase which followed a single exponential (Fig. 4a, k = 30 ± 1 s−1). Thereafter, absorbance fell as expected for a system in which the concentration of ES complex returns to zero as substrate is consumed in the reaction (Fig. 4 b). A single experiment of this kind, in which the pseudo-equilibrium mixture of enzyme-substrate complexes is observed throughout the full course of the reaction from [S] ≫ K m to [S] = 0, provides an accurate estimate of the steady state constantsk cat and K m . (The system is not subject to product inhibition since the kinetic constants were independent of initial substrate concentration and inclusion of 4-aminobutyrate had no effect.) After exclusion of the first 0.2 s because of the fast pre-steady state reaction, the profile gave an excellent fit to the Michaelis equation and provided values for the steady state constants k cat = 27.8 ± 0.1 s−1, K m = 10.6 ± 0.1 mm. The similarity of the values obtained fork cat and the rate constant characterizing the pre-steady state transient, suggests that the reaction reported by the latter is largely rate-determining in the overall process. At 420 nm the absorbance changes observed were much smaller (total absorbance change 0.02) and in the opposite direction but they were governed by the same rate constants. Because of the unusual kinetic behavior of the wild-type enzyme (see later), product formed during the first 10 s of reaction was measured using the quenched-flow apparatus. Conditions for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction were exactly as in the stopped-flow experiment. Fig. 4 c shows the result. The line of best fit through the experimental points from the quenched flow experiment is 0.98 mm s−1. The values ofk cat and K m determined from the stopped flow experiment predict 0.93 mms−1. The absorbance changes observed with the wild-type enzyme were more complex (Fig. 5a). Large changes were observed at 322, 360, and 420 nm. At 322 and 360 nm an initial increase was complete within the mixing time. This was followed by an increase lasting approximately 5 s. After exclusion of the first 5 s, the reaction showed A 322 andA 360 declining as expected for a system which is monitoring ES complex as substrate is consumed. A fit to the Michaelis equation gave values of k cat = 55 s−1 and K m = 6.7 mm. At 420 nm, changes were in the opposite direction but were characterized by the same rate constants. Inclusion of the product 4-aminobutyrate (50 mm) did not affect the kinetic profile, confirming earlier observations that product inhibition is insignificant (5Sukhareva B.S. Braunstein A.E. Mol. Biol. (Engl. Transl.). 1971; 5: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar). The complete kinetic profile was fitted, by nonlinear regression using differential equations, to a scheme in which, after initial rapid reaction to form a pseudo-equilibrium mixture of complexes (ES), a species (EX) is formed which does not lie on the path leading to product formation (Scheme 2). The data (Fig. 5 a) fit well to Scheme 2 and give kinetic constants of k 1 = 0.32 ± 0.02 s−1, k 2 = 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1, k c = 98 ± 32 s−1, K s = 11 ± 2 mm. The fit at 322 nm assigned extinction coefficients to the speciesES and EX of 2748 ± 58m−1 cm−1 and 4290 ± 810m−1 cm−1, respectively. The unusual feature of the reaction profile, namely the transient phase occurring in the first few seconds, is absent from the profile of the His-167 mutant enzyme. When this experiment was conducted with H275Q glutamate decarboxylase, the kinetic profile was very similar to that observed with wild-type enzyme. The initial transient phase was present and the results fitted well to Scheme 2 with best fit valuesk 1 = 0.12 ± 0.01 s−1,k 2 = 0.53 ± 0.02 s−1,K s = 12.4 ± 0.3 mm, andk c = 49 ± 1 s−1.Figure 5Changes in cofactor absorbance and product concentration during the reaction catalyzed by wild-type glutamate decarboxylase. Reactions were conducted (a) in H2O and (b) in D2O. Conditions as in Fig. 4. The solid lines are those of best fit to Scheme 2 using the constants given in the text. Only one in 10 of the data points collected and used in fitting is shown so that the fit of experimental points to the theoretical lines can be seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The absence of the transient phase from the H167N mutant enzyme is the most striking difference between this mutant and the wild-type enzyme. Thus the nature of the chromophore formed in the process is important in understanding the role played by His-167. The approximately equal values of k 1 and k 2 and the approximately 2-fold difference between k catand k c suggest that, during the first few seconds of reaction, approximately half of the enzyme converts into a form which cannot react further. Such a process should therefore affect the rate of product formation and result in a burst at the beginning of the reaction. A quenched-flow apparatus was therefore used to measure the formation of 4-aminobutyrate during the first 15 s of reaction. The results (Fig. 5 a, inset) show a clear burst which fits well to the same rate constants and confirms that formation of the 345-nm chromophore is effectively inhibitory. During the investigations aimed at measuring the incorporation of deuterium into the product 4-aminobutyrate (see “Deuterium Exchange Reactions”), we noticed large differences in the rates at which acid needed to be added to maintain constant pH in the reactions catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme. An earlier study of the effects of D2O on the reaction catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase has already shown large solvent isotope effects (25O'Leary M.H. Yamada H. Yapp C.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and these have been cited in support of a proposal that, after the decarboxylation step, protonation at Cα is mediated by a histidine residue (16Tilley K. Akhtar M. Gani D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1994; 1: 3079-3087Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate these effects further, we conducted rapid mixing experiments in D2O with wild-type enzyme and with the H167N mutant. We measured the steady state constants by analyzing the complete reaction profile after omitting the first 5 s containing the transient. Our results for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5 b) are in broad agreement with those published earlier (25O'Leary M.H. Yamada H. Yapp C.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found k cat(26.3 ± 0.8 s−1) to be 2.7 times smaller andk cat/K m (2.3 ± 0.1 mm−1 s−1) to be 3.5 times smaller than in H2O. We also observed a pronounced solvent isotope effect on the slow transient, the amplitude of which was greatly increased both at 420 and 322 nm. The whole process, including the slow transient, fitted well to Scheme 2 and gave constants of best fitk 1 = 0.84 ± 0.37 s−1,k 2 = 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1,k c = 74 ± 38 s−1, andK s = 32 ± 12 mm. The fit assigned extinction coefficients to the species ES and EX of 1982 ± 130 m−1 cm−1 and 4320 ± 610 m−1 cm−1, respectively. The increased size of the transient suggested that, if it is due to slow formation of a species off the reaction pathway, the course of product formation should be characterized by a more pronounced burst when the reaction is carried out in D2O. Fig. 5 b (inset) shows the course of 4-aminobutyrate production measured by quenched-flow over the first 10 s of reaction and confirms that a pronounced burst is present. The constants of best fit for these data were k 1= 2.3 ± 1.7 s−1, k 2 = 0.65 ± 0.15 s−1, k c = 42 ± 19 s−1, K s = 32 ± 12 mm. Although the constants derived from the different types of experiment are not as closely similar as those from the corresponding experiments in H2O, we consider that, in view of the large standard deviations, Scheme 2 also provides a satisfactory explanation. When the H167N mutant enzyme was used to catalyze the deuterium exchange reaction, the amount of acid required to maintain constant pH in unbuffered solution in D2O or H2O was the same. The reaction profile monitored at 322 nm after stopped-flow mixing was also similar to that obtained in H2O but analysis showed that k cat (38.2 ± 0.1 s−1) was increased 1.4-fold andk cat/K m (1.66 mm−1 s−1) was decreased 1.6-fold. The slow conversion to an unreactive intermediate does not occur with this form of the enzyme so that this complication is eliminated as a contribution to the solvent isotope effects. We note that, in the absence of the side reaction, a positive isotope effect onk cat was observed rather than the larger negative effect seen in the reaction of the wild-type enzyme. The increased amplitude of the slow transient phase in D2O and the accompanying more marked nature of the burst in product formation strengthen the evidence that an unreactive complex is formed in this phase. The 345-nm chromophore formed in the slow side reaction has been proposed (4Almazov V.P. Morozov Iu.V. Savin F.A. Sukhareva B.S. J. Mol. Biol. U.S.S.R. 1985; 2: 359-370Google Scholar) to arise by tautomerization of the quinonoid structure formed after decarboxylation (Scheme FS1; IV). In this proposal, the proton on N of the cofactor-substrate imine has transferred to O3′ of the cofactor to give an intermediate which was considered to be more likely to protonate at C4′ than at Cα and thereby to lead to the abortive transamination reaction.

TN-R, TN-X, and apparently TN-Y (18Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are multimeric but can differ in the numbers of subunits per multimer (2Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).The conservation of the amino-terminal assembly domain among all family members suggests that the multimeric structure of the tenascin family is important for function. During tenascin-C biosynthesis, the hexamer is detected very rapidly without accumulation of intermediates, suggesting that tenascin multimers form by association of nascent polypeptides during translation (19Redick S.D. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar). Within the assembly domain reside at least six cysteine residues that are available for interchain disulfide bonding in the hexabrachion. Some or all of these cysteines are likely to function in maintaining the disulfide-bonded structure. To determine which cysteines are required for hexamer assembly and to identify any disulfide-bonded assembly intermediates, we have mutagenized these cysteine residues and have used a transient expression system based on COS-1 cells to analyze the requirements for each of these cysteines and for combinations of cysteines in the formation of tenascin hexamers. Our results clearly show that only Cys-64 is essential for hexamer formation. Mutant recombinant tenascins lacking Cys-64 are assembled into trimers but not hexamers, demonstrating that trimers are an intermediate in hexamer assembly. In addition, mutation of four cysteine residues flanking the heptad repeat region does not prevent hexamer formation, indicating that trimers might form by noncovalent interactions mediated by the heptad repeats, and these trimer intermediates are then assembled into hexamers by disulfide bonding via Cys-64. The disulfide bonds surrounding the heptad repeats probably function to stabilize the trimeric intermediate structure.DISCUSSIONThe multimeric structure is conserved among the tenascin family of proteins. Each type of tenascin has a set of heptad repeats within the amino-terminal assembly domain, and these are predicted to form a triple coiled-coil structure. We have analyzed the roles of each of the six cysteines in and around the heptad repeats and have found that only one cysteine, Cys-64, is essential for hexamer formation. Mutation of the other cysteines did not prevent the secretion of hexamers, and mutation of Cys-64 resulted in assembly and secretion of trimers but no higher multimers. Our results also demonstrate that tenascin is assembled through a trimer intermediate. Apparently, tenascin follows a stepwise process of assembly into hexamers beginning with trimer formation among subunits followed quickly by linking of two trimers into a hexabrachion.Previously we had shown that the rapid intracellular assembly of tenascin did not involve detectable intermediates (19Redick S.D. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar). Only hexamers were found at even the earliest time points, suggesting cotranslational assembly. Based on our mutational analyses, we propose that noncovalent trimers are formed via the heptad repeats as soon as the chains are sufficiently long to contact each other. Upon further translation elongation, the trimers would then be assembled into disulfide-bonded hexamers via the essential Cys-64 residue. At some point during this process, interchain disulfide bonds form between the other cysteines in this domain and help to stabilize the trimer structure. However, not all cysteines flanking the heptad repeats are essential for hexamer or trimer secretion as evidenced by efficient production, even with multiple cysteine mutations.Analyses of secreted products composed of 4×C and 5×C polypeptides showed a significant level of dimers and monomers. These might represent tenascins that are secreted as dimers and monomers. An alternative explanation seems more likely, i.e. that these intermediates actually represent subunits dissociated from secreted hexamers that are not completely disulfide-bonded. Tenascin trimers probably form by association of three subunits through their heptad repeats. Such noncovalent coiled-coil interactions could be sufficient for trimer or hexamer secretion. However, if they are not stabilized by disulfide bonds, the interchain interactions would not withstand SDS denaturation before SDS-PAGE. Therefore, multimers lacking stabilizing disulfide bonds among all chains would dissociate into smaller intermediates upon denaturation. In addition to dimers and monomers, SDS-PAGE of 4×C and 5×C mutant tenascins also reveals a subfraction of disulfide-bonded multimers containing four or more subunits. Covalent interactions between a subset of subunits and involving one other cysteine in addition to Cys-64 would be sufficient to produce these higher multimers. Cysteines 161 or 172 downstream of the heptad repeats could participate in their formation.Apparently, not all chains are disulfide-bonded together in intact tenascin, as SDS-PAGE of HxB.S tenascin showed some multimers consisting of five, four, and three subunits, although only hexamers were seen by electron microscopy of purified protein (21Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide bonding at both ends of the coiled-coil is also not necessary for efficient expression of hexamers. Both C146,147G and C111,113G mutants had structures indistinguishable from native tenascin. Thus, within a population of normal or mutant tenascins, there can be multimers with interchain disulfide bonds between different numbers and combinations of subunits. In intact tenascin, one hexamer can have six disulfide-bonded chains, whereas another might have only four or five. This indicates that assembly of specific disulfide bonding partners is not a fixed process but is stochastic.Fibrinogen is a major secreted hexameric protein that shows several structural similarities with tenascin, including coiled-coil regions and interchain disulfide bridges (24Budzynski A.Z. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1986; 6: 97-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, both have cysteines flanking the coiled-coil region as well as one or more cysteines near the amino terminus that are important for hexamer formation (25Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Zhang J.-Z. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11278-11282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One major difference between these two proteins is in the roles of the disulfides that flank the coiled-coil domains. In tenascin, we have shown that these disulfides are dispensible, and hexamer assembly and secretion proceed very efficiently without them. In contrast, the disulfide rings of fibrinogen, particularly the carboxyl-terminal ring, must be properly formed in order for hexamers to be secreted (27Zhang J.-Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xu W. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30083-30088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The differing roles of the disulfides used to assemble fibrinogen versus tenascin might reflect differences in the mechanism of assembly of these hexamers. As fibrinogen is formed from three different gene products (α, β, γ), assembly must occur post-translationally. Therefore, it is possible that proper alignment of the cysteines is important for proper register of the coiled-coil. In addition, the coiled-coil of fibrinogen is significantly longer than that of tenascin, which could make molecular register more critical. The complex disulfide bonding pattern of fibrinogen would also assure that all three chains are present in the hexamer. As all six tenascin chains are identical, this is not a concern with this hexamer.The crystal structures of three- and five-chain parallel coiled-coils have been reported (30Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 31Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Comparison of the positioning of cysteine residues in and around the heptad repeats of tenascin to trimeric coiled-coil peptides did not reveal any obvious orientiation of cysteine side chains that might predict disulfide bonding partners. In the case of the five- stranded coiled-coil of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, there are two cysteines at the carboxyl terminus of the heptad repeats, and these form the interchain disulfide bonds (31Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although these residues lie at the end of the heptad repeats, they are not part of the coiled-coil structure. In fact, the coiled-coil is disrupted just before these residues, and they actually reside within a type III β turn. Thus, other determinants bring the cysteine residues into a favorable position for disulfide bridge formation. Using the Multicoils 2Internet address: ostrich.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/score program (32Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) to predict heptad repeats in the assembly domain of tenascin indicated that Cys-111,-113 and Cys-146,-147 are just outside of the heptad repeats and not likely to be involved in coiled-coil interactions. 3J. A. Luczak, S. D. Redick, and J. E. Schwarzbauer, unpublished observations. Therefore, tenascin may resemble cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and use structures in addition to a coiled-coil to bring cysteines into proximity for disulfide bonding.Whereas tenascin-C is a hexamer, tenascin-R has only been isolated as trimers or dimers (33Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and tenascin-X (34Matsumoto K.-I. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and tenascin-Y (18Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) contain unknown numbers of chains. Comparison of the assembly domains from these three shows that they are highly conserved. However, there are several differences that could account for the different numbers of subunits in the multimers. We have shown that tenascin-C uses Cys-64 to form hexamers. This cysteine is absent from tenascin-X (35Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), indicating that this tenascin is probably trimeric. However, a cysteine equivalent to Cys-64 (at position 79) is present in tenascin-R (36Norenberg U. Wille H. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1992; 8: 849-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Fuss B. Wintergerst E.-S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Why have only trimers and dimers been observed? In addition to Cys-79, mammalian tenascin-R has an additional cysteine 48 amino acids upstream (37Fuss B. Wintergerst E.-S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Carnemolla B. Leprini A. Borsi L. Querze G. Urbini S. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Perhaps these two cysteines can form an intrachain disulfide bond, preventing them from participating in hexamer assembly and thus yielding only trimers. This potential mechanism could also hold for chicken tenascin-R, which has three extra cysteines in the first 78 amino acids (36Norenberg U. Wille H. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1992; 8: 849-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All have cysteines flanking the heptad repeats, suggesting a functional role for these residues. Tenascins probably need to withstand a certain amount of tension within the extracellular matrix, and disulfide bonding around the coiled-coil could serve to prevent unraveling of the trimers in these situations. Clearly, nature has evolved a very complex set of interactions to produce tenascin family members consisting of different numbers of chains and has added extra cysteines for stability, probably to strengthen the hexabrachion for its structural role within the extracellular matrix. Tenascin-C is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that functions during embryogenesis, in the nervous system, and in tumors (1Erickson H.P. Bourdon M.A. Annu. Rev.

It is secreted as a large hexabrachion composed of six identical subunits disulfide-bonded together at their amino termini, yielding a hexamer as large as 2 MDa. Subunits range in size from 180 to 320 kDa depending on species and on alternative splicing within the type III repeats. Each subunit consists of an amino-terminal assembly domain containing heptad repeats and multiple cysteine residues, a domain of epidermal growth factor like repeats, fibronectin type III repeats, and a terminal knob that is homologous to fibrinogen (13Jones F.S.

Tenascin-C is a member of a family of related proteins containing varying numbers of type III and epidermal growth factor repeats. All family members, TN-C, 1The abbreviations used are: TN, tenascin; TN-S, small alternatively spliced form of tenascin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BHK, baby hamster kidney.1The abbreviations used are: TN, tenascin; TN-S, small alternatively spliced form of tenascin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BHK, baby hamster kidney. TN-R, TN-X, and apparently TN-Y (18Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are multimeric but can differ in the numbers of subunits per multimer (2Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The conservation of the amino-terminal assembly domain among all family members suggests that the multimeric structure of the tenascin family is important for function. During tenascin-C biosynthesis, the hexamer is detected very rapidly without accumulation of intermediates, suggesting that tenascin multimers form by association of nascent polypeptides during translation (19Redick S.D. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar). Within the assembly domain reside at least six cysteine residues that are available for interchain disulfide bonding in the hexabrachion. Some or all of these cysteines are likely to function in maintaining the disulfide-bonded structure. To determine which cysteines are required for hexamer assembly and to identify any disulfide-bonded assembly intermediates, we have mutagenized these cysteine residues and have used a transient expression system based on COS-1 cells to analyze the requirements for each of these cysteines and for combinations of cysteines in the formation of tenascin hexamers. Our results clearly show that only Cys-64 is essential for hexamer formation. Mutant recombinant tenascins lacking Cys-64 are assembled into trimers but not hexamers, demonstrating that trimers are an intermediate in hexamer assembly. In addition, mutation of four cysteine residues flanking the heptad repeat region does not prevent hexamer formation, indicating that trimers might form by noncovalent interactions mediated by the heptad repeats, and these trimer intermediates are then assembled into hexamers by disulfide bonding via Cys-64. The disulfide bonds surrounding the heptad repeats probably function to stabilize the trimeric intermediate structure. DISCUSSIONThe multimeric structure is conserved among the tenascin family of proteins. Each type of tenascin has a set of heptad repeats within the amino-terminal assembly domain, and these are predicted to form a triple coiled-coil structure. We have analyzed the roles of each of the six cysteines in and around the heptad repeats and have found that only one cysteine, Cys-64, is essential for hexamer formation. Mutation of the other cysteines did not prevent the secretion of hexamers, and mutation of Cys-64 resulted in assembly and secretion of trimers but no higher multimers. Our results also demonstrate that tenascin is assembled through a trimer intermediate. Apparently, tenascin follows a stepwise process of assembly into hexamers beginning with trimer formation among subunits followed quickly by linking of two trimers into a hexabrachion.Previously we had shown that the rapid intracellular assembly of tenascin did not involve detectable intermediates (19Redick S.D. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar). Only hexamers were found at even the earliest time points, suggesting cotranslational assembly. Based on our mutational analyses, we propose that noncovalent trimers are formed via the heptad repeats as soon as the chains are sufficiently long to contact each other. Upon further translation elongation, the trimers would then be assembled into disulfide-bonded hexamers via the essential Cys-64 residue. At some point during this process, interchain disulfide bonds form between the other cysteines in this domain and help to stabilize the trimer structure. However, not all cysteines flanking the heptad repeats are essential for hexamer or trimer secretion as evidenced by efficient production, even with multiple cysteine mutations.Analyses of secreted products composed of 4×C and 5×C polypeptides showed a significant level of dimers and monomers. These might represent tenascins that are secreted as dimers and monomers. An alternative explanation seems more likely, i.e. that these intermediates actually represent subunits dissociated from secreted hexamers that are not completely disulfide-bonded. Tenascin trimers probably form by association of three subunits through their heptad repeats. Such noncovalent coiled-coil interactions could be sufficient for trimer or hexamer secretion. However, if they are not stabilized by disulfide bonds, the interchain interactions would not withstand SDS denaturation before SDS-PAGE. Therefore, multimers lacking stabilizing disulfide bonds among all chains would dissociate into smaller intermediates upon denaturation. In addition to dimers and monomers, SDS-PAGE of 4×C and 5×C mutant tenascins also reveals a subfraction of disulfide-bonded multimers containing four or more subunits. Covalent interactions between a subset of subunits and involving one other cysteine in addition to Cys-64 would be sufficient to produce these higher multimers. Cysteines 161 or 172 downstream of the heptad repeats could participate in their formation.Apparently, not all chains are disulfide-bonded together in intact tenascin, as SDS-PAGE of HxB.S tenascin showed some multimers consisting of five, four, and three subunits, although only hexamers were seen by electron microscopy of purified protein (21Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide bonding at both ends of the coiled-coil is also not necessary for efficient expression of hexamers. Both C146,147G and C111,113G mutants had structures indistinguishable from native tenascin. Thus, within a population of normal or mutant tenascins, there can be multimers with interchain disulfide bonds between different numbers and combinations of subunits. In intact tenascin, one hexamer can have six disulfide-bonded chains, whereas another might have only four or five. This indicates that assembly of specific disulfide bonding partners is not a fixed process but is stochastic.Fibrinogen is a major secreted hexameric protein that shows several structural similarities with tenascin, including coiled-coil regions and interchain disulfide bridges (24Budzynski A.Z. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1986; 6: 97-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, both have cysteines flanking the coiled-coil region as well as one or more cysteines near the amino terminus that are important for hexamer formation (25Huang S. Cao Z. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Zhang J.-Z. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11278-11282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One major difference between these two proteins is in the roles of the disulfides that flank the coiled-coil domains. In tenascin, we have shown that these disulfides are dispensible, and hexamer assembly and secretion proceed very efficiently without them. In contrast, the disulfide rings of fibrinogen, particularly the carboxyl-terminal ring, must be properly formed in order for hexamers to be secreted (27Zhang J.-Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xu W. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30083-30088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The differing roles of the disulfides used to assemble fibrinogen versus tenascin might reflect differences in the mechanism of assembly of these hexamers. As fibrinogen is formed from three different gene products (α, β, γ), assembly must occur post-translationally. Therefore, it is possible that proper alignment of the cysteines is important for proper register of the coiled-coil. In addition, the coiled-coil of fibrinogen is significantly longer than that of tenascin, which could make molecular register more critical. The complex disulfide bonding pattern of fibrinogen would also assure that all three chains are present in the hexamer. As all six tenascin chains are identical, this is not a concern with this hexamer.The crystal structures of three- and five-chain parallel coiled-coils have been reported (30Harbury P.B. Kim P.S.

The differing roles of the disulfides used to assemble fibrinogen versus tenascin might reflect differences in the mechanism of assembly of these hexamers. As fibrinogen is formed from three different gene products (α, β, γ), assembly must occur post-translationally. Therefore, it is possible that proper alignment of the cysteines is important for proper register of the coiled-coil. In addition, the coiled-coil of fibrinogen is significantly longer than that of tenascin, which could make molecular register more critical. The complex disulfide bonding pattern of fibrinogen would also assure that all three chains are present in the hexamer. As all six tenascin chains are identical, this is not a concern with this hexamer. The crystal structures of three- and five-chain parallel coiled-coils have been reported (30Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 31Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Comparison of the positioning of cysteine residues in and around the heptad repeats of tenascin to trimeric coiled-coil peptides did not reveal any obvious orientiation of cysteine side chains that might predict disulfide bonding partners. In the case of the five- stranded coiled-coil of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, there are two cysteines at the carboxyl terminus of the heptad repeats, and these form the interchain disulfide bonds (31Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although these residues lie at the end of the heptad repeats, they are not part of the coiled-coil structure. In fact, the coiled-coil is disrupted just before these residues, and they actually reside within a type III β turn. Thus, other determinants bring the cysteine residues into a favorable position for disulfide bridge formation. Using the Multicoils 2Internet address: ostrich.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/score program (32Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) to predict heptad repeats in the assembly domain of tenascin indicated that Cys-111,-113 and Cys-146,-147 are just outside of the heptad repeats and not likely to be involved in coiled-coil interactions. 3J. A. Luczak, S. D. Redick, and J. E. Schwarzbauer, unpublished observations. Therefore, tenascin may resemble cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and use structures in addition to a coiled-coil to bring cysteines into proximity for disulfide bonding. Whereas tenascin-C is a hexamer, tenascin-R has only been isolated as trimers or dimers (33Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and tenascin-X (34Matsumoto K.-I. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and tenascin-Y (18Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) contain unknown numbers of chains. Comparison of the assembly domains from these three shows that they are highly conserved. However, there are several differences that could account for the different numbers of subunits in the multimers. We have shown that tenascin-C uses Cys-64 to form hexamers. This cysteine is absent from tenascin-X (35Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), indicating that this tenascin is probably trimeric. However, a cysteine equivalent to Cys-64 (at position 79) is present in tenascin-R (36Norenberg U. Wille H. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1992; 8: 849-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Fuss B. Wintergerst E.-S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Carnemolla B. Leprini A. Borsi L. Querze G. Urbini S. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Why have only trimers and dimers been observed? In addition to Cys-79, mammalian tenascin-R has an additional cysteine 48 amino acids upstream (37Fuss B. Wintergerst E.-S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Carnemolla B. Leprini A. Borsi L. Querze G. Urbini S. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Perhaps these two cysteines can form an intrachain disulfide bond, preventing them from participating in hexamer assembly and thus yielding only trimers. This potential mechanism could also hold for chicken tenascin-R, which has three extra cysteines in the first 78 amino acids (36Norenberg U. Wille H. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1992; 8: 849-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All have cysteines flanking the heptad repeats, suggesting a functional role for these residues. Tenascins probably need to withstand a certain amount of tension within the extracellular matrix, and disulfide bonding around the coiled-coil could serve to prevent unraveling of the trimers in these situations. Clearly, nature has evolved a very complex set of interactions to produce tenascin family members consisting of different numbers of chains and has added extra cysteines for stability, probably to strengthen the hexabrachion for its structural role within the extracellular matrix.
