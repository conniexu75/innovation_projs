https://openalex.org/W3196650609,"Abstract Large single-cell atlases are now routinely generated to serve as references for analysis of smaller-scale studies. Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases."
https://openalex.org/W3196883221,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic lead to a sudden shift to online teaching and restricted campus access. Aim To assess how university students experienced the sudden shift to online teaching after closure of campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods Students in Public Health Nutrition answered questionnaires two and 12 weeks (N = 79: response rate 20.3% and 26.6%, respectively) after the lockdown in Norway on 12 March 2020 and participated in digital focus group interviews in May 2020 (mixed methods study). Findings and discussion Two weeks into the lockdown, 75% of students reported that their life had become more difficult and 50% felt that learning outcomes would be harder to achieve due to the sudden shift to online education. Twelve weeks into the lockdown, the corresponding numbers were 57% and 71%, respectively. The most pressing concerns among students were a lack of social interaction, housing situations that were unfit for home office purposes, including insufficient data bandwidth, and an overall sense of reduced motivation and effort. The students collaborated well in digital groups but wanted smaller groups with students they knew rather than being randomly assigned to groups. Most students agreed that pre-recorded and streamed lectures, frequent virtual meetings and student response systems could improve learning outcomes in future digital courses. The preference for written home exams over online versions of previous on-campus exams was likely influenced by student’s familiarity with the former. The dropout rate remained unchanged compared to previous years. Conclusion The sudden shift to digital teaching was challenging for students, but it appears that they adapted quickly to the new situation. A lthough the concerns described by students in this study may only be representative for the period right after campus lockdown, the study provide the student perspective on a unique period of time in higher education."

https://openalex.org/W3198826726,"Oral administration provides a simple and non-invasive approach for drug delivery. However, due to poor absorption and swift enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, a wide range of molecules must be parenterally injected to attain required doses and pharmacokinetics. Here we present an orally dosed liquid auto-injector capable of delivering up to 4-mg doses of a bioavailable drug with the rapid pharmacokinetics of an injection, reaching an absolute bioavailability of up to 80% and a maximum plasma drug concentration within 30 min after dosing. This approach improves dosing efficiencies and pharmacokinetics an order of magnitude over our previously designed injector capsules and up to two orders of magnitude over clinically available and preclinical chemical permeation enhancement technologies. We administered the capsules to swine for delivery of clinically relevant doses of four commonly injected medications, including adalimumab, a GLP-1 analog, recombinant human insulin and epinephrine. These multi-day dosing experiments and oral administration in awake animal models support the translational potential of the system. Biologics are delivered by a pill that pricks the stomach wall."
https://openalex.org/W3198242174,"The bowfin (Amia calva) is a ray-finned fish that possesses a unique suite of ancestral and derived phenotypes, which are key to understanding vertebrate evolution. The phylogenetic position of bowfin as a representative of neopterygian fishes, its archetypical body plan and its unduplicated and slowly evolving genome make bowfin a central species for the genomic exploration of ray-finned fishes. Here we present a chromosome-level genome assembly for bowfin that enables gene-order analyses, settling long-debated neopterygian phylogenetic relationships. We examine chromatin accessibility and gene expression through bowfin development to investigate the evolution of immune, scale, respiratory and fin skeletal systems and identify hundreds of gene-regulatory loci conserved across vertebrates. These resources connect developmental evolution among bony fishes, further highlighting the bowfin's importance for illuminating vertebrate biology and diversity in the genomic era."
https://openalex.org/W3198653782,"To understand racial bias in clinical settings from the perspectives of minority patients and healthcare providers to inspire changes in the way healthcare providers interact with their patients.Articles on racial bias were searched on Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science. Full text review and quality appraisal was conducted, before data was synthesized and analytically themed using the Thomas and Harden methodology.23 articles were included, involving 1,006 participants. From minority patients' perspectives, two themes were generated: 1) alienation of minorities due to racial supremacism and lack of empathy, resulting in inadequate medical treatment; 2) labelling of minority patients who were stereotyped as belonging to a lower socio-economic class and having negative behaviors. From providers' perspectives, one theme recurred: the perpetuation of racial fault lines by providers. However, some patients and providers denied racism in the healthcare setting.Implicit racial bias is pervasive and manifests in patient-provider interactions, exacerbating health disparities in minorities. Beyond targeted anti-racism measures in healthcare settings, wider national measures to reduce housing, education and income inequality may mitigate racism in healthcare and improve minority patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3198756627,"Many natural polysaccharides have significant anticancer activity with low toxicity, but the complex chemical structures make in-depth studies of the involved mechanisms extremely difficult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the marine bacterial exopolysaccharide (exopolysaccharide 11 [EPS11]) on liver cancer metastasis to explore the underlying target protein and molecular mechanism. We found that EPS11 significantly suppressed cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in liver cancer cells. Proteomic analysis showed that EPS11 induced downregulation of proteins related to the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction signaling pathway. In addition, the direct pharmacological target of EPS11 was identified as collagen I using cellular thermal shift assays. Surface plasmon resonance and pull-down assays further confirmed the specific binding of EPS11 to collagen I. Moreover, EPS11 was shown to inhibit tumor metastasis by directly modulating collagen I activity via the β1-integrin-mediated signaling pathway. Collectively, our study demonstrated for the first time that collagen I could be a direct pharmacological target of polysaccharide drugs. Moreover, directly targeting collagen I may be a promising strategy for finding novel carbohydrate-based drugs."

This study aimed to compare the levels of depressive symptoms among frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in two government hospitals managing COVID-19-related cases in Kelantan, Malaysia from May to July 2020 to identify and compared depressive symptoms levels of frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers. Convenient sampling was applied in the selection of eligible participants and those diagnosed as having any psychiatric illnesses were excluded. The self-administered questionnaires for the Malay versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure depressive symptoms score and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey to measure social support score as an important confounder. A descriptive analysis, independent t -test and ANCOVA were performed using SPSS version 26. Results A total of 306 respondents from healthcare providers were recruited which 160 were frontline healthcare providers and 146 were non-frontline healthcare providers. The level of depressive symptoms (HADS score &gt;8) was 27.5% for the frontline healthcare providers and 37.7% for the non-frontline healthcare providers. The mean depressive symptoms score for the non-frontline healthcare providers was 0.75 points higher than that of the frontline healthcare providers after adjusting for gender, duration of employment and social support. Conclusion Non-frontline healthcare providers are also experiencing psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic even though they do not have direct contact with COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3196291840,"Vegetation, which is a good indicator of the impacts of climate variability and human activities, can reflect desert ecosystem dynamics. To reveal the vegetation variations in China's deserts, trends in the monthly, seasonal, and annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2017 were measured both temporally and spatially by the Theil-Sen estimator and Mann-Kendall test. Additionally, correlation coefficients and residual analysis were employed to evaluate the correlations between the NDVI and climatic factors and to distinguish the impacts of climate variability and human activities. The results showed that China's deserts underwent greening. The annual NDVI showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 0.0018/yr, with values of 0.094 in 2000 and 0.126 in 2017. Significant increasing trends in NDVI were observed in all four seasons. The NDVI were higher in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. Both the monthly NDVI and its trends showed an inverted U-shaped curve during the year. Spatially, the greening trends were mainly distributed on the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert, in the northwestern part of the Taklimakan Desert, and in the Kubuqi Desert. The correlations between the NDVI and climatic factors at the monthly and seasonal scales were stronger than those at the annual scale. Temperature and precipitation had positive effects on NDVI at the monthly and seasonal scales, but only precipitation had a positive effect at the annual scale. Human activities, especially oasis expansion and sand stabilization measures, were two major causes of large increasing areas of desert greening in China indicated by the NDVI."
https://openalex.org/W3196293977,"Background SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is important to monitor epidemic dynamics and as a mitigation strategy. Given difficulties of large-scale quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as alternatives in settings like Mexico. Here, we evaluated diagnostic performance of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications compared to qRT-PCR testing in Mexico. Methods We analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology up to April 30th, 2021 (n = 6,632,938) and cases with both qRT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n = 216,388). We evaluated diagnostic performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). We also explored test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 and mortality. Results Rapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6–38.7), high specificity 95.5% (95%CI 95.1–95.8) and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0–86.6) and negative predictive values 67.2% (95%CI 66.2–69.2). Rapid Ag-T has optimal diagnostic performance up to days 3 after symptom onset, and its performance is modified by testing location, comorbidity, and age. qRT-PCR (-) / Rapid Ag-T (+) cases had higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes (HR 1.54 95% CI 1.41–1.68) and were older, qRT-PCR (+)/ Rapid Ag-T(-) cases had slightly higher risk or adverse outcomes and ≥7 days from symptom onset (HR 1.53 95% CI 1.48–1.59). Cases detected with rapid Ag-T were younger, without comorbidities, and milder COVID-19 course. Conclusions Rapid Ag-T could be used as an alternative to qRT-PCR for large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing in Mexico. Interpretation of Rapid Ag-T results should be done with caution to minimize the risk associated with false negative results."
https://openalex.org/W3197191736,"The mitochondrial matrix protease LONP1 is an essential part of the organellar protein quality control system. LONP1 has been shown to be involved in respiration control and apoptosis. Furthermore, a reduction in LONP1 level correlates with aging. Up to now, the effects of a LONP1 defect were mostly studied by utilizing transient, siRNA-mediated knockdown approaches. We generated a new cellular model system for studying the impact of LONP1 on mitochondrial protein homeostasis by a CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic knockdown (gKD). These cells showed a stable reduction of LONP1 along with a mild phenotype characterized by absent morphological differences and only small negative effects on mitochondrial functions under normal culture conditions. To assess the consequences of a permanent LONP1 depletion on the mitochondrial proteome, we analyzed the alterations of protein levels by quantitative mass spectrometry, demonstrating small adaptive changes, in particular with respect to mitochondrial protein biogenesis. In an additional proteomic analysis, we determined the temperature-dependent aggregation behavior of mitochondrial proteins and its dependence on a reduction of LONP1 activity, demonstrating the important role of the protease for mitochondrial protein homeostasis in mammalian cells. We identified a significant number of mitochondrial proteins that are affected by a reduced LONP1 activity especially with respect to their stress-induced solubility. Taken together, our results suggest a very good applicability of the LONP1 gKD cell line as a model system for human aging processes."
https://openalex.org/W3196934234,"Despite the prevalence of disagreement between users on social media platforms, studies of online debates typically only look at positive online interactions, represented as networks with positive ties. In this paper, we hypothesize that the systematic neglect of conflict that these network analyses induce leads to misleading results on polarized debates. We introduce an approach to bring in negative user-to-user interaction, by analyzing online debates using signed networks with positive and negative ties. We apply this approach to the Dutch Twitter debate on 'Black Pete'-an annual Dutch celebration with racist characteristics. Using a dataset of 430,000 tweets, we apply natural language processing and machine learning to identify: (i) users' stance in the debate; and (ii) whether the interaction between users is positive (supportive) or negative (antagonistic). Comparing the resulting signed network with its unsigned counterpart, the retweet network, we find that traditional unsigned approaches distort debates by conflating conflict with indifference, and that the inclusion of negative ties changes and enriches our understanding of coalitions and division within the debate. Our analysis reveals that some groups are attacking each other, while others rather seem to be located in fragmented Twitter spaces. Our approach identifies new network positions of individuals that correspond to roles in the debate, such as leaders and scapegoats. These findings show that representing the polarity of user interactions as signs of ties in networks substantively changes the conclusions drawn from polarized social media activity, which has important implications for various fields studying online debates using network analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3196323780,"Cetaceans are long-lived, social species that are valued as ambassadors inspiring the public to engage in conservation action. Under professional care, they are critical partners with the scientific community to understanding the biology, behavior, physiology, health, and welfare requirements of this taxonomic group. The Cetacean Welfare Study was a highly collaborative research effort among zoos and aquariums accredited by the Alliance for Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums that provided important empirical and comparative information on the care and management of cetaceans. The goal was to identify factors that were related to the welfare of bottlenose dolphins and to develop reference intervals and values for common and novel indicators of health and welfare for common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops aduncus ), beluga whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ), and Pacific white-sided dolphins ( Lagenorhynchus obliquidens ). Data were collected from cetaceans at 43 accredited zoos and aquariums in seven countries in 2018 and 2019. This overview presents a summary of findings from the initial research articles that resulted from the study titled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums.” With multiple related objectives, animal-based metrics were used to advance frameworks of clinical care and target key conditions that were associated with good welfare of cetaceans in zoo and aquarium environments. As a result of this collaboration, species-specific reference intervals and values for blood variables and fecal hormone metabolites were developed and are freely available in an iOS application called ZooPhysioTrak. The results suggested that environmental enrichment programs and social management factors were more strongly related to behaviors likely indicative of positive welfare than habitat characteristics for common and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. These findings can be widely applied to optimize care and future science-based welfare practice."
https://openalex.org/W3196771097,"In cattle, several calves born after IVP (“in vitro” embryo production) present similar birthweight to those generated after MOET (multiple ovulation and embryo transfer). However, the underlying molecular patterns in organs involved in the developmental process are unknown and could indicate physiological programming. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare epigenomic and transcriptomic modifications in the hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal and adrenal organs between 3 months old ovum pick-up-IVP and MOET male calves (n = 4 per group) and (2) to use blood epigenomic data to proxy methylation of the inner organs. Extracted gDNA and RNA were sequenced through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing, respectively. Next, bioinformatic analyses determined differentially methylated cytosines (DMC) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) (FDR < 0.05) in IVP versus MOET samples and the KEGG pathways that were overrepresented by genes associated with DMC or DEG (FDR < 0.1). Pathways related to hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal (HPG) axis activation (GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus, GnRH signaling in the pituitary, and steroidogenesis in the testicle) were enriched in IVP calves. Modeling the effect of the methylation levels and the group on the expression of all the genes involved in these pathways confirmed their upregulation in HPG organs in IVP calves. The application of the DIABLO method allowed the identification of 15 epigenetic and five transcriptomic biomarkers, which were able to predict the embryo origin using the epigenomic data from the blood. In conclusion, the use of an integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic approach suggested an early activation of the HPG axis in male IVP calves compared to MOET counterparts, and the identification of potential biomarkers allowed the use of blood samples to proxy methylation levels of the relevant internal organs."
https://openalex.org/W3197423197,"Mesosulfuron-methyl is always applied by foliar spraying in combination with the safener mefenpyr-diethyl to avoid phytotoxicity on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars. However, it was observed that the tolerance of Tausch's goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii Coss.) to mesosulfuron-methyl significantly increased in the presence of mefenpyr-diethyl by performing bioassay. This confirmed phenomenon may lead to overuse of mesosulfuron-methyl and weed resistance evolution in field conditions. Therefore, we tested the effect of wheat seed dressing with mefenpyr-diethyl as a possible alternative and disclosed the underlying mechanisms by herbicide dissipation study, enzymatic analysis and transcriptome profiling. The results suggest that increase of ALS activity, enhancement of metabolic processes, and other stress responses are crucial for the regulation of herbicide detoxification induced by mefenpyr-diethyl. Additionally, transcription factors such as AP2/ERF-ERF, bHLH, NAC, and MYB, and protein kinase such as RLK-Pelle_DLSV might play vital regulatory roles. The current study has important implications for mesosulfuron-methyl application in wheat field to control Tausch's goatgrass and provides a comprehensive understanding of the protective effect of mefenpyr-diethyl."
https://openalex.org/W3197533799,"Delays in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) contribute to a substantial proportion of TB-related mortality, especially among people living with HIV (PLHIV). We sought to characterize the diagnostic journey for HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with a new TB diagnosis in Zambia, to understand drivers of delay, and characterize their preferences for service characteristics to inform improvements in TB services.We assessed consecutive adults with newly microbiologically-confirmed TB at two public health treatment facilities in Lusaka, Zambia. We administered a survey to document critical intervals in the TB care pathway (time to initial care-seeking, diagnosis and treatment initiation), identify bottlenecks and their reasons. We quantified patient preferences for a range of characteristics of health services using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) that assessed 7 attributes (distance, wait times, hours of operation, confidentiality, sex of provider, testing incentive, TB test speed and notification method).Among 401 patients enrolled (median age of 34 years, 68.7% male, 46.6% HIV-positive), 60.9% and 39.1% were from a first-level and tertiary hospital, respectively. The median time from symptom onset to receipt of TB treatment was 5.0 weeks (IQR: 3.6-8.0) and was longer among HIV-positive patients seeking care at a tertiary hospital than HIV-negative patients (6.4 vs. 4.9 weeks, p = 0.002). The time from symptom onset to initial presentation for evaluation accounted for the majority of time until treatment initiation (median 3.0 weeks, IQR: 1.0-5.0)-an important minority of 11.0% of patients delayed care-seeking ≥8 weeks. The DCE found that patients strongly preferred same-day TB test results (relative importance, 37.2%), facilities close to home (18.0%), and facilities with short wait times (16.9%). Patients were willing to travel to a facility up to 7.6 kilometers further away in order to access same-day TB test results. Preferences for improving current TB services did not differ according to HIV status.Prolonged intervals from TB symptom onset to treatment initiation were common, especially among PLHIV, and were driven by delayed health-seeking. Addressing known barriers to timely diagnosis and incorporating patients' preferences into TB services, including same-day TB test results, may facilitate earlier TB care engagement in high burden settings."
https://openalex.org/W3197579363,"Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, as important membrane proteins regulating intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) signaling, are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Activation and regulation of TRPC are more dependent on membrane or intracellular signals. However, how extracellular signals regulate TRPC6 function remains to be further investigated. Here, we suggest that two distinct small molecules, M085 and GSK1702934A, directly activate TRPC6, both through a mechanism of stimulation of extracellular sites formed by the pore helix (PH) and transmembrane (TM) helix S6. In silico docking scanning of TRPC6 identified three extracellular sites that can bind small molecules, of which only mutations on residues of PH and S6 helix significantly reduced the apparent affinity of M085 and GSK1702934A and attenuated the maximal response of TRPC6 to these two chemicals by altering channel gating of TRPC6. Combing metadynamics, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis, we revealed that W679, E671, E672, and K675 in the PH and N701 and Y704 in the S6 helix constitute an orthosteric site for the recognition of these two agonists. The importance of this site was further confirmed by covalent modification of amino acid residing at the interface of the PH and S6 helix. Given that three structurally distinct agonists M085, GSK1702934A, and AM-0883, act at this site, as well as the occupancy of lipid molecules at this position found in other TRP subfamilies, it is suggested that the cavity formed by the PH and S6 has an important role in the regulation of TRP channel function by extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W3198027845,"Collagen is the major protein in the extracellular matrix and plays vital roles in tissue development and function. Collagen is also one of the most processed proteins in its biosynthesis. The most prominent post-translational modification (PTM) of collagen is the hydroxylation of Pro residues in the Y-position of the characteristic (Gly-Xaa-Yaa) repeating amino acid sequence of a collagen triple helix. Recent studies using mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS sequencing (MS/MS) have revealed unexpected hydroxylation of Pro residues in the X-positions (X-Hyp). The newly identified X-Hyp residues appear to be highly heterogeneous in location and percent occupancy. In order to understand the dynamic nature of the new X-Hyps and their potential impact on applications of MS and MS/MS for collagen research, we sampled four different collagen samples using standard MS and MS/MS techniques. We found considerable variations in the degree of PTMs of the same collagen from different organisms and/or tissues. The rat tail tendon type I collagen is particularly variable in terms of both over-hydroxylation of Pro in the X-position and under-hydroxylation of Pro in the Y-position. In contrast, only a few unexpected PTMs in collagens type I and type III from human placenta were observed. Some observations are not reproducible between different sequencing efforts of the same sample, presumably due to a low population and/or the unpredictable nature of the ionization process. Additionally, despite the heterogeneous preparation and sourcing, collagen samples from commercial sources do not show elevated variations in PTMs compared to samples prepared from a single tissue and/or organism. These findings will contribute to the growing body of information regarding the PTMs of collagen by MS technology, and culminate to a more comprehensive understanding of the extent and the functional roles of the PTMs of collagen."
https://openalex.org/W3198630008,"Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment. Recently, heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of the cardiac autonomic regulation derived from short electrocardiogram tracings, has been found to correlate with sepsis mortality. This paper presents using novel heart rate n-variability (HRnV) measures for sepsis mortality risk prediction and comparing against current mortality prediction scores. This study was a retrospective cohort study on patients presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Singapore between September 2014 to April 2017. Patients were included if they were above 21 years old and were suspected of having sepsis by their attending physician. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression model was built to predict the outcome, and the results based on 10-fold cross-validation were presented using receiver operating curve analysis. The final predictive model comprised 21 variables, including four vital signs, two HRV parameters, and 15 HRnV parameters. The area under the curve of the model was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70–0.84), outperforming several established clinical scores. The HRnV measures may have the potential to allow for a rapid, objective, and accurate means of patient risk stratification for sepsis severity and mortality. Our exploration of the use of wealthy inherent information obtained from novel HRnV measures could also create a new perspective for data scientists to develop innovative approaches for ECG analysis and risk monitoring."

In African countries, where current artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are still effective, TACTs have the potential to benefit the larger community and future patients by mitigating the risk of drug resistance. This study explores the extent to which the antimalarial drug markets in African countries are ready for a transition to TACTs.A qualitative study was conducted in Nigeria and Burkina Faso and comprised in-depth interviews (n = 68) and focus group discussions (n = 11) with key actor groups in the innovation system of antimalarial therapies.Evidence of ACT failure in African countries and explicit support for TACTs by the World Health Organization (WHO) and international funders were perceived important determinants for the market prospects of TACTs in Nigeria and Burkina Faso. At the country level, slow regulatory and implementation procedures were identified as potential barriers towards rapid TACTs deployment. Integrating TACTs in public sector distribution channels was considered relatively straightforward. More challenges were expected for integrating TACTs in private sector distribution channels, which are characterized by patient demand and profit motives. Finally, several affordability and acceptability issues were raised for which ACTs were suggested as a benchmark.The market prospects of TACTs in Nigeria and Burkina Faso will depend on the demonstration of the added value of TACTs over ACTs, their advocacy by the WHO, the inclusion of TACTs in financial and regulatory arrangements, and their alignment with current distribution and deployment practices. Further clinical, health-economic and feasibility studies are required to inform decision makers about the broader implications of a transition to TACTs in African counties. The recent reporting of artemisinin resistance and ACT failure in Africa might change important determinants of the market readiness for TACTs."

Movement Tags (MTags), a bio-logging device, were used to record a suite of kinematic and environmental information outside of formal training sessions as part of a larger study titled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study). The purpose of the present study was to explore if and how habitat characteristics, environmental enrichment programs, and training programs were related to the distance traveled and energy expenditure of dolphins in accredited zoos and aquariums. Bottlenose dolphins in accredited zoos and aquariums wore MTags one day per week for two five-week data collection periods. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), a proxy for energy expenditure, and average distance traveled per hour (ADT) of 60 dolphins in 31 habitats were examined in relation to demographic, habitat, and management factors. Participating facilities were accredited by the Alliance for Marine Mammal Parks and/or Aquariums and the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums. Two factors were found to be related to ADT while six factors were associated with ODBA. The results showed that enrichment programs were strongly related to both ODBA and ADT. Scheduling predictable training session times was also positively associated with ADT. The findings suggested that habitat characteristics had a relatively weak association with ODBA and were not related to ADT. In combination, the results suggested that management practices were more strongly related to activity levels than habitat characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3197484911,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike is the primary target of virus-neutralizing antibodies and critical to the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that the prefusion-stabilized two-proline ""S2P"" spike-widely employed for laboratory work and clinical studies-unfolds when stored at 4 °C, physiological pH, as observed by electron microscopy (EM) and differential scanning calorimetry, but that its trimeric, native-like conformation can be reacquired by low pH treatment. When stored for approximately 1 week, this unfolding does not significantly alter antigenic characteristics; however, longer storage diminishes antibody binding, and month-old spike elicits virtually no neutralization in mice despite inducing high ELISA-binding titers. Cryo-EM structures reveal the folded fraction of spike to decrease with aging; however, its structure remains largely similar, although with varying mobility of the receptor-binding domain. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike is susceptible to unfolding, which affects immunogenicity, highlighting the need to monitor its integrity."

Blood samples were collected as part of a larger study titled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study). Two blood samples were collected following a standardized protocol, and two veterinarian examinations were conducted approximately six months apart between July to November 2018 and January to April 2019. Least square means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for hematology, serum, and plasma biochemical variables. Comparisons by age, gender, and month revealed statistically significant differences ( p &lt; 0.01) for several variables. Reference intervals and values were generated for samples tested at two laboratories for up to 56 hematologic, serum, and plasma biochemical variables. To apply these data, ZooPhysioTrak, an iOS mobile software application, was developed to provide a new resource for cetacean management. ZooPhysioTrak provides species-specific reference intervals and values based on user inputs of individual demographic and sample information. These data provide a baseline from which to compare hematological, serum, and plasma biochemical values in cetaceans in zoos and aquariums."
https://openalex.org/W3197896521,"Previously, we showed silicone nerve conduits containing a vascular bundle and decellularized allogenic basal laminae (DABLs) seeded with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) demonstrated successful nerve regeneration. Nerve conduits should be flexible and biodegradable for clinical use. In the current study, we used nerve conduits made of polyglycoric acid (PGA) fiber mesh, which is flexible, biodegradable and capillary-permeable. DABLs were created using chemical surfactants to remove almost all cell debris. In part 1, capillary infiltration capability of the PGA tube was examined. Capillary infiltration into regenerated neural tissue was compared between the PGA tube with blood vessels attached extratubularly (extratubularly vascularized tube) and that containing blood vessels intratubularly (intratubularly vascularized tube). No significant difference was found in capillary formation or nerve regeneration between these two tubes. In part 2, a 20 mm gap created in a rat sciatic nerve model was bridged using the extratubularly vascularized PGA tube containing the DABLs with implantation of isogenic cultured BMSCs (TubeC+ group), that containing the DABLs without implantation of the BMSCs (TubeC- group), and 20 mm-long fresh autologous nerve graft (Auto group). Nerve regeneration in these three groups was assessed electrophysiologically and histomorphometrically. At 24 weeks, there was no significant difference in any electrophysiological parameters between TubeC+ and Auto groups, although all histological parameters in Auto group were significantly greater than those in TubeC+ and TubeC- groups, and TubeC+ group demonstrated significant better nerve regeneration than TubeC- group. The transplanted DABLs showed no signs of immunological rejection and some transplanted BMSCs were differentiated into cells with Schwann cell-like phenotype, which might have promoted nerve regeneration within the conduit. This study indicated that the TubeC+ nerve conduit may become an alternative to nerve autograft."

Here, we have determined the binding site of Cp-52, and its parent compound, cryptophycin-1, on HeLa tubulin, to a resolution of 3.3 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively, by cryo-EM and characterized this binding further by molecular dynamics simulations. The binding site was determined to be located at the tubulin interdimer interface and partially overlap that of maytansine, another cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor. Binding induces curvature both within and between tubulin dimers that is incompatible with the microtubule lattice. Conformational changes occur in both α-tubulin and β-tubulin, particularly in helices H8 and H10, with distinct differences between α and β monomers and between Cp-52-bound and cryptophycin-1-bound tubulin. From these results, we have determined: (i) the mechanism of action of inhibition of both microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, (ii) how the affinity of Cp-52 for tubulin may be enhanced, and (iii) where linkers for targeted delivery can be optimally attached to this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W3198155308,"Background Out of Pocket (OOP) payment continues to persist as the major mode of payment for healthcare in Nigeria despite the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Although the burden of health expenditure has been examined in some populations, the impact of OOP among slum dwellers in Nigeria when undergoing emergencies, is under-researched. This study sought to examine the prevalence, factors and predictors of catastrophic health expenditure amongst selected slum and non-slum communities undergoing emergency surgery in Southwestern Nigeria. Methods The study utilised a descriptive cross-sectional survey design to recruit 450 households through a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using pre-tested semi-structured questionnaires in 2017. Factors considered for analysis relating to the payer were age, sex, relationship of payer to patient, educational status, marital status, ethnicity, occupation, income and health insurance coverage. Variables factored into analysis for the patient were indication for surgery, grade of hospital, and type of hospital. Households were classified as incurring catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), if their OOP expenditure exceeded 5% of payers’ household budget. Analysis of the data took into account the multistage sampling design. Results Overall, 65.6% (95% CI: 55.6–74.5) of the total population that were admitted for emergency surgery, experienced catastrophic expenditure. The prevalence of catastrophic expenditure at 5% threshold, among the population scheduled for emergency surgeries, was significantly higher for slum dwellers (74.1%) than for non-slum dwellers (47.7%) (F = 8.59; p = 0.019). Multiple logistic regression models revealed the significant independent factors of catastrophic expenditure at the 5% CHE threshold to include setting of the payer (whether slum or non-slum dweller) (p = 0.019), and health insurance coverage of the payer (p = 0.012). Other variables were nonetheless significant in the bivariate analysis were age of the payer (p = 0.017), income (p&lt;0.001) and marital status of the payer (p = 0.022). Conclusion Although catastrophic health expenditure was higher among the slum dwellers, substantial proportions of respondents incurred catastrophic health expenditure irrespective of whether they were slum or non-slum dwellers. Concerted efforts are required to implement protective measures against catastrophic health expenditure in Nigeria that also cater to slum dwellers."
https://openalex.org/W3198373099,"The SARS-CoV-2 disease, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has become a global pandemic and is causing an unprecedented burden on health care systems and the economy globally. While the travel history of index cases may suggest the origin of infection, phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains from these cases and contacts will increase the understanding and link between local transmission and other global populations. The objective of this analysis was to provide genomic data on the first six cases of SARS-CoV-2 in The Gambia and to determine the source of infection. This ultimately provide baseline data for subsequent local transmission and contribute genomic diversity information towards local and global data. Our analysis has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus identified in The Gambia are of European and Asian origin and sequenced data matched patients' travel history. In addition, we were able to show that two COVID-19 positive cases travelling in the same flight had different strains of SARS-CoV-2. Although whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is still limited in sub-Saharan Africa, this approach has proven to be a highly sensitive, specific and confirmatory tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection."
https://openalex.org/W3197041273,"The primary aims of this study were to determine the effects of lifelong exercise and detraining on age-related alterations in mitochondrial function, inflammation associated with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and lipolysis in the perirenal fat and liver of rats. Female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: young control (n = 12), old control (n = 12), detraining (n = 12), and lifelong exercise (n = 12). We then investigated mitochondrial function, SASP-associated inflammation, and lipolysis in the perirenal fat and liver using qRT-PCR and western blotting to assess the expression of AKT, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), c-jun kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). In the tissues of both the perirenal fat and liver, lifelong exercise significantly improved mitochondrial function, SASP-associated inflammation, and lipolysis. Meanwhile, pathways associated with inflammatory regulation were inhibited, predominantly via the activation of phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT) and suppression of HIF-1α in both tissues, and via JNK in the perirenal fat and p38MAPK in the liver. Furthermore, detraining activated NF-κB expression in both tissues and induced the upregulation of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. Collectively, lifelong exercise was found to exert beneficial effects by ameliorating age-related alterations in mitochondrial function, SASP-associated inflammation, and lipolysis in perirenal fat and liver tissues, potentially inhibiting inflammation via the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, respectively, as well as the HIF-1α and AKT pathways in both tissues. In contrast, detraining induced high levels of circulating hsCRP by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway in both tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3196536926,"A number of human autoinflammatory diseases manifest with severe inflammatory bone destruction. Mouse models of these diseases represent valuable tools that help us to understand molecular mechanisms triggering this bone autoinflammation. The Pstpip2cmo mouse strain is among the best characterized of these; it harbors a mutation resulting in the loss of adaptor protein PSTPIP2 and development of autoinflammatory osteomyelitis. In Pstpip2cmo mice, overproduction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and reactive oxygen species by neutrophil granulocytes leads to spontaneous inflammation of the bones and surrounding soft tissues. However, the upstream signaling events leading to this overproduction are poorly characterized. Here, we show that Pstpip2cmo mice deficient in major regulator of Src-family kinases (SFKs) receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 display delayed onset and lower severity of the disease, while the development of autoinflammation is not affected by deficiencies in Toll-like receptor signaling. Our data also show deregulation of pro-IL-1β production by Pstpip2cmo neutrophils that are attenuated by CD45 deficiency. These data suggest a role for SFKs in autoinflammation. Together with previously published work on the involvement of protein tyrosine kinase spleen tyrosine kinase, they point to the role of receptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, which after phosphorylation by SFKs recruit spleen tyrosine kinase for further signal propagation. We propose that this class of receptors triggers the events resulting in increased pro-IL-1β synthesis and disease initiation and/or progression."
https://openalex.org/W3197358822,"The goal of the current study was to create reference intervals and values for several common and one potential novel physiological indicators of animal welfare for four species of cetaceans. The subjects included 189 bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ), 27 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops aduncus ), eight Pacific white-sided dolphins ( Lagenorhynchus obliquidens ), and 13 beluga whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ) at Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited facilities. During two sampling time periods between July and November of 2018 and between January and April of 2019, fecal samples were collected weekly for five weeks from all animals. Samples were processed and analyzed using enzyme immunoassay for fecal cortisol, aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) metabolites. Linear mixed models were used to examine demographic and time factors impacting hormone metabolite concentrations. Age, sex, and time of year were all significant predictors for some of the models (p &lt; 0.01). An iOS mobile application ZooPhysioTrak was created for easy access to species-specific reference intervals and values accounting for significant predictors. For facilities without access to this application, additional reference intervals and values were constructed without accounting for significant predictors. Information gained from this study and the use of the application can provide reference intervals and values to make informed management decisions for cetaceans in zoological facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3198414511,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels, which are conserved across mammals, flies, fish, sea squirts, worms, and fungi, essentially contribute to cellular Ca2+ signaling. The activity of the unique TRP channel in yeast, TRP yeast channel 1 (TRPY1), relies on the vacuolar and cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. However, the mechanism(s) of Ca2+-dependent regulation of TRPY1 and possible contribution(s) of Ca2+-binding proteins are yet not well understood. Our results demonstrate a Ca2+-dependent binding of yeast calmodulin (CaM) to TRPY1. TRPY1 activity was increased in the cmd1-6 yeast strain, carrying a non-Ca2+-binding CaM mutant, compared with the parent strain expressing wt CaM (Cmd1). Expression of Cmd1 in cmd1-6 yeast rescued the wt phenotype. In addition, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, hypertonic shock-induced TRPY1-dependent Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release were increased by the CaM antagonist ophiobolin A. We found that coexpression of mammalian CaM impeded the activity of TRPY1 by reinforcing effects of endogenous CaM. Finally, inhibition of TRPY1 by Ca2+-CaM required the cytoplasmic amino acid stretch E33-Y92. In summary, our results show that TRPY1 is under inhibitory control of Ca2+-CaM and that mammalian CaM can replace yeast CaM for this inhibition. These findings add TRPY1 to the innumerable cellular proteins, which include a variety of ion channels, that use CaM as a constitutive or dissociable Ca2+-sensing subunit, and contribute to a better understanding of the modulatory mechanisms of Ca2+-CaM."
https://openalex.org/W3196605936,"Yeast is a facultative anaerobe and uses diverse electron acceptors to maintain redox-regulated import of cysteine-rich precursors via the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway. With the growing diversity of substrates utilizing the MIA pathway, understanding the capacity of the intermembrane space (IMS) to handle different types of stress is crucial. We used MS to identify additional proteins that interacted with the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 of the MIA pathway. Altered inheritance of mitochondria 32 (Aim32), a thioredoxin-like [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin protein, was identified as an Erv1-binding protein. Detailed localization studies showed that Aim32 resided in both the mitochondrial matrix and IMS. Aim32 interacted with additional proteins including redox protein Osm1 and protein import components Tim17, Tim23, and Tim22. Deletion of Aim32 or mutation of conserved cysteine residues that coordinate the Fe-S center in Aim32 resulted in an increased accumulation of proteins with aberrant disulfide linkages. In addition, the steady-state level of assembled TIM22, TIM23, and Oxa1 protein import complexes was decreased. Aim32 also bound to several mitochondrial proteins under nonreducing conditions, suggesting a function in maintaining the redox status of proteins by potentially targeting cysteine residues that may be sensitive to oxidation. Finally, Aim32 was essential for growth in conditions of stress such as elevated temperature and hydroxyurea, and under anaerobic conditions. These studies suggest that the Fe-S protein Aim32 has a potential role in general redox homeostasis in the matrix and IMS. Thus, Aim32 may be poised as a sensor or regulator in quality control for a broad range of mitochondrial proteins."

If left unrepaired, they inhibit transcription as well as DNA unwinding during replication and may result in genome instability or even cell death. The DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT) is known to form DNA cross-links in the presence of the carcinogen 1,2-dibromoethane, resulting in G:C to T:A transversions and other mutations in both bacterial and mammalian cells. We hypothesized that AGT-DNA cross-links would be processed by nuclear proteases to yield peptides small enough to be bypassed by translesion (TLS) polymerases. Here, a 15-mer and a 36-mer peptide from the active site of AGT were cross-linked to the N2 position of guanine via conjugate addition of a thiol containing a peptide dehydroalanine moiety. Bypass studies with DNA polymerases (pols) η and κ indicated that both can accurately bypass the cross-linked DNA peptides. The specificity constant (kcat/Km) for steady-state incorporation of the correct nucleotide dCTP increased by 6-fold with human (h) pol κ and 3-fold with hpol η, with hpol η preferentially inserting nucleotides in the order dC > dG > dA > dT. LC-MS/MS analysis of the extension product also revealed error-free bypass of the cross-linked 15-mer peptide by hpol η. We conclude that a bulky 15-mer AGT peptide cross-linked to the N2 position of guanine can retard polymerization, but that overall fidelity is not compromised because only correct bases are inserted and extended.

The processing (and possible repair) of AGT-DNA cross-links are not fully understood. Our current hypothesis is that such AGT-DNA cross-links are processed by proteases to yield peptides that are small enough to be bypassed by human translesion (TLS) DNA polymerases, with the introduction of mutations (Fig. 1). The focus of our work was the synthesis and bypass studies with DNA-peptide cross-links from the active site of AGT at the N2 position of dG, known to occur in DNA (37Chowdhury G. Cho S.-H. Pegg A.E. Guengerich F.P. Detection and characterization of ethylene dibromide-derived DNA-cross-links formed with O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.Angew. Chem. Int.

N2-dG-DNA-peptide cross-links with varying bulk (15- and 36-amino acids) were synthesized using the strategy involving the conjugate addition of a thiol-containing oligonucleotide with a dehydroalanine moiety formed from AGT in the Cys-145 peptides, thus yielding the same basic AGT-DNA cross-link as formed with 1,2-dibromoethane. Our results indicate that both hpol η and hpol κ bypass these long peptides and insert bases correctly across from the N2-dG-DNA-peptide cross-links. The N2-dG DNA peptide cross-links were synthesized using a 2-fluorodeoxyinosine (2-F-dI)-containing 19-nucleotide oligonucleotide and 15-mer (Ac-PVPILIPCHRVVSSS-NH2, AGT residues 138–152, with Cys-150 changed to Ser) or a 36-mer (Ac-PLAARAVGGALRGNPVPILIPCHRVVSSSGAVGNYS-NH2, AGT residues 124–159, with Lys-125 and Met-134 both changed to Leu and Cys-150 changed to Ser to yield modification only at the Cys-145 residue) peptide (see Table S1 for oligonucleotide and peptide sequences).

A postoligomerization approach was developed for the synthesis of the oligonucleotide-peptide cross-links. The 2-F-dI-containing oligonucleotide was converted into an N2-cystamine-dG-modified oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). The synthesis was carried out on a CPG (controlled pore glass) level, which involves nucleophilic displacement using cystamine followed by O6-(p-nitrophenylethyl) (NPE) deprotection (41Ghodke P.P. Albertolle M.E. Johnson K.M. Guengerich F.P. Synthesis and characterization of site-specific O6-alkylguanine DNA-alkyl transferase-oligonucleotide crosslinks.Curr. Protoc. Nucleic Acid Chem. 2019; 76: e74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The final oligonucleotide deprotection was carried out to cleave CPG beads and to remove base-protecting groups to obtain N2-cystamine-dG-modified oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). The cystamine-modified oligonucleotide was purified by HPLC (Fig. S4) and characterized by MALDI MS (Fig. S5). The cystamine-containing oligonucleotide was reduced with DTT to obtain an N2-(2-thioethyl)-dG oligonucleotide (Fig. 2), which was coupled with each respective dha-containing peptide (Fig. 2). The DNA–peptide cross-links were purified by gel electrophoresis (Fig. S6), and the N2-dG-15-mer peptide cross-link was characterized by MALDI MS (Fig. 3). To simplify the LC-MS/MS characterization, the nucleic acid moiety of the oligonucleotide–peptide cross-links was hydrolyzed with HF to generate a peptide adducted with only the base guanine (Fig. S7) and analyzed using nano-LC-MS/MS in the positive mode (Figs. S8 and S9; Tables S2 and S3). As a result, oxidized sulfur-bearing oligonucleotide–peptide cross-links were observed with an additional mass of 32 a. m. u. (Fig. 2). The major ions at m/z 927.56 (+2) (Fig. S8) for the N2-dG-15-mer-peptide cross-link and at m/z 952.29 (+4) (Fig. S9) for the N2-dG-36-mer-peptide cross-link and their fragmentation patterns (Figs. S8B and S9B; Tables S2 and S3) indicated an oxidized sulfur atom of the cysteine (sulfone). These oxidized forms of oligonucleotide–peptide cross-links, which had also been observed in our work with N6-adenyl cross-links to the AGT peptides (39Ghodke P.P. Gonzalez-Vasquez G. Wang H.

In the course of our work, we extended the studies to a 36-mer AGT active site peptide cross-link at the N2 atom of dG, although we did not repeat all of the miscoding studies. The full-length extension reactions were performed using a 14-mer primer and respective unmodified and cross-linked templates in the presence of mixture of dNTPs (Fig. 4A). With the N2-dG-15-mer peptide cross-link, hpol η fully extended the primer with similar efficiency as the unmodified template (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–6 and 7–12). In the case of the N2-dG-36-mer peptide cross-link, the extension efficiency was reduced as compared with the unmodified as well as the N2-dG-15-mer peptide cross-link template (Fig. 4B, lanes 13–18). With the N2-dG-15-mer peptide cross-link, hpol κ also fully extended the primer with similar efficiency as the unmodified template (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–6 and 7–12). In the case of the N2-dG-36-mer peptide cross-link, the extension efficiency was reduced as compared with the unmodified template as well as the N2-dG-15-mer peptide cross-link template (Fig. 4C, lanes 13–18). Overall, both of the TLS polymerases were able to tolerate the 36-amino acid bulk. Single-nucleotide insertion assays were carried out using a 14-mer primer and respective unmodified and cross-linked templates in the presence of all four of the individual dNTPs (Fig. 5A). As observed earlier in our laboratory and by others (e.g., Ghodke et al. (39Ghodke P.P. Gonzalez-Vasquez G. Wang H. Johnson K.M. Sedgeman C.A. Guengerich F.P.

Chem. 2021; 296: 100444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)), hpol η is prone to misincorporation at high dNTP concentrations and to insert multiple copies of a single dNTP. hpol η preferentially added dCTP across from (unmodified) dG, with the incorporation preference dCTP > dATP > dTTP > dGTP (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–12). For both the N2-dG peptide cross-links, the incorporation preference was also dCTP > dATP > dTTP > dGTP (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–12, X is N2-dG-15-mer or 36-mer peptide cross-link). With hpol κ, only dCTP incorporation was observed for all the templates (Fig. 5C). hpol κ had a slower rate of incorporation of dCTP across from N2-dG-36-mer peptide cross-link as compared with N2-dG-15-mer peptide cross-link (Fig. 5C, lanes 1–12, X is N2-dG-36-mer peptide cross-link). Overall, hpol κ showed faithful bypass of N2-dG-peptide cross-links irrespective of the bulk of the adduct. To determine the frequency of misincorporation across from N2-dG-peptide cross-links, steady-state kinetic analysis was done using individual dNTPs at varying concentrations with both hpol η and hpol κ (Figs. 6, 7, and S10–S12 and Table 1). The steady-state kinetics of insertion of the correct base (i.e., dCTP) by hpol η and κ are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

This not only excludes female perpetrators, but also fails to take socio-demographic and psychosocial differences between perpetrators and the general population into consideration. The aim of this study was to examine male- and female-perpetrated IPH cases, and to compare socio-demographic factors in IPH perpetrators and in matched controls from the general population. Data were retrieved from preliminary inquiries, court records and national registers for 48 men and 10 women, who were perpetrators of IPH committed in 2000-2016 and residing in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. The control group consisted of 480 men and 100 women matched for age, sex and residence parish. Logistic regression, yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), was performed for male perpetrators and male controls to investigate associations for selected socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics. This was not performed for females due to the small sample size. Female perpetrators were convicted of murder to a lesser extent than male perpetrators. No woman was sentenced to life imprisonment while five men were. Jealousy and separation were the most common motivational factors for male perpetration while the predominant factor for female perpetrators was subjection to IPV. Statistically significant differences were found between male perpetrators and male controls in unemployment rate (n = 47.9%/20.6%; OR 4.4; 95% CI 2.2-8.6), receiving benefits (n = 20.8%/4.8%; OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.3-11.7) and annual disposable income (n = 43.8%/23.3% low income; OR 5.2; 95% CI 1.9-14.2) one year prior to the crime. Female IPH perpetrators were less educated than female controls (≤ 9-year education 30%/12%) and were more often unemployed (70%/23%) one year before the crime. Male and female IPH perpetrators were socio-economically disadvantaged, compared with controls from the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3196403200,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune disease that primarily targets astrocytes. Autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) against the water channel protein, aquaporin 4 (AQP4), are a serologic marker in NMO patients, and they are known to be responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease. In the brain, AQP4 is mainly expressed in astrocytes, especially at the end-feet, where they form the blood-brain barrier. Following the interaction between NMO-IgG and AQP4 in astrocytes, rapid AQP4 endocytosis initiates pathogenesis. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of astrocyte destruction by autoantibodies remain largely elusive. We established an in vitro human astrocyte model system using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology in combination with NMO patient-derived serum and IgG to elucidate the cellular and functional changes caused by NMO-IgG. Herein, we observed that NMO-IgG induces structural alterations in mitochondria and their association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes at the ultrastructural level, which potentially leads to impaired mitochondrial functions and dynamics. Indeed, human astrocytes display impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and autophagy activity in the presence of NMO-IgG. We further demonstrated NMO-IgG-driven ER membrane deformation into a multilamellar structure in human astrocytes. Together, we show that NMO-IgG rearranges cellular organelles and alter their functions and that our in vitro system using human iPSCs offers previously unavailable experimental opportunities to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of NMO in human astrocytes or conduct large-scale screening for potential therapeutic compounds targeting astrocytic abnormalities in patients with NMO."

We assessed risk factors for clinical and microbiological failure in women with lower UTI. This case-control study nested within a randomized clinical trial included all women in the per-protocol population (PPP), those in the PPP with microbiologically confirmed UTI, and those in the PPP with UTI due to Escherichia coli. Cases were women who experienced clinical and/or microbiologic failure; controls were those who did not. Risk factors for failure were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. In the PPP, there were 152 clinical cases for 307 controls. Among 340 women with microbiologically confirmed UTI, 126 and 102 cases with clinical and microbiological failure were considered with, respectively, 214 and 220 controls. Age ≥52 years was independently associated with clinical (adjusted OR 3.01; 95%CI 1.84-4.98) and microbiologic failure (aOR 2.55; 95%CI 1.54-4.25); treatment with fosfomycin was associated with clinical failure (aOR 2.35; 95%CI 1.47-3.80). The association with age persisted among all women, and women with E. coli-related UTI. Diabetes was not an independent risk factor, nor were other comorbidities. Postmenopausal age emerged as an independent risk factor for both clinical and microbiological treatment failure in women with lower UTI and should be considered to define women at-risk for non-spontaneous remission, and thus for delayed antibiotic therapy; diabetes mellitus was not associated with failure."
https://openalex.org/W3198638661,"Accurate segmentation of breast masses is an essential step in computer aided diagnosis of breast cancer. The scarcity of annotated training data greatly hinders the model's generalization ability, especially for the deep learning based methods. However, high-quality image-level annotations are time-consuming and cumbersome in medical image analysis scenarios. In addition, a large amount of weak annotations is under-utilized which comprise common anatomy features. To this end, inspired by teacher-student networks, we propose an Anatomy-Aware Weakly-Supervised learning Network (AAWS-Net) for extracting useful information from mammograms with weak annotations for efficient and accurate breast mass segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a weakly-supervised learning strategy in the Teacher to extract anatomy structure from mammograms with weak annotations by reconstructing the original image. Besides, knowledge distillation is used to suggest morphological differences between benign and malignant masses. Moreover, the prior knowledge learned from the Teacher is introduced to the Student in an end-to-end way, which improves the ability of the student network to locate and segment masses. Experiments on CBIS-DDSM have shown that our method yields promising performance compared with state-of-the-art alternative models for breast mass segmentation in terms of segmentation accuracy and IoU."
https://openalex.org/W3198842315,"New neurons born in the adult brain undergo a critical period soon after migration to their site of incorporation. During this time, the behavior of the animal may influence the survival or culling of these cells. In the songbird song system, earlier work suggested that adult-born neurons may be retained in the song motor pathway nucleus HVC with respect to motor progression toward a target song during juvenile song learning, seasonal song restructuring, and experimentally manipulated song variability. However, it is not known whether the quality of song per se, without progressive improvement, may also influence new neuron survival. To test this idea, we experimentally altered song acoustic structure by unilateral denervation of the syrinx, causing a poor quality song. We found no effect of aberrant song on numbers of new neurons in HVC, suggesting that song quality does not influence new neuron culling in this region. However, aberrant song resulted in the loss of left-side dominance in new neurons in the auditory region caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), and a bilateral decrease in new neurons in the basal ganglia nucleus Area X. Thus new neuron culling may be influenced by behavioral feedback in accordance with the function of new neurons within that region. We propose that studying the effects of singing behaviors on new neurons across multiple brain regions that differentially subserve singing may give rise to general rules underlying the regulation of new neuron survival across taxa and brain regions more broadly."
https://openalex.org/W3198878433,"A wide range of de novo design of αβ-proteins has been achieved based on the design rules, which describe secondary structure lengths and loop torsion patterns favorable for design target topologies. This paper proposes design rules for register shifts in βαβ-motifs, which have not been reported previously, but are necessary for determining a target structure of de novo design of αβ-proteins. By analyzing naturally occurring protein structures in a database, we found preferences for register shifts in βαβ-motifs, and derived the following empirical rules: (1) register shifts must not be negative regardless of torsion types for a constituent loop in βαβ-motifs; (2) preferred register shifts strongly depend on the loop torsion types. To explain these empirical rules by physical interactions, we conducted physics-based simulations for systems mimicking a βαβ-motif that contains the most frequently observed loop type in the database. We performed an exhaustive conformational sampling of the loop region, imposing the exclusion volume and hydrogen bond satisfaction condition. The distributions of register shifts obtained from the simulations agreed well with those of the database analysis, indicating that the empirical rules are a consequence of physical interactions, rather than an evolutionary sampling bias. Our proposed design rules will serve as a guide to making appropriate target structures for the de novo design of αβ-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3197295544,"To determine the prevalence of visual impairment and glasses ownership among Han Chinese and Hui minority junior high school children in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.Population-based cross-sectional study.Vision screening was conducted on 20,376 children (age 12-15 years) in all 124 rural junior high schools in Ningxia. Personal and family characteristics, glasses ownership, and academic performance were assessed through a survey questionnaire and standardized mathematics test, respectively.The prevalence of visual acuity (VA) ≤6/12 in either eye was significantly higher among Han (54.5%) than Hui (45.2%) children (P<0.001), and was significantly positively associated with age, female sex, Han ethnicity, parental outmigration for work, shorter time spent outside during recess, shorter time spent watching television and higher time spent studying. Among children with VA≤6/12 in both eyes, only 56.8% of Han and 41.5% of Hui children had glasses (P<0.001). Glasses ownership was significantly associated with worse vision, greater family wealth, female sex, higher test scores, age, parental outmigration for work, understanding of myopia and glasses, higher time spent studying and Han ethnicity.One of the first of its kind, this report on Han and Hui ethnic schoolchildren confirms a high prevalence of visual impairment among both populations, but slightly higher among the Han. Both groups, especially the Hui, have low rates of glasses ownership. Future interventions and policies designed to improve glasses usage should focus on populations with lower incomes and seek to correct erroneous beliefs about the safety of glasses and efficacy of traditional eye exercises."
https://openalex.org/W3198138378,"We examined the effect of ankle joint fixation vs increased foot pressure (aiming to reduce dynamometer-subject elasticity (DSE)) on the exerted moment during plantarflexion contraction. We also examined the joint rotation in dependence of the measuring site (forefoot, rearfoot) and the foot condition (fixed, free). We hypothesized higher exerted moments due to reduced DSE compared to fixed condition and an effect of fixation on the joint rotation in dependence of the measuring site. Fourteen healthy individuals (28.7±6.9y) completed in randomized order maximal isometric plantarflexions in four different positions (0-3-6-9 cm) and two ankle joint conditions (fixed-free). Kinematics of the rear- and forefoot were obtained synchronously. We found higher moment in the fixed compared to the free condition at all positions. The maximum moment in the fixed condition did not differ at any position. At the fixed condition, the forefoot rotation did not differ at any position (~5°) while at free condition we observed a significant rotation reduction (form ~12 to ~5°). The rearfoot rotation did not differ between conditions at any position while a significant joint angle reduction was observed (~10 to ~6° and ~12 to ~6°; fixed-free respectively). The results indicate that with appropriate foot fixation the maximum moment can be achieved irrespective of the position. With the foot secured, the measuring site influences the rotational outcome. We suggest that for a minimization of the joint rotation a fixation and the forefoot-measuring site should be preferred. Additionally, for unconstrained foot kinematic observations both measuring sites can be obtained."

https://openalex.org/W3198649815,"Assessing the seroprevalence of the high-risk individuals against the influenza virus is essential to evaluate the progress of vaccine implementation programs and establish influenza virus interventions. Herein, we identified the pre-existing cross-protection of the circulating seasonal influenza viruses among the older-aged population. A cross-sectional study was performed base on the 176 residual sera samples collected from older adults aged 60 to 95 years without a history of vaccination in rural Thailand in 2015. Sera antibody titers against influenza A and B viruses circulating between 2016 and 2019 were determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay. These findings indicated the low titers of pre-existing antibodies to circulating influenza subtypes and showed age-independent antibody titers among the old adults. Moderate seropositive rates (HAI ≥ 1:40) were observed in influenza A viruses (65.9%A(H3N2), 50.0% for A(H1N1) pdm09), and found comparatively lower rates in influenza B viruses (14% B/Yam2, 21% B/Yam3 and 25% B/Vic). Only 5% of individuals possessed broadly protective antibodies against both seasonal influenza A and B virus in this region. Our findings highlighted the low pre-existing antibodies to circulating influenza strains in the following season observed in older adults. The serological study will help inform policy-makers for health care planning and guide control measures concerning vaccination programs."
https://openalex.org/W3164405825,"Meter is one of the core features of music perception. It is the cognitive grouping of regular sound sequences, typically for every 2, 3, or 4 beats. Previous studies have suggested that one can not only passively perceive the meter from acoustic cues such as loudness, pitch, and duration of sound elements, but also actively perceive it by paying attention to isochronous sound events without any acoustic cues. Studying the interaction of top-down and bottom-up processing in meter perception leads to understanding the cognitive system's ability to perceive the entire structure of music. The present study aimed to demonstrate that meter perception requires the top-down process (which maintains and switches attention between cues) as well as the bottom-up process for discriminating acoustic cues. We created a ""biphasic"" sound stimulus, which consists of successive tone sequences designed to provide cues for both the triple and quadruple meters in different sound attributes, frequency, and duration. Participants were asked to focus on either frequency or duration of the stimulus, and to answer how they perceived meters on a five-point scale (ranged from ""strongly triple"" to ""strongly quadruple""). As a result, we found that participants perceived different meters by switching their attention to specific cues. This result adds evidence to the idea that meter perception involves the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes."
https://openalex.org/W3197489459,"Magnetic resonance imaging radio frequency arrays are composed of multiple receive coils that have their signals combined to form an image. Combination requires an estimate of the radio frequency coil sensitivities to align signal phases and prevent destructive interference. At lower fields this can be accomplished using a uniform physical reference coil. However, at higher fields, uniform volume coils are lacking and, when available, suffer from regions of low receive sensitivity that result in poor sensitivity estimation and combination. Several approaches exist that do not require a physical reference coil but require manual intervention, specific prescans, or must be completed post-acquisition. This makes these methods impractical for large multi-volume datasets such as those collected for novel types of functional MRI or quantitative susceptibility mapping, where magnitude and phase are important. This pilot study proposes a fitted SVD method which utilizes existing combination methods to create a phase sensitive combination method targeted at large multi-volume datasets. This method uses any multi-image prescan to calculate the relative receive sensitivities using voxel-wise singular value decomposition. These relative sensitivities are fitted to the solid harmonics using an iterative least squares fitting algorithm. Fits of the relative sensitivities are used to align the phases of the receive coils and improve combination in subsequent acquisitions during the imaging session. This method is compared against existing approaches in the human brain at 7 Tesla by examining the combined data for the presence of singularities and changes in phase signal-to-noise ratio. Two additional applications of the method are also explored, using the fitted SVD method in an asymmetrical coil and in a case with subject motion. The fitted SVD method produces singularity-free images and recovers between 95-100% of the phase signal-to-noise ratio depending on the prescan data resolution. Using solid harmonic fitting to interpolate singular value decomposition derived receive sensitivities from existing prescans allows the fitted SVD method to be used on all acquisitions within a session without increasing exam duration. Our fitted SVD method is able to combine imaging datasets accurately without supervision during online reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W3197957253,"Differences in the capacity for absorption between different organizations will have an important impact on an organization’s choices of innovation exploration and exploitive innovation strategies. Organizations need to explore correct strategic decisions under different policies for long-term development. This study with limited rational first-mover and late-mover organizations as the research object, based on the evolutionary game theory model, using visualization system deduced first-mover and late-mover organizations in the knowledge absorptive capacity differences and incentive policies under the condition of different strategies selection process. The research shows that the rationality of policy incentive setting has a direct impact on the choice of organizational dual innovation strategy with different knowledge absorption capacities. The market pattern is stable and organizational knowledge absorption capacity is different. The higher the policy incentive level is, the more the organization is inclined to carry out exploratory innovation activities. Under the environment of stable market structure, different organizational knowledge absorption capacity, and no policy incentive, late-mover cannot adopt exploratory innovation strategy alone. When the market pattern is stable and the absorptive capacity of the organization is different, whether the late-mover can adopt the exploratory innovation strategy depends on the policy incentive level. In this case, the optimal situation is to have the opportunity to change to exploratory innovation at the same time as the first-movers."
https://openalex.org/W3198037775,"Sperm morphology is generally uniform within a species due to selective pressures that act to achieve better fertilization outcomes under postcopulatory competitive circumstances. Therefore, polyandry that intensifies post-mating sperm competition should constrain intraspecific sperm polymorphism. Contrary to this paradigm, we previously found that a polyandrous squid, Heterololigo bleekeri, produces dimorphic eusperm (flagellum length dimorphism; FLD), which is closely associated with alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs); large males (consorts) transfer their spermatophores inside the female's mantle cavity, while small males (sneakers) do so outside the mantle. Thus, FLD was considered as the consequence of different insemination strategies that arise from different modes of sperm competition, sperm storage and the fertilization environment. However, in other squid species showing ARTs, the choice of mating behaviour is rather conditional (i.e., switching mating tactic between consorts and sneakers), which poses the question of whether sperm FLD could have evolved. Here, we investigated five species in the family Loliginidae that exhibit ARTs and found that all species showed sneaker-biased FLD. However, in a species with conditional ARTs, we found FLD rather ambiguous and the testicular somatic index to be nearly continuous among individuals at transitional state, suggesting that plasticity in mating behaviour compromises the disruptive selection on a sperm morphological trait."
https://openalex.org/W3198336884,"The 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Virtual Science Research Conference (SRC) on Protein Aggregation: Function, Dysfunction, and Disease was held on June 23–25, 2021 after initially being planned as an in-person meeting in Tucson, AZ, USA. The meeting, like all FASEB meetings in recent months, required reformatting to be held virtually as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the meeting was to cover the normal and pathological mechanisms of protein aggregation. This included traditional core themes of the meeting series, such as the structure of aggregates, functional aggregates, the mechanisms of aggregate assembly, and the role of aggregate polymorphism in the clinical characteristics of disease. New technologies to understand aspects of aggregation were introduced at the meeting. In addition, in recent years, notions of protein aggregation have expanded to include a range of normal biological phenomena such as the formation of membraneless organelles driven by liquid/liquid phase separation. These mechanisms intersect with the pathological mechanisms in protein aggregation diseases. As such the meeting also brought these broader aspects of biology together with an emphasis on how normal and pathological aggregation arises, and the impacts on human health and therapeutic development. The FASEB SRC Protein Aggregation meeting series was established to address the need to bring researchers together on this topic to discuss basic research and clinical research. The meeting has run, on average, every 2–3 years since 1995 and has earned a reputation as a “must go” meeting in the field on the conference calendar. The 2021 meeting had two plenary presentations, 32 additional invited speakers, and 21 abstract talks. The gender balance for speakers was 42% female. The meeting was attended by 223 delegates. The meeting represented more new voices than previous meetings, with less than 10% of the invited speakers having presented in any one of the last 3 meetings. The organizers also introduced new measures to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. In particular, the meeting featured two workshops on the topic, one organized by FASEB and one by the conference as a hallmark initiative. The workshops included thought-provoking and engaging discussions on issues of race, gender, disability, sexuality, and gender identity and how they impact the research field. The organizers also strove to facilitate more opportunities for junior researchers to be engaged in the meeting. This included expanding the number of chairs for each session in order to mix earlier-staged researchers with more experienced researchers. The organizers also partnered with junior scientists to facilitate a Next Generation symposium the day prior to the start of the main meeting and hosted a Career Development Workshop. To maximize the impact of the online format, the program was designed to be as accommodating as possible to the three major time zones of the delegates around the world, and to allow all poster presenters the opportunity for 3-min prerecorded talks. The first plenary was delivered by Dr. Don Cleveland (University of California, San Diego, CA, USA) who presented his new studies on the organization and composition of TDP-43 condensates, which are thought to be involved both in normal mRNA regulation and in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TDP-43 formed intranuclear condensates with an “anisosome” structure, whereby the TDP-43 formed a liquid crystalline shell around a core enriched with Hsp70 family chaperones. Maintenance of the anisosome shell and liquid-like fluidity was dependent on chaperone activity. It was proposed that disturbances in the multiphasic behavior of the TDP-43 anisosomes are central to disease pathomechanisms. The second plenary was the European Molecular Biology Organization Lecture, delivered by Dr. Anne Bertolloti (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) who presented her research on strategies to influence the buffering capacity of protein quality control mechanisms and in manipulating them for clinical benefit in neurodegenerative diseases. Her key studies have found that inhibition of phosphatases (R15A and R15B) that target phosphorylated EIF2a with small molecules can be of therapeutic benefit in animal models of disease and are currently in phase 2 clinical testing for human diseases, remarkably just 10 years after the first basic research into this biology was published. The field has made breathtaking progress in terms of near atomic resolution structures of amyloids formed both in vitro and in vivo. Dr. Ruben Fernandez Busnadiego (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany) gave the opening talk of the meeting and presented several spectacular cryo-electron microscopy tomography images of intracellular protein deposits formed by polyglutamine, poly(glycine-alanine), TDP-43, and α-synuclein. The work showed remarkable new perspectives on the fibrillar or amorphous nature of these aggregates, and their interactions with other cellular structures, including membranes, with potential implications for disease mechanisms. The meeting also heard from Dr. Allison Kraus (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA) about the first high-resolution structure of an infectious mammalian prion, which has eluded the field until now. The structure has a classic parallel in-register amyloid structure, but also features striking arrays of glycans and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors projecting outwards from the fibril axis, and these were speculated to cause severe distortion of cell membranes that may contribute to infectivity and proteotoxicity. There were various talks on liquid-liquid phase separation, which has emerged as a ubiquitous principle for subcellular organization and protein aggregation. Dr. Jeanne Stachowiak (University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA) showed how phase separation at the membrane could provide compressive force to induce curvature. Her studies involved beautiful modeling that demonstrated how attractive and repulsive forces can drive the directionality of the curvature. The mechanisms have implications in disease, with phase separation at membrane surfaces driving abnormal membrane tubulation and distortion. Dr. Jay Groves (University of California, Berkely, CA, USA) described in astonishing detail how condensates contribute to kinetic proofreading functions of membrane receptors. He showed how a nucleation barrier to linker for activation of T cells phase separation allows T-cell receptors to integrate the dwell time of single ligand binding, thereby filtering out “noise” and endowing T cells with single-molecule sensitivity. The meeting also provided findings in basic science of relevance to therapeutics. Dr. Holger Wille (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada) shared his results of the development of a rationally designed β-solenoid-based prion vaccine that provided extraordinary protection against prion disease in a mouse model of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, and led to the development of a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the disease form of prion protein across all tested prion strains and species. Dr. Anna Greka (Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School/Broad Institute, Boston, MA, USA) described her research on the TMED9 protein, which her team discovered binds misfolded membrane-associated proteins and regulates them for quality control. Her research found that release of the cargo with a drug (BRD4748) could promote the degradation of the cargo and alleviate cytotoxicity of the misfolded protein that otherwise accumulates and overwhelms the quality control mechanisms. The meeting also heard about new methods for the study of protein conformations and aggregation in cellular milieu. Dr. Michael Fitzgerald (Duke University, Durham, NC, USA) and Dr. Lisa Jones (University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD, USA) described their research into developing and applying covalent labeling approaches with mass spectrometry to study the structures of proteins in lysates and in living cells. The methods illustrate exciting potential to study mechanisms of protein assembly and conformation changes in situ, as well as identify new drug targets and pathways. Dr. Marc Diamond (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA) presented his research into assaying Tau prion strains through the development of an alanine scan mutant array that provided structural fingerprints of different Tau prion strains based on the residue positions required for prion propagation in cell culture. Fingerprints were found to correspond to different tauopathies and hint at exciting opportunities for structure-based diagnosis. Results from the postmeeting survey indicated that 88% of the delegates were satisfied with the overall conference experience, and 89% said they would attend again in the future. This was despite the online format creating some organizational challenges, including long sessions to accommodate the different time zones. The organizers found that initiatives designed to stimulate less-formal interactions between attendees fell far short of replicating the camaraderie enjoyed at previous in-person meetings. Most notable among these initiatives were meet the experts sessions. These were somewhat difficult to locate in the online platform and were generally poorly attended, so some thought will be needed to make these sessions more relevant should they continue being held online in the future. The poster sessions were also not as well attended as they would have been in person, although delegates did report a generally positive experience of the way the sessions were set up. The organizers also endeavored to get as much of the content as possible uploaded ahead of the meeting, to make the content accessible to those unable to attend live and allow them a chance to deliver questions ahead of the live stream. In reality, this was not achieved, in part due to a majority of presenters missing the deadlines ahead of the meeting, and because the turnaround for converting streamed sessions to on-demand took several business days. As such, the on-demand content was not as engaging as had been planned. However, on a positive note, conference attendees participated very actively in the discussions that followed the talks, with animated in-person discussion and many questions in the Q&A session. On the whole, however, it is clear that the first virtual edition of the FASEB SRC Protein Aggregation meeting series was a success, and will serve as a blueprint for future meetings that may include virtual programming. The meeting was chaired by Danny Hatters (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia), co-chaired by Marina Ramirez-Alvarado (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA). Jean Baum (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and Randal Halfmann (Stowers Institute, Kansas City, MO, USA) made up the other organizing committee. The meeting was sponsored by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA, USA), Company of Biologists (Cambridge, UK), GenNext Technologies (Half Moon Bay, CA, USA), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO; Heidelberg, Germany), and the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The organizers are grateful for this support. The authors declare no conflicts of interest. D.M.H drafted the report with revisions and further contributions by R.H. and J.B."
https://openalex.org/W3198442639,"Lack of simple and robust methods to determine complement activation in human serum induced by antigen-antibody complexes is a major hurdle for monitoring therapeutic antibody drug quality and stability. Dezamizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to serum amyloid P component (SAP) for potential treatment of systemic amyloidosis. The mechanism of action of Dezamizumab includes the binding of SAP, complement activation through classical pathway, and phagocytosis; however, the steps in this process cannot be easily monitored. We developed two novel methods to determine Dezamizumab-SAP complex-induced complement activation. Complement component 3 (C3) depletion was detected by homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF), and C3a desArg fragment, formed after the cleavage of C3 to yield C3a followed by removal of its C-terminal arginine residue, was determined using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology. We found that the presence of both Dezamizumab and SAP was required for complement activation via both methods. The optimal molar ratio of Dezamizumab:SAP was 6:1 in order to obtain maximal complement activation. The relative potency from both methods showed a good correlation to Dezamizumab-SAP-dependent complement component 1q (C1q) binding activity in Dezamizumab thermal-stressed samples. Both SAP and C1q binding, as determined by surface plasmon resonance and the two complement activation potency methods described here, reflect the mechanism of action of Dezamizumab. We conclude that these methods can be used to monitor Dezamizumab quality for drug release and stability testing, and the novel potency methods reported here can be potentially used to evaluate complement activity induced by other antigen-antibody complexes."
