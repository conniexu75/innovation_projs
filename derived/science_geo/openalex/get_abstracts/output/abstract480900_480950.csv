ActRIIB mediates signaling of numerous TGF-β proteins; of these, we demonstrate that activins are the most potent negative regulators of muscle mass. To determine whether activin signaling in the absence of tumor-derived factors induces cachexia, we used recombinant serotype 6 adeno-associated virus (rAAV6) vectors to increase circulating activin A levels in C57BL/6 mice. While mice injected with control vector gained ~10% of their starting body mass (3.8±0.4 g) over 10 wk, mice injected with increasing doses of rAAV6:activin A exhibited weight loss in a dose-dependent manner, to a maximum of –12.4% (–4.2±1.1 g). These reductions in body mass in rAAV6:activin-injected mice correlated inversely with elevated serum activin A levels (7- to 24-fold). Mechanistically, we show that activin A reduces muscle mass and function by stimulating the ActRIIB pathway, leading to deleterious consequences, including increased transcription of atrophy-related ubiquitin ligases, decreased Akt/mTOR-mediated protein synthesis, and a profibrotic response. Critically, we demonstrate that the muscle wasting and fibrosis that ensues in response to excessive activin levels is fully reversible. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting activins in cachexia.—Chen, J. L., Walton, K. L., Winbanks, C. E., Murphy, K. T., Thomson, R. E., Makanji, Y., Qian, H., Lynch, G.

https://openalex.org/W2065752901,"Fibrosis is characterized by excessive tissue remodeling resulting from altered expression of various growth factors, cytokines and proteases. We hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mediated degradation of type IV collagen, a main component of the basement membrane, will release peptide fragments (neo-epitopes) into the circulation. Here we present the development of two competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for assessing the levels of specific fragments of type IV collagen α1 (C4M12a1) and α3 (C4M12a3) chains in serum as indicators of fibrosis.Fragments of type IV collagen cleaved in vitro by MMP-12 were identified by mass spectrometry, and two were chosen for ELISA development due to their unique sequences. The assays were evaluated using samples from a carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) rat model of liver fibrosis and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Two technically robust ELISAs were produced using neo-epitope specific monoclonal antibodies. Mean serum C4M12a1 levels were significantly elevated in CCl₄-treated rats compared with controls in weeks 12, 16, and 20, with a maximum increase of 102% at week 16 (p < 0.0001). Further, C4M12a1 levels correlated with the total collagen content of the liver in CCl₄-treated rats (r = 0.43, p = 0.003). Mean serum C4M12a3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with mild, moderate, and severe IPF, and COPD relative to healthy controls, with a maximum increase of 321% in COPD (p < 0.0001).Two assays measuring C4M12a1 and C4M12a3 enabled quantification of MMP mediated degradation of type IV collagen in serum. C4M12a1 was elevated in a pre-clinical model of liver fibrosis, and C4M12a3 was elevated in IPF and COPD patients. This suggests the use of these assays to investigate pathological remodeling of the basement membrane in different organs. However, validations in larger clinical settings are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2001377421,"Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase whose targets include histone H4 lysine 16, p53, and α-tubulin. Because deacetylation of p53 regulates its effect on apoptosis, pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2-dependent p53 deacetylation is of great therapeutic interest for the treatment of cancer. Here, we have identified two structurally related compounds, AEM1 and AEM2, which are selective inhibitors of SIRT2 (IC50 values of 18.5 and 3.8 μm, respectively), but show only weak effects on other sirtuins such as SIRT1, SIRT3, and yeast Sir2. Interestingly, both compounds sensitized non-small cell lung cancer cell lines toward the induction of apoptosis by the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Importantly, this sensitization was dependent on the presence of functional p53, thus establishing a link between SIRT2 inhibition by these compounds and p53 activation. Further, treatment with AEM1 and AEM2 led to elevated levels of p53 acetylation and to increased expression of CDKN1A, which encodes the cell cycle regulator p21WAF1, as well as the pro-apoptotic genes PUMA and NOXA, three transcriptional targets of p53. Altogether, our data suggest that inhibition of SIRT2 by these compounds causes increased activation of p53 by decreasing SIRT2-dependent p53 deacetylation. These compounds thus provide a good opportunity for lead optimization and drug development to target p53-proficient cancers.

https://openalex.org/W1998076382,"Meiotic recombination is sexually dimorphic in most mammalian species, including humans, but the basis for the male:female differences remains unclear. In the present study, we used cytological methodology to directly compare recombination levels between human males and females, and to examine possible sex-specific differences in upstream events of double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptic initiation. Specifically, we utilized the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 as a marker of recombination events, the RecA homologue RAD51 as a surrogate for DSBs, and the synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and/or SYCP1 to examine synapsis between homologs. Consistent with linkage studies, genome-wide recombination levels were higher in females than in males, and the placement of exchanges varied between the sexes. Subsequent analyses of DSBs and synaptic initiation sites indicated similar male:female differences, providing strong evidence that sex-specific differences in recombination rates are established at or before the formation of meiotic DSBs. We then asked whether these differences might be linked to variation in the organization of the meiotic axis and/or axis-associated DNA and, indeed, we observed striking male:female differences in synaptonemal complex (SC) length and DNA loop size. Taken together, our observations suggest that sex specific differences in recombination in humans may derive from chromatin differences established prior to the onset of the recombination pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2086829335,"Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease of the Brassica crops, is widespread in the world. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for partial resistance to 4 different isolates of P. brassicae (Pb2, Pb4, Pb7, and Pb10) were investigated using a BC1F1 population from a cross between two subspecies of Brassica rapa, i.e. Chinese cabbage inbred line C59-1 as a susceptible recurrent parent and turnip inbred line ECD04 as a resistant donor parent. The BC1F2 families were assessed for resistance under controlled conditions. A linkage map constructed with simple sequence repeats (SSR), unigene-derived microsatellite (UGMS) markers, and specific markers linked to published clubroot resistance (CR) genes of B. rapa was used to perform QTL mapping. A total of 6 QTLs residing in 5 CR QTL regions of the B. rapa chromosomes A01, A03, and A08 were identified to account for 12.2 to 35.2% of the phenotypic variance. Two QTL regions were found to be novel except for 3 QTLs in the respective regions of previously identified Crr1, Crr2, and Crr3. QTL mapping results indicated that 1 QTL region was common for partial resistance to the 2 isolates of Pb2 and Pb7, whereas the others were specific for each isolate. Additionally, synteny analysis between B. rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that all CR QTL regions were aligned to a single conserved crucifer blocks (U, F, and R) on 3 Arabidopsis chromosomes where 2 CR QTLs were detected in A. thaliana. These results suggest that some common ancestral genomic regions were involved in the evolution of CR genes in B. rapa."
https://openalex.org/W2111995654,"Deletion of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in Sod1–/– mice leads to accelerated loss of muscle mass and force during aging, but the losses do not occur with muscle-specific deletion of CuZnSOD. To determine the role of motor neurons in the muscle decline, we generated transgenic Sod1–/– mice in which CuZnSOD was expressed under control of the synapsin 1 promoter (SynTgSod1–/– mice). SynTgSod1–/– mice expressed CuZnSOD in brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve, but not in other tissues. Sciatic nerve CuZnSOD content in SynTgSod1–/– mice was ~20% that of control mice, but no reduction in muscle mass or isometric force was observed in SynTg-Sod1–/– mice compared with control animals, whereas muscles of age-matched Sod1–/– mice displayed 30–40% reductions in mass and force. In addition, increased oxidative damage and adaptations in stress responses observed in muscles of Sod1–/– mice were absent in SynTgSod1–/– mice, and degeneration of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure and function occurred in Sod1–/– mice but not in SynTgSod1–/– mice. Our data demonstrate that specific CuZnSOD expression in neurons is sufficient to preserve NMJ and skeletal muscle structure and function in Sod1–/– mice and suggest that redox homeostasis in motor neurons plays a key role in initiating sarcopenia during aging.—Sakellariou, G.

https://openalex.org/W2150045440,"Light pollution is known to affect important biological functions of wild animals, including daily and annual cycles. However, knowledge about long-term effects of chronic exposure to artificial light at night is still very limited. Here we present data on reproductive physiology, molt and locomotor activity during two-year cycles of European blackbirds (Turdus merula) exposed to either dark nights or 0.3 lux at night. As expected, control birds kept under dark nights exhibited two regular testicular and testosterone cycles during the two-year experiment. Control urban birds developed testes faster than their control rural conspecifics. Conversely, while in the first year blackbirds exposed to light at night showed a normal but earlier gonadal cycle compared to control birds, during the second year the reproductive system did not develop at all: both testicular size and testosterone concentration were at baseline levels in all birds. In addition, molt sequence in light-treated birds was more irregular than in control birds in both years. Analysis of locomotor activity showed that birds were still synchronized to the underlying light-dark cycle. We suggest that the lack of reproductive activity and irregular molt progression were possibly the results of i) birds being stuck in a photorefractory state and/or ii) chronic stress. Our data show that chronic low intensities of light at night can dramatically affect the reproductive system. Future studies are needed in order to investigate if and how urban animals avoid such negative impact and to elucidate the physiological mechanisms behind these profound long-term effects of artificial light at night. Finally we call for collaboration between scientists and policy makers to limit the impact of light pollution on animals and ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2045752938,"Recent reports have demonstrated that endothelial cells are involved in vascular inflammatory injury in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SSC. However, little is known about the effects of IL-17A on endothelial cell inflammation in SSC. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of IL-17A in endothelial inflammation. Here, we showed that IL-17A mRNA and protein levels were augmented in the peripheral blood and more IL-17⁺ lymphocytes infiltrated in the perivascular areas in the involved skin of SSC patients. SSC patient serum induced chemokine and adhesion molecule expression in HUVECs, which was blocked by IL-17A neutralization. IL-17A alone induced chemokine and adhesion molecule expression and promoted T cell-HUVEC adhesion. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibition and IL-17A neutralization prominently inhibited chemokine and adhesion molecule expression and blocked T cell-HUVEC adhesion. IL-17A derived from SSC patient serum mediated endothelial cells inflammation by up-regulating chemokines and adhesion molecules, which was blocked by ERK inhibition. These data imply that ERK signal pathway might play a key role in the progression of endothelial injury induced by IL-17A in SSC."
https://openalex.org/W2005004362,"Due to antimicrobial properties, nisin is one of the most commonly used and investigated bacteriocins for food preservation. Surprisingly, nisin has had limited use in animal feed as well as there are only few reports on its influence on microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The present study therefore aimed at investigating effects of dietary nisin on broiler chicken GIT microbial ecology and performance in comparison to salinomycin, the widely used ionophore coccidiostat. In total, 720 one-day-old male Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to six experimental groups. The positive control (PC) diet was supplemented with salinomycin (60 mg/kg). The nisin (NI) diets were supplemented with increasing levels (100, 300, 900 and 2700 IU nisin/g, respectively) of the bacteriocin. The negative control (NC) diet contained no additives. At slaughter (35 days of age), activity of specific bacterial enzymes (α- and β-glucosidases, α-galactosidases and β-glucuronidase) in crop, ileum and caeca were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the NC group, and nisin supplementation decreased the enzyme activities to levels observed for the PC group. A similar inhibitory influence on bacterial activity was reflected in the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and putrefactive SCFA (PSCFA) in digesta from crop and ileum; no effect was observed in caeca. Counts of Bacteroides and Enterobacteriacae in ileum digesta were significantly (P<0.001) decreased by nisin and salinomycin, but no effects were observed on the counts of Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus/Enterococcus and total bacteria. Like salinomycin, nisin supplementation improved broiler growth performance in a dose-dependent manner; compared to the NC group, the body weight gain of the NI₉₀₀ and NI₂₇₀₀ groups was improved by 4.7 and 8.7%, respectively. Our findings suggest that dietary nisin exerts a mode of action similar to salinomycin and could be considered as a dietary supplement for broiler chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2139779173,"Objectives Repellents do not kill mosquitoes - they simply reduce human-vector contact. Thus it is possible that individuals who do not use repellents but dwell close to repellent users experience more bites than otherwise. The objective of this study was to measure if diversion occurs from households that use repellents to those that do not use repellents. Methods The study was performed in three Tanzanian villages using 15%-DEET and placebo lotions. All households were given LLINs. Three coverage scenarios were investigated: complete coverage (all households were given 15%-DEET), incomplete coverage (80% of households were given 15%-DEET and 20% placebo) and no coverage (all households were given placebo). A crossover study design was used and coverage scenarios were rotated weekly over a period of ten weeks. The placebo lotion was randomly allocated to households in the incomplete coverage scenario. The level of compliance was reported to be close to 100%. Mosquito densities were measured through aspiration of resting mosquitoes. Data were analysed using negative binomial regression models. Findings Repellent-users had consistently fewer mosquitoes in their dwellings. In villages where everybody had been given 15%-DEET, resting mosquito densities were fewer than half that of households in the no coverage scenario (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR]=0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25-0.60); p<0.001). Placebo-users living in a village where 80% of the households used 15%-DEET were likely to have over four-times more mosquitoes (IRR=4.17; 95% CI: 3.08-5.65; p<0.001) resting in their dwellings in comparison to households in a village where nobody uses repellent. Conclusions There is evidence that high coverage of repellent use could significantly reduce man-vector contact but with incomplete coverage evidence suggests that mosquitoes are diverted from households that use repellent to those that do not. Therefore, if repellents are to be considered for vector control, strategies to maximise coverage are required."
https://openalex.org/W1973232711,"Objective Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) has beneficial effects on motor performance and motor learning in healthy subjects and is emerging as a promising tool for motor neurorehabilitation. Applying tDCS concurrently with a motor task has recently been found to be more effective than applying stimulation before the motor task. This study extends this finding to examine whether such task-concurrent stimulation further enhances motor learning on a dual M1 montage. Method Twenty healthy, right-handed subjects received anodal tDCS to the right M1, dual tDCS (anodal current over right M1 and cathodal over left M1) and sham tDCS in a repeated-measures design. Stimulation was applied for 10 mins at 1.5 mA during an explicit motor learning task. Response times (RT) and accuracy were measured at baseline, during, directly after and 15 mins after stimulation. Motor cortical excitability was recorded from both hemispheres before and after stimulation using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Results Task-concurrent stimulation with a dual M1 montage significantly reduced RTs by 23% as early as with the onset of stimulation (p<0.01) with this effect increasing to 30% at the final measurement. Polarity-specific changes in cortical excitability were observed with MEPs significantly reduced by 12% in the left M1 and increased by 69% in the right M1. Conclusion Performance improvement occurred earliest in the dual M1 condition with a stable and lasting effect. Unilateral anodal stimulation resulted only in trendwise improvement when compared to sham. Therefore, task-concurrent dual M1 stimulation is most suited for obtaining the desired neuromodulatory effects of tDCS in explicit motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2166596238,"The aim of this study was to demonstrate the existence of systematic associations in drug prescription that lead to the establishment of patterns of polypharmacy, and the clinical interpretation of the associations found in each pattern.A cross-sectional study was conducted based on information obtained from electronic medical records and the primary care pharmacy database in 2008. An exploratory factor analysis of drug dispensing information regarding 79,089 adult patients was performed to identify the patterns of polypharmacy. The analysis was stratified by age and sex.Seven patterns of polypharmacy were identified, which may be classified depending on the type of disease they are intended to treat: cardiovascular, depression-anxiety, acute respiratory infection (ARI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rhinitis-asthma, pain, and menopause. Some of these patterns revealed a clear clinical consistency and included drugs that are prescribed together for the same clinical indication (i.e., ARI and COPD patterns). Other patterns were more complex but also clinically consistent: in the cardiovascular pattern, drugs for the treatment of known risk factors-such as hypertension or dyslipidemia-were combined with other medications for the treatment of diabetes or established cardiovascular pathology (e.g., antiplatelet agents). Almost all of the patterns included drugs for preventing or treating potential side effects of other drugs in the same pattern.The present study demonstrated the existence of non-random associations in drug prescription, resulting in patterns of polypharmacy that are sound from the pharmacological and clinical viewpoints and that exist in a significant proportion of the population. This finding necessitates future longitudinal studies to confirm some of the proposed causal associations. The information discovered would further the development and/or adaptation of clinical patient guidelines to patients with multimorbidity who are taking multiple drugs."

However, host cells can control the intracellular M. tuberculosis burden by the induction of autophagy. The mechanism of autophagosome formation to M. tuberculosis has been well studied in macrophages, but remains unclear in dendritic cells. We therefore characterized autophagosome formation in response to M. tuberculosis infection in dendritic cells. Autophagy marker protein LC3, autophagy adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 (p62) and ubiquitin co-localized to M. tuberculosis in dendritic cells. Mycobacterial autophagosomes fused with lysosomes during infection, and major histcompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC II) also localized to mycobacterial autophagosomes. The proteins p62 and Atg5 function in the initiation and progression of autophagosome formation to M. tuberculosis, respectively; p62 mediates ubiquitination of M. tuberculosis and Atg5 is involved in the trafficking of degradative vesicles and MHC II to mycobacterial autophagosomes. These results imply that the autophagosome formation to M. tuberculosis in dendritic cells promotes the antigen presentation of mycobacterial peptides to CD4(+) T lymphocytes via MHC II."

M. tuberculosis expresses alkyl hydroxyperoxide reductase E (AhpE), among other peroxiredoxins. So far the system that reduces AhpE was not known. We identified M. tuberculosis mycoredoxin-1 (MtMrx1) acting in combination with mycothiol and mycothiol disulfide reductase (MR), as a biologically relevant reducing system for MtAhpE. MtMrx1, a glutaredoxin-like, mycothiol-dependent oxidoreductase, directly reduces the oxidized form of MtAhpE, through a protein mixed disulfide with the N-terminal cysteine of MtMrx1 and the sulfenic acid derivative of the peroxidatic cysteine of MtAhpE. This disulfide is then reduced by the C-terminal cysteine in MtMrx1. Accordingly, MtAhpE catalyzes the oxidation of wt MtMrx1 by hydrogen peroxide but not of MtMrx1 lacking the C-terminal cysteine, confirming a dithiolic mechanism. Alternatively, oxidized MtAhpE forms a mixed disulfide with mycothiol, which in turn is reduced by MtMrx1 using a monothiolic mechanism. We demonstrated the H2O2-dependent NADPH oxidation catalyzed by MtAhpE in the presence of MR, Mrx1, and mycothiol. Disulfide formation involving mycothiol probably competes with the direct reduction by MtMrx1 in aqueous intracellular media, where mycothiol is present at millimolar concentrations. However, MtAhpE was found to be associated with the membrane fraction, and since mycothiol is hydrophilic, direct reduction by MtMrx1 might be favored.

Among them, mycoredoxin 1 (MtMrx1 EC 1.20.4.3) has recently been described as a 10-kDa protein with a CGYC catalytic motif that accepts electrons from MSH and reduces MSH-containing mixed disulfides by a monothiolic mechanism (7.Van Laer K.

More recently, twenty-five proteins of C. glutamicum including thiol peroxidase (TPx) were found mycothiolated under hypochloric stress conditions (17.Chi B.K. Busche T. Laer K.V. Basell K. Becher D.

The S-mycothiolation of Tpx inhibits its peroxidase activity, but could be restored after treatment with CgMrx1. So far no MtMrx1-dependent protein reduction has been described in Mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis expresses a heme-dependent peroxidase (catalase peroxidase, KatG, EC 1.11.1.6) and several thiol-dependent peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin (Prx, EC 1.11.1.15) type, including alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C, TPx, two bacterioferritin comigratory proteins (Bcp andBcpB) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase E (MtAhpE) (13.Jaeger T.

As a one-cysteine peroxidase, MtAhpE lacks a resolving cysteine. However, the structure and sequence of MtAhpE show greater similarity with two-cysteine Prxs than with other one-cysteine Prxs, and is considered as the prototype of a novel Prx subfamily (19.Soito L.

We have previously investigated the peroxidase activity of MtAhpE, the only Prx of the AhpE subfamily to be functionally characterized. It is a broad-spectrum peroxidase with higher catalytic efficiency for fatty acid hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite than for H2O2. Upon reaction with the peroxide substrate (ROOH), the thiolate form of the peroxidatic cysteine (CP) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid (22.Hugo M. Turell L. Manta B. Botti H. Monteiro G. Netto L.E.

However, the physiological reducing substrate(s) for this enzyme (as well as for AhpE-like Prxs from several other bacteria) is/are still unknown.

Herein, we report that MtMrx1 and MtMrx1 in combination with mycothiol acts as a reducing substrate for MtAhpE. Our data not only constitute the first report for biologically relevant routes of reduction for an AhpE-like Prx, but also describe the first acceptor for the electrons provided by a mycoredoxin in Mycobacteria. We also propose a functional link between the mycothiol/mycoredoxin-1 pathway and the bacterial peroxide detoxification systems, which helps to rationalize the increased peroxide-dependent cytotoxicity in Mycobacteria with a reduced MSH content (9.Rawat M.

The CgMR preparation was more robust and active compared with MtMR, and therefore it was preferentially utilized. MtAhpE was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (expression vector pDEST17) as a recombinant His-tagged protein and purified as previously described (22.Hugo M. Turell L. Manta B. Botti H.

The enzyme was stored at −80 °C under argon atmosphere. Wild type MtMrx1 (MtMrx1wt) and a mutant form at the second cysteine residue (MtMrx1CXXA) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star and purified as previously described (15.Van Laer K. Buts L.

Following the immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography step, MtMrx1CXXA was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 column in 100 mm phosphate buffer, 0.1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4. Both MtMrx1wt and MtMrx1CXXA were stored at −20 °C in the presence of 5 mm DTT. Excess reductant was removed by gel filtration using a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Bioscience) with UV-vis detection at 280 nm immediately before use. MtAhpE was reduced before use by incubation with 1 mm DTT for 30 min at 4 °C. Excess reductant was removed from all proteins immediately before use by gel filtration as above indicated. The concentration of H2O2 stock solutions was measured at 240 nm (λ240 = 43.6 m−1cm−1) (24.Hildebraundt A.G. Roots I.

MtAhpE, MtMrx1wt, and MtMrx1CXXA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using molar absorption coefficients of 23,950 (22.Hugo M. Turell L. Manta B. Botti H. Monteiro G.

Protein thiol content was measured by Ellman's assay (λ412 = 14,150 m−1cm−1) (26.Ellman G.L. Tissue sulfhydryl groups.Arch. Biochem.

Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing reduced and/or oxidized MtAhpE in the presence or absence of MSH, MtMrx1wt, or MtMrx1CXXA at indicated concentrations were precipitated by addition of 10 μl of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (10% (w/v)) and kept on ice for 30 min. Protein precipitates were pelleted, washed with 100 μl of ice-cold acetone, dried at 37 °C, resuspended in 15 μl of 3 mm PEG-maleimide (in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) and incubated at 45 °C for 45 min. Samples were immediately loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE in the absence of β-ME, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein samples were diluted to ∼5 μm in 50% acetonitrile 0.1% acetic acid and intact protein mass measurements were performed by direct infusion in a microelectrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ XL, ThermoFisher Scientific, San José, CA). The mass spectrometer was operated manually in positive ion mode with a source voltage set at 3.8 kV and the ion transfer tube at 220 °C The parent ions were submitted to in-source dissociation (SID) using the minimal energy to promote efficient declustering of water molecules and salts adducts. The mass spectra were deconvoluted using the software ProMass Deconvolution from ThermoFisher Scientific. For the identification of MtAhpE-MtMrx1CXXA mixed disulfide, the expected corresponding band was in-gel digested with sequencing grade trypsin (0.5 μg) overnight at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described (28.Pyr Dit Ruys S. Wang X. Smith E.M. Herinckx G. Hussain N. Rider M.H. Vertommen D. Proud C.G. Identification of autophosphorylation sites in eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase.Biochem. J. 2012; 442: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent-mode and switched automatically between MS, Zoom Scan for charge state determination and MS/MS for the most abundant ion. Each MS scan was followed by a maximum of five MS/MS using collision energy of 35%. Dynamic exclusion was enabled to allow analysis of co-eluting peptides. For peptide identification peak lists were generated using the application spectrum selector in the Proteome Discoverer 1.3 package. The resulting peak lists were searched using Sequest against a homemade protein database containing the MtMrx1 and MtAhpE sequences (Uniprot Q8VJ51 and Q73YJ5). The following parameters were used: trypsin was selected with cleavage only after lysine and arginine; the number of internal cleavage sites was set to 1; the mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 1.1 Da and 1.0 Da, respectively; and the considered dynamic modifications were +15.99 Da for oxidized methionine and +71.0 Da for acrylamide addition to cysteine. Peptide matches were filtered using charge-state versus cross-correlation scores (Xcorr). The mixed disulfide peptide between MtMrx1 and MtAhpE was identified by the use of DBond software (29.Choi S. Jeong J. Na S. Lee H.S. Kim H.Y. Lee K.J. Paek E. New algorithm for the identification of intact disulfide linkages based on fragmentation characteristics in tandem mass spectra.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and manually validated. The kinetics of oxidized MtAhpE reaction with mycothiol to form the mixed disulfide described above was determined by a competition approach, following MtAhpE overoxidation to sulfinic acid by excess H2O2 in the absence and presence of mycothiol, which does not compete for initial oxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine due to the high rate constant of the latter enzyme. Overoxidation was measured following the accompanying intrinsic fluorescence increase, using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrophotometer as previously (22.Hugo M. Turell L. Manta B.

Turell L. Manta B. Botti H. Monteiro G. Netto L.E. Alvarez B. Radi R. Trujillo M.

Observed rate constants of fluorescence increase (kobs) were determined by fitting experimental data to single exponentials. In the presence of mycothiol, in Equation 4,kobs=k1×[H2O2]+k2[MSH](Eq. 4) where k2 is the second order rate constant for the reaction between oxidized MtAhpE and reduced mycothiol. k2 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C was obtained from the slope of kobs versus MSH concentration, and the offset corresponds to k1 × [H2O2]. Reaction mixtures containing reduced MtAhpE (20 μm) were treated with mycothiol disulfide (MSSM, 20 μm) or oxidized with an equimolar concentration of H2O2. Immediately after oxidation, reduced MSH was added to reach a final concentration of 20 μm and incubated for 30 min to form MtAhpE-SS-M. Time of incubation was selected to allow ≥90% mixed disulfide formation as calculated using Gepasy 3 software (30.Mendes P. GEPASI: a software package for modelling the dynamics, steady states and control of biochemical and other systems.Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar) and the rate constant of the reaction reported below. Then, MtMrx1 wt was added to one of the MtAhpE-SS-M containing samples (20 μm Mrx1 and 10 μm MtAhpE-SS-M final concentrations). After 15 min, samples were precipitated with TCA and analyzed by alkylation with PEG-maleimide. Oxidized MtAhpE was prepared by incubation of reduced MtAhpE (17 μm) with an equimolar concentration of H2O2 for 1 min immediately after the oxidation step, reduced MtMrx1 was added to reach a final concentration of 16 μm MtMrx1 and 10 μm MtAhpE. Aliquots (90 μl) were taken at different times of incubation (0.2, 0.5,"

https://openalex.org/W1995645104,"Production of antimicrobial peptides in plants constitutes an approach for obtaining them in high amounts. However, their heterologous expression in a practical and efficient manner demands some structural requirements such as a minimum size, the incorporation of retention signals to assure their accumulation in specific tissues, and the presence of protease cleavage amino acids and of target sequences to facilitate peptide detection. Since any sequence modification may influence the biological activity, peptides that will be obtained from the expression must be screened prior to the synthesis of the genes for plant transformation. We report herein a strategy for the modification of the antimicrobial undecapeptide BP100 that allowed the identification of analogues that can be expressed in plants and exhibit optimum biological properties. We prepared 40 analogues obtained by incorporating repeated units of the antimicrobial undecapeptide, fragments of natural peptides, one or two AGPA hinges, a Gly or Ser residue at the N-terminus, and a KDEL fragment and/or the epitope tag54 at the C-terminus. Their antimicrobial, hemolytic and phytotoxic activities, and protease susceptibility were evaluated. Best sequences contained a magainin fragment linked to the antimicrobial undecapeptide through an AGPA hinge. Moreover, since the presence of a KDEL unit or of tag54 did not influence significantly the biological activity, these moieties can be introduced when designing compounds to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and detected using a complementary epitope. These findings may contribute to the design of peptides to be expressed in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2081909639,"Adaptive, context-dependent control of locomotion requires modulation of centrally generated rhythmic motor patterns through peripheral control loops and postural reflexes. Thus assuming that the modulation of rhythmic motor patterns accounts for much of the behavioural variability observed in legged locomotion, investigating behavioural variability is a key to the understanding of context-dependent control mechanisms in locomotion. To date, the variability of unrestrained locomotion is poorly understood, and virtually nothing is known about the features that characterise the natural statistics of legged locomotion. In this study, we quantify the natural variability of hexapedal walking and climbing in insects, drawing from a database of several thousand steps recorded over two hours of walking time.We show that the range of step length used by unrestrained climbing stick insects is large, showing that step length can be changed substantially for adaptive locomotion. Step length distributions were always bimodal, irrespective of leg type and walking condition, suggesting the presence of two distinct classes of steps: short and long steps. Probability density of step length was well-described by a gamma distribution for short steps, and a logistic distribution for long steps. Major coefficients of these distributions remained largely unaffected by walking conditions. Short and long steps differed concerning their spatial occurrence on the walking substrate, their timing within the step sequence, and their prevalent swing direction. Finally, ablation of structures that serve to improve foothold increased the ratio of short to long steps, indicating a corrective function of short steps.Statistical and functional differences suggest that short and long steps are physiologically distinct classes of leg movements that likely reflect distinct control mechanisms at work."
https://openalex.org/W2023510440,"N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation have been suggested to play a role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Although chemicals have been shown to be a risk factor contributing to the carcinogenesis of NPC, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We demonstrated recently that N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) enhances the genomic instability and tumorigenicity of NPC cells via induction of EBV reactivation. However, the mechanisms that trigger EBV reactivation from latency remain unclear. Here, we address the role of ROS in induction of EBV reactivation under MNNG treatment. EBV reactivation was induced in over 70% of EBV-positive NA cells and the promoter of Rta (Rp) was activated after MNNG treatment. Inhibitor experiments revealed ATM, p38 MAPK and JNK were activated by ROS and involved in MNNG-induced EBV reactivation. Significantly, ROS scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), catalase and reduced glutathione inhibited EBV reactivation under MNNG and H₂O₂ treatment, suggesting ROS mediate EBV reactivation. The p53 was essential for EBV reactivation and the Rp activation by MNNG. Moreover, the p53 was phosphorylated, translocated into nucleus, and bound to Rp following ROS stimulation. The results suggest ROS play an important role in initiation of EBV reactivation by MNNG through a p53-dependent mechanism. Our findings demonstrate novel signaling mechanisms used by NOCs to induce EBV reactivation and provide a novel insight into NOCs link the EBV reactivation in the contribution to the development of NPC. Notably, this study indicates that antioxidants might be effective for inhibiting N-nitroso compound-induced EBV reactivation and therefore could be promising preventive and therapeutic agents for EBV reactivation-associated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2085764445,"Linkage of risk-factor data for blood-stream infection (BSI) in paediatric intensive care (PICU) with bacteraemia surveillance data to monitor risk-adjusted infection rates in PICU is complicated by a lack of unique identifiers and under-ascertainment in the national surveillance system. We linked, evaluated and performed preliminary analyses on these data to provide a practical guide on the steps required to handle linkage of such complex data sources.Data on PICU admissions in England and Wales for 2003-2010 were extracted from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network. Records of all positive isolates from blood cultures taken for children <16 years and captured by the national voluntary laboratory surveillance system for 2003-2010 were extracted from the Public Health England database, LabBase2. ""Gold-standard"" datasets with unique identifiers were obtained directly from three laboratories, containing microbiology reports that were eligible for submission to LabBase2 (defined as ""clinically significant"" by laboratory microbiologists). Reports in the gold-standard datasets were compared to those in LabBase2 to estimate ascertainment in LabBase2. Linkage evaluated by comparing results from two classification methods (highest-weight classification of match weights and prior-informed imputation using match probabilities) with linked records in the gold-standard data. BSI rate was estimated as the proportion of admissions associated with at least one BSI.Reporting gaps were identified in 548/2596 lab-months of LabBase2. Ascertainment of clinically significant BSI in the remaining months was approximately 80-95%. Prior-informed imputation provided the least biased estimate of BSI rate (5.8% of admissions). Adjusting for ascertainment, the estimated BSI rate was 6.1-7.3%.Linkage of PICU admission data with national BSI surveillance provides the opportunity for enhanced surveillance but analyses based on these data need to take account of biases due to ascertainment and linkage error. This study provides a generalisable guide for linkage, evaluation and analysis of complex electronic healthcare data."
https://openalex.org/W1973443738,"Genetically modified hematopoietic progenitors represent an important testing platform for a variety of cell-based therapies, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and other applications. Stable expression of a transfected gene of interest in the cells is often obstructed by its silencing. DNA transposons offer an attractive non-viral alternative of transgene integration into the host genome, but their broad applicability to leukocytes and other ""transgene unfriendly"" cells has not been fully demonstrated. Here we assess stability of piggyBac transposon-based reporter expression in murine prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C2, human monocyte THP-1 and erythroleukemia K562 cell lines, along with macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that have differentiated from the THP-1 transfects. The most efficient and stable reporter activity was observed for combinations of the transposon inverted terminal repeats and one 5'- or two cHS4 core insulators flanking a green fluorescent protein reporter construct, with no detectable silencing over 10 months of continuous cell culture in absence of any selective pressure. In monocytic THP-1 cells, the functional activity of luciferase reporters for NF-κB, Nrf2, or HIF-1α has not decreased over time and was retained following differentiation into macrophages and DCs, as well. These results imply pB as a versatile tool for gene integration in monocytic cells in general, and as a convenient access route to DC-based signaling pathway reporters suitable for high-throughput assays, in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2038683394,"Non-human primate populations, other than responding appropriately to naturally occurring challenges, also need to cope with anthropogenic factors such as environmental pollution, resource depletion, and habitat destruction. Populations and individuals are likely to show considerable variations in food extraction abilities, with some populations and individuals more efficient than others at exploiting a set of resources. In this study, we examined among urban free-ranging bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata (a) local differences in food extraction abilities, (b) between-individual variation and within-individual consistency in problem-solving success and the underlying problem-solving characteristics, and (c) behavioral patterns associated with higher efficiency in food extraction. When presented with novel food extraction tasks, the urban macaques having more frequent exposure to novel physical objects in their surroundings, extracted food material from PET bottles and also solved another food extraction task (i.e., extracting an orange from a wire mesh box), more often than those living under more natural conditions. Adults solved the tasks more frequently than juveniles, and females more frequently than males. Both solution-technique and problem-solving characteristics varied across individuals but remained consistent within each individual across the successive presentations of PET bottles. The macaques that solved the tasks showed lesser within-individual variation in their food extraction behavior as compared to those that failed to solve the tasks. A few macaques appropriately modified their problem-solving behavior in accordance with the task requirements and solved the modified versions of the tasks without trial-and-error learning. These observations are ecologically relevant – they demonstrate considerable local differences in food extraction abilities, between-individual variation and within-individual consistency in food extraction techniques among free-ranging bonnet macaques, possibly affecting the species’ local adaptability and resilience to environmental changes."

Colonies were pale yellow, rough surface with uneven edges on TSA after 72 h incubation. Heterotrophic growth was observed at 40-60°C and pH 5.5-11.5; optimum growth occurred at 55°C and pH 7.5. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed the strains belong to genus Anoxybacillus. DNA-DNA homology values among strains were above 70% and showed distinct ERIC and REP PCR profile. On the basis of morphology and biochemical characteristics, strain JS1(T) was studied further. Strain JS1(T) showed 99.30% sequence similarity with A. flavithermus subsp. yunnanensis, 99.23% with A. mongoliensis, 99.16% with A. eryuanensis, 98.74% with A. flavithermus subsp. flavithermus, 98.54% with A. tengchongensis, 98.51% with A. pushchinoensis, 97.91% with A. thermarum, 97.82% with A. kaynarcensis, 97.77% with A. ayderensis and A. kamchatkensis, 97.63% with A. salavatliensis, 97.55% with A. kestanbolensis, 97.48% with A. contaminans, 97.27% with A. gonensis and 97.17% with A. voinovskiensis. In 16S rRNA secondary structure based phylogenetic comparison, strain JS1(T) was clustered with Anoxybacillus eryuanensis, A. mongoliensis, and A. flavithermus subsp. yunnanensis and showed 15 species specific base substitutions with maximum variability in helix 6. Moreover, DNA-DNA relatedness between JS1(T) and the closely related type strains were well below 70%. The DNA G+C content was 42.1 mol%. The major fatty acids were C(15:0 iso), C(16:0 iso) and C(17:0iso). The polar lipids were a phosphatidylgylycerol, a diphosphatidylglycerol, a phosphatidylethnolamine, a phosphatidylcholine, a phosphatidyl monomethylethanolamine and four unknown lipids. Based on polyphasic approach, strain JS1(T) represent a novel species of the genus Anoxybacillus for which Anoxybacillus suryakundensis sp. nov. is proposed.

https://openalex.org/W2072979461,"Background The objective of this study was to examine the effects of short (2 h) and prolonged (18 h) inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) on palmitate (PA) induced insulin resistance in L6 myotubes. Methods L6 myotubes were treated simultaneously with either PA and myriocin (SPT inhibitor) or PA and Ski II (SphK1inhibitor) for different time periods (2 h and 18 h). Insulin stimulated glucose uptake was measured using radioactive isotope. Expression of insulin signaling proteins was determined using Western blot analyses. Intracellular sphingolipids content [sphinganine (SFA), ceramide (CER), sphingosine (SFO), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)] were estimated by HPLC. Results Our results revealed that both short and prolonged time of inhibition of SPT by myriocin was sufficient to prevent ceramide accumulation and simultaneously reverse palmitate induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. In contrast, prolonged inhibition of SphK1 intensified the effect of PA on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and attenuated further the activity of insulin signaling proteins (pGSK3β/GSK3β ratio) in L6 myotubes. These effects were related to the accumulation of sphingosine in palmitate treated myotubes. Conclusion Myriocin is more effective in restoration of palmitate induced insulin resistance in L6 myocytes, despite of the time of SPT inhibition, comparing to SKII (a specific SphK1 inhibitor). Observed changes in insulin signaling proteins were related to the content of specific sphingolipids, namely to the reduction of ceramide. Interestingly, inactivation of SphK1 augmented the effect of PA induced insulin resistance in L6 myotubes, which was associated with further inhibition of insulin stimulated PKB and GSK3β phosphorylation, glucose uptake and the accumulation of sphingosine."
https://openalex.org/W2141018171,"Genomic integrity is preserved by checkpoints, which act to delay cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage or replication stress. The heterotrimeric Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex is a PCNA-like clamp that is loaded onto DNA at structures resulting from damage and is important for initiating and maintaining the checkpoint response. Rad9 possesses a C-terminal tail that is phosphorylated constitutively and in response to cell cycle position and DNA damage. Previous studies have identified tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) as a kinase that may modify Rad9. Here we show that Rad9 is phosphorylated in a TLK-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo, and that T355 within the C-terminal tail is the primary targeted residue. Phosphorylation of Rad9 at T355 is quickly reduced upon exposure to ionizing radiation before returning to baseline later in the damage response. We also show that TLK1 and Rad9 interact constitutively, and that this interaction is enhanced in chromatin-bound Rad9 at later stages of the damage response. Furthermore, we demonstrate via siRNA-mediated depletion that TLK1 is required for progression through S-phase in normally cycling cells, and that cells lacking TLK1 display a prolonged G2/M arrest upon exposure to ionizing radiation, a phenotype that is mimicked by over-expression of a Rad9-T355A mutant. Given that TLK1 has previously been shown to be transiently inactivated upon phosphorylation by Chk1 in response to DNA damage, we propose that TLK1 and Chk1 act in concert to modulate the phosphorylation status of Rad9, which in turn serves to regulate the DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2054219015,"Background Point of Care testing (POCT) provides on-site, rapid, accessible results. With current South African anti-retroviral treatment guidelines, up to 4 fingersticks /patient/clinic visit could be required if utilizing POC. We determined the feasibility and accuracy of a nurse performing multiple POCT on multiple fingersticks followed by simplification of the process by performance of multiple POC on a single fingerstick. Method and Findings Random HIV positive adult patients presenting at a HIV treatment clinic in South Africa, for ART initiation/ monitoring, were approached to participate in the study between April-June 2012. Phase I: n=150 patients approached for multiple POCT on multiple fingersticks. Phase II: n=150 patients approached for multiple POCT on a single fingerstick. The following POC tests were performed by a dedicated nurse: PIMA (CD4), HemoCue (hemoglobin), Reflotron (alanine aminotransferase, creatinine). A venepuncture specimen was taken for predicate laboratory methodology. Normal laboratory ranges and Royal College of Pathologists Australasia (RCPA) allowable differences were used as guidelines for comparison. In 67% of participants, ≥3 tests were requested per visit. All POCT were accurate but ranged in variability. Phase I: Hemoglobin was accurate (3.2%CV) while CD4, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine showed increased variability (16.3%CV; 9.3%CV; 12.9%CV respectively). PIMA generated a misclassification of 12.4%. Phase II: Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine showed good accuracy (3.2%CV, 8.7%CV, 6.4%CV respectively) with increased variability on CD4 (12.4%CV) but low clinical misclassification (4.1%). No trends were observed for the sequence in which POC was performed on a single fingerstick. Overall, PIMA CD4 generated the highest error rate (16-19%). Conclusions Multiple POCT for ART initiation and/or monitoring can be performed practically by a dedicated nurse on multiple fingersticks. The process is as accurate as predicate methodology and can be simplified using a single fingerstick."
https://openalex.org/W1992492089,"To trace the fate of individual pollen grains through pollination processes, we determined genotypes of single pollen grains deposited on Hemerocallis stigmas in an experimental mixed-species array. Hemerocallis fulva, pollinated by butterflies, has diurnal, reddish and unscented flowers, and H. citrina, pollinated by hawkmoths, has nocturnal, yellowish and sweet scent flowers. We observed pollinator visits to an experimental array of 24 H. fulva and 12 F2 hybrids between the two species (H. fulva and H. citrina) and collected stigmas after every trip bout of swallowtail butterflies or hawkmoths. We then measured selection by swallowtail butterflies or hawkmoths through male and female components of pollination success as determined by single pollen genotyping. As expected, swallowtail butterflies imposed selection on reddish color and weak scent: the number of outcross pollen grains acquired is a quadratic function of flower color with the maximum at reddish color, and the combined pollination success was maximal at weak scent (almost unrecognizable for human). This explains why H. fulva, with reddish flowers and no recognizable scent, is mainly pollinated by swallowtail butterflies. However, we found no evidence of hawkmoths-mediated selection on flower color or scent. Our findings do not support a hypothesis that yellow flower color and strong scent intensity, the distinctive floral characteristics of H. citrina, having evolved in adaptations to hawkmoths. We suggest that the key trait that triggers the evolution of nocturnal flowers is flowering time rather than flower color and scent."

Our previous studies indicated that RBBP1 possesses a Tudor domain, which cannot bind histone marks. In order to clarify the function of the Tudor domain, the solution structure of the RBBP1 Tudor domain was determined by NMR and is presented here. Although the proteins are unrelated, the RBBP1 Tudor domain forms an interdigitated double Tudor structure similar to the Tudor domain of JMJD2A, which is an epigenetic mark reader. This indicates the functional diversity of Tudor domains. The RBBP1 Tudor domain structure has a significant area of positively charged surface, which reveals a capability of the RBBP1 Tudor domain to bind nucleic acids. NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicate that the RBBP1 Tudor domain binds both double- and single-stranded DNA with an affinity of 10–100 μm; no apparent DNA sequence specificity was detected. The DNA binding mode and key interaction residues were analyzed in detail based on a model structure of the Tudor domain-dsDNA complex, built by HADDOCK docking using the NMR data. Electrostatic interactions mediate the binding of the Tudor domain with DNA, which is consistent with NMR experiments performed at high salt concentration. The DNA-binding residues are conserved in Tudor domains of the RBBP1 protein family, resulting in conservation of the DNA-binding function in the RBBP1 Tudor domains.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An interdigitated double Tudor domain was found in the three Jmjc domain-containing histone demethylases (JMJD2A/2B/2C), in which two β strands at the N terminus and two β strands at the C terminus form a hybrid Tudor domain (HTD-1), and the middle four β strands form another Tudor domain (HTD-2) (25.Huang Y. Fang J. Bedford M.T. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Recognition of histone H3 lysine-4 methylation by the double tudor domain of JMJD2A.Science. 2006; 312: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This interdigitated double Tudor domain specifically binds with trimethylated histone H3 Lys4 by a conserved aromatic box in HTD-2. Our previous studies indicated that the RBBP1 Tudor domain has low sequence homology to other known Tudor domains and cannot recognize epigenetic marks (13.Gong W. Zhou T. Mo J. Perrett S. Wang J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 8531-8540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to further understand the function of the RBBP1 Tudor domain, we have now determined its solution structure, which shows an interdigitated double Tudor fold similar to the epigenetic mark reader JMJD2A. Structural analysis reveals that the RBBP1 Tudor domain does not contain an aromatic cage to recognize an epigenetic mark. However, a positive electrostatic surface on the Tudor domain suggests that the RBBP1 Tudor domain has the capability of binding to nucleic acids. NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments demonstrated that the RBBP1 Tudor domain can bind to both dsDNA and ssDNA with an apparent KD of 10–100 μm; no sequence specificity was detected. The DNA-binding mode of the RBBP1 Tudor domain was analyzed by docking and modeling and was compared with other Tudor domains. Our data indicate diversity in the structures and functions of Tudor domains. The detailed analysis suggests that the Tudor, chromobarrel, and ARID domains of RBBP1 may act cooperatively to play roles in chromatin recognition. The RBBP1 Tudor domain was expressed and purified as reported previously (13.Gong W. Zhou T. Mo J. Perrett S. Wang J. Feng Y.

All NMR experiments were performed at 293 K on Bruker DMX, AVANCE 600-MHz, or Agilent DD2 600-MHz spectrometers, each of which was equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe. NMR samples of the RBBP1 Tudor domain contained 0.2–0.6 mm protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonate in 10% (v/v) D2O.

The three-dimensional 1H-15N and 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra with mixing times of 120 ms were collected to generate distance restraints. All data were processed with NMRPipe (27.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S.

The longitudinal relaxation rates (R1), transverse relaxation rates (R2), and steady-state heteronuclear {1H}15N NOE values of the RBBP1 Tudor domain were measured using standard pulse programs (30.Farrow N.A.

Double-stranded DNA was made by annealing equimolar amounts of the two synthesized single-stranded DNA (1:1 molar ratio), which were dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 50 mm NaCl, heated to 94 °C for 3 min, and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The ssDNAs and dsDNAs were further purified by gel filtration and then concentrated.

For consistency, n was fixed as 3 in the fitting of 12-bp DNA titration curves and as 5 in the fitting of 18-bp DNA titration curves. Open table in a new tab Interaction of the RBBP1 Tudor domain with DNA was monitored by recording a series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of proteins at each DNA titration point. The observed chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of the protein resonances were calculated using the equation,CSP=(δHN)2+(δN6)2(Eq. 1) where δHN and δN are the changes of 1HN and 15N chemical shifts, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of protein with DNA were estimated by fitting the CSPs to the equation,CSP=CSPmax2((1+n×r+n×KD(1Cpro+rClig))−n×(1/n+r+KD(1Cpro+rClig)2−4r/n)(Eq. 2) where CSPmax is the CSP value at the theoretical saturated condition obtained from the titration curve fitting; r is the molar ratio of DNA to protein; Cpro is the concentration of initial protein solution; Clig is the stock concentration of DNA; and n is the number of equivalent and independent binding sites on the DNA. Fitting of the titration curves suggested that the 12-bp DNAs can accommodate simultaneously at least two RBBP1 Tudor domain molecules. When n was floating, a value of 3–5 was obtained for 12-bp DNAs and 5–9 for 18-bp DNAs. The physical meaning of the obtained value of n is complicated because it could also account for any uncertainty in DNA and protein concentrations that were fixed in fitting. To be consistent, n was fixed as 3 in the fitting of 12-bp DNA titration curves and as 5 in the fitting of 18-bp DNA titration curves. ITC measurements were performed at 21 °C on an iTC-200 calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.). The titrations were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 50 mm NaCl. The reactant (0.3 mm Tudor domain) was placed in the 200-μl sample cell. dsDNA2 solutions in an injection syringe (1 mm) were injected into Tudor domain solutions in the cell. The volume of each injection was 2 μl except that the first injection was 0.4 μl. A titration experiment consisted of 20 consecutive injections of 4-s duration, with a 120-s interval between injections. The experiments for Tudor domain-ssAT and Tudor domain-dsAT with 0.1 mm Tudor domain and 1 mm ssAT or 1 mm dsAT used the same parameters. Control experiments were performed under identical conditions to determine the heat signals that arise from the addition of DNA into the buffer. The resulting data were fitted with a multiple-site binding model using the Origin software package (MicroCal, Inc.). Modeling of the RBBP1 Tudor domain-DNA complex was performed on the HADDOCK Web server (42.de Vries S.J. van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. The HADDOCK web server for data-driven biomolecular docking.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The starting structural coordinate files for HADDOCK were generated from the 20 solution structures of the RBBP1 Tudor domain and a 12-bp B form DNA duplex built using 3D-dart (43.van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. 3D-DART. A DNA structure modelling server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W235-W239Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For HADDOCK calculations, active residues for the RBBP1 Tudor domain were defined as those having weighted CSPs larger than 0.5 ppm, which are residues at sequence positions 8–115 of the RBBP1 Tudor domain. Residues 4–7 and 116–121 of the RBBP1 Tudor domain, which contain several negatively charged residues, are flexible in the structure and showed smaller CSP values during NMR titration. They were deleted in the docking because they are not important for DNA binding and their flexibility could lead to steric hindrance during the docking process. Passive residues were automatically defined around the active residues by HADDOCK. The active r"
https://openalex.org/W2006705691,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an important signaling regulator that assembles into the heteroternary complex with adaptor proteins PINCH and parvin (termed the IPP complex). We recently reported that ILK is important for integrin activation in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell system. We previously established parental CHO cells expressing a constitutively active chimeric integrin (αIIbα6Bβ3) and mutant CHO cells expressing inactive αIIbα6Bβ3 due to ILK deficiency. In this study, we further investigated the underlying mechanisms for ILK-dependent integrin activation. ILK-deficient mutant cells had trace levels of PINCH and α-parvin, and transfection of ILK cDNA into the mutant cells increased not only ILK but also PINCH and α-parvin, resulting in the restoration of αIIbα6Bβ3 activation. In the parental cells expressing active αIIbα6Bβ3, ILK, PINCH, and α-parvin were co-immunoprecipitated, indicating the formation of the IPP complex. Moreover, short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments targeting PINCH-1 or both α- and β-parvin mRNA in the parent cells impaired the αIIbα6Bβ3 activation as well as the expression of the other components of the IPP complex. In addition, ILK mutants possessing defects in either PINCH or parvin binding failed to restore αIIbα6Bβ3 activation in the mutant cells. Kindlin-2 siRNA in the parental cells impaired αIIbα6Bβ3 activation without disturbing the expression of ILK. For CHO cells stably expressing wild-type αIIbβ3 that is an inactive form, overexpression of a talin head domain (THD) induced αIIbβ3 activation and the THD-induced αIIbβ3 activation was impaired by ILK siRNA through a significant reduction in the expression of the IPP complex. In contrast, overexpression of all IPP components in the αIIbβ3-expressing CHO cells further augmented THD-induced αIIbβ3 activation, whereas they did not induce αIIbβ3 activation without THD. These data suggest that the IPP complex rather than ILK plays an important role and supports integrin activation probably through stabilization of the active conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2083179406,"Marine mammal Brucella spp. have been isolated from pinnipeds (B. pinnipedialis) and cetaceans (B. ceti) from around the world. Although the zoonotic potential of marine mammal brucellae is largely unknown, reports of human disease exist. There are few studies of the mechanisms of bacterial intracellular invasion and multiplication involving the marine mammal Brucella spp. We examined the infective capacity of two genetically different B. pinnipedialis strains (reference strain; NTCT 12890 and a hooded seal isolate; B17) by measuring the ability of the bacteria to enter and replicate in cultured phagocytes and epithelial cells. Human macrophage-like cells (THP-1), two murine macrophage cell lines (RAW264.7 and J774A.1), and a human malignant epithelial cell line (HeLa S3) were challenged with bacteria in a gentamicin protection assay. Our results show that B. pinnipedialis is internalized, but is then gradually eliminated during the next 72-96 hours. Confocal microscopy revealed that intracellular B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain colocalized with lysosomal compartments at 1.5 and 24 hours after infection. Intracellular presence of B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain was verified by transmission electron microscopy. By using a cholesterol-scavenging lipid inhibitor, entrance of B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain in human macrophages was significantly reduced by 65.8 % (± 17.3), suggesting involvement of lipid-rafts in intracellular entry. Murine macrophages invaded by B. pinnipedialis do not release nitric oxide (NO) and intracellular bacterial presence does not induce cell death. In summary, B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain can enter human and murine macrophages, as well as human epithelial cells. Intracellular entry of B. pinnipedialis hooded seal strain involves, but seems not to be limited to, lipid-rafts in human macrophages. Brucella pinnipedialis does not multiply or survive for prolonged periods intracellulary."

The best-performing mutant, Z3-86, was obtained after three rounds of WGS, producing 4.4% more ethanol and retaining 2.15-fold higher viability than ZTW1 after drying. Proteomics and physiological analyses indicated that the altered expression patterns of genes involved in protein metabolism, plasma membrane composition, trehalose metabolism, and oxidative responses contribute to the trait improvement of Z3-86. This work not only successfully developed a novel S. cerevisiae mutant for application in commercial bioethanol production, but also enriched the current understanding of how WGS improves the complex traits of microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2117655211,"Prey animals often have to trade off foraging against vigilance. However, vigilance is costly and individuals are expected to adjust their vigilance and its cost in relation to social cues and their predation risk. To test this, we conducted playback experiments in the field to study how lions' (Panthera leo) roars and male impalas' (Aepyceros melampus) territorial vocalizations affected the vigilance and foraging behaviours as well as movements of female impalas. Our results show that impalas adjusted their activities in different ways depending on the vocalizations broadcast. After lions' roars were played, female impalas increased their vigilance activity (in particular increasing their high-cost vigilance--vigilance without chewing), decreased their bite rates and increased their movements, whereas male impalas' vocalizations caused females to decrease their vigilance (decreasing their low-cost vigilance--vigilance while chewing) and increase their movements without affecting their bite rates. Therefore, it appears that predators' vocalizations stimulate anti-predator behaviours such as vigilance and movement at the expense of foraging, whereas males' vocalizations increase individuals' displacements at the expense of vigilance. Overall, this study shows that both predator and social cues have direct effects on the behaviour of gregarious prey and need to be considered in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2104383126,"Pediatric populations continue to be understudied in clinical drug trials despite the increasing use of pharmacotherapy in children, particularly with psychotropic drugs. Most pertinent to the clinical selection of drug interventions are trials directly comparing drugs against other drugs. The aim was to measure the prevalence of active drug comparators in neuropsychiatric drug trials in children and identify the effects of funding source on comparator selection. We analyzed the selection of drugs and drug comparisons in clinical trials registered between January 2006 and May 2012. Completed and ongoing interventional trials examining treatments for six neuropsychiatric conditions in children were included. Networks of drug comparisons for each condition were constructed using information about the trial study arms. Of 421 eligible trial registrations, 228 (63,699 participants) were drug trials addressing ADHD (106 trials), autism spectrum disorders (47), unipolar depression (16), seizure disorders (38), migraines and other headaches (15), or schizophrenia (11). Active drug comparators were used in only 11.0% of drug trials while 44.7% used a placebo control and 44.3% no drug or placebo comparator. Even among conditions with well-established pharmacotherapeutic options, almost all drug interventions were compared to a placebo. Active comparisons were more common among trials without industry funding (17% vs. 8%, p=0.04). Trials with industry funding differed from non-industry trials in terms of the drugs studied and the comparators selected. For 73% (61/84) of drugs and 90% (19/21) of unique comparisons, trials were funded exclusively by either industry or non-industry. We found that industry and non-industry differed when choosing comparators and active drug comparators were rare for both groups. This gap in pediatric research activity limits the evidence available to clinicians treating children and suggests a need to reassess the design and funding of pediatric trials in order to optimize the information derived from pediatric participation in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2136289684,"The membrane bound NADPH oxidase involved in the synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a multi-protein enzyme encoded by CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2 and NCF4 genes. Growing evidence suggests a role of ROS in the modulation of signaling pathways of non-phagocytic cells, including differentiation and proliferation of B-cell progenitors. Transcriptional downregulation of the CYBB gene has been previously reported in cell lines of the B-cell derived classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Thus, we explored functional consequences of CYBB downregulation on the NADPH complex. Using flow cytometry to detect and quantify superoxide anion synthesis in cHL cell lines we identified recurrent loss of superoxide anion production in all stimulated cHL cell lines in contrast to stimulated non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. As CYBB loss proved to exert a deleterious effect on the NADPH oxidase complex in cHL cell lines, we analyzed the CYBB locus in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of primary cHL biopsies by in situ hybridisation and identified recurrent deletions of the gene in 8/18 cases. Immunohistochemical analysis to 14 of these cases revealed a complete lack of detectable CYBB protein expression in all HRS cells in all cases studied. Moreover, by microarray profiling of cHL cell lines we identified additional alterations of NADPH oxidase genes including CYBA copy number loss in 3/7 cell lines and a significant downregulation of the NCF1 transcription (p=0.006) compared to normal B-cell subsets. Besides, NCF1 protein was significantly downregulated (p<0.005) in cHL compared to other lymphoma cell lines. Together this findings show recurrent alterations of the NADPH oxidase encoding genes that result in functional inactivation of the enzyme and reduced production of superoxide anion in cHL."
https://openalex.org/W2050098999,"String-pulling and patterned-string tasks are often used to analyse perceptual and cognitive abilities in animals. In addition, the paradigm can be used to test the interrelation between visual-spatial and motor performance. Two Australian parrot species, the galah (Eolophus roseicapilla) and the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), forage on the ground, but only the galah uses its feet to manipulate food. I used a set of string pulling and patterned-string tasks to test whether usage of the feet during foraging is a prerequisite for solving the vertical string pulling problem. Indeed, the two species used techniques that clearly differed in the extent of beak-foot coordination but did not differ in terms of their success in solving the string pulling task. However, when the visual-spatial skills of the subjects were tested, the galahs outperformed the cockatiels. This supports the hypothesis that the fine motor skills needed for advanced beak-foot coordination may be interrelated with certain visual-spatial abilities needed for solving patterned-string tasks. This pattern was also found within each of the two species on the individual level: higher motor abilities positively correlated with performance in patterned-string tasks. This is the first evidence of an interrelation between visual-spatial and motor abilities in non-mammalian animals."

Subjects and Methods Subgingival plaque samples from the deepest diseased site of 30 LAP patients [PD ≥ 5 mm, BoP and bone loss] were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-based microarrays. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were analyzed for 14 cyto/chemokines. Peripheral blood was obtained and stimulated in vitro with P.gingivalis and E.coli to evaluate inflammatory response profiles. Plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels were also measured. Results Aa was detected in 56% of LAP patients and was shown to be an indicator for different bacterial community structures (p<0.01). Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cyto/chemokines were detected in LPS-stimulated blood samples in both Aa-detected and Aa-non-detected groups (p>0.05). Clinical parameters and serum LPS levels were similar between groups. However, Aa-non-detected GCF contained higher concentration of IL-8 than Aa-detected sites (p<0.05). TNFα and IL1β were elevated upon E.coli LPS stimulation of peripheral blood cells derived from patients with Aa-detected sites. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that the detection of Aa in LAP affected sites, did not correlate with clinical severity of the disease at the time of sampling in this cross-sectional study, although it did associate with lower local levels of IL-8, a different subgingival bacterial profile and elevated LPS-induced levels of TNFα and IL1β."

DzmP belongs to the ABBA prenyltransferases and is the first member of this superfamily which utilizes farnesyl diphosphate as genuine substrate. All previously discovered members utilize either dimethylallyl diphosphate (C5) or geranyl diphosphate (C10). Another putative diazepinomicin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the genome of Streptomyces griseoflavus Tü4000, suggesting that the formation of diazepinomicin is not restricted to the genus Micromonospora. The gene cluster contains a gene ssrg_00986 with 61.4% identity (amino acid level) to dzmP. The gene was expressed in E. coli, and the purified protein showed similar catalytic properties as DzmP. Both enzymes also accepted other phenolic or phenazine substrates. ABBA prenyltransferases are useful tools for chemoenzymatic synthesis, due to their nature as soluble, stable biocatalysts. The discovery of DzmP and Ssrg_00986 extends the isoprenoid substrate range of this superfamily. The observed prenylation of an amide nitrogen is an unusual biochemical reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2032598611,"Candida dubliniensis is an important human fungal pathogen that causes oral infections in patients with AIDS and diabetes mellitus. However, C. Dubliniensis has been frequently reported in bloodstream infections in clinical settings. Like its phylogenetically related virulent species C. albicans, C. Dubliniensis is able to grow and switch between yeast form and filamentous form (hyphae) and develops biofilms on both abiotic and biotic surfaces. Biofilms are recalcitrant to antifungal therapies and C. Dubliniensis readily turns drug resistant upon repeated exposure. More than 80% of infections are associated with biofilms. Suppression of fungal biofilms may therefore represent a viable antifungal strategy with clinical relevance. Here, we report that C. dubliniensis biofilms were inhibited by purpurin, a natural anthraquinone pigment isolated from madder root. Purpurin inhibited C. dubliniensis biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner; while mature biofilms were less susceptible to purpurin. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed scanty structure consisting of yeast cells in purpurin-treated C. dubliniensis biofilms. We sought to delineate the mechanisms of the anti-biofilm activity of purpurin on C. Dubliniensis. Intracellular ROS levels were significantly elevated in fungal biofilms and depolarization of MMP was evident upon purpurin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. DNA degradation was evident. However, no activated metacaspase could be detected. Together, purpurin triggered metacaspase-independent apoptosis in C. dubliniensis biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W1978578532,"The BamA protein is the key component of the Bam complex, the assembly machinery for outer membrane proteins (OMP) in gram-negative bacteria. We previously demonstrated that BamA recognizes its OMP substrates in a species-specific manner in vitro. In this work, we further studied species specificity in vivo by testing the functioning of BamA homologs of the proteobacteria Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bordetella pertussis, Burkholderia mallei, and Escherichia coli in E. coli and in N. meningitidis. We found that no BamA functioned in another species than the authentic one, except for N. gonorrhoeae BamA, which fully complemented a N. meningitidis bamA mutant. E. coli BamA was not assembled into the N. meningitidis outer membrane. In contrast, the N. meningitidis BamA protein was assembled into the outer membrane of E. coli to a significant extent and also associated with BamD, an essential accessory lipoprotein of the Bam complex.Various chimeras comprising swapped N-terminal periplasmic and C-terminal membrane-embedded domains of N. meningitidis and E. coli BamA proteins were also not functional in either host, although some of them were inserted in the OM suggesting that the two domains of BamA need to be compatible in order to function. Furthermore, conformational analysis of chimeric proteins provided evidence for a 16-stranded β-barrel conformation of the membrane-embedded domain of BamA."
https://openalex.org/W2004143485,"Complex visuospatial processing relies on distributed neural networks involving occipital, parietal and frontal brain regions. Effects of physiological maturation (during normal brain development) and proficiency on tasks requiring complex visuospatial processing have not yet been studied extensively, as they are almost invariably interrelated. We therefore aimed at dissociating the effects of age and performance on functional MRI (fMRI) activation in a complex visual search task. In our cross-sectional study, healthy children and adolescents (n = 43, 19 females, 7-17 years) performed a complex visual search task during fMRI. Resulting activation was analysed with regard to the differential effects of age and performance. Our results are compatible with an increase in the neural network's efficacy with age: within occipital and parietal cortex, the core regions of the visual exploration network, activation increased with age, and more so in the right than in the left hemisphere. Further, activation outside the visual search network decreased with age, mainly in left inferior frontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortex. High-performers had stronger activation in right superior parietal cortex, suggesting a more mature visual search network. We could not see effects of age or performance in frontal cortex. Our results show that effects of physiological maturation and effects of performance, while usually intertwined, can be successfully disentangled and investigated using fMRI in children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2040132160,"Translation elongation is mediated by ribosomes and multiple soluble factors, many of which are conserved across bacteria and eukaryotes. During elongation, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A; EF-Tu in bacteria) delivers aminoacylated-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome, whereas eEF2 (EF-G in bacteria) translocates the ribosome along the mRNA. Fungal translation elongation is striking in its absolute requirement for a third factor, the ATPase eEF3. eEF3 binds close to the E-site of the ribosome and has been proposed to facilitate the removal of deacylated tRNA from the E-site. eEF3 has two ATP binding cassette (ABC) domains, the second of which carries a unique chromodomain-like insertion hypothesized to play a significant role in its binding to the ribosome. This model was tested in the current study using a mutational analysis of the Sac7d region of the chromodomain-like insertion. Specific mutations in this domain result in reduced growth rate as well as slower translation elongation. In vitro analysis demonstrates that these mutations do not affect the ability of eEF3 to interact with the ribosome. Kinetic analysis revealed a larger turnover number for ribosomes in comparison to eEF3, indicating that the partial reactions involving the ribosome are significantly faster than that of eEF3. Mutations in the chromodomain-like insertion severely compromise the ribosome stimulated ATPase of eEF3, strongly suggesting that it exerts an allosteric effect on the hydrolytic activity of eEF3. The chromodomain-like insertion is, therefore, vital to eEF3 function and may be targeted for developing novel antifungal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2149146152,"Infant mortality from viral infection remains a major global health concern: viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication. Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8⁺ T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-α supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-α responses."
https://openalex.org/W2084325971,"Karyopherins are transporters involved in the bidirectional, selective and active transport of macromolecules through nuclear pores. Importin-β1 is the paradigm of karyopherins and, together with its cargo-adapter importin-α, mediates the general nuclear import pathway. Here we show the existence of different cellular pools of both importin-α and -β1 homologues, KapA and KapB, in the coenocytic ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. Fluorescence analysis of haploid and diploid strains expressing KapB::GFP and/or KapA::mRFP showed patches of both karyopherins concurrently translocating long distances in apically-growing cells. Anterograde and retrograde movements allowed those patches to reach cell tips and distal regions with an average speed in the range of μm/s. This bidirectional traffic required microtubules as well as kinesin and dynein motors, since it is blocked by benomyl and also by the inactivation of the dynein/dynactin complex through nudA1 or nudK317 mutations. Deletion of Kinesin-3 motor UncA, required for the transport through detyrosinated microtubules, strongly inhibited KapA and KapB movement along hyphae. Overall, this is the first report describing the bidirectional dynamics of the main nuclear import system in coenocytic fungi. A functional link is proposed between two key cellular machines of the filamentous fungal cell: nuclear transport and the tip-growth apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2022131968,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 3 (SGK3) mediates a variety of cellular processes including membrane transport, cell proliferation, and survival, and it has been implicated in Akt-independent signaling downstream of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations (activating mutations in the α catalytic subunit of PI3K) in human cancers. However, the regulation of SGK3 is poorly understood. Here we report that SGK3 stability and kinase activation are regulated by the Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone complex. Hsp90-Cdc37 associates with the kinase domain of SGK3 and acts in concert with a C-terminal hydrophobic motif of SGK3 to prevent Hsp70 association and ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein)-mediated degradation. Phosphorylation of hydrophobic motif triggers release of Cdc37 and concomitant association of 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) to activate SGK3. Our study provides new insights into regulation of SGK3 stability and activation and the rationale for application of Hsp90 inhibitors in treating SGK3-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1985900875,"Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is a stress-response transcription factor that responds to amino acid limitation and exposure to cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and sodium arsenite (NaAsO2). The N-terminal amino acids contribute to the destabilization of the ATF5 protein in steady-state conditions and serve as a stabilization domain in the stress response after CdCl2 or NaAsO2 exposure. In this study, we show that interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a proinflammatory cytokine, increases the expression of ATF5 protein in HepG2 hepatoma cells in part by stabilizing the ATF5 protein. The N-terminal domain rich in hydrophobic amino acids that is predicted to form a hydrophobic network was responsible for destabilization in steady-state conditions and served as an IL-1β response domain. Furthermore, IL-1β increased the translational efficiency of ATF5 mRNA via the 5' UTRα and phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). ATF5 knockdown in HepG2 cells up-regulated the IL-1β-induced expression of the serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) and SAA2 genes. Our results show that the N-terminal hydrophobic amino acids play an important role in the regulation of ATF5 protein expression in IL-1β-mediated immune response and that ATF5 is a negative regulator for IL-1β-induced expression of SAA1 and SAA2 in HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2041078424,"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection is widely considered an anthroponosis, although it has also been found in wild and domestic animals. Thus, fauna could act as reservoir, constraining the elimination of the parasite in hypo-endemic foci. To better understand the possible maintenance of T. b. gambiense in local fauna and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation, we generated adapted cells lines (ACLs) by in vitro culture of the parasites in different mammalian sera. Using specific antibodies against the Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs) we found that serum ACLs exhibited different VSG variants when maintained in pig, goat or human sera. Although newly detected VSGs were independent of the sera used, the consistent appearance of different VSGs suggested remodelling of the co-transcribed genes at the telomeric Expression Site (VSG-ES). Thus, Expression Site Associated Genes (ESAGs) sequences were analysed to investigate possible polymorphism selection. ESAGs 6 and 7 genotypes, encoding the transferrin receptor (TfR), expressed in different ACLs were characterised. In addition, we quantified the ESAG6/7 mRNA levels and analysed transferrin (Tf) uptake. Interestingly, the best growth occurred in pig and human serum ACLs, which consistently exhibited a predominant ESAG7 genotype and higher Tf uptake than those obtained in calf and goat sera. We also detected an apparent selection of specific ESAG3 genotypes in the pig and human serum ACLs, suggesting that other ESAGs could be involved in the host adaptation processes. Altogether, these results suggest a model whereby VSG-ES remodelling allows the parasite to express a specific set of ESAGs to provide selective advantages in different hosts. Finally, pig serum ACLs display phenotypic adaptation parameters closely related to human serum ACLs but distinct to parasites grown in calf and goat sera. These results suggest a better suitability of swine to maintain T. b. gambiense infection supporting previous epidemiological results."
https://openalex.org/W2161606367,"Introduction Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly used in critical care medicine to improve gas exchange. Altitude sickness is associated with exaggerated reduction in arterial oxygenation. We assessed the effect of PEEP and pursed lips breathing (PLB) on arterial and tissue oxygenation under normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions. Methods Sixteen healthy volunteers were exposed to acute normobaric hypoxia (Laboratory study, FiO2=0.12). The protocol consisted in 3-min phases with PEEPs of 0, 5 or 10 cmH2O, PLB or similar ventilation than with PEEP-10, interspaced with 3-min phases of free breathing. Arterial (pulse oximetry) and quadriceps (near-infrared spectroscopy) oxygenation, ventilation, cardiac function, esophageal and gastric pressures and subjects’ subjective perceptions were recorded continuously. In addition, the effect of PEEP on arterial oxygenation was tested at 4,350 m of altitude in 9 volunteers breathing for 20 min with PEEP-10 (Field study). Results During the laboratory study, PEEP-10 increased arterial and quadriceps oxygenation (arterial oxygen saturation +5.6±5.0% and quadriceps oxyhemoglobin +58±73 µmol.cm compared to free breathing; p<0.05). Conversely, PLB did not increase oxygenation. Oxygenation improvement with PEEP-10 was accompanied by an increase in expiratory esophageal and gastric pressures (esophageal pressure swing +5.4±3.2 cmH2O, p<0.05) but no change in minute ventilation, breathing pattern, end-tidal CO2 or cardiac function (all p>0.05) compared to PEEP-0. During the field study, PEEP-10 increased arterial oxygen saturation by +6.7±6.0% after the 3rd minute with PEEP-10 without further significant increase until the 20th minute with PEEP-10. Subjects did not report any significant discomfort with PEEP. Conclusions These data indicate that 10-cmH2O PEEP significantly improves arterial and muscle oxygenation under both normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions in healthy subjects. PEEP-10 could be an attractive non-pharmacological tool to limit blood oxygen desaturation and possibly symptoms at altitude."
https://openalex.org/W1995169620,"The air-breathing singhi catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis) is frequently being challenged by different environmental insults such as hyper-ammonia, dehydration and osmotic stresses in their natural habitats throughout the year. The present study investigated the effect of hyperosmotic stress, due to exposure to hypertonic environment (300 mM mannitol) for 14 days, on gluconeogenesis in this catfish. In situ exposure to hypertonic environment led to significant stimulation of gluconeogenic fluxes from the perfused liver after 7 days of exposure, followed by further increase after 14 days in presence of three different potential gluconeogenic substrates (lactate, pyruvate and glutamate). Environmental hypertonicity also caused a significant increase of activities of key gluconeogenic enzymes, namely phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase and glucose 6-phosphatase by about 2-6 fold in liver, and 3-6 fold in kidney tissues. This was accompanied by more abundance of enzyme proteins by about 1.8–3.7 fold and mRNAs by about 2.2–5.2 fold in both the tissues with a maximum increase after 14 days of exposure. Hence, the increase in activities of key gluconeogenic enzymes under hypertonic stress appeared to be as a result of transcriptional regulation of genes. Immunocytochemical analysis further confirmed the tissue specific localized expression of these enzymes in both the tissues with the possibility of expressing more in the same localized places. The induction of gluconeogenesis during exposure to environmental hypertonicity possibly occurs as a consequence of changes in hydration status/cell volume of different cell types. Thus, these adaptational strategies related to gluconeogenesis that are observed in this catfish under hypertonic stress probably help in maintaining glucose homeostasis and also for a proper energy supply to support metabolic demands mainly for ion transport and other altered metabolic processes under various environmental hypertonic stress-related insults."
https://openalex.org/W1990129475,"Visual short-term memory (VSTM) and visual imagery have been shown to modulate visual perception. However, how the subjective experience of VSTM/imagery and its contrast modulate this process has not been investigated. We addressed this issue by asking participants to detect brief masked targets while they were engaged either in VSTM or visual imagery. Subjective experience of memory/imagery (strength scale), and the visual contrast of the memory/mental image (contrast scale) were assessed on a trial-by-trial basis. For both VSTM and imagery, contrast of the memory/mental image was positively associated with reporting target presence. Consequently, at the sensory level, both VSTM and imagery facilitated visual perception. However, subjective strength of VSTM was positively associated with visual detection whereas the opposite pattern was found for imagery. Thus the relationship between subjective strength of memory/imagery and visual detection are qualitatively different for VSTM and visual imagery, although their impact at the sensory level appears similar. Our results furthermore demonstrate that imagery and VSTM are partly dissociable processes."
https://openalex.org/W2326561943,"We investigated whether and how comprehending sentences that describe a social context influences our motor behaviour. Our stimuli were sentences that referred to objects having different connotations (e.g., attractive/ugly vs. smooth/prickly) and that could be directed towards the self or towards ""another person"" target (e.g., ""The object is ugly/smooth. Bring it to you/Give it to another person""). Participants judged whether each sentence was sensible or non-sensible by moving the mouse towards or away from their body. Mouse movements were analysed according to behavioral and kinematics parameters. In order to enhance the social meaning of the linguistic stimuli, participants performed the task either individually (Individual condition) or in a social setting, in co-presence with the experimenter. The experimenter could either act as a mere observer (Social condition) or as a confederate, interacting with participants in an off-line modality at the end of task execution (Joint condition). Results indicated that the different roles taken by the experimenter affected motor behaviour and are discussed within an embodied approach to language processing and joint actions."
https://openalex.org/W2069424496,"The whole genome analysis has demonstrated that wine yeasts undergo changes in promoter regions and variations in gene copy number, which make them different to lab strains and help them better adapt to stressful conditions during winemaking, where oxidative stress plays a critical role. Since cytoplasmic thioredoxin II, a small protein with thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase activity, has been seen to perform important functions under biomass propagation conditions of wine yeasts, we studied the involvement of Trx2p in the molecular regulation of the oxidative stress transcriptional response on these strains. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of several oxidative stress-related genes regulated by either Yap1p or the co-operation between Yap1p and Skn7p. The results revealed a lowered expression for all the tested Skn7p dependent genes in a Trx2p-deficient strain and that Trx2p is essential for the oxidative stress response during respiratory metabolism in wine yeast. Additionally, activity of Yap1p and Skn7p dependent promoters by β-galactosidase assays clearly demonstrated that Skn7p-dependent promoter activation is affected by TRX2 gene deficiency. Finally we showed that deleting the TRX2 gene causes Skn7p hyperphosphorylation under oxidative stress conditions. We propose Trx2p to be a new positive efector in the regulation of the Skn7p transcription factor that controls phosphorylation events and, therefore, modulates the oxidative stress response in yeast."
