https://openalex.org/W3093858607,"Cell differentiation and function are regulated across multiple layers of gene regulation, including modulation of gene expression by changes in chromatin accessibility. However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. Here we developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to different tissues. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells in tissues."

Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional TH1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities."
https://openalex.org/W3093610264,"Abstract We use COVID-19 case and mortality data from 1 February 2020 to 21 September 2020 and a deterministic SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the United States at the state level from 22 September 2020 through 28 February 2021. Using this SEIR model, and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates and mask use per capita), we assessed scenarios of social distancing mandates and levels of mask use. Projections of current non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies by state—with social distancing mandates reinstated when a threshold of 8 deaths per million population is exceeded (reference scenario)—suggest that, cumulatively, 511,373 (469,578–578,347) lives could be lost to COVID-19 across the United States by 28 February 2021. We find that achieving universal mask use (95% mask use in public) could be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Universal mask use could save an additional 129,574 (85,284–170,867) lives from September 22, 2020 through the end of February 2021, or an additional 95,814 (60,731–133,077) lives assuming a lesser adoption of mask wearing (85%), when compared to the reference scenario."
https://openalex.org/W3093916434,"Classically considered short-lived and purely defensive leukocytes, neutrophils are unique in their fast and moldable response to stimulation. This plastic behavior may underlie variable and even antagonistic functions during inflammation or cancer, yet the full spectrum of neutrophil properties as they enter healthy tissues remains unexplored. Using a new model to track neutrophil fates, we found short but variable lifetimes across multiple tissues. Through analysis of the receptor, transcriptional, and chromatin accessibility landscapes, we identify varying neutrophil states and assign non-canonical functions, including vascular repair and hematopoietic homeostasis. Accordingly, depletion of neutrophils compromised angiogenesis during early age, genotoxic injury, and viral infection, and impaired hematopoietic recovery after irradiation. Neutrophils acquired these properties in target tissues, a process that, in the lungs, occurred in CXCL12-rich areas and relied on CXCR4. Our results reveal that tissues co-opt neutrophils en route for elimination to induce programs that support their physiological demands."
https://openalex.org/W3093620357,"The derivation of tissue-specific stem cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would have broad reaching implications for regenerative medicine. Here, we report the directed differentiation of human iPSCs into airway basal cells (""iBCs""), a population resembling the stem cell of the airway epithelium. Using a dual fluorescent reporter system (NKX2-1GFP;TP63tdTomato), we track and purify these cells as they first emerge as developmentally immature NKX2-1GFP+ lung progenitors and subsequently augment a TP63 program during proximal airway epithelial patterning. In response to primary basal cell medium, NKX2-1GFP+/TP63tdTomato+ cells display the molecular and functional phenotype of airway basal cells, including the capacity to self-renew or undergo multi-lineage differentiation in vitro and in tracheal xenografts in vivo. iBCs and their differentiated progeny model perturbations that characterize acquired and genetic airway diseases, including the mucus metaplasia of asthma, chloride channel dysfunction of cystic fibrosis, and ciliary defects of primary ciliary dyskinesia."
https://openalex.org/W3093896076,"Background After claiming nearly five hundred thousand lives globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down. While the UK, USA, Brazil and parts of Asia are bracing themselves for the second wave—or the extension of the first wave—it is imperative to identify the primary social, economic, environmental, demographic, ethnic, cultural and health factors contributing towards COVID-19 infection and mortality numbers to facilitate mitigation and control measures. Methods We process several open-access datasets on US states to create an integrated dataset of potential factors leading to the pandemic spread. We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making. Findings Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the inter-zone distance. Interpretation States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit consistently high infected and death numbers. Mortality rate seems to be driven by individual physiology, preexisting condition, age etc., rather than gender, healthcare facility or ethnic predisposition. Finally, policymaking on the timing of lockdowns should primarily consider the pre-lockdown infected numbers along with population density and airport traffic."
https://openalex.org/W3094415888,"Visiting parks and gardens supports physical and mental health. We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantify (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people (~87%) can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents (~13%) live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas visit parks that are potentially overcrowded during periods of high use. Such disparity in urban areas of England and Wales becomes particularly evident during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown when local parks, the only available out-of-home space option, hinder social distancing requirements. Cities aiming to facilitate social distancing while keeping public green spaces safe might require implementing measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park."

https://openalex.org/W3094461804,"Introduction Efforts to mitigate the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) have largely relied on broad compliance with public health recommendations yet navigating the high volume of evolving information can be challenging. We assessed self-reported public perceptions related to COVID-19 including, beliefs (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) to understand perspectives in Canada and to inform future public health initiatives. Methods We administered a national online survey aiming to obtain responses from 2000 adults in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize responses and tested for regional differences using chi-squared tests, followed by weighted logistic regression. Results We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% reported self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified associations between region and self-reported beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Discussion We found that information about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public’s overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3094489852,"Understanding the influence of COVID-19 on China's agricultural economy and the Chinese government's emergency measures to ease the economic impacts of viral spread can offer urgently-needed lessons while this virus continues to spread across the globe. Thus, this study collected over 750,000 words upon the topic of COVID-19 and agriculture from the largest two media channels in China: WeChat and Sina Weibo, and employed web crawler technology and text mining method to explore the influence of COVID-19 on agricultural economy and mitigation measures in China. The results show that: (1) the impact of COVID-19 on China's agricultural economy at the very first phase is mainly reflected in eight aspects as crop production, agricultural products supply, livestock production, farmers' income and employment, economic crop development, agricultural products sales model, leisure agriculture development, and agricultural products trade. (2) The government's immediate countermeasures include resuming agricultural production and farmers' work, providing financial support, stabilizing agricultural production and products supply, promoting agricultural products sale, providing subsidies, providing agricultural technology guidance and field management, and providing assistance to poor farmers to reduce poverty. (3) The order of government's immediate countermeasures is not all in line with the order of impact aspects, which indicates that more-tailored policies should be implemented to mitigate the strikes of COVID-19 on China's agricultural economy in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3093852602,"Re-activation and clonal expansion of tumor-specific antigen (TSA)-reactive T cells are critical to the success of checkpoint blockade and adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-based therapies. There are no reliable markers to specifically identify the repertoire of TSA-reactive T cells due to their heterogeneous composition. We introduce FucoID as a general platform to detect endogenous antigen-specific T cells for studying their biology. Through this interaction-dependent labeling approach, intratumoral TSA-reactive CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and TSA-suppressive CD4+ T cells can be detected and separated from bystander T cells based on their cell-surface enzymatic fucosyl-biotinylation. Compared to bystander TILs, TSA-reactive TILs possess a distinct T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and unique gene features. Although exhibiting a dysfunctional phenotype, TSA-reactive CD8+ TILs possess substantial capabilities of proliferation and tumor-specific killing. Featuring genetic manipulation-free procedures and a quick turnover cycle, FucoID should have the potential of accelerating the pace of personalized cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3093517675,"The excitatory synapse between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibits long-term potentiation (LTP), a positive feedback process implicated in learning and memory in which postsynaptic depolarization strengthens synapses, promoting further depolarization. Without mechanisms for interrupting positive feedback, excitatory synapses could strengthen inexorably, corrupting memory storage. Here, we reveal a hidden form of inhibitory synaptic plasticity that prevents accumulation of excitatory LTP. We developed a knockin mouse that allows optical control of endogenous α5-subunit-containing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors (α5-GABARs). Induction of excitatory LTP relocates α5-GABARs, which are ordinarily extrasynaptic, to inhibitory synapses, quashing further NMDA receptor activation necessary for inducing more excitatory LTP. Blockade of α5-GABARs accelerates reversal learning, a behavioral test for cognitive flexibility dependent on repeated LTP. Hence, inhibitory synaptic plasticity occurs in parallel with excitatory synaptic plasticity, with the ensuing interruption of the positive feedback cycle of LTP serving as a possible critical early step in preserving memory."
https://openalex.org/W3094130570,"The mechanisms by which prenatal immune activation increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders are unclear. Here, we generated developmental cortical interneurons (cINs)—which are known to be affected in schizophrenia (SCZ) when matured—from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from healthy controls (HCs) and individuals with SCZ and co-cultured them with or without activated microglia. Co-culture with activated microglia disturbed metabolic pathways, as indicated by unbiased transcriptome analyses, and impaired mitochondrial function, arborization, synapse formation and synaptic GABA release. Deficits in mitochondrial function and arborization were reversed by alpha lipoic acid and acetyl-l-carnitine treatments, which boost mitochondrial function. Notably, activated-microglia-conditioned medium altered metabolism in cINs and iPSCs from HCs but not in iPSCs from individuals with SCZ or in glutamatergic neurons. After removal of activated-microglia-conditioned medium, SCZ cINs but not HC cINs showed prolonged metabolic deficits, which suggests that there is an interaction between SCZ genetic backgrounds and environmental risk factors. When co-cultured with activated microglia, iPSC-derived interneurons from individuals with schizophrenia and from healthy controls show defects in metabolic pathways, but only the interneurons from individuals with schizophrenia showed prolonged metabolic deficits."
https://openalex.org/W3093507025,"Kidney disease is a recognised risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes. Up to 30 June 2020, the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) collected data for 2,385 in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) patients with COVID-19 in England and Wales. Overall unadjusted survival at 1 week after date of positive COVID-19 test was 87.5% (95% CI 86.1–88.8%); mortality increased with age, treatment vintage and there was borderline evidence of Asian ethnicity (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94–1.44) being associated with higher mortality. Compared to the general population, the relative risk of mortality for ICHD patients with COVID-19 was 45.4 and highest in younger adults. This retrospective cohort study based on UKRR data supports efforts to protect this vulnerable patient group."
https://openalex.org/W3093846884,"Background In the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly data related to the burden of care required by infected patients were reported. The aim of this study was to illustrate the timeline of actions taken and to measure and analyze their impact on surgical patients. Method This is a retrospective review of actions to limit Covid-19 spread and their impact on surgical activity in a Swiss tertiary referral center. Data on patient care, human resources and hospital logistics were collected. Impact on surgical activity was measured by comparing 6-week periods before and after the first measures were taken. Results After the first Swiss Covid-19 case appeared on February 25, progressively restrictive measures were taken over a period of 23 days. Covid-19 positive inpatients increased from 5 to 131, and ICU patients from 2 to 31, between days 10 and 30, respectively, without ever overloading resources. A 43% decrease of elective visceral surgical procedures was observed after Covid-19 (295 vs 165, p<0.01), while the urgent operations (all specialties) decreased by 39% (1476 vs 897, p<0.01). Fifty-two and 38 major oncological surgeries were performed, respectively, representing a 27% decrease (p = 0.316). Outpatient consultations dropped by 59%, from 728 to 296 (p<0.01). Conclusion While allowing for maximal care of Covid-19 patients during the pandemic, the shift of resources limited the access to elective surgical care, with less impact on cancer care."
https://openalex.org/W3093613701,"Every year, hundreds of thousands of people die because of metastatic brain cancer. Most metastatic cancer research uses 2D cell culture or animal models, but they have a few limitations, such as difficulty reproducing human tissue structures. This study developed a simple 3D in vitro model to better replicate brain metastasis using human cancer cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids (metastatic brain cancer cerebral organoid [MBCCO]). The MBCCO model successfully reproduced metastatic cancer processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration, in addition to cell-cell interactions. Using the MBCCO model, we demonstrated that lung-specific X protein (LUNX) plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration or invasion. We also observed astrocyte accumulation around and their interaction with cancer cells through connexin 43 in the MBCCO model. We analyzed whether the MBCCO model can be used to screen drugs by measuring the effects of gefitinib, a well-known anticancer agent. We also examined the toxicity of gefitinib using normal cerebral organoids (COs). Therefore, the MBCCO model is a powerful tool for modeling human metastatic brain cancer in vitro and can also be used to screen drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3094082114,"There has been little evidence linking changes in spiking activity that occur prior to a spatially predictable target (i.e., prior to target selection) to behavioral outcomes, despite such preparatory changes being widely assumed to enhance the sensitivity of sensory processing. We simultaneously recorded from frontal and parietal nodes of the attention network while macaques performed a spatial cueing task. When anticipating a spatially predictable target, different patterns of coupling between spike timing and the oscillatory phase in local field potentials-but not changes in spike rate-were predictive of different behavioral outcomes. These behaviorally relevant differences in local and between-region synchronization occurred among specific cell types that were defined based on their sensory and motor properties, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying enhanced sensory processing prior to target selection. We propose that these changes in neural synchronization reflect differential anticipatory engagement of the network nodes and functional units that shape attention-related sampling."
https://openalex.org/W3093510566,"The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability."
https://openalex.org/W3094166907,"Because a DNA nucleotide sequence has the characteristics of large storage capacity, high parallelism, and low energy consumption, DNA cryptography is favored by information security researchers. Image encryption algorithms based on DNA coding have become a research hotspot in the field of image encryption and security. In this study, based on a comprehensive review of the existing studies and their results, we present new insights into the existing image encryption algorithms based on DNA coding. First, the existing algorithms were summarized and classified into five types, depending on the type of DNA coding: DNA fixed coding, DNA dynamic coding, different types of base complement operation, different DNA sequence algebraic operations, and combinations of multiple DNA operations. Second, we analyzed and studied each classification algorithm using simulation and obtained their advantages and disadvantages. Third, the DNA coding mechanisms, DNA algebraic operations, and DNA algebraic combination operations were compared and discussed. Then, a new scheme was proposed by combining the optimal coding mechanism with the optimal DNA coding operation. Finally, we revealed the shortcomings of the existing studies and the future direction for improving image encryption methods based on DNA coding."
https://openalex.org/W3033508706,"Wuhua yellow chicken (WHYC) is an important traditional yellow-feathered chicken from China, which is characterized by its white tail feathers, white flight feathers, and strong disease resistance. However, the genomic basis of these unique traits associated with WHYC is poorly understood. In this study, whole-genome resequencing was performed with an average coverage of 20.77-fold to investigate heritable variation and identify selection signals in WHYC. Reads were mapped onto the chicken reference genome (Galgal5) with a coverage of 85.95%. After quality control, 11,953,471 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 1,069,574 insertion/deletions were obtained. In addition, 41,408 structural variants and 33,278 copy number variants were found. Comparative genomic analysis of WHYC and other yellow-feathered chicken breeds showed that selected regions were enriched in genes involved in transport and catabolism, immune system, infectious diseases, signal transduction, and signaling molecules and interactions. Several genes associated with disease resistance were also identified, including IFNA, IFNB, CD86, IL18, IL11RA, VEGFC, and ATG10. Furthermore, our results suggest that PMEL and TYRP1 may contribute to the white feather coloring in WHYC. These findings can improve our understanding of the genetic characteristics of WHYC and may contribute to future breed improvement."

https://openalex.org/W3094241454,"Individuals often choose between remembering information using their own memory ability versus using external resources to reduce cognitive demand (i.e. ‘cognitive offloading’). For example, to remember a future appointment an individual could choose to set a smartphone reminder or depend on their unaided memory ability. Previous studies investigating strategic reminder setting found that participants set more reminders than would be optimal, and this bias towards reminder-setting was predicted by metacognitive underconfidence in unaided memory ability. Due to the link between underconfidence in memory ability and excessive reminder setting, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether metacognitive training is an effective intervention to a) improve metacognitive judgment accuracy, and b) reduce bias in strategic offloading behaviour. Participants either received metacognitive training which involved making performance predictions and receiving feedback on judgment accuracy, or were part of a control group. As predicted, metacognitive training increased judgment accuracy: participants in the control group were significantly underconfident in their memory ability, whereas the experimental group showed no significant metacognitive bias. However, contrary to predictions, both experimental and control groups were significantly biased toward reminder-setting, and did not differ significantly. Therefore, reducing metacognitive bias was not sufficient to eliminate the bias towards reminders. We suggest that the reminder bias likely results in part from erroneous metacognitive evaluations, but that other factors such as a preference to avoid cognitive effort may also be relevant. Finding interventions to mitigate these factors could improve the adaptive use of external resources."
https://openalex.org/W3093941166,"In the global context, the health and quality of life of people are adversely affected by either one or more types of chronic diseases. The chronic pain associated with diagnosed patients may include heavy medical expenditure along with the physical and mental suffering they undergo. Usually, unbearable amounts of medical expenses are incurred, to improve or sustain the health condition of the patient. Consequently, the heavy financial burden tends to push households from a comfortable or secure life, or even from bad to worse, towards the probability of becoming poor. Hence, this study is conducted to identify the impact chronic illnesses have on poverty using data from a national survey referred as the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), with data gathered by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka in 2016. As such, this study is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, declaring the originality of the study based on data collected from the local arena. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity, in the age category of 40-65, having an educational level of tertiary level or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. Moreover, it was inferred that, if a person is deprived from access to basic education in the level of education, lives in the rural or estate sector, or suffers from a brain disease, cancer, heart disease or kidney disease, he is highly likely to be poor. Some insights concluded from this Sri Lankan case study can also be applied in the context of other developing countries, to minimise chronic illnesses and thereby the probability of falling into poverty."
https://openalex.org/W3094048867,"Objectives This study examined the mediating or moderating relationship of social health on physical health and post-traumatic stress symptoms among displaced Syrians and Jordanians at high risk for physical and mental health ailments. Frequency of mental health symptoms stratified by demographic factors was also explored. We hypothesized social health would mediate and/or moderate the relationship between physical and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Methods This cross-sectional study includes 598 adults between 18 and 75 years old recruited from three health centers in the city of Irbid, Jordan, 20 km away from the Syrian border. Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured through the primary care post-traumatic stress disorder checklist. Physical and social health were assessed through the Duke Health Profile. One-way ANOVA and independent samples T-tests examined mean scores of social health, PTSS, physical health stratified by age, gender, nationality, education level, and trauma exposure. Bivariate correlations explored the relationship between social health, PTSS, and physical health. PROCESS macro tested social health as a moderator and mediator on the association of the physical health and PTSS. Results Social health moderated and mediated the relationship between physical health and PTSS. Males reported (t = 2.53, p < .05) better physical health scores than females. Those who had less than a high school education reported lower social health (F = 13.83, p < .001); higher PTSS (F = 5.83, p < .001); and lower physical health (F = 5.76, p < .01) than more educated individuals. Syrians reported significantly higher PTSS (F = 4.13, p < .05) than Jordanians, however, there was no significant differences between nationality for physical or social health. Social health was positively associated with better physical health (r = 0.10, p < .01) and negatively with PTSS (r = -.293, p < .01). Conclusions Our results support our primary hypothesis suggesting social health mediates and moderates PTSS and physical health. Secondary findings illustrate gender, educational, and income differences in physical health and PTSS. Clinical trials registry NCT03721848"
https://openalex.org/W3093728306,"Sleep misperception has long been a major issue in the field of insomnia research. Most studies of sleep misperception examine sleep underestimation by comparing the results of polysomnography conducted in a laboratory environment with patients’ sleep diary entries. We aimed to investigate psychosocial characteristics of adults who underestimated or overestimated sleep time in a nonclinical, middle-aged community-dwelling population. We collected one week of sleep data with wrist-worn accelerometers. We used egocentric social network analysis to analyze the effects of psychosocial factors. Among 4,060 study participants, 922 completed the accelerometer substudy. Underestimation was defined as an accelerometer-measured sleep time ≥ 6 h and a subjective sleep time < 6 h. Overestimation was defined as an objective sleep time < 6 h and a subjective sleep time ≥ 6 h. Psychosocial characteristics of the sleep misperception group were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. A total of 47 participants underestimated sleep time, and 420 overestimated sleep time. Regression analysis revealed that women, living with spouse, economic satisfaction, and bridging potential had protective effects against sleep underestimation. Blame from a spouse involved a 3.8-times higher risk of underestimation than the control group (p = 0.002). In men, discussing concerns with a spouse had a protective effect against underestimation (p < 0.001). Economic satisfaction, feeling social network-based intimacy, and support from a spouse were associated with overestimation in women. In men, feeling social network-based intimacy was also associated with overestimation (p < 0.001). We found that social relationship quality was related to sleep overestimation and underestimation. This association was marked in women. Good social relationships may have positive effects on sleep misperception via attenuation of negative emotional reactions and effects on emotional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3094144354,"The purpose of this study was to test the effect of subconcussive head impacts on acute changes in plasma S100B. In this randomized controlled trial, 79 healthy adult soccer players were randomly assigned to either the heading (n = 41) or kicking-control groups (n = 38). The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph, whereas the kicking-control group performed 10 kicks. Plasma samples were obtained at pre-, 0h post-, 2h post- and 24h post-intervention and measured for S100B. The primary hypothesis was that there would be a significant group difference (group-by-time interaction) in plasma S100B at 2h post-intervention. Secondary hypotheses included (1) no significant group differences in plasma S100B concentrations at 0h post- and 24h post-intervention; (2) a significant within-group increase in S100B concentrations in the heading group at 2h post-intervention compared to pre-intervention; and (3) no significant within-group changes in plasma S100B in the kicking-control group. Data from 68 subjects were available for analysis (heading n = 37, kicking n = 31). There were no differences in S100B concentrations between heading and kicking groups over time, as evidenced by nonsignificant group-by-time interaction at 2h post-intervention (B = 2.20, 95%CI [-22.22, 26.63], p = 0.86) and at all the other time points (0h post: B = -11.05, 95%CI [-35.37, 13.28], p = 0.38; 24h post: B = 16.11, 95%CI [-8.29, 40.51], p = 0.20). Part of the secondary outcome, the heading group showed elevation in plasma S100B concentrations at 24h post-intervention compared to pre-heading baseline (B = 19.57, 95%CI [3.13, 36.02], p = 0.02), whereas all other within-group comparisons in both remained nonsignificant. The data suggest that 10 bouts of acute controlled soccer headings do not elevate S100B concentrations up to 24-hour post-heading. Further dose-response studies with longer follow-up time points may help determine thresholds of acute soccer heading exposure that are related to astrocyte activation. The protocol was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03488381; retrospectively registered.)."
https://openalex.org/W3094155159,"Mammary-derived serotonin has been implicated in breast-to-bone communication during lactation by increasing parathyroid hormone related-protein (PTHrP) in the mammary gland. It is well established that PTHrP acts on the bone to liberate calcium for milk synthesis during lactation; however, the mechanism of serotonin’s regulation of PTHrP has not been fully elucidated. Recently, serotonylation has been shown to be involved in a variety of physiological processes mediated by serotonin. Therefore, we investigated whether serotonylation is involved in serotonin’s regulation of PTHrP in the mammary gland using lactogenically differentiated mouse mammary epithelial cells. We investigated the effect of increased intracellular serotonin using the antidepressant fluoxetine or 5-hydroxytryptophan (serotonin precursor), with or without transglutaminase inhibition and the corresponding action on PTHrP induction and activity. Treatment with fluoxetine or 5-hydroxytryptophan significantly increased intracellular serotonin concentrations and subsequently increased PTHrP gene expression, which was reduced with transglutaminase inhibition. Furthermore, we determined that transglutaminase activity is increased with lactogenic differentiation and 5-hydroxytryptophan or fluoxetine treatment. We investigated whether RhoA, Rac1, and Rab4 were potential serotonylation target proteins. We speculate that RhoA is potentially a serotonylation target protein. Our data suggest that serotonin regulates PTHrP induction in part through the process of serotonylation under lactogenic conditions in mouse mammary epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3094275897,"Studies have shown that human gait entrains to rhythmic bursts of ankle torque for perturbation intervals both slightly shorter and slightly longer than the natural stride period while walking on a treadmill and during overground walking, with phase alignment such that the torque adds to ankle push-off. This study investigated whether human gait also entrains to align the phase of rhythmic electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle with the timing of ankle push-off. In addition, this study investigated the muscle response to electrical stimulation at different phases of the gait cycle. We found that for both treadmill and overground walking entrainment was observed with phasing that aligned the stimuli with ankle push-off or just before foot contact. Achilles tendon wave speed measurements showed a significant difference (increase) in tendon load when electrical stimulation was applied just after foot contact and during swing phase, with a greater increase for higher amplitudes of electrical stimulation. However, stimulation did not increase tendon load when the timing coincided with push-off. Stride period measurements also suggest the effect of electrical stimulation is sensitive to the gait phase it is applied. These results confirmed that timing aligned with push-off is an attractor for electrical stimulation-induced perturbations of the medial gastrocnemius, and that the muscle response to stimulation is sensitive to timing and amplitude. Future research should investigate other muscles and timings and separate sensory vs. motor contributions to these phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W3094516279,"Infections of the lung are among the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite the preactivation of innate defense programs during viral infection, secondary bacterial infection substantially elevates morbidity and mortality rates. Particularly problematic are co-infections with influenza A virus (IAV) and the major bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the molecular processes underlying the severe course of such co-infections are not fully understood. Previously, the absence of secreted glycoprotein Chitinase-3-like 1 (CHI3L1) was shown to increase pneumococcal replication in mice. We therefore hypothesized that an IAV preinfection decreases CHI3L1 levels to promote pneumococcal infection. Indeed, in an air-liquid interface model of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs), IAV preinfection interfered with apical but not basolateral CHI3L1 release. Confocal time-lapse microscopy revealed that the gradual loss of apical CHI3L1 localization during co-infection with influenza and S. pneumoniae coincided with the disappearance of goblet as well as ciliated cells and increased S. pneumoniae replication. Importantly, extracellular restoration of CHI3L1 levels using recombinant protein significantly reduced bacterial load in influenza preinfected bronchial models. Thus, recombinant CHI3L1 may provide a novel therapeutic means to lower morbidity and mortality associated with post-influenza pneumococcal infections."
https://openalex.org/W3094525334,"Objective Optimizing cardiac stroke volume during high-risk surgical anesthesia is of particular interest with regard to a therapeutic target to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. However, intensive fluid management in critically ill small animals with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been empirically performed, and thus it can be challenging. Stroke volume variation (SVV) has been used as a dynamic preload predictor of fluid responsiveness. We hypothesized that if SVV exhibited robust reliability in the setting of hemodynamically unstable condition, it would provide more precise information on fluid resuscitation to translate it into veterinary anesthesia. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the utility of SVV measured by the electrical velocimetry (EV) method for predicting fluid responsiveness in dogs with PH. Methods Sixteen dogs undergoing emergency abdominal surgery and diagnosed with PH secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) on preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram were included. Dogs were randomly assigned to 2 groups with and without inotropic cardiac support with dobutamine. Hemodynamic measurements including stroke volume and SVV derived from the EV device were performed under general anesthesia before (baseline) and after surgery (fluid challenge with a colloid solution defined by a SV increase of ≥ 10%). Results In both groups, SVV elevated significantly after abdominal surgery compared with baseline. In dobutamine infused group, the SVV values decreased significantly after fluid challenge (P < 0.05) with a greater number of responders than saline infused control group (P < 0.01). Receiver operating curve analysis of SVV confirmed high positive predictive value for dogs during dobutamine infusion (P < 0.05; cut-off value of 15%; specificity 90%, sensitivity 82%). Conclusions Noninvasive EV monitoring may be useful for the prediction of fluid responsiveness in critically ill dogs with left-sided heart failure-related PH. This normalization of dynamic preload indices, which could be achieved more precisely under inotropic support, may prevent further detrimental consequence of fluid loading."
https://openalex.org/W3093485077,"Background Indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduces vector densities and malaria transmission, however, the most effective spraying intervals for IRS have not been well established. We estimated the optimal timing interval for IRS using a statistical approach. Methods Six rounds of IRS were implemented in Tororo District, a historically high malaria transmission setting in Uganda, during the study period (3 rounds with bendiocarb active ingredient (Ficam®): December 2014 to December 2015, and 3 rounds with pirimiphos methyl active ingredient (Actellic 300®CS): June 2016 to July 2018). A generalized additive model was used to estimate the optimal timing interval for IRS based on the predicted malaria incidence. The model was fitted to clinical incidence data from a cohort of children aged 0.5–10 years from selected households observed throughout the study period. Results 494 children, 67% aged less than 5 years at enrolment were analysed. Six-months period incidence of malaria decreased from 2.96 per person-years at the baseline to 1.74 following the first round of IRS and then to 0.02 after 6 rounds of IRS. The optimal time interval for IRS differed between bendiocarb and pirimiphos methyl and by IRS round. To retain an optimum impact, bendiocarb would require respraying 17 (95% CI: 14.2–21.0) weeks after application whereas pirimiphos methyl could remain impactful for 40 (95% CI: 37.0–42.8) weeks, although in the final year this estimates 36 (95% CI: 32.7–37.7) weeks. However, we could not estimate from the data the optimal time after the second and third rounds of bendiocarb and after the second round of pirimiphos methyl. Neither the amount of rainfall nor the EIR nor the distribution of nets were found to be statistically significant for determining the time period between spray rounds. Conclusion In our setting, the effect of the two IRS products was distinct. Statistically, pirimiphos methyl provided a longer window of protection than bendiocarb, although impact varied between different spray rounds and years which was not explained by rainfall or EIR or distribution of nets in our statistical approach. Understanding the effectiveness of IRS and how long it lasts can help for planning campaigns, but one should consider the financial cost and insecticide resistance. Monitoring the timing of spray campaigns using clinical incidence could be repeated in future programs to help determine the average period of protectivity of these products."
https://openalex.org/W3093516146,"To be able to extend working lives, maintaining good health in older workers is important. The aim of the present study was to identify which work characteristics are associated with physical and mental health outcomes in older workers in the Netherlands, and particularly whether there are educational differences in these associations. We used longitudinal tobit and ordered logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between physical demands, psychosocial demands, variation in tasks, autonomy, and job strain and self-rated health (SRH), functional limitations, and depressive symptoms. We included interaction terms between the work characteristics and education to examine effect modification by education. We found that high physical demands, low variation in tasks, low autonomy, and high job strain were associated with poorer physical and mental health. We found evidence for educational differences in the exposure to these work characteristics, as well as in the strengths of their associations with health, with lower educated workers being disadvantaged. The associations between physical demands (SRH: OR = 3.70 (95%CI:1.92;7.11); functional limitations: B = 1.27 (95%CI:.47;2.07)), autonomy (SRH: OR = .42(95%CI:.26;.69)), and job strain (active job; SRH: OR = .25 (95%CI:.09;.69); functional limitations: B = -1.51 (95%CI:-2.68;-.34), and health were strongest in the lower educated workers. In order to maintain good health in older workers and reduce health inequalities, it is recommended to implement workplace interventions to improve working conditions, especially among the lower educated workers."
https://openalex.org/W3094440543,"We measured 34 years of plant community change in a degraded oak woodland undergoing ecological management. Management included regular prescribed fire, control of white-tailed deer populations, repeated sowing of a diverse seed mix, and removal of invasive plants. We tracked change with several conservation metrics. Time series analysis showed no significant changes over time in either plant species richness or the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. Floristic Quality Assessment measures—the Floristic Quality Index (FQI), Cover-weighted FQI, and the Mean Coefficient of Conservatism (Mean C)—all increased dramatically over time, such that their values now surpass those of the highest quality representative of this habitat in the region. Cover-weighted FQI had the added benefit of being quick to respond (negatively and positively) to short-term management changes during the study. This sensitivity highlights its utility for adaptive management, enabling timely, data-driven changes to ongoing management regimes. Plant community composition showed striking changes during the study period, as species of high conservation value replaced weedier species. As a group, conservative woodland species are notoriously slow to recover from degradation, making this flora’s recovery particularly notable. A mid-study cessation of management immediately stalled the woodland’s recovery according to Floristic Quality metrics, but the restoration quickly returned to its positive trajectory with the resumption of management treatments. These results illustrate that impressive plant biodiversity restoration can be achieved, even in highly degraded contemporary oak ecosystems, if ecological management is comprehensive and if it is sustained over time."
https://openalex.org/W3094536902,"The control of cell fate is critical to homeostasis and cancer. Cell cycle cdk inhibitor p21CIP1 has a central and paradoxical role in the regulatory crossroads leading to senescence, apoptosis, or differentiation. p21 is an essential target of tumor suppressor p53, but it also is regulated independently. In squamous self-renewal epithelia continuously exposed to mutagenesis, p21 controls cell fate by mechanisms still intriguing. We previously identified a novel epidermoid DNA damage-differentiation response. We here show that p21 intervenes in the mitosis block that is required for the squamous differentiation response to cell cycle deregulation and replication stress. The inactivation of endogenous p21 in human primary keratinocytes alleviated the differentiation response to oncogenic loss of p53 or overexpression of the DNA replication major regulator Cyclin E. The bypass of p21-induced mitotic block involving upregulation of Cyclin B allowed DNA damaged cells to escape differentiation and continue to proliferate. In addition, loss of p21 drove keratinocytes from differentiation to apoptosis upon moderate UV irradiation. The results show that p21 is required to drive keratinocytes towards differentiation in response to genomic stress and shed light into its dual and paradoxical role in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3093576727,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel, non-invasive imaging tool used to detect vascular flow. The absence of a flow signal in OCTA in polyps revealed by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) may indicate slow or compromised filling of blood flow from choroidal vessels. Naïve patients with PCV treated with intravitreal injections of aflibercept (IVI-A) were enrolled in this study to validate the hypothesis that baseline flow may affect the outcome of polyp regression in ICGA. The flow signal of polyps in OCTA was detected by manual segmentation in the corresponding location by ICGA. Polyps were defined as high-flow if both OCTA and ICGA showed positive findings, and low-flow if OCTA showed a negative flow signal in 3 consecutive horizontal scans at the polyp area shown in ICGA. A total of 24 polyps were identified in 13 PCV patients at baseline. Of these 24 polyps, 22 (91.7%) were high-flow and 2 (8.3%) were low-flow. After 3 monthly IVI-A, all low-flow polyps had complete regression in ICGA. Among 17 (77%) high-flow polyps at baseline that had regression after treatment, 10 (58.8%) became low-flow, while 5 (22.7%) persistent polyps remained high-flow. Flow signal of polyps as detected by OCTA could be a predictive factor for treatment response in patients with PCV. Monitoring changes in flow signal after treatment is clinically relevant."

Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative therapy for severe haematological disorders. However, it carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. To improve patient outcomes, better graft selection strategies are needed, incorporating HLA matching with clinically important graft characteristics. Studies have shown that the cellular content of HCT grafts, specifically higher ratios of T regulatory (Tregs)/T cells, are important factors influencing outcomes when using adult peripheral blood mobilised grafts. So far, no equivalent study exists in umbilical cord blood (CB) transplantation due to the limitations of cryopreserved CB samples.


Study design and methods 
To establish the most robust and efficient way to measure the Treg content of previously cryopreserved CB units, we compared the enumeration of Treg and CD3+ cells using flow cytometry and an epigenetic, DNA-based methodology. The two methods were assessed for their agreement, consistency and susceptibility to error when enumerating Treg and CD3+ cell numbers in both fresh and cryopreserved CB samples.


Results 
Epigenetic enumeration gave consistent and comparable results in both fresh and frozen CB samples. By contrast, assessment of Tregs and CD3+ cells by flow cytometry was only possible in fresh samples due to significant cell death following cryopreservation and thawing.


Conclusion 
Epigenetic assessment offers significant advantages over flow cytometry for analysing cryopreserved CB; similar cell numbers were observed both in fresh and frozen samples. Furthermore, multiple epigenetic assessments can be performed from DNA extracted from small cryopreserved CB segments; often the only CB sample available for clinical studies."

A total of 438 women from 24 national teams who participated at Canada 2015 (artificial turf) and 283 players from 16 national teams who played in Germany 2011 (natural grass) were selected for this study. The collected data were provided by OPTA Sports. Twenty-nine key performance indicators were included for analysis. The variables were calculated for the total sample and independently by positions (defense, midfielders and forwards) for matches on natural grass (2011) and artificial turf (2015). A Mann–Whitney U test was used out to identify differences between the sport surfaces. Moreover, a discriminant analysis was performed with the forced entry method to find the variables that better differentiated between the FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 (natural grass) and FIFA Women's World Cup 2015 (artificial turf). Key performance aspects were very similar between the two tournaments, but on natural grass, we observed a significantly higher number of total passes, successful dribbles, total tackles, successful tackles and interceptions. However, on artificial turf there were significantly higher percentages of success in total passes, and a higher number of fouls. This is an important factor for the choice of an elite competition surface because technical actions are crucial to the quality of the game and can influence the future behavior of spectators and fans."
https://openalex.org/W3093802275,"From the end of the 1980s, the Hungarian suicide rate, which had been until that point the highest in the world for decades, has decreased drastically. The reason behind this decrease was probably due to the changes in numerous and often interlinked risk factors. Studies on this topic have mostly ignored to interrogate to what extent the change of the population composition, for example the improvement of educational level, contributed to the decrease of the rate in the given period? Our aim was to assess the contribution of changes in some sociodemographic factors to the decrease of the suicide rate in Hungary. During the analysis, data from 1990 were compared with data from 2011. For the statistical calculations, the method of Standardization and Decomposition (SDA) was used, which according to our best knowledge, has not yet been applied in Hungarian suicide studies. The results show that the improvement of educational level helped to decrease the rate for men by about a third, while for women only by about a tenth. However, the benefit of the improvement in educational attainment during the period investigated was significantly offset by the changes primarily in marital status (the ratios of unmarried and divorced subjects increased for both genders) and in age distribution (the ratio of the elderly persons increased for both genders). The results of our study emphasise the inverse relationship between suicide and educational level and support the hypothesis that we can regard educational policy as indirect health policy."
https://openalex.org/W3094018193,"Transient species, which do not maintain self-sustaining populations in a system where they are observed, are ubiquitous in nature and their presence often impacts the interpretation of ecological patterns and processes. Identifying transient species from temporal occupancy, the proportion of time a species is observed at a given site over a time series, is subject to classification errors as a result of imperfect detection and source-sink dynamics. We use a simulation-based approach to assess how often errors in detection or classification occur in order to validate the use of temporal occupancy as a metric for inferring whether a species is a core or transient member of a community. We found that low detection increases error in the classification of core species, while high habitat heterogeneity and high detection increase error in classification of transient species. These findings confirm that temporal occupancy is a valid metric for inferring whether a species can maintain a self-sustaining population, but imperfect detection, low abundance, and highly heterogeneous landscapes may yield high misclassification rates."
https://openalex.org/W3094317887,"It has been shown that community-level social capital may affect residents’ health. The present mixed ecological study assesses the evidence for an association between the community-level social capital and the individual level of self-rated health. The Hakui City Health Interview Survey targeted 15,242 people aged 40 years and older from 11 communities. Among them, 6578 residents responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 43.2%). We examined whether the community-level social capital (general trust, norm, and civic participation) was associated with the individual level of self-rated health. Overall, 1919 (29.1%) answers of self-rated poor health were identified. Community-level civic participation was negatively associated with poor self-rated health after adjusting for individual demographic factors, individual social capitals, and community-level economic status, whereas community-level general trust, and norm were not significant. The findings suggest the importance of fostering communities with high civic participation to reduce the poor health status of residents."
https://openalex.org/W3094338841,"In recent years, the ex situ population of the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes; ferret) has experienced a decline in normal sperm morphology (from 50% to 20%), which may be linked to inbreeding depression and/or a dietary change. We examined the effects of adding carcass and vitamin E to the diet on stress and reproductive biomarkers in male ferrets (n = 42 males including 16 juveniles and 26 adults) housed at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center (Carr, CO, USA). Fecal samples (3x/week) were collected from November and December (pre-breeding season, no diet change), February through May (breeding season, diet change) and June (post-breeding season, diet change) and analyzed for fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) via a corticosterone enzyme immunoassay (EIA). A subset of samples from adult males (n = 15) were analyzed for fecal androgen metabolites (FAM) via a testosterone EIA. We first used a linear mixed effects model to identify the important fixed effects among meat treatment, vitamin E treatment, age class (juvenile or adult), and all possible interactions on each hormone. We then examined the important factor's effects across seasons using the non-parametric Friedman test. We found that age did not influence (p = 0.33) FGMs; however there was a significant effect of meat treatment on FGM (p = 0.04) and an effect of vitamin E on FAMs (p 0.05) between during and post-breeding season periods. Males that were not fed carcass had higher (p 0.05). Males supplemented with vitamin E had higher (p<0.001) FAM than non-supplemented males during the breeding season only. For both groups, FAM was highest (p<0.05) during the breeding season. In conclusion, adding carcass to the diet can reduce glucocorticoid production and adding vitamin E can increase testosterone during the breeding season, which may influence reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W3094613435,"Mental health and wellness research continue to be a topic of importance among veterinary students in the United States of America (US). Limited peer reviewed literature focusing on South African veterinary students is available. South African veterinary medical students might benefit from approaches to improve mental health and wellness similar to those recommended in the US. However, these recommendations may not address the underlying risk factors for mental health and wellness concerns or mismatch resources available to South African veterinary medical students. The purpose of this collaborative study was to compare the mental health and wellness among veterinary students enrolled at the University of California, Davis (UCD), and the University of Pretoria (UP), the only veterinary school in South Africa. Our primary research question was; Are the measures of mental health and wellness for students at similar stages in the veterinary curriculum different between the two schools? We hypothesized that mental health and wellness as determined by assessment of anxiety, burnout, depression, and quality of life between the two schools is different. A cross-sectional study of 102 students from UCD and 74 students from UP, at similar preclinical stages (Year 2 for UCD and Year 4 for UP) of the veterinary curriculum was performed. Anxiety, burnout, depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Short Form-8 (SF-8), respectively. Students from both schools had moderate levels of anxiety, high levels of burnout, mild to moderate levels of depression, poor mental health, and good physical health. Our results suggest that similar mental health and wellness concerns in South African veterinary students is comparable with concerns in veterinary medical students in the US. Recommendations and resources to improve mental health and wellness in US veterinary medical students might be applicable to South African veterinary medical students."
https://openalex.org/W3093707162,"Purpose To evaluate the long-term effect of 20 and 23 gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) on intraocular pressure (IOP). Methods Study type: Monocentric retrospective cohort study. 249 eyes of 249 patients undergoing PPV due to epiretinal membrane (EM), idiopathic macular hole (IMH) or vitreoretinal traction (VT) were included. The fellow eye served as control. Exclusion criteria were factors known to influence the IOP, such as cataract surgery during follow-up, extended use of steroids, cryotherapy and silicone oil endotamponade. The relative change of IOP (operated vs. fellow eye) at 6-12 months after surgery was defined as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the relative change of IOP at 3-6 and 12-24 months. Possible influencing cofactors were analysed using ANCOVA. Results The primary endpoint did not show a significant IOP reduction of the operated eye relative to the fellow eye (P = 0.089, n = 84). However, the IOP of the operated eye alone was significantly reduced at 6-12 and 12-24 months after surgery (-0.75 ± 2.80 and -1.22 ± 3.29 mmHg, P = 0.008 and 0.007, respectively). The IOP of the fellow eye was also significantly reduced at the 12-24 months period (-0.75 ± 2.73 mmHg, P = 0.008). In the subgroup analysis, sclerotomy size was a significant influencing cofactor, leading to lower IOP after 20G compared to 23G vitrectomy (P = 0.04). Conclusion Pars plana vitrectomy did not induce a significant long-term IOP reduction relative to the contralateral eye. However, we observed a IOP lowering potential in 20G vitrectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3094170481,"Fibrosis is a chronic disease with heterogeneous clinical presentation, rate of progression, and occurrence of comorbidities. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) is a rare rheumatic autoimmune disease that encompasses several aspects of fibrosis, including highly variable fibrotic manifestation and rate of progression. The development of effective treatments is limited by these variabilities. The fibrotic response is characterized by both chronic inflammation and extracellular remodeling. Therefore, there is a need for improved understanding of which inflammation-related genes contribute to the ongoing turnover of extracellular matrix that accompanies disease. We have developed a multi-tiered method using Naïve Bayes modeling that is capable of predicting level of disease and clinical assessment of patients based on expression of a curated 60-gene panel that profiles inflammation and extracellular matrix production in the fibrotic disease state. Our novel modeling design, incorporating global and parametric-based methods, was highly accurate in distinguishing between severity groups, highlighting the importance of these genes in disease. We refined this gene set to a 12-gene index that can accurately identify SSc patient disease state subsets and informs knowledge of the central regulatory pathways in disease progression."
