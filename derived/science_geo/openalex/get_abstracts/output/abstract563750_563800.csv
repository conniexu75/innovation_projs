https://openalex.org/W2462403219,"Intraoral digital impressions have been stated to meet the clinical requirements for some teeth-supported restorations, though fewer evidences were proposed for larger scanning range. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy (trueness and precision) of intraoral digital impressions for whole upper jaws, including the full dentitions and palatal soft tissues, as well as to determine the effect of different palatal vault height or arch width on accuracy of intraoral digital impressions. Thirty-two volunteers were divided into three groups according to the palatal vault height or arch width. Each volunteer received three scans with TRIOS intraoral scanner and one conventional impression of whole upper jaw. Three-dimensional (3D) images digitized from conventional gypsum casts by a laboratory scanner were chose as the reference models. All datasets were imported to a specific software program for 3D analysis by ""best fit alignment"" and ""3D compare"" process. Color-coded deviation maps showed qualitative visualization of the deviations. For the digital impressions for palatal soft tissues, trueness was (130.54±33.95)μm and precision was (55.26±11.21)μm. For the digital impressions for upper full dentitions, trueness was (80.01±17.78)μm and precision was (59.52±11.29)μm. Larger deviations were found between intraoral digital impressions and conventional impressions in the areas of palatal soft tissues than that in the areas of full dentitions (p<0.001). Precision of digital impressions for palatal soft tissues was slightly better than that for full dentitions (p = 0.049). There was no significant effect of palatal vault height on accuracy of digital impressions for palatal soft tissues (p>0.05), but arch width was found to have a significant effect on precision of intraoral digital impressions for full dentitions (p = 0.016). A linear correlation was found between arch width and precision of digital impressions for whole upper jaws (r = 0.326, p = 0.034 for palatal soft tissues and r = 0.485, p = 0.002 for full dentitions). It was feasible to use the intraoral scanner to obtain digital impressions for whole upper jaws. Wider dental arch contributed to lower precision of an intraoral digital impression. It should be confirmed in further studies that whether accuracy of digital impressions for whole upper jaws is clinically acceptable."
https://openalex.org/W2470103967,"Aggregates of abnormal proteins are widely observed in neuronal and glial cells of patients with various neurodegenerative diseases, and it has been proposed that prion-like behavior of these proteins can account for not only the onset but also the progression of these diseases. However, it is not yet clear which abnormal protein structures function most efficiently as seeds for prion-like propagation. In this study, we aimed to identify the most pathogenic species of α-synuclein (α-syn), the main component of the Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that are observed in α-synucleinopathies. We prepared various forms of α-syn protein and examined their seeding properties in vitro in cells and in mouse experimental models. We also characterized these α-syn species by means of electron microscopy and thioflavin fluorescence assays and found that fragmented β sheet-rich fibrous structures of α-syn with a length of 50 nm or less are the most efficient promoters of accumulation of phosphorylated α-syn, which is the hallmark of α-synucleinopathies. These results indicate that fragmented amyloid-like aggregates of short α-syn fibrils are the key pathogenic seeds that trigger prion-like conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2341468445,"Finding relevant publications is important for scientists who have to cope with exponentially increasing numbers of scholarly material. Algorithms can help with this task as they help for music, movie, and product recommendations. However, we know little about the performance of these algorithms with scholarly material. Here, we develop an algorithm, and an accompanying Python library, that implements a recommendation system based on the content of articles. Design principles are to adapt to new content, provide near-real time suggestions, and be open source. We tested the library on 15K posters from the Society of Neuroscience Conference 2015. Human curated topics are used to cross validate parameters in the algorithm and produce a similarity metric that maximally correlates with human judgments. We show that our algorithm significantly outperformed suggestions based on keywords. The work presented here promises to make the exploration of scholarly material faster and more accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2474518039,"We previously proposed that hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation is a key event in the development of diabetic complications. Interestingly, some common aspects exist between hyperglycemia and hypoxia-induced phenomena. Thus, hyperglycemia may induce cellular hypoxia, and this phenomenon may also be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. In endothelial cells (ECs), cellular hypoxia increased after incubation with high glucose (HG). A similar phenomenon was observed in glomeruli of diabetic mice. HG-induced cellular hypoxia was suppressed by mitochondria blockades or manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) overexpression, which is a specific SOD for mtROS. Overexpression of MnSOD also increased the expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water and oxygen channel. AQP1 overexpression in ECs suppressed hyperglycemia-induced cellular hypoxia, endothelin-1 and fibronectin overproduction, and apoptosis. Therefore, hyperglycemia-induced cellular hypoxia and mtROS generation may promote hyperglycemic damage in a coordinated manner."
https://openalex.org/W2474883340,"The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is an important commercial farmed herbivorous fish species in China, but is susceptible to Aeromonas hydrophila infections. In the present study, we performed de novo RNA-Seq sequencing of spleen tissue from specimens of a disease-resistant family, which were given intra-peritoneal injections containing PBS with or without a dose of A. hydrophila. The fish were sampled from the control group at 0 h, and from the experimental group at 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. 122.18 million clean reads were obtained from the normalized cDNA libraries; these were assembled into 425,260 contigs and then 191,795 transcripts. Of those, 52,668 transcripts were annotated with the NCBI Nr database, and 41,347 of the annotated transcripts were assigned into 90 functional groups. 20,569 unigenes were classified into six main categories, including 38 secondary KEGG pathways. 2,992 unigenes were used in the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 89 of the putative DEGs were related to the immune system and 41 of them were involved in the complement and coagulation cascades pathway. This study provides insights into the complement and complement-related pathways involved in innate immunity, through expression profile analysis of the genomic resources in C. idella. We conclude that complement and complement-related genes play important roles during defense against A. hydrophila infection. The immune response is activated at 4 h after the bacterial injections, indicating that the complement pathways are activated at the early stage of bacterial infection. The study has improved our understanding of the immune response mechanisms in C. idella to bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2472865244,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development of chronic periodontitis. Tissue macrophages are amongst the first immune cells to respond to bacteria and depending on the cytokine profile at the infection site, macrophages are primed to react to infection in different ways. Priming of naive macrophages with IFN-γ produces a classical pro-inflammatory, antibacterial M1 macrophage after TLR ligation, whereas priming with IL-4 induces an anti-inflammatory tissue-repair M2 phenotype. Previous work has shown that M1 are preferentially generated in gingival tissue following infection with P. gingivalis. However, few studies have investigated the interactions of macrophage subsets with P. gingivalis cells. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of naive, M1 and M2 macrophages to phagocytose P. gingivalis and investigate how this interaction affects both the bacterial cell and the macrophage. M1 and M2 macrophages were both found to have enhanced phagocytic capacity compared with that of naive macrophages, however only the naive and M1 macrophages were able to produce a respiratory burst in order to clear the bacteria from the phagosome. P. gingivalis was found to persist in naive and M2, but not M1 macrophages for 24 hours. Phagocytosis of P. gingivalis also induced high levels of TNF-α, IL-12 and iNOS in M1 macrophages, but not in naive or M2 macrophages. Furthermore, infection of macrophages with P. gingivalis at high bacteria to macrophage ratios, while inducing an inflammatory response, was also found to be deleterious to macrophage longevity, with high levels of apoptotic cell death found in macrophages after infection. The activation of M1 macrophages observed in this study may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of a pro-inflammatory state during chronic periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2462888294,"Offspring of older mothers are at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, childhood cancers, type 1 diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The underlying biologic mechanisms for most of these associations remain obscure. One possibility is that maternal aging may produce lasting changes in the epigenetic features of a child’s DNA. To test this, we explored the association of mothers’ age at pregnancy with methylation in her offspring, using blood samples from 890 Norwegian newborns and measuring DNA methylation at more than 450,000 CpG sites across the genome. We examined replication of a maternal-age finding in an independent group of 1062 Norwegian newborns, and then in 200 US middle-aged women. Older maternal age was significantly associated with reduced methylation at four adjacent CpGs near the 2nd exon of KLHL35 in newborns (p-values ranging from 3x10-6 to 8x10-7). These associations were replicated in the independent set of newborns, and replicated again in women 40 to 60 years after their birth. This study provides the first example of parental age permanently affecting the epigenetic profile of offspring. While the specific functions of the affected gene are unknown, this finding opens the possibility that a mother’s age at pregnancy could affect her child’s health through epigenetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2468587667,"The Middle Stone Age (MSA) of southern Africa, and in particular its Still Bay and Howiesons Poort lithic traditions, represents a period of dramatic subsistence, cultural, and technological innovation by our species, Homo sapiens. Climate change has frequently been postulated as a primary driver of the appearance of these innovative behaviours, with researchers invoking either climate instability as a reason for the development of buffering mechanisms, or environmentally stable refugia as providing a stable setting for experimentation. Testing these alternative models has proved intractable, however, as existing regional palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records remain spatially, stratigraphically, and chronologically disconnected from the archaeological record. Here we report high-resolution records of environmental shifts based on stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in ostrich eggshell (OES) fragments, faunal remains, and shellfish assemblages excavated from two key MSA archaeological sequences, Blombos Cave and Klipdrift Shelter. We compare these records with archaeological material remains in the same strata. The results from both sites, spanning the periods 98–73 ka and 72–59 ka, respectively, show significant changes in vegetation, aridity, rainfall seasonality, and sea temperature in the vicinity of the sites during periods of human occupation. While these changes clearly influenced human subsistence strategies, we find that the remarkable cultural and technological innovations seen in the sites cannot be linked directly to climate shifts. Our results demonstrate the need for scale-appropriate, on-site testing of behavioural-environmental links, rather than broader, regional comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W2473161167,"Although there are studies showing that mobile phone solutions can improve health service delivery outcomes in the developed world, there is little empirical evidence that demonstrates the impact of mHealth interventions on key maternal health outcomes in low income settings.A non-randomized controlled study was conducted in the Amhara region, Ethiopia in 10 health facilities (5 intervention, 5 control) together serving around 250,000 people. Health workers in the intervention group received an android phone (3 phones per facility) loaded with an application that sends reminders for scheduled visits during antenatal care (ANC), delivery and postnatal care (PNC), and educational messages on dangers signs and common complaints during pregnancy. The intervention was developed at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. Primary outcomes were the percentage of women who had at least 4 ANC visits, institutional delivery and PNC visits at the health center after 12 months of implementation of the intervention.Overall 933 and 1037 women were included in the cross-sectional surveys at baseline and at follow-up respectively. In addition, the medical records of 1224 women who had at least one antenatal care visit were followed in the longitudinal study. Women who had their ANC visit in the intervention health centers were significantly more likely to deliver their baby in the same health center compared to the control group (43.1% versus 28.4%; Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.98 (95%CI 1.53-2.55)). A significantly higher percentage of women who had ANC in the intervention group had PNC in the same health center compared to the control health centers (41.2% versus 21.1%: AOR: 2.77 (95%CI 2.12-3.61)).Our findings demonstrated that a locally customized mHealth application during ANC can significantly improve delivery and postnatal care service utilization possibly through positively influencing the behavior of health workers and their clients."
https://openalex.org/W2474545121,"Sociologists coined the term “anomie” to describe societies that are characterized by disintegration and deregulation. Extending beyond conceptualizations of anomie that conflate the measurements of anomie as ‘a state of society’ and as a ‘state of mind’, we disentangle these conceptualizations and develop an analysis and measure of this phenomenon focusing on anomie as a perception of the ‘state of society’. We propose that anomie encompasses two dimensions: a perceived breakdown in social fabric (i.e., disintegration as lack of trust and erosion of moral standards) and a perceived breakdown in leadership (i.e., deregulation as lack of legitimacy and effectiveness of leadership). Across six studies we present evidence for the validity of the new measure, the Perception of Anomie Scale (PAS). Studies 1a and 1b provide evidence for the proposed factor structure and internal consistency of PAS. Studies 2a-c provide evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Finally, assessing PAS in 28 countries, we show that PAS correlates with national indicators of societal functioning and that PAS predicts national identification and well-being (Studies 3a & 3b). The broader implications of the anomie construct for the study of group processes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2475059841,"Background The Internet has increasingly been studied as mode of delivery for interventions targeting problematic alcohol use. Most interventions have been fully automated, but some research suggests that adding counselor guidance may improve alcohol consumption outcomes. Methods An eight-module Internet-based self-help program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was tested among Internet help-seekers. Eighty participants with problematic alcohol use according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; scores of ≥ 6 for women and ≥ 8 for men) were recruited online from an open access website and randomized into three different groups. All groups were offered the same self-help program, but participants in two of the three groups received Internet-based counselor guidance in addition to the self-help program. One of the guidance groups was given a choice between guidance via asynchronous text messages or synchronous text-based chat, while the other guidance group received counselor guidance via asynchronous text messages only. Results In the choice group, 65% (13 of 20 participants) chose guidance via asynchronous text messages. At the 10-week post-treatment follow-up, an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that participants in the two guidance groups (choice and messages) reported significantly lower past week alcohol consumption compared to the group without guidance; 10.8 (SD = 12.1) versus 22.6 (SD = 18.4); p = 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.77. Participants in both guidance groups reported significantly lower scores on the AUDIT at follow-up compared to the group without guidance, with a mean score of 14.4 (SD = 5.2) versus 18.2 (SD = 5.9); p = 0.003; Cohen’s d = 0.68. A higher proportion of participants in the guidance groups said that they would recommend the program compared to the group without guidance (81% for choice; 93% for messages versus 47% for self-help). Conclusion Self-help programs for problematic alcohol use can be more effective in reducing alcohol consumption over a 10-week period when counselor guidance is added.

Design A pre-intervention / post-intervention / follow up control group design with clustered random allocation of participants to groups was used. The “control” group received “Training as Usual” (TAU). Method Participants were 45 career recruits within the recruit school at the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) in Western Australia. The intervention group received a four-hour resilience training intervention (Mental Agility and Psychological Strength training) as part of their recruit training school curriculum. Data was collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-months post intervention. Results We found no evidence that the intervention was effective in the primary prevention of mental health issues, nor did we find any significant impact of MAPS training on social support or coping strategies. A significant difference across conditions in trauma knowledge is indicative of some impact of the MAPS program. Conclusion While the key hypotheses were not supported, this study is the first randomised control trial investigating the primary prevention of PTSD. Practical barriers around the implementation of this program, including constraints within the recruit school, may inform the design and implementation of similar programs in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2470570848,"Edges have become prevailing habitats, mainly as a result of habitat fragmentation and agricultural expansion. The interchange of functionally relevant organisms like insects occurs through these edges and can influence ecosystem functioning in both crop and non-crop habitats. However, very few studies have focused on the directionality of insect movement through edges, and the role of crop and non-crop amount has been ignored. Using bi-directional flight interception traps we investigated interchange of herbivore, natural enemy, pollinator and detritivore insects between native forest fragments and soybean crops, simultaneously considering movement direction, forest cover in the landscape and crop phenology. In total, 52,173 specimens and 877 morphospecies were collected. We found that, within most functional and taxonomic groups, movement intensity was similar (richness and/or abundance) between directions, whereas a predominantly forest-to-crop movement characterized natural enemies. Insect movement was extensively affected by crop phenology, decreasing during crop senescence, and was enhanced by forest cover particularly at senescence. Mainly the same herbivore species moved to and from the forest, but different natural enemy species predominated in each direction. Finally, our analyses revealed greater forest contribution to natural enemy than to herbivore communities in the crop, fading with distance to the forest in both groups. By showing that larger amounts of forest lead to richer insect interchange, in both directions and in four functional groups, our study suggests that allocation to natural and cultivated habitats at landscape level could influence functioning of both systems. Moreover, natural enemies seemed to benefit more than pests from natural vegetation, with natural enemy spillover from forests likely contributing to pest control in soybean fields. Thus consequences of insect interchange seem to be mostly positive for the agroecosystem, although consequences for the natural system deserve further study."
https://openalex.org/W2461086509,"Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) support diverse communities of marine organisms with changes in community structure occurring along a depth gradient. In recent years, MCEs have gained attention due to their depths that provide protection from natural and anthropogenic stressors and their relative stability over evolutionary time periods, yet ecological structures of fish assemblages in MCEs remain largely un-documented. Here, we investigated composition and trophic structure of reef fish assemblages in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) along a depth gradient from 1 to 67 m. The structure of reef fish assemblages as a whole showed a clear gradient from shallow to mesophotic depths. Fish assemblages at mesophotic depths had higher total densities than those in shallower waters, and were characterized by relatively high densities of planktivores and invertivores and relatively low densities of herbivores. Fishes that typified assemblages at mesophotic depths included six species that are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The present study showed that mesophotic reefs in the NWHI support unique assemblages of fish that are characterized by high endemism and relatively high densities of planktivores. Our findings underscore the ecological importance of these undersurveyed ecosystems and warrant further studies of MCEs."
https://openalex.org/W2472267260,"Elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels correlates with tumor grade and poor prognosis in cancer patients. IL-6 has been shown to promote tumor lymphangiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) induction in tumor cells. We recently showed that IL-6 also induced VEGF-C expression in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). However, the signaling mechanisms involved in IL-6-induces VEGF-C induction in LECs remain incompletely understood. In this study, we explored the causal role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in inducing VEGF-C expression in IL-6-stimulated murine LECs (SV-LECs). FAK signaling blockade by NSC 667249 (a FAK inhibitor) attenuated IL-6-induced VEGF-C expression and VEGF-C promoter-luciferase activities. IL-6's enhancing effects of increasing FAK, ERK1/2, p38MAPK, C/EBPβ, p65 and STAT3 phosphorylation as well as C/EBPβ-, κB- and STAT3-luciferase activities were reduced in the presence of NSC 667249. STAT3 knockdown by STAT3 siRNA abrogated IL-6's actions in elevating VEGF-C mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, Src-FAK signaling blockade reduced IL-6's enhancing effects of increasing STAT3 binding to the VEGF-C promoter region, cell migration and endothelial tube formation of SV-LECs. Together these results suggest that IL-6 increases VEGF-C induction and lymphangiogenesis may involve, at least in part, Src-FAK-STAT3 cascade in LECs."
https://openalex.org/W2469870057,"A decrease in insulin sensitivity enhances adipose tissue lipolysis helping early lactation cows counteracting their energy deficit. However, excessive lipolysis poses serious health risks for cows, and its underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. The present study used targeted ESI-LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics and indirect insulin sensitivity measurements to evaluate metabolic alterations in the serum of dairy cows of various parities experiencing variable lipolysis early postpartum. Thirty (12 primiparous and 18 multiparous) cows of Holstein Friesian and Simmental breeds, fed the same diet and kept under the same management conditions, were sampled at d 21 postpartum and classified as low (n = 10), medium (n = 8), and high (n = 12) lipolysis groups, based on serum concentration of nonesterified fatty acids. Overall, excessive lipolysis in the high group came along with impaired estimated insulin sensitivity and characteristic shifts in acylcarnitine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and lysophospholipid metabolome profiles compared to the low group. From the detected phosphatidylcholines mainly those with diacyl-residues showed differences among lipolysis groups. Furthermore, more than half of the detected sphingomyelins were increased in cows experiencing high lipomobilization. Additionally, strong differences in serum acylcarnitines were noticed among lipolysis groups. The study suggests an altered serum phospholipidome in dairy cows associated with an increase in certain long-chain sphingomyelins and the progression of disturbed insulin function. In conclusion, the present study revealed 37 key metabolites as part of alterations in the synthesis or breakdown of sphingolipids and phospholipids associated with lowered estimated insulin sensitivity and excessive lipolysis in early-lactating cows."
https://openalex.org/W2467050617,"Remains of theropod dinosaurs are very rare in Northern Germany because the area was repeatedly submerged by a shallow epicontinental sea during the Mesozoic. Here, 80 Late Jurassic theropod teeth are described of which the majority were collected over decades from marine carbonates in nowadays abandoned and backfilled quarries of the 19th century. Eighteen different morphotypes (A—R) could be distinguished and 3D models based on micro-CT scans of the best examples of all morphotypes are included as supplements. The teeth were identified with the assistance of discriminant function analysis and cladistic analysis based on updated datamatrices. The results show that a large variety of theropod groups were present in the Late Jurassic of northern Germany. Identified specimens comprise basal Tyrannosauroidea, as well as Allosauroidea, Megalosauroidea cf. Marshosaurus, Megalosauridae cf. Torvosaurus and probably Ceratosauria. The formerly reported presence of Dromaeosauridae in the Late Jurassic of northern Germany could not be confirmed. Some teeth of this study resemble specimens described as pertaining to Carcharodontosauria (morphotype A) and Abelisauridae (morphotype K). This interpretation is however, not supported by discriminant function analysis and cladistic analysis. Two smaller morphotypes (N and Q) differ only in some probably size-related characteristics from larger morphotypes (B and C) and could well represent juveniles of adult specimens. The similarity of the northern German theropods with groups from contemporaneous localities suggests faunal exchange via land-connections in the Late Jurassic between Germany, Portugal and North America."
https://openalex.org/W2475364998,"Black people are at increased risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Whether clinical presentation of TTP in Black patients has specific features is unknown. We assessed here differences in TTP presentation and outcome between Black and White patients. Clinical presentation was comparable between both ethnic groups. However, prognosis differed with a lower death rate in Black patients than in White patients (2.7% versus 11.6%, respectively, P = .04). Ethnicity, increasing age and neurologic involvement were retained as risk factors for death in a multivariable model (P < .05 all). Sixty-day overall survival estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the Log-Rank test confirmed that Black patients had a better survival than White patients (P = .03). Salvage therapies were similarly performed between both groups, suggesting that disease severity was comparable. The comparison of HLA-DRB1*11, -DRB1*04 and -DQB1*03 allele frequencies between Black patients and healthy Black individuals revealed no significant difference. However, the protective allele against TTP, HLA-DRB1*04, was dramatically decreased in Black individuals in comparison with White individuals. Black people with TTP may have a better survival than White patients despite a comparable disease severity. A low natural frequency of HLA-DRB1*04 in Black ethnicity may account for the greater risk of TTP in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2463787062,"Wide-spread fasciculations are a characteristic feature in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting motor axonal hyperexcitability. Previous excitability studies have shown increased nodal persistent sodium conductances and decreased potassium currents in motor axons of ALS patients, both of the changes inducing hyperexcitability. Altered axonal excitability potentially contributes to motor neuron death in ALS, but the relationship of the extent of motor neuronal death and abnormal excitability has not been fully elucidated. We performed multiple nerve excitability measurements in the median nerve at the wrist of 140 ALS patients and analyzed the relationship of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude (index of motor neuronal loss) and excitability indices, such as strength-duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, recovery cycle and current-threshold relationships. Compared to age-matched normal controls (n = 44), ALS patients (n = 140) had longer strength-duration time constant (SDTC: a measure of nodal persistent sodium current; p < 0.05), greater threshold changes in depolarizing threshold electrotonus (p < 0.05) and depolarizing current threshold relationship (i.e. less accommodation; (p < 0.05), greater superexcitability (a measure of fast potassium current; p < 0.05) and reduced late subexcitability (a measure of slow potassium current; p < 0.05), suggesting increased persistent sodium currents and decreased potassium currents. The reduced potassium currents were found even in the patient subgroups with normal CMAP (> 5mV). Regression analyses showed that SDTC (R = -0.22) and depolarizing threshold electrotonus (R = -0.22) increased with CMAP decline. These findings suggest that motor nerve hyperexcitability occurs in the early stage of the disease, and precedes motor neuronal loss in ALS. Modulation of altered ion channel function could be a treatment option for ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2461691091,"Tau proteins are abnormally aggregated in a range of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, tau has emerged as an extensively post-translationally modified protein, among which lysine acetylation is critical for normal tau function and its pathological aggregation. Here, we demonstrate that tau isoforms have different propensities to undergo lysine acetylation, with auto-acetylation occurring more prominently within the lysine-rich microtubule-binding repeats. Unexpectedly, we identified a unique intrinsic property of tau in which auto-acetylation induces proteolytic tau cleavage, thereby generating distinct N- and C-terminal tau fragments. Supporting a catalytic reaction-based mechanism, mapping and mutagenesis studies showed that tau cysteines, which are required for acetyl group transfer, are also essential for auto-proteolytic tau processing. Further mass spectrometry analysis identified the C-terminal 2nd and 4th microtubule binding repeats as potential sites of auto-cleavage. The identification of acetylation-mediated auto-proteolysis provides a new biochemical mechanism for tau self-regulation and warrants further investigation into whether auto-catalytic functions of tau are implicated in AD and other tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2466411120,"Copepods, small aquatic crustaceans, are the most abundant metazoan zooplankton and outnumber every other group of multicellular animals on earth. In spite of ecological and biological importance in aquatic environment, their morphological plasticity, originated from their various lifestyles and their incomparable capacity to adapt to a variety of environments, has made the identification of species challenging, even for expert taxonomists. Molecular approaches to species identification have allowed rapid detection, discrimination, and identification of cryptic or sibling species based on DNA sequence data. We examined sequence variation of a partial mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene (COI) from 133 copepod individuals collected from the Korean Peninsula, in order to identify and discriminate 94 copepod species covering six copepod orders of Calanoida, Cyclopoida, Harpacticoida, Monstrilloida, Poecilostomatoida and Siphonostomatoida. The results showed that there exists a clear gap with ca. 20 fold difference between the averages of within-specific sequence divergence (2.42%) and that of between-specific sequence divergence (42.79%) in COI, suggesting the plausible utility of this gene in delimitating copepod species. The results showed, with the COI barcoding data among 94 copepod species, that a copepod species could be distinguished from the others very clearly, only with four exceptions as followings: Mesocyclops dissimilis–Mesocyclops pehpeiensis (0.26% K2P distance in percent) and Oithona davisae–Oithona similis (1.1%) in Cyclopoida, Ostrincola japonica–Pseudomyicola spinosus (1.5%) in Poecilostomatoida, and Hatschekia japonica–Caligus quadratus (5.2%) in Siphonostomatoida. Thus, it strongly indicated that COI may be a useful tool in identifying various copepod species and make an initial progress toward the construction of a comprehensive DNA barcode database for copepods inhabiting the Korean Peninsula."
https://openalex.org/W2471674245,"The biosynthesis of iron sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in Bacillus subtilis is mediated by a SUF-type gene cluster, consisting of the cysteine desulfurase SufS, the scaffold protein SufU, and the putative chaperone complex SufB/SufC/SufD. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of the SufS homodimer in its product-bound state (i.e., in complex with pyrodoxal-5ʹ-phosphate, alanine, Cys361-persulfide). By performing hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/DX) experiments, we characterized the interaction of SufS with SufU and demonstrate that SufU induces an opening of the active site pocket of SufS. Recent data indicate that frataxin could be involved in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis by facilitating iron incorporation. H/DX experiments show that frataxin indeed interacts with the SufS/SufU complex at the active site. Our findings deepen the current understanding of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, a complex yet essential process, in the model organism B. subtilis."

A total of 132 sub-adult and adult Atlantic sturgeon were tagged in Minas Basin during the summers of 2010–2014 using pressure measuring, uniquely coded, acoustic transmitters with a four or eight year life span. The aim of this study was to examine spatial and seasonal distribution of sturgeon in Minas Passage during 2010–2014 and test the hypothesis that, when present, Atlantic sturgeon were evenly distributed from north to south across Minas Passage. This information is important as tidal energy extraction using in-stream, hydrokinetic turbines is planned for only the northern portion of Minas Passage. Electronic tracking data from a total of 740 sturgeon days over four years demonstrated that Atlantic sturgeon used the southern portion of Minas Passage significantly more than the northern portion. Sturgeon moved through Minas Passage at depths mostly between 15 and 45 m (n = 10,116; mean = 31.47 m; SD = 14.88). Sturgeon mean swimming depth was not significantly related to bottom depth and in deeper regions they swam pelagically. Sturgeon predominately migrated inward through Minas Passage during spring, and outward during late summer-autumn. Sturgeon were not observed in Minas Passage during winter 2012–2013 when monitoring receivers were present. This information will enable the estimation of encounters of Atlantic sturgeon with in-stream hydrokinetic turbines."

The functional properties and subunit arrangement of these receptors are controversial. We predefined subunit arrangement by using subunit concatenation. α4, β2, and δ subunits were concatenated to dimeric, trimeric, and, in some cases, pentameric subunits. We constructed in total nine different receptor pentamers in at least two different ways and expressed them in Xenopus oocytes. The δ subunit was substituted in any of the five positions in the α1β2 receptor. In addition, we investigated all receptors with the 2:2:1 subunit stoichiometry for α4, β2, and δ. Several functional receptors were obtained. Interestingly, all of these receptors had very similar EC50 values for GABA in the presence of the neurosteroid 3α, 21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (THDOC). All functional receptors containing δ subunits were sensitive to 4-chloro-N-[2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl]benzamide (DS2). Moreover, none of the receptors was affected by ethanol up to 30 mm. These properties recapitulate those of non-concatenated receptors expressed from a cRNA ratio of 1:1:5 coding for α4, β2, and δ subunits.

GABAA receptors are the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS and are a therapeutic target for several drugs. They form heteropentamers made up of distinct subunit combinations selected from the following different subunit isoforms: α(1–6), β(1–4), γ(1–3), δ, ϵ, θ, π, and ρ(1–3). The five subunits form a central chloride ion-selective channel (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. GABAA receptor channels.Annu. Rev.

Atomic force microscopy of recombinant α4β3δ receptors expressed in either the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or in the plasma membrane of tsA 201 cells has suggested that the δ subunit is able to substitute for the γ2 subunit (18Barrera N.P.

Structural work on α4β2δ GABAA receptors expressed in HEK cells indicated that subunit stoichiometry is highly influenced by the ratio of subunit cDNAs transfected and that more than one δ subunit can assemble into a pentamer (19Wagoner K.R.

It should be noted that such structural work cannot differentiate between functional and non-functional receptors. Therefore, functional strategies are of special interest.

Receptor concatenation predefines subunit composition and arrangement. Electrophysiological analysis provides functional properties of these receptors. So far, subunit concatenation has been applied to approach the architecture of α1β2γ2 GABAA receptors (7Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. Subunit arrangement of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors.J.

In addition, the technique has contributed to the finding that the assembly of ϵ subunits is promiscuous (24Bollan K.A. Baur R. Hales T.G. Sigel E. Connolly C.N. The promiscuous role of the ϵ subunit in GABAA receptor biogenesis.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 37: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to use subunit concatenation to understand subunit arrangement in α4β2δ receptors have indicated that the δ subunit simply replaces the γ2 subunit in the classical arrangement (25Shu H.J. Bracamontes J. Taylor A. Wu K. Eaton M.M. Akk G. Manion B. Evers A.S. Krishnan K. Covey D.F. Zorumski C.F. Steinbach J.H. Mennerick S. Characteristics of concatemeric GABAA receptors containing α4/δ subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 2228-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Later, the same group reported that various subunit arrangements may result in functional receptors (26Eaton M.M. Bracamontes J. Shu H.J. Li P. Mennerick S. Steinbach J.H. Akk G. γ-aminobutyric acid type A α4, β2, and δ subunits assemble to produce more than one functionally distinct receptor type.Mol. Pharmacol. 2014; 86: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this work, we aimed to understand the function and architecture of α4β2δ receptors by combining subunit concatenation and expression in Xenopus oocytes. The receptors were functionally characterized by determining their response to GABA in the presence of THDOC 3The abbreviations used are:THDOC3α, 21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-oneDS24-chloro-N-[2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl]benzamide. and modulation by DS2 and ethanol. We conclude that the δ subunit, together with α4 and β2, does not form one defined receptor but can form, at least in the oocyte, more than one subunit arrangement and that these receptors display similar functional properties. 3α, 21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one 4-chloro-N-[2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl]benzamide. We wanted to get insight into the subunit arrangement of α4βxδ GABAA receptors. As a first step, we had to choose the β subunit subtype. To allow selection, we investigated whether expression of α4β1δ, α4β2δ, or α4β3δ would result in the largest current amplitudes, indicating a preference for subunit assembly. Comparison of these three receptor types revealed no preference (data not shown). We restricted our analysis to functional α4β2δ receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes by applying electrophysiological techniques. Unless stated otherwise, 2.5 fmol cRNA/subunit was injected into an oocyte, an amount that prevents overloading artifacts. For such a study, it would be desirable to construct 30 pentameric concatenated receptors where all five subunits are covalently linked. In a realistic time period, this is impossible. We restricted ourselves to the construction of six dimeric subunit constructs, six trimeric subunit constructs, and two pentameric subunit constructs. We cannot exclude that receptors with alternative subunit arrangements are also functional. GABA acts only as a partial agonist for many δ subunit-containing receptors (15Baur R. Kaur K.H. Sigel E.

Fig. 1A shows current traces from an application of 1 mm GABA followed by application of 1 μm THDOC and, subsequently, by the combination of the two. 1 mm GABA elicited 17% ± 3% (mean ± S.D., n = 5) of the current elicited in the combined presence of 1 mm GABA/1 μm THDOC. Fig. 1B shows a similar experiment with the concatenated receptor β2-α4-δ/α4-β2 (R1). Here the relative current was 32% ± 13% (mean ± S.D., n = 5). For P1 with the same subunit arrangement but all five subunits covalently linked, this value amounted to 19% ± 3% (mean ± S.D., n = 5). THDOC has been reported to potentiate current mediated by δ subunit-containing receptors with no or maximally a 2.6-fold decrease of the EC50 for GABA (16Kaur K.H. Baur R. Sigel E.

Additionally, it has been reported that, in the presence of THDOC, receptors are uncovered that are silent in its absence (16Kaur K.H. Baur R. Sigel E.

The concentration of endogenous neurosteroids near the GABAA receptors in the brain is not known, but it may be assumed that at least part of the receptors are activated by these compounds. For all experiments shown below, except when DS2 was present, we included 1 μm THDOC in the solutions containing GABA. In the following, we first report our observations on the expression of non-concatenated single subunits and combinations of two or three subunits, followed by observations on concatenated receptors. Functional expression of the individual subunits α4, β2, or δ did not result in appreciable currents (Fig. 2). The same was observed for the expression of the δ subunit in combination with α4 or β2 subunits (Fig. 2). The combination of α4 with β2 subunits resulted in robust currents, characterized by an EC50 for GABA of 0.25 ± 0.03 μm (n = 4). It is interesting to note that expression of 5-fold lower amounts of cRNA produced only very tiny currents, but inclusion of small amounts of cRNA coding for the δ subunit (0.25 fmol) to α4β2 rescued functional expression (Fig. 2). We investigated the triple subunit combination α4β2δ injected with genetic information coding for the individual subunits at two different stoichiometries that are often used in work with these receptors (21Karim N. Wellendorph P. Absalom N. Bang L.H. Jensen M.L. Hansen M.M. Lee H.J. Johnston G.A. Hanrahan J.R. Chebib M.

Pharmacol. 2014; 86: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both stoichiometries, 0.5:0.5:2.5 fmol/oocyte and 2.5:0.5:2.5 fmol/oocyte, resulted in robust current expression. Although the first receptor was characterized by an EC50 for GABA of 0.41 ± 0.12 μm (n = 3), the second receptor displayed a biphasic behavior with nanomolar affinities (Fig. 2). As discussed below, we do not think that such a receptor is expressed in vivo. Detailed averaged concentration-response curves are shown in Fig. 3. First we tested all dual- and triple-concatenated subunit constructs individually for current expression. In case of a subunit hanging out, pentameric receptors could be built. The dual subunit constructs α4-β2, α4-δ, β2-δ, δ-α4, and δ-β2 and the triple subunit constructs α4-β2-α4, α4-δ-α4, β2-δ-β2, and δ-β2-α4 did not result in current expression (Fig. 2). β2-α4-δ produced very small currents. Surprisingly, 2.5 fmol cRNA/oocyte coding for β2-α4 and 2.5 fmol cRNA/oocyte coding for β2-α4-β2 both resulted in expression of robust currents, possibly by squeezing out one subunit of a hexameric receptor. Therefore, all pentameric receptors where one of these two constructs forms part of the pentamer should be judged with care. It is worth mentioning that, in previous work using the dual subunit construct β2-α4, the conclusion has been reached that several subunit arrangements can be formed from α4, β2 and δ (25Shu H.J. Bracamontes J. Taylor A. Wu K. Eaton M.M. Akk G. Manion B. Evers A.S. Krishnan K. Covey D.F. Zorumski C.F. Steinbach J.H. Mennerick S.

Bracamontes J. Shu H.J. Li P. Mennerick S. Steinbach J.H. Akk G. γ-aminobutyric acid type A α4, β2, and δ subunits assemble to produce more than one functionally distinct receptor type.Mol. Pharmacol. 2014; 86: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The authors of this study report that >40 fmol cRNA coding for β2-α4 alone did not form functional channels. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear. None of the combinations of the δ subunit with either α4-β2, α4-δ, β2-δ, δ-α4, or δ-β2 resulted in current expression (Fig. 2). Please note that α4-β2/δ may assemble into α4-β2/α4-β2/δ (called R2 below). This fact is discussed below. For the investigation of the putative pentameric arrangement of α4β2δ receptors, we followed two rationales. First, we assumed that the δ subunit would occupy any of the five positions in the classical subunit arrangement of α1β2 GABAA receptors (Fig. 4, top) (7Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E.

A GABAA receptor of defined subunit composition and positioning: concatenation of five subunits.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Second, we assumed a 2:2:1 stoichiometry of α4:β2:δ subunits. As discussed above, this stoichiometry has been found for α4β3δ receptors expressed in HEK cells and claimed to be independent of the ratio of genetic information introduced into a cell (23Patel B. Mortensen M. Smart T.G. Stoichiometry of δ subunit containing GABAA receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These two approaches are discussed in the following. For the first approach, we constructed each receptor, R1 to R5 (Fig. 4), combining free subunits and dual or triple subunit constructs in two to three different ways. For R1, where the δ subunit replaces the β subunit between the two α subunits, both combinations, β2-α4-δ/α4-β2 and α4-δ-α4/β2, could be functionally expressed. The former receptor was characterized by an EC50 for GABA of 0.55 ± 0.11 μm (n = 3). We confirmed these results by constructing the concatenated pentamer P1 and found an EC50 for GABA of 1.45 ± 0.39 μm (n = 3). An about 2-fold increased EC50 for GABA compared with the receptor composed of dual and triple subunit constructs has been observed previously in similar cases (9Baur R. Minier F. Sigel E. A GABAA receptor of defined subunit composition and positioning: concatenation of five subunits.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We conclude that R1 may be one of the formed receptor configurations. It should be noted that this also seems to be a preferred configuration of α1β3δ, α6β3δ, and α1α6β3δ receptors (15Baur R.

An example of a concentration-response curve is given for β2-α4-δ/α4-β2 (R1) as crude current traces (Fig. 5A). Averaged concentration-response curves for β2-α4-δ/α4-β2 (R1), δ-β2-α4/β2-α4 (R5), β2-α4-δ-α4-β2 (P1), and δ-β2-α4-β2-α4 (P5) are shown in Fig. 5B. For R2, where the δ subunit replaces the second β subunit of the two subsequent β subunits, two of the combinations, α4-β2-α4/β2-δ and α4-β2/δ, were silent, whereas the other combination, β2-α4-β2/δ-α4, was functionally expressed and was characterized with an EC50 for GABA of 1.11 ± 0.26 μm (n = 4). This combination contains β2-α4-β2 producing current by itself with similar functional properties as found here. As the EC50 for GABA of the combination was similar to that of the single concatenated subunit, we think that R2 may not be formed. For R3, where the δ subunit replaces the α subunit between two subsequent β subunits and the single β subunit, one of the combinations, β2-δ-β2/α4-β2, was silent, whereas the other combination, β2-α4-β2/β2-δ, was functionally expressed. This combination contains β2-α4-β2 producing current by itself and is characterized by an EC50 for GABA of 0.26 ± 0.04 μm (n = 4). This value is significantly different (Student's t test, p < 0.02) from that characterizing the β2-α4-β2 construct. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the configuration R3 is formed. The fact that β2-δ-β2/α4-β2 is not functionally expressed may indicate that the β/α interface is assembled inefficiently. In line with this hypothesis is the observation that α4-δ-α4/β2 (R1) expresses less efficiently than β2-α4-δ/α4-β2 (R1) and α4-β2-α4/δ-β2 (R5) not at all. For R4, where the δ subunit replaces the α subunit preceding the two subsequent β subunits, one of the combinations, which can also form R3, α4-β2/δ-β2/β2, was silent, whereas the other combination, β2-α4-β2/δ-β2, was functionally expressed. This combination contains β2-α4-β2 producing current by itself and is characterized by an EC50 for GABA of 0.93 ± 0.17 μm (n = 4), similar to the EC50 of β2-α4-β2 expressed alone. We think that R4 may either not be formed or is indistinguishable from β2-α4-β2. For R5, where the δ subunit replaces the first of the two subsequent β subunits in the classical αβ receptor or the γ subunit in the classical αβγ receptor, α4-β2-α4/δ-β2 did not result in active channel formation, but, as discussed above, this combination requires formation of a β/α subunit interface. δ-β2-α4/β2-α4 and β2-α4-δ/β2-α4 did functionally express, but each contains β2-α4, a construct that results in current formation by itself. The two receptors were characterized by an EC50 for GABA of 1.50 ± 0.14 μm (n = 3) and 1.58 ± 0.59 μm (n = 3), respectively. Both values are similar to the EC50 of β2-α4. As this receptor has previously been claimed to represent the subunit arrangement of α4β2δ receptors (25Shu H.J. Bracamontes J. Taylor A. Wu K. Eaton M.M. Akk G. Manion B. Evers A.S. Krishnan K. Covey D.F. Zorumski C.F. Steinbach J.H. Mennerick S. Characteristics of concatemeric GABAA receptors containing α4/δ subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 2228-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we decided to construct the pentameric concatenated receptor δ-β2-α4-β2-α4 (P5). To our surprise, we found functional expression of the pentameric construct with an EC50 for GABA of 0.75 ± 0.11 μm (n = 4). Successful expression of a pentameric concatenated construct suggested that R5 may be a possible receptor configuration. Additionally, we studied α4β2δ GABAA receptors with a 2:2:1 subunit stoichiometry of α4, β2, and δ subunits. In theory, six possible subunit arrangements exist with this stoichiometry. It should be noted that the subunit arrangements R1, R2, and R5 are identical to three of these six receptors. We did not observe functional expression"

These two compartments interact throughout mammary morphogenesis to form branching ducts during puberty and terminate in secretory alveoli during lactation. It is not known how the myoepithelial cell lineage is specified, nor how signals in myoepithelial cells contribute to lactogenesis. Here, we show that Numb and Numbl are enriched in mammary myoepithelial cells, with their expression peaking during pregnancy. We use conditional Numb-and Numbl-knockout mouse models to demonstrate that loss of Numb/ Numbl compromised the myoepithelial layer and expanded the luminal layer, led epithelial cells to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and resulted in lactation failure as a result of abnormal alveolar formation during pregnancy. Numb and Numbl function via repression of the Notch signaling pathway and of the p53–p21 axis during mammary gland development. These findings highlight the importance of Numb and Numbl in the control of myoepithelial cell fate determination, epithelial identity, and lactogenesis.—Zhang Y., Li, F., Song, Y., Sheng, X., Ren, F., Xiong, K., Chen, L., Zhang, H., Liu, D., Lengner, C.

https://openalex.org/W2462886043,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing in the Middle East. However, the genetic risk factors for T2D in the Middle Eastern populations are not known, as the majority of studies of genetic risk for T2D are in Europeans and Asians.All subjects were ≥3 generation Qataris. Cases with T2D (n = 1,124) and controls (n = 590) were randomly recruited and assigned to the 3 known Qatari genetic subpopulations [Bedouin (Q1), Persian/South Asian (Q2) and African (Q3)]. Subjects underwent genotyping for 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 29 genes known to be associated with T2D in Europeans and/or Asian populations, and an additional 27 tag SNPs related to these susceptibility loci. Pre-study power analysis suggested that with the known incidence of T2D in adult Qataris (22%), the study population size would be sufficient to detect significant differences if the SNPs were risk factors among Qataris, assuming that the odds ratio (OR) for T2D SNPs in Qatari's is greater than or equal to the SNP with highest known OR in other populations.Haplotype analysis demonstrated that Qatari haplotypes in the region of known T2D risk alleles in Q1 and Q2 genetic subpopulations were similar to European haplotypes. After Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing, only two SNPs (rs7903146 and rs4506565), both associated with transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), achieved statistical significance in the whole study population. When T2D subjects and control subjects were assigned to the known 3 Qatari subpopulations, and analyzed individually and with the Q1 and Q2 genetic subpopulations combined, one of these SNPs (rs4506565) was also significant in the admixed group. No other SNPs associated with T2D in all Qataris or individual genetic subpopulations.With the caveats of the power analysis, the European/Asian T2D SNPs do not contribute significantly to the high prevalence of T2D in the Qatari population, suggesting that the genetic risks for T2D are likely different in Qataris compared to Europeans and Asians."

Four independent variables including the amount of VCO, Tween 80: Pluronic F68 (T80:PF68), xanthan gum and water were the inputs whereas particle size was taken as the response for the trained network. Genetic algorithms (GA) were used to model the data which were divided into training sets, testing sets and validation sets. The model obtained indicated the high quality performance of the neural network and its capability to identify the critical composition factors for the VCO nanoemulsion. The main factor controlling the particle size was found out to be xanthan gum (28.56%) followed by T80:PF68 (26.9%), VCO (22.8%) and water (21.74%). The formulation containing copper peptide was then successfully prepared using optimum conditions and particle sizes of 120.7 nm were obtained. The final formulation exhibited a zeta potential lower than -25 mV and showed good physical stability towards centrifugation test, freeze-thaw cycle test and storage at temperature 25°C and 45°C."
https://openalex.org/W2474824026,"Epigenetic systems are well known for the roles they play in regulating the differential expression of the same genome in different cell types. However, epigenetic systems can also directly impact genomic integrity by protecting genetic sequences. Using an experimental evolutionary approach, we studied rates of mutation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains that lacked genes encoding several epigenetic regulators or mismatch repair components. We report that loss of a functional mismatch repair pathway in S. pombe resulted in the preferential enrichment of mutations in euchromatin, indicating that the mismatch repair machinery preferentially protected genetic fidelity in euchromatin. This preference is probably determined by differences in the accessibility of chromatin at distinct chromatin regions, which is supported by our observations that chromatin accessibility positively correlated with mutation rates in S. pombe or human cancer samples with deficiencies in mismatch repair. Importantly, such positive correlation was not observed in S. pombe strains or human cancer samples with functional mismatch repair machinery."

Boreal forests represent an excellent case study for such research because these forests have undergone significant changes over recent decades. We analyzed the temporal trends of four widely-used landscape pattern indices for boreal forests of Canada: forest cover, largest forest patch index, forest edge density, and core (interior) forest cover. The indices were computed over landscape extents ranging from 5,000 ha (n = 18,185) to 50,000 ha (n = 1,662) and across nine major ecozones of Canada. We used 26 years of Landsat satellite imagery to derive annualized trends of the landscape pattern indices. The largest declines in forest cover, largest forest patch index, and core forest cover were observed in the Boreal Shield, Boreal Plain, and Boreal Cordillera ecozones. Forest edge density increased at all landscape extents for all ecozones. Rapidly changing landscapes, defined as the 90th percentile of forest cover change, were among the most forested initially and were characterized by four times greater decrease in largest forest patch index, three times greater increase in forest edge density, and four times greater decrease in core forest cover compared with all 50,000 ha landscapes. Moreover, approximately 18% of all 50,000 ha landscapes did not change due to a lack of disturbance. The pattern database results provide important context for forest management agencies committed to implementing ecosystem-based management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2471675542,"Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), produce a wide variety of vocal emissions for communication and echolocation, of which the pulsed repertoire has been the most difficult to categorize. Packets of high repetition, broadband pulses are still largely reported under a general designation of burst-pulses, and traditional attempts to classify these emissions rely mainly in their aural characteristics and in graphical aspects of spectrograms. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of pulsed signals emitted by wild bottlenose dolphins, in the Sado estuary, Portugal (2011-2014), and test the reliability of a traditional classification approach. Acoustic parameters (minimum frequency, maximum frequency, peak frequency, duration, repetition rate and inter-click-interval) were extracted from 930 pulsed signals, previously categorized using a traditional approach. Discriminant function analysis revealed a high reliability of the traditional classification approach (93.5% of pulsed signals were consistently assigned to their aurally based categories). According to the discriminant function analysis (Wilk's Λ = 0.11, F3, 2.41 = 282.75, P < 0.001), repetition rate is the feature that best enables the discrimination of different pulsed signals (structure coefficient = 0.98). Classification using hierarchical cluster analysis led to a similar categorization pattern: two main signal types with distinct magnitudes of repetition rate were clustered into five groups. The pulsed signals, here described, present significant differences in their time-frequency features, especially repetition rate (P < 0.001), inter-click-interval (P < 0.001) and duration (P < 0.001). We document the occurrence of a distinct signal type-short burst-pulses, and highlight the existence of a diverse repertoire of pulsed vocalizations emitted in graded sequences. The use of quantitative analysis of pulsed signals is essential to improve classifications and to better assess the contexts of emission, geographic variation and the functional significance of pulsed signals."

These runs, although indispensable as structural elements for the functional dynamics of protein domains, are highly susceptible to genomic rearrangements and mutational expansions that are causative for several human pathologies, including triplet repeat expansion diseases (2Orr H.T.

Our earlier work shows that pathological expansion of the CAG repeats (>35 consecutive CAG codons) in huntingtin (Htt) exon 1, implicated in Huntington disease, involves stochastic −1 frameshifting within the CAG stretch that is triggered by limitation of the charged cognate glutaminyl-tRNAGlnCUG, although uncharged tRNAGlnCUG is plentiful (5Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z.

This is conceptually similar to the frameshifting characterized earlier at tandem rare codons in Escherichia coli that is caused by cognate tRNA depletion (11Gurvich O.L. Baranov P.V. Gesteland R.F.

In partial contrast, for the stochastic −1 frameshifting in decoding the expanded CAG run in the SCA3 gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, an mRNA structure formed by the CAG repeats has been proposed as a major stimulatory component of the −1 frameshifting. A depletion of glutaminyl-tRNAGlnCUG is likely to be involved, as alternating bicodon CAA CAG repeats read by different tRNAs but with not too distant propensity to form secondary structure do not exhibit −1 frameshifting (6Stochmanski S.J.

Post-mortem analyses of Huntington disease-affected brain tissues revealed traces of both polyalanine (polyA) or polyserine (polyS) proteins in the CAG-encoded polyQ aggregates of Htt (13Davies J.E. Rubinsztein D.C. Polyalanine and polyserine frameshift products in Huntington's disease.J. Med. Genet. 2006; 43: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although our early work has shown that polyA proteins derive from −1 frameshifting in the expanded CAG run of Htt exon 1 (5Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z. Depletion of cognate charged transfer RNA causes translational frameshifting within the expanded CAG stretch in huntingtin.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 148-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the origin of the polyS proteins remained undefined. +1 shift in the decoding frame of the polyCAG repeat would result in a polyACG stretch encoding serines. Here we set to define whether decoding of the Htt exon 1 also involves a +1 frameshift in the zero CAG frame, which would result in synthesis of +1 trans-frame encoded polyS segments. We report that, unlike the −1 frameshifting that occurs at any position, stochastically along the CAG repeat in Htt exon 1 with expanded pathological repeats (5Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z. Depletion of cognate charged transfer RNA causes translational frameshifting within the expanded CAG stretch in huntingtin.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 148-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), +1 frameshifting is initiated at a sequence (UCC UUC C) upstream of the first CAG codon and produces only one polyS-containing species. The +1 trans-frame polyS protein alters the aggregation of the zero-frame CAG protein and may contribute to the aggregation heterogeneity. To investigate the formation of +1 frame-encoded protein(s), we fused the coding sequence of YFP in the +1 reading frame 3′ of the Htt exon 1 with a CAG repeat in the pathological (Htt51Q(+1)YFP), non-pathological polyQ repeat length (Htt22Q or Htt7Q(+1)YFP) and with Ala repeat Htt51A(+1)YFP (Fig. 1A). HttQ(+1)YFP constructs were N-terminally tagged with an HA tag to monitor the total expression with the start in the zero-frame (Fig. 1B). Transient expression of Htt51Q(+1)YFP in murine neuroblastoma cells (N2a) revealed a single band that was YFP-positive on immunoblots (Fig. 1B), i.e. corresponds to +1 frame protein(s). +1 frame products were immunoprecipitated using their YFP moiety and immunostained with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1C). The HA-detected product migrates as a 46-kDa protein (Fig. 1C), the same size as the YFP-immunodetected protein (Fig. 1B), suggesting that this product has both a zero frame-encoded N terminus and a +1 frame-encoded C terminus, i.e. trans-frame encoded. Note that this approach detects products with a start in the zero frame; possible repeat-associated non-ATG-initiated products remain undetected by this approach. The immunoprecipitated +1 trans-frame products using their YFP moiety (Fig. 1C) were also subjected to mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1D). For detection reasons, we expressed Htt51Q(+1)YFP in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells (14Yamamoto A. Cremona M.L. Rothman J.E. Autophagy-mediated clearance of huntingtin aggregates triggered by the insulin-signaling pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), as they produce larger amounts of the +1 trans-frame-encoded protein than N2a cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Tryptic digested product was analyzed by MALDI-TOF in linear and reflector mode. Repeat proteins commonly deliver poor spectra, as they dwell poorly in the gas phase; some of them, polyQ proteins, are undetectable by this approach. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the products SFS49NSR and S49NSR (linear mode; Fig. 1D, inset and table) in which the CAG repeat encoding polyQ is completely converted to a +1-frame-recoded polyS product. The k.AFESLK.s peptide (Fig. 1E) originated from the N-terminal region of the intact Htt exon 1 in zero frame and was identified in reflector mode (Fig. 1A). We did not detect any product of +1-frame decoding in the region 5′ upstream of the CAG stretch. Also, the two amino acids (SF) in the SFS49NSR peptide specified by zero-frame decoding of the two codons adjacent to the polyQ stretch imply that the site of frame transition is immediately 5′ of the repeat CAG codons. The periodical peak pattern in the spectrum is typical for fragments with multiple amino acids containing hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1D, inset). To mimic a frameshifting event prior to the CAG repeat, an “in-frame” construct was made with a single nucleotide deletion 5′ adjacent to the CAG repeat to bring serine codons into the zero frame (Htt51S-YFP). The product of Htt51S-YFP co-migrated with the trans-frame product of Htt51Q(+1)YFP (Fig. 1C), and MALDI-TOF analysis yielded the same pattern of tryptic digested peaks, resulting from Htt51S-YFP being more pronounced (Fig. 1D). We next sought to determine the frequency of frameshifting. In most studies of reading frame transitions, the ratio of trans-frame-encoded product is compared with the product of standard zero-frame decoding (mainly by electrophoresis-based approaches) to calculate the frameshift frequency. However, the full-length zero-frame product of Htt51Q is highly insoluble and readily forms SDS-insoluble aggregates (5Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z.

We adopted an approach used previously to determine −1 frameshifting of other polyQ-containing aggregation-prone proteins, e.g. ataxin-3 (10Toulouse A. Au-Yeung F. Gaspar C. Roussel J. Dion P.

We calculated the fraction of YFP-positive cells (which reports on the presence of +1 trans-frame product) from all HA-Htt51Q-expressing cells (i.e. immunostained positively for the HA tag). Note that this approach does not report on the fraction of trans-frame product from the zero-frame protein. Approximately 10% of N2a cells expressing Htt51Q(+1)YFP and ≈20% of Htt103Q-CFP cells are detectably YFP-positive (Fig. 1F). Compared with our previous results, the frequency of the +1 frameshifting is much lower than that of −1 frameshifting measured with YFP fused in the −1 frame to the polyCAG reading frame, Htt51Q(−1)YFP (5Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z.

As deduced from the mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1, D and E), the site of frame transition is 5′ adjacent to the repeat CAG codons run, i.e. at the sequence UUC CAG CAGC50 (last zero frame, UUC, and first +1 codon, AGC). UUC C resembles to some extent the +1 slippery site UUU C in influenza A virus (16Firth A.E. Jagger B.W. Wise H.M. Nelson C.C. Parsawar K. Wills N.M. Napthine S. Taubenberger J.K. Digard P.

Firth A.E. et al.An overlapping protein-coding region in influenza A virus segment 3 modulates the host response.Science. 2012; 337: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, in the virus context, the UUU C mutation to UUC C (which would be similar to the sequence in Htt) mediates less ribosomal frameshifting than UUU C (16Firth A.E. Jagger B.W. Wise H.M. Nelson C.C. Parsawar K. Wills N.M. Napthine S. Taubenberger J.K. Digard P. Atkins J.F. Ribosomal frameshifting used in influenza A virus expression occurs within the sequence UCC_UUU_CGU and is in the +1 direction.Open Biol. 2012; 2: 120109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To explore whether a similar effect occurs in the Htt context, the wild-type UUC CAG of HttQ was changed to UUU CAG (underlining denotes a mutated nucleotide). This mutation increased the frequency of +1 frameshifting from 10% for wild-type Htt51Q with the UUC CAG sequence to 40% with UUU CAG (Fig. 2A). The frameshifting at the UUU C slippery sequence in influenza A virus is stimulated by a rare codon in the ribosomal A site, and its slow-to-decode nature is important for +1 frameshifting (16Firth A.E. Jagger B.W. Wise H.M. Nelson C.C. Parsawar K. Wills N.M. Napthine S. Taubenberger J.K. Digard P. Atkins J.F. Ribosomal frameshifting used in influenza A virus expression occurs within the sequence UCC_UUU_CGU and is in the +1 direction.Open Biol. 2012; 2: 120109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The counterpart A site codon in Htt51Q is the first CAG of the CAG repeat. Although CAG is a common codon, translation of expanded CAG runs depletes the cognate charged glutaminyl-tRNAGlnCUG, rendering CAG slow to decode (5Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z. Depletion of cognate charged transfer RNA causes translational frameshifting within the expanded CAG stretch in huntingtin.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 148-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Increasing the amount of simultaneously translated CAG codons by expressing Htt51Q(+1)YFP in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells increased the number of cells with +1 frameshifting by 2-fold compared with expression in N2a cells (Fig. 1E). (N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells stably express Htt103Q, in which glutamines are encoded by alternating CAG CAA codons (14Yamamoto A. Cremona M.L. Rothman J.E. Autophagy-mediated clearance of huntingtin aggregates triggered by the insulin-signaling pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), i.e. 51 CAG codons per mRNA copy.) To investigate whether increased consumption of glutaminyl-tRNAGlnCUG by decoding consecutive CAG codons correlates with +1 frameshifting, we down-regulated tRNAGlnCUG using a specific shRNA probe. Notably, partial knockdown of tRNAGlnCUG did not change the frameshifting frequency in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells expressing the Htt51Q(+1)YFP reporter and was comparable with the control with scrambled shRNA (Fig. 2B). This suggests that +1 frameshifting in Htt51Q is independent of tRNAGlnCUG. Further proof that an induced hungry codon downstream of the slippery site did not play a role in +1 frameshifting came from the following experiment. Variants with mutated UUC CAG (Gln) to UUC GAG (Glu) or UUC AAG (Lys) yielded a level of +1 frame product comparable with that of the wild-type UUC CAG sequence in both N2a or N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells (Fig. 2A). Also, we detected a similar approximate increase of +1 frameshifting with UUC AAG or UUC GAG in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP compared with N2a, which we observed with the wild-type UUC CAG sequence in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP compared with N2a (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we reasoned that the higher amount of trans-frame product in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells compared with N2a cells (Fig. 1F) might be due to differences in degrading it in both cells. To prove this, we expressed Htt51S-YFP with serine codons into the zero frame (Htt51S-YFP) in N2a cells and when co-expressed with a polyQ-protein in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells. Notably, Htt51S-YFP accumulated in detectably higher amounts in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP than in N2a (Fig. 2C, top panels, compare the 4- and 6-h expression time points). Homopolymeric polyQ peptides impair proteasome function (18Venkatraman P. Wetzel R. Tanaka M. Nukina N. Goldberg A.L. Eukaryotic proteasomes cannot digest polyglutamine sequences and release them during degradation of polyglutamine-containing proteins.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which most likely results in higher amount of Htt51S-YFP in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells (Fig. 2C, bottom panels), although the Htt51S-YFP mRNA amount is equal in both N2a and N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells (Fig. 2E). We further determined the expression level of Htt51S-YFP in both cell lines in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2C, right panels). The rationale behind this comparison is that if Htt103Q-CFP protein has already inhibited the proteasomal function, then the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 would not additionally stabilize the Htt51S-YFP in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells. Indeed, MG-132 stabilized Htt51S-YFP only in N2a cells and marginally in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells (Fig. 2C, compare ±MG-132 for each cell line). Together, these results suggest that the higher frameshifting frequency in N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells is a result of the higher stability of the +1 trans-frame product in these cells. mRNA structure 3′ of productively utilized +1 frameshift sites can stimulate frameshifting (19Ivanov I.P. Atkins J.F.

Autoregulatory frameshifting in decoding mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme.Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence shows that elongated CAG runs exhibit a high propensity to form elongated stem-loop structures (21Michlewski G. Krzyzosiak W.J. Molecular architecture of CAG repeats in human disease related transcripts.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether the structural propensity of the CAG repeat influences the +1 frameshifting in Htt exon 1. Thus, we generated two additional variants with shorter repeat lengths in the non-pathological range, Htt22Q(+1)YFP and Htt7Q(+1)YFP, for which secondary structures are predicted (Fig. 3, A–C), but their stability is much lower and they do not persist as experimentally shown earlier (21Michlewski G. Krzyzosiak W.J. Molecular architecture of CAG repeats in human disease related transcripts.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For both Htt22Q(+1)YFP and Htt7Q(+1)YFP, we did not detect any +1 trans-frame products when expressed in either N2a cells or N2a/Htt103Q-CFP cells (Fig. 2D), although they expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3E). Moreover, no YFP-positive cells were detected even when the more shift-prone site UUU C was introduced in Htt22Q(+1)YFP (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the stability of the 22-CAG run is not enough to stimulate +1 frameshifting. Together, these data imply that pathological expansion of the CAG repeat stabilizes the secondary structure (21Michlewski G. Krzyzosiak W.J. Molecular architecture of CAG repeats in human disease related transcripts.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) so that it acts as a +1 frameshifting stimulatory element. To further address the implication that the secondary structure is a major determinant of +1 frameshifting, we tested another construct without glutamine codons, Htt51A(+1)YFP, which displays very similar secondary structure stability as Htt51Q(+1)YFP. Its slippery sequence, UUC C, is intact (Fig. 3D). Our reasoning was to use a construct with identical nucleotide sequence to the polyCAG tract to ensure the same stability of the hairpin, but, unlike Htt51Q, it has a lower aggregation propensity (22Albrecht A.N. Kornak U. Böddrich A. Süring K. Robinson P.N. Stiege A.C. Lurz R. Stricker S. Wanker E.E. Mundlos S. A molecular pathogenesis for transcription factor associated poly-alanine tract expansions.Hum.

Intracellular localization of homopolymeric amino acid-containing proteins expressed in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21217-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, the expression Htt51A(+1)YFP displayed a similar frequency of cells with +1 trans-frame products (Fig. 2A). Cumulatively, our results suggest that the secondary structure is likely the major determinant of +1 frameshifting. To determine whether the frameshift-derived product with 51 serines, Htt51S, interacts with the parental Htt51Q protein and thus potentially modulates its aggregation, we first analyzed the intracellular localization of Htt51S inclusions by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The YFP-positive trans-frame product localized almost exclusively in the nucleus; only very rarely (less than 5%) did we find a cell with additional cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 4A). The Htt51S-YFP control also exclusively localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Nuclear +1 trans-frame protein was diffusively distributed with small fluorescently denser loci, whereas the rare cytoplasmic counterpart formed larger, ring-shaped structures surrounding the core aggregates composed of Htt103Q-CFP (Fig. 4A). The mobility of nuclear and cytoplasmic +1 trans-frame products differed markedly (Fig. 4C). The nuclear loci were composed of mobile species, as their fluorescence rapidly recovered after photobleaching, whereas the cytoplasmic structures contained species with reduced mobility, as they displayed much slower recovery (Fig. 4C). The nuclear +1 trans-frame products seem to not alter the nuclear membranes; the continuous lamin B1 rims are indicative of an intact nuclear envelope (Fig. 4, A and B). The co-localization of Htt51S with Htt103Q in the rare cytoplasmic aggregates raised the question of whether the polyS-containing product derived from +1 frameshifting can influence the aggregation of the poly-glutamine protein. To test this, we added Htt51S in different concentrations at the onset of Htt52Q aggregation and monitored aggregation by light scattering at 90° and a filter retardation assay; the latter captures only large detergent (SDS)-resistant aggregates. Htt51S accelerated Htt52Q aggregation only at high concentration (Fig. 5A). The lag phase of Htt51Q aggregation was markedly shortened, suggesting an impact on the initial aggregation phase, whereas the exponential stage of aggregates growth remained unaltered (Fig. 5A). Notably, the SDS-resistant Htt52Q aggregates contained Htt51S (Fig. 5B), indicating that the two proteins co-aggregated. When individually subjected to aggregation, Htt51S exhibited no clear sigmoidal aggregation signature as observed for Htt52Q (Fig. 5C) and, unlike Htt52Q, formed no SDS-resistant aggregates within the time frame of the experiments (Fig. 5D). Importantly, the lack of SDS-resistance of Htt51S aggregates alone correlated with the observed motility of the nuclear aggregates composed solely of Htt51AGC-YFP. Detergent-labile inclusions are highly mobile, whereas amyloid SDS-resistant aggregates display restricted mobility (24Hinz J. Lehnhardt L. Zakrzewski S. Zhang G. Ignatova Z.

Most humans also have circulating antibodies specific for this dietary xenoglycan. The potential for inflammation induced by incorporated Neu5Gc and circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, termed xenosialitis, has been discussed as a factor influencing several human diseases. Potential effects of xenosialitis on human fertility remain unknown. Here, we investigate possible adverse effects of the presence of Neu5Gc on sperm or endometrium combined with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in semen or uterine secretions in a mouse model. We use Cmah(-/-) mice, humanized for Neu5Gc deficiency. We find that the viability, migration, and capacitation of sperm with incorporated Neu5Gc are negatively affected when these are exposed to anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. In addition, we find that after copulation, activated uterine neutrophils and macrophages show increased phagocytosis of sperm in the presence of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies via the complement receptor 3 (C3R) and Fcγ I/II/III (Fc receptor). Furthermore, Neu5Gc in endometrial cells combined with the presence of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies alters the receptivity and decidualization of endometrial explants. These studies provide mechanistic insights on how Neu5Gc on sperm and/or endometrium combined with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in semen and uterine fluid might contribute to unexplained human infertility."

Our results using an inducible cell line that expresses an estrogen receptor fusion of the macrophage-specific transcription factor PU.1 (PUER) show that BAF/PBAF recruitment to these enhancers is a consequence of translocation of PUER to the nucleus in the presence of tamoxifen, and we speculate that remodeler recruitment may be directly mediated by PU.1. In the absence of BAF/PBAF recruitment, nucleosome occupancy at the enhancer of Il12b (and to a lesser extent at Il1a) reaches high levels in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and the enhancers are not fully cleared of nucleosomes upon LPS induction, resulting in impaired gene expression. Analysis of Il12b expression in single cells suggests that recruitment of the remodeler is necessary for high levels of transcription from the same promoter, and we propose that remodelers function by increasing nucleosome turnover to facilitate transcription factor over nucleosome binding in a process we have termed “remodeler-assisted competition.” We show how enhancers of macrophage-specific genes are rendered accessible in differentiating macrophages to allow their induction in mature cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.

These TFs are often pioneer TFs that have been suggested to control access to cis-regulatory elements, in particular gene enhancers, by other ubiquitously expressed TFs (1Zaret K.S. Carroll J.S. Pioneer transcription factors: establishing competence for gene expression.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2227-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The idea that access to regulatory elements is controlled in a cell type-specific manner is supported by the finding that sensitivity of enhancers to nucleases such as DNase I or micrococcal nuclease (MNase) is cell type-specific (for recent studies, see Refs. 2Mouse ENCODE Consortium Stamatoyannopoulos J.A.

Moreover, what constitutes accessible or “open” chromatin has remained unclear. Although regulatory regions of constitutively expressed genes are often completely nucleosome-free, we recently showed that the enhancers of inducible genes are occupied by intermediate levels of nucleosomes in resting macrophages, and these nucleosomes are evicted when the genes are induced (4Gjidoda A.

Nucleosomes are stably evicted from enhancers but not promoters upon induction of certain pro-inflammatory genes in mouse macrophages.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e93971Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, before induction, these enhancers are already bound by the macrophage-specific pioneer TF PU.1 and primed for activation as indicated by the presence of certain histone marks (i.e. H3K4me1) (5Ghisletti S.

Mammals have two related SWI/SNF complexes, BAF and PBAF, which share certain subunits but also contain unique subunits that are thought to play a role in recruitment of either complex to specific sites. Both BAF and PBAF use the catalytic subunit BRG1, but BAF can also use the alternate catalytic subunit BRM. BRG1 deletion results in early embryonic lethality, but BRM−/− mice develop normally, and it has been suggested that up-regulation of BRG1 may, in part, compensate for the loss of BRM (14Bultman S.

Rhabdoid tumor cells are unable to proliferate when BRG1 is inactivated, and it has been suggested that these cells may become dependent on an altered BAF/PBAF complex that still relies on the presence of BRG1 (22Wang X. Sansam C.G. Thom C.S. Metzger D. Evans J.A. Nguyen P.T. Roberts C.W. Oncogenesis caused by loss of the SNF5 tumor suppressor is dependent on activity of BRG1, the ATPase of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that BAF/PBAF is required for induction of pro-inflammatory genes in mouse macrophages, because simultaneous knockdown of both BRG1 and BRM impaired induction of a subset of pro-inflammatory genes in a macrophage cell line by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (23Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Braas D. Bhatt D.M. Cheng C.S. Hong C. Doty K.R. Black J.C. Hoffmann A. Carey M. Smale S.T. A unifying model for the selective regulation of inducible transcription by CpG islands and nucleosome remodeling.Cell. 2009; 138: 114-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These investigators suggested a role for BAF/PBAF in remodeling non-CpG island promoters but did not investigate whether the remodeler creates accessible chromatin at the enhancers of these genes to prime them for later gene induction. These investigators also determined whether primary and secondary response genes show differential dependence on the BAF/PBAF remodelers, and concluded that secondary genes and a subset of primary response genes require the remodeler, whereas other primary response genes are largely independent. Here, we show how regulatory regions of two representative macrophage-specific genes (i.e. Il1a, a primary response gen, and Il12b, a secondary response gene) are rendered accessible during differentiation through recruitment of BAF/PBAF, presumably as a consequence of PU.1 binding. This allows induction of these genes in mature macrophages in response to an appropriate signal. We find that both genes depend on BAF/PBAF for induction and nucleosome eviction at their enhancers, but the effects on Il1a are less pronounced. Our analysis of gene expression in single cells suggests that remodelers function by “remodeler-assisted competition” to facilitate TF binding over nucleosome formation at cell type-specific gene enhancers. To investigate how the enhancers of Il12b and Il1a are kept accessible and occupied only by intermediate levels of nucleosomes in BMDMs, we investigated whether the BAF/PBAF complex is involved in the process. We determined binding of BAF/PBAF to Il12b and Il1a by ChIP and detected the core subunits BAF155 and SNF5 at both enhancers in resting macrophages (Fig. 1, A and B, dark blue bars). Recruitment of the remodeler to the Il12b enhancer further increased upon LPS induction (yellow bars), but the levels of remodeler at Il1a were already high in resting BMDMs and did not increase significantly upon induction. We found little binding of BAF/PBAF to the enhancers in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; isolated by Lin− selection from bone marrow) or B-cells (cyan and green bars, respectively), demonstrating that recruitment of the remodeler to these genes is macrophage-specific. Together our results indicate that BAF/PBAF is recruited to the enhancers of Il12b and Il1a at some time during macrophage differentiation, and that gene induction leads to further remodeler recruitment to Il12b. Binding of SNF5 and BAF155 to the promoters of both genes was low, suggesting that the nucleosome remodeler functions predominantly at the enhancers of these genes. To determine how BAF/PBAF is recruited to macrophage-specific enhancers, we turned to the PUER-expressing cell line that we had previously used to determine the effects of PU.1 binding on nucleosome occupancy (8Tagore M. McAndrew M.J. Gjidoda A. Floer M. The lineage-specific transcription factor PU.1 prevents polycomb-mediated heterochromatin formation at macrophage-specific genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 2610-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This cell line was derived from hematopoietic progenitors of the fetal liver of a PU.1−/− mouse and expresses the pioneer TF PU.1 as an estrogen receptor fusion (PUER). Growth for prolonged times (i.e. 4 days) in the presence of tamoxifen leads to differentiation of these cells into macrophage-like cells (24Walsh J.C. DeKoter R.P. Lee H.J. Smith E.D. Lancki D.W. Gurish M.F. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Anastasi J. Singh H. Cooperative and antagonistic interplay between PU.1 and GATA-2 in the specification of myeloid cell fates.Immunity. 2002; 17: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Alternatively, they can be differentiated into mast cells or erythrocyte precursors, indicating that they are multipotent progenitors. We and others previously showed that when these cells were grown in the presence of tamoxifen, PUER bound to the enhancer of Il1a and other inducible genes, which led to reduced nucleosome binding at these sites (6Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N. Bertolino E. Lin Y.C. Laslo P. Cheng J.X. Murre C. Singh H. Glass C.K.

McAndrew M.J. Gjidoda A. Floer M. The lineage-specific transcription factor PU.1 prevents polycomb-mediated heterochromatin formation at macrophage-specific genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 2610-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We had also shown that PUER did not bind to the enhancer of Il12b and several other inducible macrophage-specific enhancers that are bound by PU.1 in BMDMs, consistent with published results (6Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N. Bertolino E. Lin Y.C. Laslo P. Cheng J.X. Murre C. Singh H. Glass C.K.

Instead this subset of inducible genes became associated with the polycomb repressive complex PRC2 (i.e. Suz12) and acquired repressive histone marks (i.e. H3K27me3) when the cells were differentiated into macrophage-like cells, indicating that facultative heterochromatin was formed at these sites in the absence of PU.1 binding. To determine whether PUER recruited BAF/PBAF to macrophage-specific enhancers that could bind the pioneer TF in this system, we performed a ChIP experiment probing for the BAF155 subunit and for PU.1 and found that recruitment of BAF/PBAF indeed correlated with PUER binding to the enhancers of Il1a, Peli1, Il6, and Ccl5. Statistically significant BAF155 recruitment and PUER binding was detected as early as 1 h after the addition of tamoxifen at Il1a and Peli1 (Fig. 1, C and D, orange bars) and further increased with prolonged growth in the presence of tamoxifen to reach significant levels at all four enhancers after 6 h (red bars). We had shown previously that at this time the cells still resemble progenitors and that the associated genes are not induced and signal-induced TFs are not bound (8Tagore M. McAndrew M.J. Gjidoda A. Floer M. The lineage-specific transcription factor PU.1 prevents polycomb-mediated heterochromatin formation at macrophage-specific genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 2610-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The rapid appearance of BAF155 binding after tamoxifen addition suggests that remodeler recruitment is a direct consequence of PUER translocation to the nucleus. We speculate that PU.1 may directly recruit BAF/PBAF to these enhancers, although further experiments will have to be performed to confirm this conclusion. We also demonstrated that in primary HSPCs from bone marrow, where BAF/PBAF was not recruited to the enhancers (Fig. 1, A, B, and D, cyan bars), PU.1 was absent as well (Fig. 1C, cyan bars), further supporting the idea that BAF/PBAF recruitment is a consequence of PU.1 binding in primary macrophages. Together our results suggest that up-regulation of PU.1 expression during macrophage differentiation (25Laiosa C.V. Stadtfeld M. Graf T. Determinants of lymphoid-myeloid lineage diversification.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 705-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) induces PU.1 binding and concomitant recruitment of BAF/PBAF to enhancers of macrophage-specific genes, which primes these genes for induction in mature macrophages. To determine whether recruitment of the BAF/PBAF complex rendered the enhancers of Il12b and Il1a accessible during macrophage differentiation, we used a lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown approach. For these experiments, bone marrow cells were transduced with lentivirus containing shRNAs targeting BRG1, encoded by the Smarca4 gene, or with control shRNA targeting firefly luciferase (shLuc). The effect of BRG1 KD was then analyzed in transduced cells that had been differentiated into macrophages in the presence of M-CSF for 9 days. We identified two shRNAs from a pool of shRNAs pre-validated by the Broad Consortium (shSmarca4-3 and shSmarca4-4) that yielded 50–60% knockdown of Smarca4 as determined by mRNA analysis (Fig. 2A) and resulted in reduction of chromatin-associated BRG1 protein by 50% (Fig. 2B). This level of knockdown reduced Il12b and Il1a expression 1.5 h after LPS addition by 50% (Fig. 2C). Previous studies in the macrophage cell line J774 had shown that Il12b expression was dependent on BRG1, but these investigators had classified Il1a as a BAF/PBAF-independent gene, although a small decrease in Il1a expression was reported (23Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Braas D. Bhatt D.M. Cheng C.S. Hong C. Doty K.R. Black J.C. Hoffmann A. Carey M. Smale S.T. A unifying model for the selective regulation of inducible transcription by CpG islands and nucleosome remodeling.Cell. 2009; 138: 114-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We believe that the more pronounced effect of our BRG1 KD on Il1a induction may be due to differences between the macrophage cell line J774 and primary BMDMs. The cells differentiated under these conditions still resembled macrophages and expressed the macrophage marker F4/80 (i.e. Emr1, orange bars in Fig. 2D). However, we found that other macrophage-specific, constitutively expressed genes were expressed at lower levels in BRG1 KD cells (i.e. Csf1r, blue bars in Fig. 2D). To analyze the effect of knocking down BRG1 on nucleosome occupancy at enhancers, we pooled cells transduced with lentivirus containing either of the two BRG1-specific shRNAs we had identified, and then performed the quantitative nucleosome occupancy assay. We found that nucleosome occupancy over the whole Il12b enhancer was higher in BRG1 KD when compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 2E). Nucleosome occupancy at preferred positions increased by 10–25%, resulting in peak occupancies of 75–90%. Positioning of nucleosomes was largely unaffected, suggesting that other factors determine nucleosome positioning in the Il12b enhancer. Knockdown of BRG1 in hematopoietic progenitors also led to increased nucleosome occupancy at the Il1a enhancer, although the effect was less pronounced than at Il12b (Fig. 2F). p values of Student's t tests showed that the differences found over the whole enhancer region between BRG1 KD and control cells were statistically significant. Control regions were not affected by BRG1 KD (Fig. 2G). Analysis of nucleosome occupancy 1.5 h after LPS addition showed less nucleosome eviction at both enhancers in BRG1 KD when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2, H and I). For example, occupancy at positions in the Il12b enhancer that are completely cleared of nucleosomes in response to LPS in untreated cells (<5%) remained associated with nucleosomes in 15–20% of the population when BRG1 was knocked down. Control experiments showed that transduction with shLuc had no effect on occupancy before or upon LPS induction (Fig. 3, A–D). Together our results indicate that recruited BAF/PBAF prevents high levels of nucleosome binding at the Il12b and Il1a enhancers in resting macrophages and stimulates nucleosome eviction from the enhancers upon LPS induction. However, nucleosomes were still partially evicted in the absence of BRG1, suggesting that a BRM containing BAF complex may partially compensate for the loss of BRG1. To determine whether inactivation of both BAF and PBAF has a stronger effect on nucleosome occupancy at the enhancers, we knocked down the shared core subunit SNF5 in hematopoietic progenitors using the same lentiviral approach. As shown in Fig. 4A, we identified three shRNAs (shSmarcb1-1, shSmarcb1-2, and shSmarcb1-3) that knocked down Smarcb1 (the gene encoding SNF5). shSmarcb1-1 yielded better knockdown (∼80%) than either of the other two shRNAs (shown as average), and we therefore selected shSmarcb1-1 for further analysis. Western blotting confirmed that KD by shSmarcb1-1 reduced the levels of chromatin-associated SNF5 protein by about 90% (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the catalytic subunit BRG1 was no longer detectable in the chromatin-bound fraction when SNF5 was knocked down (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, Il12b induction was reduced by about 75% 1.5 h after LPS addition and Il1a induction was reduced by about 50% (Fig. 4C). Similar to our findings in BRG1 KD cells, we found that SNF5 KD cells still resembled macrophages and expressed macrophage markers (Fig. 4D). However, we noted that many cells died during the time course of differentiation when we knocked down SNF5, suggesting that loss of SNF5 impairs differentiation and that a minimal amount of SNF5 may be necessary for cells to differentiate into macrophages. Cell survival was also impaired upon BRG1 KD, but to a lesser extent. When we analyzed recruitment of the BAF/PBAF complex to the Il12b and Il1a enhancers by ChIP, we found that recruitment of BAF155, both before and upon LPS induction, was strongly reduced in the SNF5 KD (Fig. 4E); as expected, SNF5 was no longer detected at the enhancers under these conditions (Fig. 4F). This result suggests that the SNF5 subunit is required for either recruitment of BAF/PBAF to the Il12b and Il1a enhancers or formation of a stable complex. Previous results indicated that a BAF/PBAF complex is still formed in the absence of SNF5 in rhabdoid tumor cell lines (26Doan D.N. Veal T.M. Yan Z. Wang W. Jones S.N. Imbalzano A.N. Loss of the INI1 tumor suppressor does not impair the expression of multiple BRG1-dependent genes or the assembly of SWI/SNF enzymes.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3462-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but our attempts to determine whether BAF/PBAF stability was affected when we knocked down SNF5 in BMDMs were unsuccessful, because low abundance of the complex in whole cell lysates of primary BMDMs made detection of the complex difficult. 4M. Floer and A. Gjidoda, unpublished data. We analyzed nucleosome occupancy in BMDMs that had been transduced with shSmarcb1-1-expressing lentivirus and found increased nucleosome occupancy at the Il12b and Il1a enhancers, both before and upon LPS induction (Fig. 5, A–D). The increase in nucleosome occupancy at Il12b was even more pronounced than in the BRG1 KD and resulted in occupancies at preferred nucleosomal positions at about 85–100% before LPS induction (Fig. 5A), whereas control regions were not affected (Fig. 5E). 1 h after LPS addition, nucleosomes remained associated with the Il12b enhancer in 40–50% of the population (Fig. 5B) and occupancy did not decrease further with prolonged LPS induction for 1.5 h (see Fig. 6C). This result is consistent with the more pronounced effect of SNF5 KD on Il12b expression when compared with KD of BRG1 (compare Fig. 2C with Fig. 4C). We also found increased nucleosome occupancy at the Il1a enhancer both before and upon LPS induction (Fig. 5, C and D). The increase in occupancy at the Il1a enhancer before induction was similar to what we had found in the BRG1 KD, whereas nucleosome eviction at Il1a upon LPS induction was more strongly affected by SNF5 KD. Nevertheless, we note that some level of nucleosome eviction was still seen at both enhancers in the SNF5 KD, and nucleosome occupancy at the Il1a enhancer before induction was only moderately affected. Whether this is due to the activity of residual SNF5 under the conditions of our KD, or whether other remodelers play a role in addition to BAF/PBAF at these as well as at other enhancers that may regulate these genes, remains to be determined.FIGURE 6Cytokine expression in SNF5 KD cells.

https://openalex.org/W2472994153,"A wide range of biological processes, including regulation of gene expression, protein synthesis, and replication and assembly of many viruses are mediated by RNA-protein interactions. However, experimental determination of the structures of protein-RNA complexes is expensive and technically challenging. Hence, a number of computational tools have been developed for predicting protein-RNA interfaces. Some of the state-of-the-art protein-RNA interface predictors rely on position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)-based encoding of the protein sequences. The computational efforts needed for generating PSSMs severely limits the practical utility of protein-RNA interface prediction servers. In this work, we experiment with two approaches, random sampling and sequence similarity reduction, for extracting a representative reference database of protein sequences from more than 50 million protein sequences in UniRef100. Our results suggest that random sampled databases produce better PSSM profiles (in terms of the number of hits used to generate the profile and the distance of the generated profile to the corresponding profile generated using the entire UniRef100 data as well as the accuracy of the machine learning classifier trained using these profiles). Based on our results, we developed FastRNABindR, an improved version of RNABindR for predicting protein-RNA interface residues using PSSM profiles generated using 1% of the UniRef100 sequences sampled uniformly at random. To the best of our knowledge, FastRNABindR is the only protein-RNA interface residue prediction online server that requires generation of PSSM profiles for query sequences and accepts hundreds of protein sequences per submission. Our approach for determining the optimal BLAST database for a protein-RNA interface residue classification task has the potential of substantially speeding up, and hence increasing the practical utility of, other amino acid sequence based predictors of protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2475063958,"Many histone acetyltransferases undergo autoacetylation, either through chemical or enzymatic means, to potentiate enzymatic cognate substrate lysine acetylation, although the mode and molecular role of such autoacetylation is poorly understood. The MYST family of histone acetyltransferases is autoacetylated at an active site lysine residue to facilitate cognate substrate lysine binding and acetylation. Here, we report on a detailed molecular investigation of Lys-274 autoacetylation of the human MYST protein Males Absent on the First (hMOF). A mutational scan of hMOF Lys-274 reveals that all amino acid substitutions of this residue are able to bind cofactor but are significantly destabilized, both in vitro and in cells, and are catalytically inactive for cognate histone H4 peptide lysine acetylation. The x-ray crystal structure of a hMOF K274P mutant suggests that the reduced stability and catalytic activity stems from a disordering of the residue 274-harboring a α2-β7 loop. We also provide structural evidence that a C316S/E350Q mutant, which is defective for cognate substrate lysine acetylation; and biochemical evidence that a K268M mutant, which is defective for Lys-274 chemical acetylation in the context of a K274-peptide, can still undergo quantitative K274 autoacetylation. Together, these studies point to the critical and specific role of hMOF Lys-274 autoacetylation in hMOF stability and cognate substrate acetylation and argues that binding of Ac-CoA to hMOF likely drives Lys-274 autoacetylation for subsequent cognate substrate acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2460301858,"At rest, healthy human brain activity is characterized by large electroencephalography (EEG) fluctuations in the 8-13 Hz range, commonly referred to as the alpha band. Although it is well known that EEG alpha activity varies across individuals, few studies have investigated how this may be related to underlying morphological variations in brain structure. Specifically, it is generally believed that the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and its efferent fibres (optic radiation, OR) play a key role in alpha activity, yet it is unclear whether their shape or size variations contribute to its inter-subject variability. Given the widespread use of EEG alpha in basic and clinical research, addressing this is important, though difficult given the problems associated with reliably segmenting the LGN and OR. For this, we employed a multi-modal approach and combined diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG in 20 healthy subjects to measure structure and function, respectively. For the former, we developed a new, semi-automated approach for segmenting the OR and LGN, from which we extracted several structural metrics such as volume, position and diffusivity. Although these measures corresponded well with known morphology based on previous post-mortem studies, we nonetheless found that their inter-subject variability was not significantly correlated to alpha power or peak frequency (p >0.05). Our results therefore suggest that alpha variability may be mediated by an alternative structural source and our proposed methodology may in general help in better understanding the influence of anatomy on function such as measured by EEG or fMRI."

The process of SUMO attachment consists of the following four steps: (i) processing of the ∼10-kDa precursor SUMO peptide by SUMO-specific proteases to reveal a C-terminal diglycine motif in the mature SUMO; (ii) ATP-dependent activation of the processed SUMO through the thioester bond formation between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and the catalytic cysteine of the E1-activating enzyme; (iii) transfer of the SUMO polypeptide from the E1 enzyme to a conserved cysteine in the E2-conjugating enzyme via a thioester linkage; and (iv) E3 ligase-mediated formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of the SUMO and the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue within the conserved sequence on the target protein (2Wilkinson K.A.

Among the known virulence factors of C. glabrata, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked adhesins, cell surface-associated proteases, robust oxidative stress response, and the ability to form biofilms and evade immune response occupy central position (30Rodrigues C.F.

Although SUMOylation is known to be involved in the regulation of fungal development, differentiation, and virulence (22Leach M.D. Stead D.A. Argo E. Brown A.J.

Microbiol. 2013; 90: 1125-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), nothing is known about its role in the pathogenesis of C. glabrata. Here, using the reverse genetics approach, we have identified components of the SUMOylation machinery in C. glabrata and show that the deSUMOylation peptidase CgUlp2 is required for biofilm formation, adhesion, and virulence of C. glabrata. We also report essentiality of C. glabrata Smt3 for cell growth and viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time a functional conservation of key SUMOylation components between S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. To determine components of the SUMOylation pathway in C. glabrata, we performed whole proteome sequence and BLAST analyses, and identified C. glabrata orthologues of the proteins that are involved in SUMOylation in S. cerevisiae (Table 1). Orthologues of all the components could be identified, and their percent similarity across the complete sequence is shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. SUMO and the E2 ligase Ubc9 protein are the most conserved between C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae with both showing over 85% identity (Table 1 and data not shown). Other SUMOylation components in both yeasts also showed significant sequence similarities as well as conserved architecture of various characterized domains (see Fig. 1 and data not shown). One striking difference was the absence of the SAP domain in the C. glabrata Siz1 ligase (see Fig. 1). The SAP domain, found in SIZ/PIAS family (Sap and Miz/protein inhibitors of activated STAT) of SUMO ligases, is implicated in DNA binding and nuclear retention (32Takahashi Y. Kikuchi Y.

Although Siz1 is nuclear through most of the cell cycle stages, it relocates to the bud neck during cytokinesis, as SUMOylation of septins and other substrates at this stage is essential for completion of cell division (11Takahashi Y.

Siz1 relocation is dependent on the C-terminal domain, whereas its nuclear retention is contingent on the SAP domain (32Takahashi Y. Kikuchi Y.

Therefore, loss of this well conserved domain in CgSiz1 ligase raises the possibility of additional C. glabrata-specific SUMO substrates outside the nucleus. Given the strong conservation of sequence and architecture of all components of the SUMOylation pathway in C. glabrata, we next examined whether some of the key components would functionally complement the S. cerevisiae mutants. For the two essential genes tested, SMT3 and ULP1, we performed plasmid shuffling experiments in S. cerevisiae knock-outs. First, we transformed the S. cerevisiae smt3Δ strain carrying the ScSMT3 gene on a URA3-based vector either with a LEU2-based plasmid expressing the CgSMT3 gene from the ADH1 promoter (CKM 379) or with the LEU2-based vector alone. The double transformants were streaked on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to select for uracil auxotrophs. We found that the S. cerevisiae smt3Δ strain expressing CgSMT3 survived, but the strain carrying the empty vector did not (Fig. 2A). This establishes that the Scsmt3Δ mutant could be complemented by CgSMT3, and therefore it could lose the ScSMT3-expressing plasmid. Through similar plasmid shuffle experiments, we next showed that CgULP1 could also complement the Sculp1Δ mutant (Fig. 2B). The ULP2 gene is not essential for cell viability in S. cerevisiae, but its deletion results in growth retardation (35Darst R.P. Garcia S.N. Koch M.R. Pillus L. Slx5 promotes transcriptional silencing and is required for robust growth in the absence of Sir2.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, slow growth of the S. cerevisiae ulp2Δ mutant was rescued by ectopic expression of the CgULP2 gene indicative of a functional conservation between S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata Ulp2 deSUMOylase. However, CgUlp2 could not complement the telomeric silencing defect of the Sculp2Δ mutant as CgULP2-expressing Sculp2Δ cells did not grow on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (see Fig. 2C). These cells carry URA3 at the subtelomeric region of chromosome VII and would exhibit growth on FOA medium only if URA3 expression was suppressed due to the telomere position effect. As expected, S. cerevisiae wild-type strain harboring the URA3 gene at the subtelomeric locus exhibited robust growth on plates containing 5-FOA (see Fig. 2C). These data suggest that CgULP2 cannot complement all functions of ScULP2. Of note, we could not perform complementation studies with C. glabrata UBA2, AOS1, UBC9, and MMS21 genes because the corresponding heterozygous S. cerevisiae mutants sporulated extremely poorly (data not shown). In S. cerevisiae, SUMOylated proteins are mostly nuclear with very few proteins SUMOylated in the cytosol or other subcellular compartments. This is because most of the SUMO ligases are found in the nucleus except Siz1, which localizes to the septin ring during cell division (13Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. The Ulp1 SUMO isopeptidase: distinct domains required for viability, nuclear envelope localization, and substrate specificity.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Zhao X. Blobel G.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4777-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To examine whether the location of SUMO enzymes was conserved between C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae, we introduced the dual His-FLAG tag sequence into C. glabrata SMT3, SIZ1, SIZ2, ULP1, and ULP2 gene sequences, and we transformed these plasmids into either wild-type strain (for essential genes) or the respective C. glabrata deletion strains. Immunofluorescence analysis with anti-FLAG antibody revealed that CgSmt3 was localized uniformly across the cell suggesting that SUMO and/or SUMOylated proteins are found both in the cytosol and the nucleus (Fig. 3). The two SUMO ligases, CgSiz1 and CgSiz2, and the desumoylating enzymes, CgUlp1 and CgUlp2, were all predominantly nuclear with only CgSiz1 and CgUlp1 showing few cytosolic spots (see Fig. 3). Interestingly, the characteristic nuclear pore complex localization of ScUlp1 was not observed in CgUlp1. Thus, despite uniform distribution of SUMOylated proteins across the cell, the enzymes involved in SUMOylation and deSUMOylation are predominantly nuclear in C. glabrata. These findings suggest that localization of most components of the SUMOylation pathway in C. glabrata is similar to that in S. cerevisiae. To examine the effect of perturbation of SUMOylation machinery on physiology and pathogenesis of C. glabrata, we sought to generate strains lacking one or more SUMO components. Of the set of nine genes shown in Table 1, we were able to create deletion strains for CgSIZ1, CgSIZ2, and CgULP2 genes via a homologous recombination-based strategy. We also generated a double deletion strain for CgSIZ1 and CgSIZ2 genes to investigate the role of SUMO ligases in C. glabrata pathobiology. Despite several attempts, we could not delete CgAOS1, CgUBA2, CgUBA9, CgMMS21, CgULP1, and CgSMT3 ORFs. Notably, S. cerevisiae orthologues of these six genes are essential for cell viability (5Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrová H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A. Varshavsky A.

Furthermore, using the one-step disruption and plasmid loss methodologies, we could show that CgSMT3 is required for growth in vitro in C. glabrata (data not shown). To investigate the role of SUMOylation in cell physiology, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of the C. glabrata mutants generated. Growth analysis of Cgsiz1Δ, Cgsiz2Δ, Cgsiz1Δsiz2Δ, and Cgulp2Δ mutants revealed that the Cgulp2Δ mutant grew about 18% slower than the wild-type (WT) strain in rich medium (Fig. 4A). The Cgulp2Δ mutant exhibited highly attenuated growth at 42 °C and in medium containing caffeine and non-fermentable carbon sources (glycerol, oleic acid, and ethanol) (Fig. 4, B and C). Compared with WT cells, the Cgulp2Δ mutant was more susceptible to the DNA-alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), replication fork staller hydroxyurea, thymine dimer-inducing ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and oxidative stress-inducing agent hydrogen peroxide (see Fig. 4B). Elevated sensitivity of the Cgulp2Δ mutant to aforementioned stresses was complemented by ectopic expression of the CgULP2 gene, indicating that these effects were specifically induced by the absence of CgULP2 (see Fig. 4B). Contrary to the Cgulp2Δ mutant, growth of the Cgsiz1Δ mutant remained unaffected under diverse stressful conditions, viz. DNA damage (MMS, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea), oxidative (hydrogen peroxide and menadione), thermal (37 and 42 °C), varied pH values (low (2.0) and neutral (7.0) pH), cell wall (caffeine), cell membrane SDS, non-fermentable carbon sources, and antifungal drug (fluconazole and caspofungin) stresses (see Fig. 4, B and C and data not shown). Interestingly, the Cgsiz2Δ and Cgsiz1Δsiz2Δ mutants displayed sensitivity to both UV and MMS, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of the CgSIZ2 gene (see Fig. 4B). Expression of CgSIZ1 partially restored slow growth of the Cgsiz1Δsiz2Δ mutant in MMS-supplemented medium and upon UV treatment (see Fig. 4B). Altogether, these data implicate CgSiz2 and CgUlp2 in survival of DNA damage and thermal, oxidative, and DNA damage stresses, respectively. During our phenotype profiling analysis, we noticed that about 5% of the Cgulp2Δ mutant population displayed elongated pseudohypha-like structures after 48 h of growth in the YPD medium (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2466141826,"Recently, musical sounds from pre-recorded orchestra sample libraries (OSL) have become indispensable in music production for the stage or popular charts. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether human listeners can identify sounds as stemming from real orchestras or OSLs. Thus, an internet-based experiment was conducted to investigate whether a classic orchestral work, produced with sounds from a state-of-the-art OSL, could be reliably discerned from a live orchestra recording of the piece. It could be shown that the entire sample of listeners (N = 602) on average identified the correct sound source at 72.5%. This rate slightly exceeded Alan Turing's well-known upper threshold of 70% for a convincing, simulated performance. However, while sound experts tended to correctly identify the sound source, participants with lower listening expertise, who resembled the majority of music consumers, only achieved 68.6%. As non-expert listeners in the experiment were virtually unable to tell the real-life and OSL sounds apart, it is assumed that OSLs will become more common in music production for economic reasons."
https://openalex.org/W2466672038,"Perchlorate is a common aquatic contaminant that has long been known to affect thyroid function in vertebrates, including humans. More recently perchlorate has been shown to affect primordial sexual differentiation in the aquatic model fishes zebrafish and threespine stickleback, but the mechanism has been unclear. Stickleback exposed to perchlorate from fertilization have increased androgen levels in the embryo and disrupted reproductive morphologies as adults, suggesting that perchlorate could disrupt the earliest stages of primordial sexual differentiation when primordial germ cells (PGCs) begin to form the gonad. Female stickleback have three to four times the number of PGCs as males during the first weeks of development. We hypothesized that perchlorate exposure affects primordial sexual differentiation by reducing the number of germ cells in the gonad during an important window of stickleback sex determination at 14-18 days post fertilization (dpf). We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the number of PGCs at 16 dpf in control and 100 mg/L perchlorate-treated male and female stickleback. Perchlorate exposure from the time of fertilization resulted in significantly reduced PGC number only in genotypic females, suggesting that the masculinizing effects of perchlorate observed in adult stickleback may result from early changes to the number of PGCs at a time critical for sex determination. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a connection between an endocrine disruptor and reduction in PGC number prior to the first meiosis during sex determination. These findings suggest that a mode of action of perchlorate on adult reproductive phenotypes in vertebrates, including humans, such as altered fecundity and sex reversal or intersex gonads, may stem from early changes to germ cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2462147473,"Determining the effects of unpredictable disturbances on dynamic ecological systems is challenged by the paucity of appropriate temporal and spatial coverage of data. On 27 February 2010, an 8.8 Mw mega-earthquake and tsunami struck central Chile and caused coastal land-level changes, massive damage to coastal infrastructure, and widespread mortality of coastal organisms. Wave-exposed sandy beaches showed significant changes of species abundances from before to after the earthquake, but the highly dynamic biotic and abiotic conditions of these habitats make difficult to draw clear-cut conclusions from these patterns. Here, we analysed a beyond-BACI (Before-After Control-Impact) sampling design to test whether the effects of the Maule earthquake on sandy-shore species diversity, abundance, and structure were heterogeneous along the shore. Invertebrate species abundances were quantified before (i.e. February 2010) and after (i.e. March 2010, September 2010, and March 2011) the earthquake at three sandy shores randomly located within the earthquake rupture area and three sites within a ""control"" area located >400 km southward from epicentre. Immediately after the earthquake took place, the three sites located in the rupture area showed anomalous beach-profile uplifts that did not comply with the erosion (i.e. ""negative"" uplifts) that regularly occurs during late summer in the region. Species richness, abundance, and community structure significantly varied from before to after the strike, but these patterns of change varied among sites within both areas. Only the site with the strongest and persistent beach-profile uplift within the rupture area showed significant concomitant changes in species richness and community structure; after 13 months, this community showed a similar multivariate structure to the before-disturbance state. This site, in particular, was located in the section of the rupture area that received most of the impact of the after-earthquake tsunami. Therefore, our results suggest that the effects of the Maule mega-earthquake on the ecological communities were spatially heterogeneous and highly localised. We suggest that high mobility and other species' adaptations to the dynamic environmental conditions of sandy beaches might explain the comparatively high resilience of these assemblages. With this work we hope to motivate further experimental research on the role of individual- and population-level properties in the response of sandy-beach communities to interacting sources of disturbances."

Therefore, the identification of potential biomarkers to assess the prognosis of early stage colorectal cancer patients is critical for further clinical treatment. Dysregulated tyrosine phosphorylation has been found in several diseases that play a significant regulator of signaling in cellular pathways. In this study, this strategy was used to characterize the tyrosine phosphoproteome of colorectal cell lines with different progression abilities (SW480 and SW620). We identified a total of 280 phosphotyrosine (pTyr) peptides comprising 287 pTyr sites from 261 proteins. Label-free quantitative analysis revealed the differential level of a total of 103 pTyr peptides between SW480 and SW620 cells. We showed that cyclin-dependent kinase I (CDK1) pTyr15 level in SW480 cells was 3.3-fold greater than in SW620 cells, and these data corresponded with the label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomic quantification analysis. High level CDK1 pTyr15 was associated with prolonged disease-free survival for stage II colorectal cancer patients (n = 79). Taken together, our results suggest that the CDK1 pTyr15 protein is a potential indicator of the progression of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2461540919,"Glycine receptors are chloride-permeable, ligand-gated ion channels and contribute to the inhibition of neuronal firing in the central nervous system or to facilitation of neurotransmitter release if expressed at presynaptic sites. Recent structure-function studies have provided detailed insights into the mechanisms of channel gating, desensitization, and ion permeation. However, most of the work has focused only on comparing a few isoforms, and among studies, different cellular expression systems were used. Here, we performed a series of experiments using recombinantly expressed homomeric and heteromeric glycine receptor channels, including their splice variants, in the same cellular expression system to investigate and compare their electrophysiological properties. Our data show that the current-voltage relationships of homomeric channels formed by the α2 or α3 subunits change upon receptor desensitization from a linear to an inwardly rectifying shape, in contrast to their heteromeric counterparts. The results demonstrate that inward rectification depends on a single amino acid (Ala254) at the inner pore mouth of the channels and is closely linked to chloride permeation. We also show that the current-voltage relationships of glycine-evoked currents in primary hippocampal neurons are inwardly rectifying upon desensitization. Thus, the alanine residue Ala254 determines voltage-dependent rectification upon receptor desensitization and reveals a physio-molecular signature of homomeric glycine receptor channels, which provides unprecedented opportunities for the identification of these channels at the single cell level.

https://openalex.org/W2470602894,"The role of tumor heterogeneity in regulating disease progression is poorly understood. We hypothesized that interactions between subpopulations of cancer cells can affect the progression of tumors selecting for a more aggressive phenotype. We developed an in vivo assay based on the immortalized nontumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A and its Ras-transformed derivatives AT1 (mildly tumorigenic) and CA1d (highly tumorigenic). CA1d cells outcompeted MCF10A, forming invasive tumors. AT1 grafts were approximately 1% the size of CA1d tumors when initiated using identical cell numbers. In contrast, CA1d/ AT1 mixed tumors were larger than tumors composed of AT1 alone (100-fold) or CA1d (3-fold), suggesting cooperation in tumor growth. One of the mechanisms whereby CA1d and AT1 were found to cooperate was by modulation of TGF-α and TGF-β signaling. Both of these molecules were sufficient to induce changes in AT1 proliferative potential in vitro. Reisolation of AT1 tumor-derived (AT1-TD) cells from these mixed tumors revealed that AT1-TD cells grew in vivo, forming tumors as large as tumorigenic CA1d cells. Cooperation between subpopulations of cancer epithelium is an understudied mechanism of tumor growth and invasion that may have implications on tumor resistance to current therapies.—Franco, O.

https://openalex.org/W2469162850,"Targeting modules or signalings may open a new path to understanding the complex pharmacological mechanisms of reversing disease processes. However, determining how to quantify the structural alteration of these signalings or modules in pharmacological networks poses a great challenge towards realizing rational drug use in clinical medicine. Here, we explore a novel approach for dynamic comparative and quantitative analysis of the topological structural variation of modules in molecular networks, proposing the concept of allosteric modules (AMs). Based on the ischemic brain of mice, we optimize module distribution in different compound-dependent modular networks by using the minimum entropy criterion and then calculate the variation in similarity values of AMs under various conditions using a novel method of SimiNEF. The diverse pharmacological dynamic stereo-scrolls of AMs with functional gradient alteration, which consist of five types of AMs, may robustly deconstruct modular networks under the same ischemic conditions. The concept of AMs can not only integrate the responsive mechanisms of different compounds based on topological cascading variation but also obtain valuable structural information about disease and pharmacological networks beyond pathway analysis. We thereby provide a new systemic quantitative strategy for rationally determining pharmacological mechanisms of altered modular networks based on topological variation."
https://openalex.org/W2464061716,"Developing robust in vitro models of HIV latency is needed to better understand how latency is established, maintained and reversed. In this study, we examined the effects of donor variability, HIV titre and co-receptor usage on establishing HIV latency in vitro using two models of HIV latency. Using the CCL19 model of HIV latency, we found that in up to 50% of donors, CCL19 enhanced latent infection of resting CD4+ T-cells by CXCR4-tropic HIV in the presence of low dose IL-2. Increasing the infectious titre of CXCR4-tropic HIV increased both productive and latent infection of resting CD4+ T-cells. In a different model where myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) were co-cultured with resting CD4+ T-cells, we observed a higher frequency of latently infected cells in vitro than CCL19-treated or unstimulated CD4+ T-cells in the presence of low dose IL-2. In the DC-T-cell model, latency was established with both CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic virus but higher titres of CCR5-tropic virus was required in most donors. The establishment of latency in vitro through direct infection of resting CD4+ T-cells is significantly enhanced by CCL19 and mDC, but the efficiency is dependent on virus titre, co-receptor usage and there is significant donor variability."
https://openalex.org/W2466728101,"To compare the safety and efficacy of fixed-dose tafluprost/timolol combination (Taf/T-FDC) with those of fixed-dose latanoprost/timolol combination (Lat/T-FDC) by measuring the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect, ocular pharmacokinetics, and ocular surface toxicity.The IOP-lowering effect of Taf/T-FDC and Lat/T-FDC in ocular normotensive monkeys was evaluated at 4 and 8 h after instillation in study A, at 12, 14, 16, and 18 h after instillation in study B, and at 24, 26, 28, and 30 h after instillation in study C. Drug penetration into the eye was evaluated by measuring the concentrations of timolol, tafluprost acid (active metabolic form of tafluprost), and latanoprost acid (active metabolic form of latanoprost) using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry after single instillation of Taf/T-FDC or Lat/T-FDC to Sprague Dawley rats. Cytotoxicity following 1-30 min exposure of SV40-transformed human corneal epithelial cells to Taf/T-FDC or Lat/T-FDC was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assays. Undiluted and 10-fold diluted solutions of each FDC were evaluated.The IOP-lowering effect of Taf/T-FDC was almost equivalent to that of Lat/T-FDC at 4-8 h after instillation. The peak IOP reduction of Taf/T-FDC and Lat/T-FDC was observed at 8 h after instillation, and there is no difference between the two. The difference between them was observed at 24-30 h after instillation, and Taf/T-FDC demonstrated a significantly greater IOP-lowering effect than Lat/T-FDC at 24-30 h after instillation. The IOP-lowering effect of Taf/T-FDC was sustained up to 30 h after instillation, while that of Lat/T-FDC had almost disappeared at 28 h after instillation. Timolol concentrations in aqueous humor after Taf/T-FDC instillation were higher than those after Lat/T-FDC instillation (Cmax, 3870 ng/mL vs 1330 ng/mL; AUCinf, 3970 ng·h/mL vs 1250 ng·h/mL). The concentrations of tafluprost acid and latanoprost acid in aqueous humor after instillation of Taf/T-FDC and Lat/T-FDC, respectively, were similar to those after instillation of mono-preparations of tafluprost and latanoprost, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of Taf/T-FDC to the human corneal epithelial cells was significantly lower than that of Lat/T-FDC at all evaluated time points in both undiluted and 10-fold diluted FDCs.Taf/T-FDC provides increased IOP-lowering effect duration and lower potential ocular surface toxicity than Lat/T-FDC."
https://openalex.org/W2460301736,"Evolutionary psychology suggests that men are more likely than women to deceive to bolster their status and influence. Also gender perception influences deceptive behavior, which is linked to pervasive gender stereotypes: women are typically viewed as weaker and more gullible than men. We assessed bluffing in an online experiment (N = 502), where participants made decisions to bluff or not in simulated poker tasks against opponents represented by avatars. Participants bluffed on average 6% more frequently at poker tables with female-only avatars than at tables with male-only or gender mixed avatars-a highly significant effect in games involving repeated decisions. Nonetheless, participants did not believe the avatar genders affected their decisions. Males bluffed 13% more frequently than females. Unlike most economic games employed exclusively in research contexts, online poker is played for money by tens of millions of people worldwide. Thus, gender effects in bluffing have significant monetary consequences for poker players."
https://openalex.org/W2465310184,"The logistic coupled map lattices (LCML) have been widely investigated as well as their pattern dynamics. The patterns formation may depend on not only fluctuations of system parameters, but variation of the initial conditions. However, the mathematical discussion is quite few for the effect of initial values so far. The present paper is concerned with the pattern formation for a two-dimensional Logistic coupled map lattice, where any initial value can be linear expressed by corresponding eigenvectors, and patterns formation can be determined by selecting the corresponding eigenvectors. A set of simulations are conducted whose results demonstrate the fact. The method utilized in the present paper could be applied to other discrete systems as well."
https://openalex.org/W2469461310,"Muscle contractile phenotype is affected during immobilization. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms are the major determinant of the muscle contractile phenotype. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of muscle immobilization on both the MHC composition at single-fibre level and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), a family of intracellular signaling pathways involved in the stress-induced muscle plasticity.The distal tendon of female Wistar rat Peroneus Longus (PL) was cut and fixed to the adjacent bone at neutral muscle length. Four weeks after the surgery, immobilized and contralateral PL were dissociated and the isolated fibres were sampled to determine MHC composition. Protein kinase 38 (p38), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and c-Jun- NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylations were measured in 6- and 15-day immobilized and contralateral PL.MHC distribution in immobilized PL was as follows: I = 0%, IIa = 11.8 ± 2.8%, IIx = 53.0 ± 6.1%, IIb = 35.3 ± 7.3% and I = 6.1 ± 3.9%, IIa = 22.1 ± 3.4%, IIx = 46.6 ± 4.5%, IIb = 25.2 ± 6.6% in contralateral muscle. The MHC composition in immobilized muscle is consistent with a faster contractile phenotype according to the Hill's model of the force-velocity relationship. Immobilized and contralateral muscles displayed a polymorphism index of 31.1% (95% CI 26.1-36.0) and 39.3% (95% CI 37.0-41.5), respectively. Significant increases in p38 and JNK phosphorylation were observed following 6 and 15 days of immobilization.Single muscle immobilization at neutral length induces a shift of MHC composition toward a faster contractile phenotype and decreases the polymorphic profile of single fibres. Activation of p38 and JNK could be a potential mechanism involved in these contractile phenotype modifications during muscle immobilization."
https://openalex.org/W2460330966,"Despite the importance of trauma in healthspan and lifespan in humans as well as in non-human species, with one important exception the literature in both gerontology and ecology contains virtually no experimental demographic studies concerned with trauma in any species. We used dietary manipulation [full diet (F) versus sugar-only (S)] to produce four levels of frailty in 55-day old tephritid fruit flies (Anastrepha ludens) that were then subject to the trauma of cage transfer stress (n = 900/sex in each of the 4 treatments). The key results included the following: (1) there is a trauma effect caused by the transfer that depends on previous diet before transfer, new diet after transfer and gender of the fly; (2) males are more vulnerable than females; (3) if initial diet was F, flies are relatively immune against the trauma, and the subsequent diet (F or S) does not matter; (4) however if initial diet was S, then the effect of the trauma depends largely on the diet after the transfer; (5) flies transferred from S to F diets do very well in terms of remaining longevity (i.e. greatest remaining longevity), while flies transferred from S to S diet do poorly (i.e. shortest remaining longevity). We discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of this study and implications of the results."
