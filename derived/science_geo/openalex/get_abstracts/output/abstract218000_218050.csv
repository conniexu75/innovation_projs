The methane produced is about 8 percent enriched in C(12), relative to the original methanol. Fractionation factors determined at 30 degrees C and 23 degrees C were 1.081 and 1.094, respectively, which indicates that this process is dependent on temperature."

S., contains an antibody which reacts only with the cells of people who have either of two predominantly Negro characters—V and R′s (Table 1). The place of these antigens in the Rh system was previously unknown and a relationship between them unsuspected."

Further, the changes of these compounds with time in red lateral and in dorsal muscle of rainbow trout were followed by using ion-exchange chromatography. It was found that the enzyme activities of the former affecting the breakdown of nucleotides are greater than of the latter."

The mechanism by which insulin exerts this effect is not known, and we have now studied this problem."

At higher stimulation values the eighth nerve responses also were abolished, and at intermediate stimulus values responses at the medial geniculate and inferior colliculus were suppressed."

Hybridization of chick hemoglobins produced an electrophoretically distinguishable new component."

It was determined that 5-bromouracil can be incorporated into the deoxyribonucleic acid of this organism, replacing thymine specifically."

https://openalex.org/W2071068897,The potentiating action of chloroform on bacterial beta-glucuronidase has been shown to increase as the interface area between the two liquid phases increases. Prior extraction of the enzyme with chloroform causes a loss rather than an increase in activity. It is tentatively suggested that the correlation between activity and interface area may reflect a phenomenon of enzyme action at a liquid/liquid interface.

https://openalex.org/W2066713442,"IT has been suggested that lack of betanin excretion in urine is a hereditary trait in man1. This could result from an inborn incapacity to metabolize the pigment. This communication reports a study of the frequencies of betanin excretors among different racial groups. Classification of the excretors necessitated taking into account the time-range necessary for excretion, the amount of beetroot eaten and the pH of the urine. The effect of these variables on the validity of the test was determined before establishing the following procedure. 100–150 gm. of cooked beetroot was given to each individual examined. Two test-tube samples were taken, one before and the other 5 hr. after the beetroot was eaten. The classification of the individuals as excretors and non-excretors was based on visual comparison of the colour of the two urine samples. When any reddish tint could be observed in the second sample relative to the first the subject was recorded as ‘excretor’, and if otherwise, ‘non-excretor’. It should be noted that a great deal of variation was observed in the intensity of the red tint in the urine of the excretors."

When we have acquired further information about the biology of the rabbit flea (Spilopsyllus cuniculi) and also other possible arthropod vectors, we may find that a somewhat different set of factors comes into operation in Britain between major epizootics."
